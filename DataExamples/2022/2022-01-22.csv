American-Statesman Correspondent

“The 3M Half Marathon has been good to me” Will Nation said after crossing the finish line downtown Sunday in first place.

Nation and fellow Austin runner Sarah Jackson notched solid victories on the point-to-point downhill course besting a field of some 6000 runners.

Nation a former Texas track and cross-country standout first won the Half Marathon back in 2015 just after graduating.

“That was my first road race and first half-marathon” Nation said of his 2015 win. “So it was my introduction into road racing. Today was the first time I’ve run 3M since then.”

Nation and Samuel Doud took it out fast from the start on Stonegate Boulevard at Gateway Shopping Center flying through the first mile in 4 minutes 50 seconds. The pair quickly broke away from the chase pack which included Longhorns runner Kobe Yepez and John Liddell of Wauwatosa Wis. and hit the 5-kilometer mark in 15:25.

When they passed the 10K mark on Great Northern Boulevard in 30:51 it was clear that it was a two-man race as Nation and Doud had nearly a minute on the rest of the field. Just before the 8-mile mark on Shoal Creek Boulevard Nation put the hammer down and by the ninth mile he had a 30-second lead on Doud.

“We ran together for around 7 or 8 miles” Nation said. “I was feeling good so I decided to test my legs and I pulled away.”

Nation averaged 4:56 a mile breaking the tape in 1:04:36 while Doud cruised home second in 1:05:40. John Rice a recent UT graduate and a two-time track and cross-country All-American took third in 1:06:34 ahead of Yepez who clocked 1:06:52. Liddell rounded out the top five in 1:07:54.

“I came here to run a fast time.” said Doud who ran for American University in Washington. “I’ll be running the Ascension Seton Austin Marathon on Feb. 20 and I’m hoping for an Olympic qualifying time.”

Nation who ran a personal best of 2:13:24 at the California International Marathon in December also has his sights set on the Austin Marathon. “It’s good to get a race effort like this in before the marathon because it’s really kind of a short window between now and then” he said. “I’d love to win the hometown marathon.”

Jackson was a last-minute entry in the women’s race but wasted no time establishing a big gap on the rest of the field. The 2020 Austin Marathon champion moved into the lead right from the start and passed the 5K mark in 17:54 more than a minute ahead of Jaclyn Range of Ohio. Taking advantage of the cool weather Jackson averaged 5:47 a mile in what amounted to a solo effort. By the 10K mark (35:42) she was nearly two minutes up on Range.

Jackson who like Nation was coming off a fast time at the California International Marathon (2:42:27) finished in 1:15:47 a personal best for the half-marathon distance. Range took second in 1:18:37 ahead of Diane Fisher of Ohio who posted a 1:19:13. Mary Reiser of Baltimore was fourth in 1:20:24 and Austin’s Katy Cranfill took fifth in 1:20:54.

“I went out a little fast and just tried to hang on. I was really in the zone today and felt really smooth” Jackson said. “I’ve run 3M every year since high school but this is my first win. You can just cruise on the downhills on this course and use them to your advantage. That’s why I love this race so much.”

The 3M race is known nationwide as one of the fastest half-marathon courses in the country attracting runners from all over the nation in search of speedy times.

“I ran my best half-marathon yet today” Range said. “My teammate Diane Fisher and I are both from Ohio. We’ve been running in the snow and cold so this was a chance to come here and run. Conditions couldn’t have been more perfect.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMif2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmhhcmxlbXdvcmxkbWFnYXppbmUuY29tL3N0aWxyaWRlLXJhaXNlcy0zbS10by1wcm9kdWNlLXN1c3RhaW5hYmxlLWUtbW90b3JjeWNsZXMtdXNpbmctaW5kdXN0cmlhbC1vcmlnYW1pLXJvYm8tdGVjaC_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Niccccceee! STILRIDE Raises $3m+ To Produce Sustainable E-Moto Using 'Industrial Origami' Robo Tech,"Swedish technology and design startup STILRIDE has raised £2.5m ($3m USA) to produce sustainable electric motorcycles and scooters using a groundbreaking process dubbed ‘industrial origami’. The trailblazing manufacturing technique involves robots that are able to fold single sheets of recyclable steel into intricate lightweight and durable new structures – significantly reducing the environmental impact of production.

This process is being used to create the chassis and body for a fleet of next-generation e-motorcycles which will be made available to consumers in Europe later this year.

This £2.5m ($3m USA) seed round was joined by angels and private investors that include Gustaf Hagman Saeid Esmaeilizadeh Sam Bonnier and Andreas Adler.

STILRIDE’s pioneering industrial origami technology called STILFOLD is the brainchild of best friends Tue Beijer and Jonas Nyvang whose backgrounds span the worlds of fashion industrial design and engineering.

With STILRIDE the duo aims to reimagine how high-performance electric-mobility products are manufactured and distributed using cutting-edge steelwork advanced robotics and ambitious design.

The injection of funding will be used to bring the startup’s first product to the mass market: the futuristic Sport Utility Scooter One (SUS1).

Unlike traditional scooters (which consist of a tubular frame and plastic body) the SUS1 is constructed by folding sheets of stainless steel over curves much like origami. Not only does this result in a durable body and distinctive aesthetic but it also requires fewer raw materials and reduces labor costs.

Compared to a traditional scooter the SUS1 requires 70% fewer components drives a 25% reduction in labour costs and a 20% reduction in material costs.

Compared to a traditional scooter the SUS1 requires 70% fewer components drives a 25% reduction in labour costs and a 20% reduction in material costs.

E-motorcycles are the first application of STILRIDE’s proprietary STILFOLD technology. Next STILRIDE will use this technique to add Cargo Bikes and trailers to its product offering.

To reduce the product’s carbon footprint the company is aiming to create a production process which allows the steel sheets to be flat-packed and shipped to local factories across Europe where they’ll be folded and fitted with a hub motor and battery pack.

Already the climate impact of developing the SUS1’s chassis is 50% lower than that of traditional scooters.

There are already 90000 people on the waiting list for the STILRIDE SUS1 e-scooter with the first pre-series set to be released to customers in the autumn of 2022.

Jonas Nyvang co-founder and Chief Executive Officer of STILRIDE comments:

“STILRIDE sits at the intersection of technology mobility and design. My co-founder Tue first introduced the idea for the scooter to me at a dinner in 2019. He sketched out how it could be manufactured using origami folding and built a model out of paper. It’s surreal to have now created a high-spec electric motorcycle that’s true to that original vision. It meets our commitment to sustainability whilst also having a radical and distinctive design identity. Not only is it unisex but it’s uni-age. It’s designed for everyone and we hope it can be an accessible entrypoint to the world of scooters and motorcycles for those with an eye for style and a love of nature.

“The STILFOLD technology is best described as a dance between robots and steel. We have created a process which builds high-performance sustainable personal mobility products that are also durable lightweight and desirable. The SUS1 is the first application of the technology and the ambition is to apply it to cargo bikes and trailer products.

“Using STILFOLD manufacturers can minimize resource consumption and waste cut down on labor costs and ultimately reduce the environmental impact of production. We’re launching in Europe first as it’s a market that relies heavily on outsourcing and has much to gain from increasing its domestic manufacturing capabilities. Next we will look to expand into other international markets.

“We’re incredibly proud to be working with such esteemed investors to push ahead with production of this first product and get it in the hands of customers. It’s an exciting time to be in the green mobility space and we’re ready to make our mark.”

Saeid Esmaeilizadeh entrepreneur and STILRIDE investor comments:

“There is a very strong team behind this whole solution which made the choice to invest easy. They have found a solution to build lighter electric vehicles which is a key challenge for the whole transportation industry. In addition the first product’s place in the market is a total no-brainer.”

Gustaf Hagman serial entrepreneur business angel and investor comments:

“Their Green Steel production technique STILFOLD is groundbreaking and there are endless application areas this is just the beginning”.

STILRIDE is a Swedish technology and design company that will soon launch its first product the electric motorcycle SUS1.

SUS1 is also the first product to take advantage of the company’s own and unique manufacturing process STILFOLD where an origami-style process is utilized to shape advanced constructions from sheets of steel.

The process not only creates extremely durable constructions but also enables environmentally friendly and local production. STILRIDE was founded in 2020 by Tue Beijer and Jonas Nyvang.

Owner John Burke has shrugged off disruption caused by two difficult years of pandemic restrictions shutting the doors of the popular wedding venue for January to get the work done quickly.

He is currently recruiting 100 additional staff to work at the Co Clare hotel.

The clock is ticking on the project with a wedding due to take place in the remodelled venue on the first weekend in February.

“We probably wouldn’t want the bride to come near the place just at the moment because we’ve stripped things right back to the concrete. But everything will be ready for her big day in February” said Burke who showed he is not afraid of taking on a challenge when he climbed Mount Everest.

The investment will see the delivery of a new 90-seater restaurant a cafe bar private dining area a new events space aimed at attracting corporate business and a dedicated space for wedding arrivals.

It also involves the installation of a substantial electrical station at the hotel to allow it install a large number of electric car chargers and a completely new fully electric kitchen.

“We’re expecting to grow our electrical requirement by 400pc as more and more guests look to charge cars” he said.

Burke is “hugely optimistic” about the future of the business despite challenges from Covid as well as rising costs and supply issues.

“Inevitably there will be challenges with restrictions into the summer but when I look at all of our markets I’m optimistic. There is pent up demand for weddings and we’ve strong business on the books for the next three years.

“I see the footfall in the area in January when typically Spanish Point would have been empty and it is incredible. People are now appreciating the water the beaches and the walks. I also see population growth in the area with people moving from urban areas to places like Miltown Malbay Ennistymon and all the way along the coast bringing places back to life.”

Burke is aiming to offer a range of roles from mixologists and baristas to brand managers and graphic designers. The ongoing recruitment drive to attract new staff to the western seaboard has been backed by the launch of a package of new career benefits including above industry-norm rates of pay flexible working hours private healthcare packages a well-being programme paid days off for community charity work and maternity leave bonuses to help cover new baby costs.

“We are trying to create year round employment for this area. Before the pandemic our core winter staff was about 70 or 80 rising to 140 for the summer. Now we will have peak summer employment of about 200 and full-time year round we will have 180 staff.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMie2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnJlYWxlc3RhdGUuY29tLmF1L25ld3Mvc3lkbmV5cy1leHBsb3Npb24taW4tNG0tYW5kLTNtLXN1YnVyYnMtcHJpY2VzLWhpdC1uZXctZXh0cmVtZXMtaW4tYWxyZWFkeS1wcmljZXktbWFya2V0L9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Sydney's explosion in $4m and $3m suburbs: prices hit new extremes in already pricey market - realestate.com.au,"Paying more than $3m for a house has become the norm in nearly one in eight Sydney suburbs and there are 29 suburbs where prices typically exceed $4m.

And even more areas will cross these high marks if prices simply grow at the same rate as inflation this year market analysis has revealed.

It comes as low interest rates housing shortages and the Covid pandemic combined last year to fuel Sydney’s biggest housing boom in three decades.

What a Labor win will mean for home seekers

There were already an incredible 39 suburbs where median house prices were over $3m at the start of 2021 but the number more than doubled to 82 suburbs by year-end.

That bounty of pricey areas included 29 suburbs where the median house price was over $4m according to the CoreLogic data provided exclusively to The Daily Telegraph.

For some context Melbourne has just one suburb with a $4m median. The rest of Australia has none.

Melbourne’s sole $4m suburb is the mansion mecca of Toorak where the wealthiest Victorians live but many of Sydney suburbs now in this category were not traditionally markets for the ultra-wealthy.

They included Fairlight near Manly Roseville Chase on the upper north shore and Queens Park in the east.

Other $4m suburbs were lower north shore enclaves Cremorne Greenwich and Castlecrag and eastern suburbs Waverley Coogee and South Coogee.

Prices in these areas jumped by more than 35 per cent over the year – in some cases an average rise of more than $1m.

Suburbs where the median house price surpassed $3m for the first time last year were Cronulla Maroubra Chatswood Manly Vale Bondi Junction Lane Cove Drummoyne and Haberfield.

CoreLogic head of research Eliza Owen said these suburbs attracted some of the most extreme price rises in the country last year because they were often perceived as “retreats within the city”.

“We’ve had this environment where people have been locked down for two years and they’ve looked for escapes. A lot of these markets have easy access to the coast” Ms Owen said.

The staggering prices now being recorded in parts of Sydney reflected homebuyer’s appetite for debt not changes in income or wages Ms Owen said.

“It can seem mind-boggling how people can (pay) these premiums but the answer is that most are changeover buyers” she said.

“They bought really well 10 years ago when prices were lower they saw gains on their home as interest rates dropped and then had a huge amount of equity to direct toward buying (a new home).

“The extraordinary prices are a reflection of how finance is structured and how you can use equity to purchase homes … the growth we had is really a story about what happens when interest rates are low.”

Ray White Touma Group agent Roger Wardy said long-time residents in high-growth city pockets were often surprised to find out how much their houses were worth.

This was especially the case in a market like eastern suburb Kensington where multimillion dollar prices were not a feature until recently.

“We see a lot of people freak out when they see the results we’re getting” Ms Wardy said.

“The owners don’t dictate the prices it’s what buyers are prepared to pay to secure the properties ahead of the competition from other buyers.”

Long-time Kensington residents Michelle and Darren Giordimania recently moved into a new home in the area and said house prices were unrecognisable compared to a few years ago.

“We were a bit concerned about price rises” Ms Giordimania said. “A lot of people want to live here. You’ve got the tram university. Everything is super easy.”

The couple were tempted to move to a new area to get better bang for their buck but chanced upon a deal they liked Ms Giordimania said. “Something just came up” she said.

Ray White chief economist Nerida Consibee said it was unlikely last year’s incredible price gains would be repeated in 2022 and there were signs the market was slowing down.

Pent up demand could drive a modest rise in the early months of the year but tighter lending controls and greater housing supply meant growth would slow further into the year Ms Conisbee said.

But considering how high prices have become even a slight rise this year would be enough to push another glut of suburbs into the multimillion dollar club.

A 3 per cent rise in prices this year roughly in line with inflation would mean $3m would become the norm for houses in Concord Gladesville Lane Cove West North Balgowlah and Bilgola Plateau among others.

Paying more than $3m for the average house in a suburb remains rare outside Sydney.

Including Toorak Melbourne has five suburbs with a median above $3m Perth has one and the rest of the country doesn’t have any.

Speaking about that day just before Christmas Gwen's family said: 'It was a very special occasion to get all five generations together particularly during the pandemic.

'Strict protocols are still in place but the home's manager Chris permitted the visit for which we are all extremely grateful.'

The care home resident who will turn 101 next month already has five grandsons eight great-grandsons and six step great-grandsons and was extremely proud to meet the newest addition to the family.

Unfortunately Gwen's cataracts mean she can no longer see very well but according to her family she was still tremendously happy to meet the little one.

Gwen was born in Essex on 28 February 1921 and after she moved to Gravesend as a youngster she became a keen dancer and performed at many local events while working at her father's seed merchant shops in Kent.

ABT,Abbott,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lmt3dHguY29tLzIwMjIvMDEvMjIvdGV4YXMtZ292ZXJub3ItZ3JlZy1hYmJvdHQtcHJvcG9zZXMtcGFyZW50YWwtYmlsbC1yaWdodC_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Texas Governor Greg Abbott proposes 'parental bill of right',"LEWISVILLE Texas (CBSDFW.COM) – At the public charter school Founders Classical Academy of Lewisville Thursday night Governor Greg Abbott warned hundreds of parents they’re losing their voice when it comes to their child’s education and healthcare. “The essential role of parents is being threatened by government itself.”

During the past year we’ve seen parents in North Texas criticize their local school boards amid controversies over mask mandates the material in some library books and whether critical race theory is being taught in classrooms.

To help parents become more involved in their child’s education the Governor signed a pledge outlining four main provisions of his proposed parental bill of rights. “Parents will be restored to their rightful place as the pre-eminent decision-makers for their children.”

The Governor said the Texas Constitution needs to be changed to make sure that happens.

Other parts of his pledge include giving parents more easy access to students’ course curriculum notifying parents about their rights online and protecting students from the sharing or selling of their personal data outside the Texas public school system.

The Governor also told the crowd he wants to toughen penalties against educators including teachers and librarians who give students inappropriate books. “Texas will ensure that any education personnel who is convicted of providing minors with obscene content will lose their educational credentials and state licensing forfeits their retirement benefits and be placed on a do not hire list.”

Under the state’s existing penal code chapter 43 covering public indecency it is either a class A misdemeanor or third-degree felony to sell distribute or display harmful material to someone younger than 18 years of age.

The code describes harmful material as appealing “to the prurient interest of a minor in sex nudity or excretion; is “patently offensive to prevailing standards in the adult community as a whole with respect to what is suitable for minors; and is utterly without redeeming social value for minors.”

Bill Bennett former U.S. Education Secretary for President Ronald Reagan appeared virtually at the event and told the crowd “Take charge of your child’s education. It is the single most important thing you can do for your child.

Texas American Federation of Teachers President Zeph Capo criticized the Governor’s proposals pointing out the state legislature passed a Parents Bill of Rights in 1995 and that additions to them have already given parents access to curriculum.

Capo said “We’re all for full parental involvement in their kids’ education…what we won’t agree to is a phony politicized storyline from the governor that ends up targeting and vilifying teachers and schools…Our governor is playing politics. It’s disgusting.”

The Texas Public Policy Foundation a non-partisan institute that promoting liberty personal responsibility and free enterprise supports the Governor’s parental bill of rights.

The foundation’s K-12 Education Policy Director Michael Barba said “All families deserve curriculum transparency a quality education respect for their input and ultimately the right to choose the best education for their child.”

This week the Governor and other Republican leaders in Texas spoke before the foundation’s Policy Orientation.

Another Republican candidate for Governor former Texas GOP Chair Allen West also rejected the Governor’s plan saying “Parents already have been endowed with natural and unalienable rights from the Creator God not Governor Abbott.. We live in a constitutional Republic not a monarchy.”

The campaign for another Republican primary challenger former State Senator Don Huffines of Dallas didn’t respond to an email seeking comment.

The presumed Democratic nominee for Governor Beto O’Rourke said he supports parental involvement in their children’s education.

But he said voters have told him they oppose focusing on culture-war issues. “They want us to come together to make sure our kids can read at grade level that we’re focused on math and stem education and that we’re graduating 18 year olds in the state of Texas who are college-ready and competitive for the careers that we’re creating in Texas today.”

State lawmakers will have to amend existing law or pass new legislation to toughen penalties against educators.

A change in the state constitution requires not only approval from lawmakers but voters as well.

The next legislative session is set to begin next January.

Listen to Williams’ Jan. 2021 episode of S&A’s ‘Opening Act’ podcast above.

The veteran actor has joined a new ensemble cast to tell the funny yet not so funny woes of a group of elementary teachers as they grapple with the ups and downs of working within the public school system. From the lack of funding to the bare minimum when it comes to classroom supplies the new ABC comedy will make you laugh but it also challenges the issues plaguing underserved and underfunded school systems that were built to educate urban city youth.

Williams said yes to the role of Gregory Eddie a substitute teacher who finds himself in a classroom position that is supposed to be temporary until he can land his dream job as principal with the goal of changing views on male teachers.

Williams first became a household name when he stepped into the shoes of Chris on the beloved sitcom Everybody Hates Chris which aired in the early 2000s on the now-dissolved home to some of our favorite Black shows UPN.

“I think what will always be purposeful for me after having success really young is that I stopped chasing the fame and all of that” Williams recalled. “I got really purposeful asking myself why am I here and the consistent thread is giving voices to those who don’t have a megaphone.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMic2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnN0YXRlc21hbi5jb20vc3RvcnkvbmV3cy8yMDIyLzAxLzIyL21hcmNoLWZvci1saWZlLTIwMjItdGV4YXMtYWJvcnRpb24tbGF3LXJhbGx5LXJvZS12LXdhZGUvNjU5NzU5MzAwMS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Texas Rally for Life: Abortion opponents gather at Capitol,"Gov. Greg Abbott activists religious leaders and thousands of abortion opponents gathered Saturday outside the Capitol to celebrate the impact of the Texas abortion law and to push for even greater restrictions.

The Texas Rally for Life on Saturday comes nearly five months after Texas ignited a national conversation over access to abortion. State lawmakers adopted Senate Bill 8 the most restrictive abortion ban in the nation during last year’s regular legislative session and Abbott swiftly signed it into law.

The law which went into effect Sept. 1 prohibits abortion after six weeks of pregnancy — which is often before most people are aware they are pregnant. Abortion providers have said they are complying with the law which has had the effect of severely curtailing abortion in the state.

""There's no freedom more precious than life itself. I promised to protect the life of a child with a heartbeat and we did"" Abbott told the crowd Saturday. ""I am proud to join you in this fight to protect the sanctity of life in Texas.""

Demonstrators kicked off the rally at the intersection of East 13th and Brazos Streets and marched to the Capitol chanting ""We are pro-life!""

Speakers included the Rev. Joe Vasquez Roman Catholic bishop of Austin; state Rep. Giovanni Capriglione R-Southlake and Joe Pojman executive director of the Texas Alliance for Life.

Janette Taylor who drove from Belton with her daughter Chelsea Taylor 22 to attend the rally said she wants to see more resources available for women who might feel abortion is their only choice.

""Abortion is hurtful and I really wish that women had other choices in a tough situation"" Janette Taylor said. ""Women can feel hopeless and like abortion is their only choice and that saddens me. We can do more to help women be able to choose life.""

Abbott said Saturday he is prioritizing help for pregnant people in need.

""I am proud that Texas is stepping up and providing $100 million for alternatives to abortion programs to support expecting mothers in need"" he said.

The Texas abortion law uses a unique enforcement mechanism that has resulted in legal battles playing out in local state and federal courtrooms.

The law prohibits state officials from enforcing the six-week ban and instead lets any private individual sue abortion providers or people who aid and abet an abortion past six weeks gestation. Successful litigants can collect at least $10000.

This provision has complicated efforts to challenge the law in court because attorneys for the state argue that Texas and state officials cannot be sued as a means of blocking the law because they are not responsible for enforcing it.

But abortion providers and abortion rights organizations say the law was written to evade judicial review which largely has been the case across multiple legal challenges brought by providers.

Annette Montgomery of Waco brought her children Evelyn 11 and Catherine 9 to Saturday's rally.

""I really want my kids to know that they are a gift to us to those around them they are a gift to our community"" Montgomery said. ""I want them to know that they have a part to play in speaking for people who can't speak for themselves.""

The rally fell on the anniversary of the 1973 Roe v. Wade Supreme Court decision which ruled that the U.S. Constitution protects a pregnant person's right to choose to have an abortion.

The Supreme Court has three times declined to intervene at the request of abortion providers and block enforcement of the new Texas law while legal cases over its constitutionality play out.

More:Sarah Weddington attorney who secured abortion rights in Roe v. Wade dies at 76 in Austin

But depending on how the court handles a challenge to a Mississippi law banning abortion after 15 weeks of pregnancy the past decisions establishing a right to abortion could be overturned.

Texas is one of several conservative states that has adopted a so-called trigger ban which would criminalize abortion to the extent permitted by the Supreme Court. The law would take effect 30 days after a relevant ruling from the court and would not require the involvement of the Legislature or any official to be implemented.

Similar to SB 8 the law would not include exceptions in cases of rape or incest and would only permit abortion under rare circumstances including when a woman’s life is in danger. That law would not rely on private lawsuits for enforcement. Instead abortion providers who perform illegal abortions could be charged with a second-degree felony and face fines of at least $100000.

That means drug companies will need to focus less on the selling and more on the science. And they’ll need real-world data to prove their drugs work as well in the “messy setting of everyday life” as they do in the clinic a new Accenture survey of 120 oncologists in the U.S. and Germany suggests.

“The clinical trials that are the basis for your promotional materials—those are just your ticket to play” said André Dahinden a managing director of global precision oncology in Accenture’s Life Sciences division. Oncologists are asking “What do these medicines really do in reality?”

RELATED: Don't spam us healthcare professionals plea as they seek quality over quantity from pharma marketers

The report found 65% of oncologists want pharma reps to be able to discuss real-world data with them; more than half (51%) said they “will need more discussion” on real-world data from reps in the future.

The report also suggests machine-assisted decision-making where technology is employed to match patients with suitable treatments will increasingly trump sales reps when it comes to doctors' cancer drug decisions.

When asked what will shape treatment decisions 10 years from now 66% of oncologists picked “technology-driven recommendations based on data” more than scientific societies (57%) discussions with peers and key opinion leaders (26%) and interactions with sales reps (23%).

“I think that’s very remarkable and has very big implications for pharmaceutical companies” said Dahinden.

When it comes to how oncologists want to get their information 90% chose either face-to-face or virtual meetings with pharma—with the preferred format depending on the reason for the meeting. And unless they're discussing a specific patient they overwhelmingly prefer to meet in groups.

Smartphone- or tablet-based apps also ranked highly with 88% of oncologists preferring those channels while the least-preferred channels were websites (56%) print (35%) and out-of-office meetings like medical congresses (27%).

Based on the survey the report suggests pharma companies should think about adding science-savvy employees to their customer-facing teams as well as creating a network of experts and peers with varying levels of expertise that doctors can tap for information.

With the number of cancer drugs and drug combinations growing exponentially it’s less likely a single sales rep can answer all of a doctor’s questions said Dahinden. The need for more scientific guidance is especially true for community practice oncologists who are working outside the realm of specialized cancer centers he added.

Dahinden calls it “ecosystem solutioning"" versus a marketed-oriented approach where the best-promoted brand wins.

“You’re enabling [doctors] to apply precision oncology rather than just pushing medicines promotionally.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiPWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1ha2V1c2VvZi5jb20vdG9wLXJlY2VudC1jbG91ZC1zZWN1cml0eS1icmVhY2hlcy_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Top 5 Cloud Security Data Breaches in Recent Years,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with ('Connection aborted.', RemoteDisconnected('Remote end closed connection without response')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiPWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1ha2V1c2VvZi5jb20vdG9wLXJlY2VudC1jbG91ZC1zZWN1cml0eS1icmVhY2hlcy_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lml0YnVzaW5lc3NlZGdlLmNvbS9pdC1tYW5hZ2VtZW50L2RpZ2l0YWwtdHJhbnNmb3JtYXRpb24tY29tcGFuaWVzL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Top Digital Transformation Companies & Services 2022 | ITBE,"If digital transformation is the key to innovation then digital transformation companies and services are the teeth and notches on the key that make it possible to unlock new opportunities.

Well so far not so good. As photographers we thrive off of getting inspired by what we see posted by other creatives. With Instagram changing its business model and becoming more and more promotion-heavy now’s a great chance to look into some other options.

One of those options is the Discover tab in Adobe Lightroom. Here you can see what photographers have posted based on what you have personally explored or liked. You can also browse by featured photographers those you follow or new work.

The Discover tab is available not only in the Lightroom desktop app but also on the web and Lightroom mobile app.

Find inspiration and learn Lightroom through others

Lightroom Discover features several ways to find photos but it also lets you filter down by genre. If I need inspiration for an upcoming event I can find that. Portrait shoot? Yep it’s got that too.

But more than that you can go into a photo and see all the edits the photographer made to get to their final look. If you’re new to photo editing or are playing around with different styles Lightroom Discover lets you easily see what each tool does and how it impacts a photo. And if you like a photographer’s edit you can save that as a preset that you can then apply to your own photos.

Put your skills to the test

Last year Adobe introduced Remix a tool that lets you take other people’s work and edit them as your own. Photographers enable people to “remix” their images so this isn’t across the board. In this case I was able to take this photo highlighting some different whisky and turn it into a dynamic contrasty black and white.

Lightroom Discover puts the emphasis on photo inspiration and education

In a lot of ways Lightroom Discover does all that I want it to do in that it showcases some of the best photographs by Lightroom users. But with the ability to see photo edits and “remix” photos I can learn how different tools I might not normally use work and then apply those skills to my own images. If you’re looking for a way to kick off your year Lightroom Discover really offers a lot for any type of photographer.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNubi5jb20vMjAyMi8wMS8yMy9oZWFsdGgvY2hpbGktd2ludGVyLW1vb2QtYm9vc3QtcmVjaXBlcy13ZWxsbmVzcy9pbmRleC5odG1s0gFSaHR0cHM6Ly9hbXAuY25uLmNvbS9jbm4vMjAyMi8wMS8yMy9oZWFsdGgvY2hpbGktd2ludGVyLW1vb2QtYm9vc3QtcmVjaXBlcy13ZWxsbmVzcw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Make this mood-boosting meal right now,"Editor’s Note: This month recipe developer and writer Casey Barber thinks it’s time to make chili. Stay tuned for her February recipe selection and for all the months that follow.

CNN —

If the post-holiday slump is hitting a little harder for you in 2022 you’re not the only one. It’s cold and icy across the country and many of us feel like staying indoors until spring. It’s times like these when we all need comfort and a hearty bowl of chili will cure what ails you: It might even be an antidepressant according to a recent study.

Though various regions of the Southwest and Central America lay claim to being the birthplace of chili – San Antonio New Mexico northern Mexico – the food is as diverse as the population of North America according to Robb Walsh author of “The Chili Cookbook.”

The Aztecs and other Mesoamerican cultures made chile pepper-spiced stews with turkey lobster and frogs he noted while chile peppers have been grown in New Mexico since the 1600s.

Texas has a number of competing chili origin stories including Mexican-American War soldiers who adapted the field dish known as chili con carne and the San Antonio Chili Queens who sold chili from outdoor stalls in the late 1800s long before food trucks hit the scene. William Gebhardt a German immigrant in New Braunfels brought chili spices to a wider public when he patented the first canned chili powder blend in 1899.

It’s that adaptability that makes chili so well suited for any palate whether you’re an omnivore or vegan whether you want to sweat through your scalp or feel a slow burn or whether you want to make yours with ground beef chunks of lamb five kinds of beans or even tofu.

As for the argument over beans’ place in a chili bowl it’s not a recent phenomenon – they’ve been in the mix for at least a century. “Adding beans and other vegetables to chili was a response to the meat rationing of the World Wars” Walsh said. Frugal home cooks used the produce from their victory gardens to get creative with their chili recipes and the new traditions stuck.

No matter your eating habits there’s a chili out there for you. Find your favorite chili from the suggestions below or try a new variation and spice things up this month.

Texas-style chili con carne

As any Texan will likely tell you there are no beans in traditional chili con carne – the focus is on chile peppers and meat. “Texans don’t put beans in the chili for the same reason that Italian-Americans don’t dump spaghetti into the red sauce” Walsh said. “Cincinnati chili and Texas chili are essentially sauces served with other foods often with beans on the side.”

Make it with chunks of chuck roast or try Lady Bird Johnson’s famous recipe that calls for ground beef then feel free to gussy it up with as many toppings as you like. It’s also ideal as a burrito or enchilada filling ladled over fries or tater tots or as the crowning glory of Frito Pie.

White chicken chili

“White” chili gets its name from a few substitutions: Instead of red meat and tomatoes chicken and its broth are used and instead of red chile peppers green chiles are the stars of the show here. Many recipes also include white beans such as cannellini or Great Northern.

Switch it up and try making a white chicken chili which feaures green peppers instead of red. Adobe Stock

Make this white chicken chili on the stovetop or in an Instant Pot with either mild or hot canned New Mexican Hatch chiles depending on how much spice you prefer. If you’re feeling ambitious you can also roast Anaheim or poblano peppers and add them to the chili for more flavor.

Cincinnati chili

Cinnamon might sound like a strange ingredient for a chili recipe but for the Macedonian immigrants of the Midwest it made sense. The Greek dish of pasta with meat sauce known as makaronia me kima resembled Southwestern chili so the name was Americanized. “But they left in the cinnamon nutmeg allspice and cloves that make it taste so unique. And they still served it over pasta” Walsh said.

Cincinnati chili is always served over spaghetti but the toppings can add up. Eat it “three-way” with shredded cheddar cheese “four-way” with diced white onions and cheese or go all the way with “five-way” chili topped with beans onions and cheese.

Sweet potato black bean chili

“As long as it has chile peppers in it I have no beef with vegetarian chili” Walsh said and this vegan chili is loaded with chiles. Sweet potatoes replace traditional stewed beef here simmered in a sauce that features fresh chopped poblanos and ancho chile-based chili powder along with smoked paprika.

If you have leftover cubed butternut squash or other hard winter squash feel free to substitute some or all the sweet potatoes in the recipe.

Vegetarian bean chili

You want beans in your chili? How about three different types of beans? This spicy vegetarian chili is loaded with kidney pinto and black beans. The classic chili spices are also rounded out by one secret ingredient – red curry paste – to add more heat and depth of flavor.

Or for another variation on beans this recipe uses refried pinto beans in place of whole canned beans to thicken the chili.

Smoked sausage chili

There is a long (and confusingly named) tradition of topping hot dogs and sausages with chili whether we’re talking Detroit’s Coney Island dogs New Jersey and Pennsylvania’s Texas wieners or Rhode Island’s hot wieners also known as New York System wieners.

The FBI has been called in to help the San Diego County Sheriff’s Department investigate a spree of high-end burglaries that have occurred in the region since May 2021 Poway authorities said Friday Jan. 21.

The burglaries which are believed to be by the same organized group have taken place in north Poway 4S Ranch and Rancho Santa Fe.

The San Diego Police Department is investigating similar burglaries in Del Mar La Jolla Carmel Valley Torrey Highlands Del Mar Mesa and Black Mountain Ranch officials said.

(See story on those burglaries at https://www.delmartimes.net/news/story/2022-01-22/la-jolla-burglaries-are-tied-to-sophisticated-crime-ring-police-say)

There have been 26 residential burglaries within the San Diego Police Department’s Northwestern Division that are associated with this string of burglaries police said. The San Diego County Sheriff’s Department did not respond to a request for comment by press time.

The Poway sheriff’s station reported in a tweet Wednesday Jan. 19 that it had sent out information on these burglaries to specific neighborhoods a couple weeks ago. But due to national news reports of a similar case involving a celebrity officials decided to share the information more broadly.

The Poway station retweeted a story about Lori Loughlin and Mossimo Giannulli reportedly having $1 million in jewelry stolen from their home in Los Angeles.

“These groups are operating throughout Southern California. This is the first case I’ve seen get this sort of coverage. A crime trend to be aware of” the Poway tweet said.

More details on the local burglaries was not immediately available

Poway officials tweeted some findings from their investigation into the local burglaries.

The burglars are targeting master bedrooms and closet areas looking for high-end jewelry handbags cash and watches. Home surveillance camera systems will often be turned away deputies said in the tweet.

“These suspects are highly organized skilled and appear to have collective training” deputies said. “They operate in groups often teams of four with three suspects doing the burglary and the fourth as a ‘getaway driver.’” All the burglars appear to be male.

The burglaries generally take place within the first hours after nightfall deputies said.

“Knowing most home alarms are only active on the first floor they prefer to make entry via a second-floor balcony. The suspects have utilized patio furniture ladders and even scaled walls to gain access to the second story. Single-story homes have also been targeted though” the tweet said.

The crimes have occurred quickly typically in a few minutes. The suspects usually flee the same way they made entry deputies said.

“When confronted by homeowners the suspects have run away” they said.

If you have an emergency dial 911. The San Diego County Sheriff’s Department North Coastal Station’s non-emergency phone number is (760) 966-3500.

OpenCL and Vulkan results for the international variant of the Galaxy S22 Ultra are far ahead of recent scores made by the Snapdragon 8 Gen 1 in the upcoming OnePlus 10 Pro.

There has been plenty of discussion about the Exynos 2200 and its AMD RDNA 2-based GPU the Xclipse 920. Some of it has been positive and some of it has been negative; however with news that Exynos-powered Samsung Galaxy S22 phones will be coming to international markets the great performance by the chip on Geekbench in OpenCL and Vulkan will be seen as positives for those worried that they might get the “worst flagship processor” in their brand-new S22 devices. While the CPU part has not set the world on fire just yet the GPU part has new results to help it stand head and shoulders beyond (most of) the competition.

The Exynos 2200 was spotted on Geekbench in a Samsung SM-S908B which should be the international variant of the Galaxy S22 Ultra. There are three Vulkan scores for the chip and one OpenCL score with the Xclipse 920 performing the bulk of the work in these benchmarks. Remarkably the AMD co-designed GPU seems to be coasting in the OpenCL test as the measured frequency is just 555 MHz for a part that apparently can manage up to 1.30 GHz. The score of 9143 points is +50.7% higher than the best score so far listed for the OnePlus NE2210 (6050 points) which is the OnePlus 10 Pro with Snapdragon 8 Gen 1 and Adreno 730.

The Vulkan test results are also promising for the Exynos 2200 with Xclipse 920. At the time of writing there were three records on Geekbench leaving an average score of 8556 points. Browsing through the results for the Snapdragon 8 Gen 1 SoC in the OnePlus 10 Pro leaves an idea of what the Adreno 730 can manage in Vulkan: The highest score is 7285 points. This puts the Samsung Xclipse 920 a more palatable (for the competition) +17.4% ahead. But this is highest vs. average; if the highest Vulkan score for both devices are set together then the lead for the Exynos 2200 grows to +23.9%.

It's important to remember these are synthetic benchmark results with the Exynos 2200 apparently not even at full stretch here. Real-life and gaming tests will likely throw up differing results; however the fact can’t be taken away that the Samsung Exynos 2200 and specifically its Xclipse 920 GPU look very tasty in this particular comparison. It might just come down to which smartphone can offer the best thermal management when it comes to deciding which chip really is currently the best (and worst) flagship processor.

The South Korean mobile giant is yet to formally introduce the first mobile devices based on its in-house Exynos processor. However the company has already announced its Exynos 2200 System on a Chip outfitted with AMD RDNA2 GPU.

This month started with rumors about next-gen Samsung’s chip encountering thermal throttling issues and as a result a necessity to substantially downclock the processor. Those rumors are yet to be confirmed because Samsung has not publicly confirmed the frequencies. This is despite introducing the new processor itself. The company did not provide any performance figures nor clock speeds of its CPU and GPU yet.

Unfortunately neither did the newly-leaked entries on Geekbench benchmark pages provide information on this subject. The new Exynos chip is listed with a clock speed of 555 MHz which is way lower than it should be and unlikely to be the correct frequency. The Xclipse 920 GPU is recognized as GFX1040 GPU which confirms it is part of the AMD RDNA2 product family.

Samsung Exynos 2200 features a 1+3+4 core design. The most powerful core is based on ARM Cortex X2 design the triple-core setup is Cortex A710 while the four power-efficient cores are Cortex A510 by design. The graphics are powered by Xclipse 920 GPU which is based on AMD RDNA2 graphics IP. The exact specs are not known but the rumors have suggested it might be equipped with 6 Compute Units which gives 384 Stream Processors.

In terms of performance in OpenCL benchmarks the RDNA2 GPU scores up to 9143 points which is up to 50.7% higher than the best score listed by Spandragon Gen1 with Adreno 730 GPU in Oneplus 10 PRO (vs 6050 points). In more gaming-related graphics API Vulkan Samsung processor is up to 25.5% faster than Qualcomm’s (9143 vs to 7285).

Samsung has not yet confirmed which devices will be outfitted with Exynos 2200 GPU but one would guess that the international version of the Samsung S22 series might be among the first. The company is now expected to host its Galaxy Unpacked 2022 product launch event on February 9th a date which has been suggested by two leakers so far. However Samsung is yet to confirm this date.

Matthew Gray Gubler who played Dr. Spencer Reid on long-running CBS show Criminal Minds will be starring alongside Westworld's Clementine Pennyfeather (Angela Sarafyan) in King Knight.



The movie follows Thorn (Gubler) and Willow (Sarafyan) the revered high priest and priestess of a coven of new age witches. They appear to have it all but a secret from Thorn's past threatens to turn their lives upside down and sends them on a trippy hilarious journey.

The trailer starts with new-age music in the background as Willow says that they are ""so lucky to have found each other"". Before long Thorn begins to narrate in saying: ""My name is Thorn and I'm a witch. This is my life partner Willow and this is my coven. This was the calm before the storm.""

It then shows Willow discovering through a Google search that Thorn is not who he says he is. When he was younger he was the classic all-American kid who became class president and prom king.

When Willow confronts him she asks seriously: ""Did. You. Play. Sports.""

Thorn says he played lacrosse leading to Willow screaming hysterically and dramatically.

When the coven wants to banish him Thorn attempts to confront his past and figure out who he really is through a spiritual drug-induced journey.

Though the start of the trailer and promotional photos are reminiscent of horror film Midsommar the movie is undoubtedly a hilarious comedy about self-discovery and identity.

Andy Milonakis Kat comer Johnny Pemberto Josh Fadem Nelson Franklin Emily Chang Swati Kapila Shane Brady AnnaLynne McCord Alice Glass Ronnie Gene Blevins Barbara Crampton and Ray Wise will be starring alongside Gubler and Sarafyan.

The movie will be released in selected theatres and on demand from February 17 2022.

Introduction by

Lorraine M. Martin

President and CEO

National Safety Council

A culture of safety starts at the top. It takes leaders who understand that safety needs to be at the forefront of every major business decision and ensure safety is a guiding value throughout their organization. That’s precisely what it means to be a CEO who “gets it.”

This year’s honorees are leaders with decades of experience who represent U.S. industries coast to coast. They’re passionate about safety and the impact it has on their employees organizations and communities. They set bold goals focus on continuous improvement and deliver strong results recognizing that safety never stops.

In a year like no other these nine CEOs consistently have gone “above and beyond” for their employees. Not only do their collective efforts help advance the National Safety Council mission to save lives from the workplace to anyplace I have no doubt that their exemplary leadership contributed to business becoming the most trusted institution worldwide according to the most recent Edelman Trust Barometer.

CEOs who “get it” lead by example – such as David B. Burritt of U.S. Steel Corp. whose organization was named to Newsweek’s list of the “Most Loved Workplaces” last year for its permeating belief – from the frontline to the boardroom – that each of its 23000 worldwide employees deserves to return home safely to their loved ones every day. Or take Matthew Flannery of United Rentals Inc.: a leader who aspires for his team to return home better for having come to work – safe inspired and motivated. For Brian Evans leader of Environmental Air Systems caring for those around you means having the courage to speak up in unsafe situations – a “people-first” approach to accountability that has resulted in 50% fewer incidents in a single year.

These leaders also challenge the status quo. Nick Stanage of Hexcel believes a zero-injury workplace is possible and has implemented new policies and systems that challenge traditional safety metrics. In his prior role leading Jetco Delivery Brian L. Fielkow went against the grain and incorporated safety into Jetco’s value proposition which attracted clients who are willing partners in a shared safety mission.

Over the past couple of years the divide between work and life has narrowed. These leaders recognize that the constructs of workplace safety have evolved as well. Understanding that many on-the-job incidents stem from external stressors Mike Greenawalt of Rosendin included a program to address topics related to mental health diversity and inclusion. Similarly Vijay Manthripragada of Montrose Environmental Group knows that holistic employee well-being creates healthier workplaces and communities which is why he formalized the company’s commitment to several of the United Nations’ sustainable development goals.

Finally CEOs who “get it” listen and have a desire to continually improve their organizations and the communities in which they live and work. After soliciting candid feedback from more than 8000 AES Corp. employees across 30 countries and 10 languages President and CEO Andrés Gluski embarked on a three-year project to improve safety culture which resulted in new technologies and practices that fuel employee wellness. Similarly Revathi Advaithi CEO of Flex used feedback from the company’s frontline workers to refine safety protocols and training implementing a global program focused on eliminating machine-related injuries.

Every worker in America deserves a CEO who gets it and these nine individuals not only inspire their own employees colleagues and other industry leaders but they also help people live their fullest lives – on and off the clock.

On behalf of NSC congratulations to the 2022 honorees.

Does your CEO 'get it?' Tell us why on the submission form and your CEO could appear among the 2023 selections. Thoughts on diversity: Throughout the years that the CEOs Who “Get It” recognition program has been in existence the National Safety Council has shone a spotlight on leaders from diverse industries. To help NSC showcase more diversity among the CEOs themselves we encourage safety professionals whose leaders are women and minorities to submit their leaders’ names for consideration.",,,,,,,,,,,,

Find out which cities in Georgia are perfect for you.

By Bonnie Burch on January 23 2022

Peaches and southern accents aren’t the only reasons people are moving to Georgia: This Deep South state is also highly reasonable for budget-conscious residents.

To be clear: This list is not just the cheapest cities in the state; we looked at many more factors in determining it. A high quality of life for example as well as a comparison to the average in cost of living to other cities through the state. We also examined transportation and housing options. So based on this special scorecard here are six most affordable places to live in Georgia.

1. Warner Robins

Located in Houston County Warner Robins is nationally known for its airplane history. Robins Air Force Base one of three Air Force Air Logistics Centers nationwide is located here along with the Museum of Aviation and the Georgia Aviation Hall of Fame. As of the 2020 US Census the median household income for residents is $55163 and the median home value is $178691.

Residents share a good health index whether hitting the links at a couple of area golf courses or hiking the Wellston Trail. Other attractions include Mildred’s Country Store Warner Robins Little Theatre and two railroad museums.

2. Duluth

Duluth has become an affordable option for those who want to live near Atlanta but still want a small-town feel. A part of Gwinnett County Duluth boasts a median income of $40685 while the median home value is $421166.

In the past the railroad industry was a big economic driver for Duluth and the Southeastern Railway Museum celebrates this. The city is the site of the popular annual Fall Festival ArtWalks and the Duluth History Museum.

3. Gainesville

Gainesville goes by several different nicknames including “Queen City of the Mountains” the “Hospitality Capital of the World” and the “Poultry Capital of the World” for the number of chicken processing plants here. The seat of Hall County Gainesville has a median income is $63651 and a median home value is $362859. Boaters fishermen and other water-lovers are drawn to recreational opportunities abundant on Lake Lanier (pictured above).

In addition to water attractions this northeastern Georgia city presents a haven for those keen on nature with the Chicopee Woods Nature. Art lovers on the other hand will love The Arts Council and the Quinlan Visual Arts Center.

4. Smyrna

Just outside of bustling Atlanta Smyrna has really come into its own in recent years. With a healthy median income of $77713 and a median home value of $458470 there’s good reason why Smyrna is one of the fastest growing cities in the state.

In order to keep up with the growth Market Village a mixed-use development featuring residential and commercial elements such as retail offices and restaurants opened in the city. The paved non-motorized Silver Comet Trail begins in Smyrna and ends 61.5 miles later at the Georgia/Alabama state line. Smyrna is also known for its great culinary scene.

5. Marietta

Along with Smyrna Marietta is the second Cobb County city to make the most affordable cities in Georgia list. The median income is $59594 with median home values at $459138.

Even though it’s close to the big city of Atlanta Marietta is proud of its Southern charm. The focal point is the Historic Marietta Square with its big old oak trees gazebo bandstand and fountain in the center of Glover Park which is surrounded by shops stores and more than 30 restaurants. Visitors can take in all the sites on the Historic Marietta Trolley Company or in the back of a foot-operated pedicab.

6. Newnan

The seat of Coweta County Newnan is known as the “City of Homes” since many of the old historic structures escaped Sherman’s scorched earth policy during the Civil War. In Newnan the median household income is pegged at $66384 with median home values at $345826.

For those who love architecture the 1904 Classic Revival courthouse with its magnificent dome fits the bill. As many folks continue to discover Newnan the city also boasts some of the best dining and shopping in the area.",,,,,,,,,,,,

Researchers at Rutgers say that phthalates may disrupt the placental corticotropin releasing hormone or pCRH produced by the placenta that is essential to pregnancy. The hormone is also produced by the brain as part of the body’s stress response. Levels of the hormone rise significantly during pregnancy and may act like a placental clock — telling the body when it’s time to give birth.

Levels of this hormone may rise too early in an individual’s pregnancy if that person is greatly exposed to phthalates Rutgers scientists say. Researchers now want to know whether this can cause preterm birth as well as other health effects.

“This [study] is just sort of another nail in the coffin reinforcing that we need tighter regulation of these chemicals. And that’s something that’s done in Europe but not so much in the United States” said lead author Emily Barrett associate professor of biostatistics and epidemiology at the Rutgers School of Public Health in New Jersey.

Phthalates are a class of chemicals that make plastics soft and flexible and are common in consumer products such as shower curtains. They are also used to hold color and scent in products such as nail polishes and air fresheners. The chemicals also contaminate food especially processed food and fast food.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has found that nearly 100% of people have phthalates in their bodies.

“On a daily basis we are unknowingly inhaling ingesting and rubbing these chemicals on our skin. They’re very very common” Barrett said.

“We’re all sort of unwitting participants in this big ongoing experiment. We all have measurable exposure to these chemicals. We’re regularly dosing ourselves with phthalates daily without really knowing what the effects will be” she said. “And what’s kind of troubling about phthalates and other chemicals that disrupt hormones is that a lot of times the impacts are sort of subtle or they may appear years after the exposure so they give the false impression that they’re safe because when you apply something to your skin it’s not giving you a bad reaction so you assume that it’s safe.”

Scientists previously observed that phthalates interfere with the normal activity of the hormones in the body of mice. The mice had problems with reproduction and metabolism and other essential activities. The effects were most significant when mice were exposed as fetuses. Those results spurred Rutgers to begin studying the effects of phthalates several years ago.

“And so we began to ask ourselves ‘If we’re all exposed to phthalates and they’re having these negative impacts on mice what are they doing to us?’” Barrett said.",,,,,,,,,

Often catered to vacationers it’s thought to be an informal mom-and-pop service.

At least that’s how Airbnb started.

But an increasing number of companies have formalized a model that combines Airbnb booking arrangements with the basic structure of an average hotel—so-called “Airbnb hotels.” Airbnb itself is building some of these hotels while other companies manage buildings under this format often using Airbnb to manage bookings. In doing so they blend not just the Airbnb and hotel format but short-term medium-term and long-term leasing into one building. STRs already face harsh regulations and it remains to be seen whether this hybrid model will too.

Airriva is an example in this genre. It is a Columbus-based chain that buys hotel licenses for its properties but rents rooms out on Airbnb VRBO and its own site. Airriva operates in Ohio Kentucky Michigan Missouri and Texas and is planning to enter Florida. I recently visited the hotel they are opening in Cleveland still under construction. Inside a historic warehouse it will have a restaurant courtyard bar and dozens of furnished rooms that are bigger than a standard hotel room.

Airriva also partners with large-scale property owners such as Kansas City’s City Club to broaden its reach. Other notable Airbnb hotel companies include Sonder and Blueground. The appeal to consumers is that by letting them book through third parties and check into and maintain their own units they will not have to pay the higher prices involved with a large hotel staff. Another perk is that these hotels are not supposed to feel like hotels; they have common areas that foster a community feel.

Interestingly Airbnb itself is getting in on the act of running hotels. Under its “Natiivo” brand it has partnered with developers to open ones in Miami Orlando Nashville and Austin. The buildings’ units are about 2/3rds condos 1/3rd hotel and all units can be sublet on Airbnb. The Miami project describes itself as providing “a one-of-a-kind ownership experience with the luxuries services and amenities of a hotel — with the added flexibility to list on any homeshare platform as desired.”

These platforms are redefining hotels into an STR/LTR hybrid. They serve a broader clientele than tourists; last year I wrote for Catalyst about how the STR market is shifting towards those who need longer stays than most hotels provide but shorter than most leases—meaning temp workers college students traveling nurses etc. In Cleveland Airriva’s property is located near the Cleveland Clinic making it ideal for patients and temporary medical staff. When Cleveland saw an influx of medical workers due to COVID Airriva was there to house them.

Airbnb hotels are thus disrupting traditional hotels. Research from Boston University finds that both budget and high-end hotels have lost revenue per available room while Airbnb has gained in that metric.

“In 2016 alone this 2.5% decrease in RevPAR amounted to $5.8 million in revenue lost by hotels to Airbnb…As a whole Airbnb’s accommodated demand made up nearly 3% of all traditional hotel demand in Q12016.”

The hotel industry has supported harsher regulations on STRs. The American Hotel & Lodging Association for example has worked to push cities to pass strict rules that would effectively ban the service. In 2020 the industry backed federal legislation that would have made the provider liable for violations of local laws by hosts.

Now however a growing number of conventional hotels use the Airbnb platform to facilitate bookings. Many are independent bed-and-breakfast hotels that lack the large internal booking systems used by hotel chains.

One solution Airbnb hotels have is that by acquiring hotel licenses they can reduce the legal ambiguity of their properties. Cities can be more permissive by loosening this licensure process and ending zoning rules that restrict where hotels can be built. That would help foster this interesting new real estate genre that blends so many different housing needs.

The CEO believes travel among remote workers will be bigger than ever as the pandemic pushes employers to offer more flexible working conditions. To prove it's possible to work from just about anywhere Chesky plans to live and work from Airbnbs across the U.S. over the next several months returning to his home in San Francisco between each one-to-two-week trip.

""All you need is a laptop and someone's internet in their home and you can do your job. In fact you can even run a nearly $100 billion company"" he told USA TODAY.

Airbnb updates coming soon

Chesky's first stop on his remote working tour was in Atlanta where he stayed in a home owned by a host who lives next door with her two young children. San Francisco street posters that the host's father and uncle collected in the 1970s were propped up behind Brian during a video interview one of the""personal touches"" that drew the CEO to the listing while he was browsing forplaces to stay.

►We've been nomads for almost a year:Here's what I've learned about taking an extended road trip

""I generally like homes that feel like they're part of a community"" he said. ""Some Airbnbs feel a little bit more lived-in than others.""

Chesky suggests remote workers who want to travel through Airbnb look for listings with good Wi-Fi and take a close look at reviews. The longer the better he said.

""The more passionate somebody is a better review the longer they're going to leave reviews"" Chesky said. ""So if you see a bunch of reviews and they're like one or two sentences on Airbnb even they're positive clearly that property didn't leave the same impression.""

The CEO plans to use his time working remotely to find ways to improve the platform. Airbnb has announced major upgrades in recent months and Chesky said ""some pretty big updates"" related to remote work will drop before the summer travel season arrives.

'A revolution in travel'

Before the pandemic customers primarily viewed Airbnb as a way to find an apartment in a city to stay at for a few days according to Chesky. That's changed over the past two years.

About 20% of nights booked between July and September were 28 days or longer. Half of the nights booked in that same time period were at least seven days long – up from 44% in 2019.

""We're on the verge of a revolution in travel"" Chesky said. ""The world is getting digitized. The world is getting smaller. It's getting more global. And I think this has probably been the biggest change in daily living.""

► Airbnb update:Airbnb upgrades app with automatic translations verified Wi-Fi and more as international travel picks up

While the pandemic won't last forever Chesky believes the remote working trend is here to stay with the ""vast majority"" of workers not returning to the office five days a week. He expects this will be especially big for workers without kids who are tethered to a school system but added that remote work could open doors for families who want to travel for extended periods over the summer.

The shift is a boon for employees who want to fit in more travel but Chesky said it makes sense from a business perspective as well: Why would a company limit their labor pool to only people who live near their office?

""I think ultimately people are going to want to compete for the very best talent"" he said.

'I feel like I can be anywhere'

Chesky's next stop is still undecided. Cities with friends he'd like to visit are high on the list but he's not discounting small towns and rural communities as options.

""I'm still kind of still figuring out where my next adventure is"" he said. ""I think I'm going to go to Nashville and then I think I'm gonna go to L.A. I'm not sure where next – maybe Miami.""

Chesky is considering posting a poll on social media to ask advice on where to go next.

""It's a really fun adventure"" he said. ""I always had this dream of being able to live anywhere. … (Now) as long as I'm in a reasonable time zone I feel like I can be anywhere and I can be just as effective here as at my house. So my office is everywhere.""

Police received multiple calls about shots heard at the home near Easton and Xenophon in west Tulsa around 3:45 a.m. around the same time officers responded to a call about a shooting victim at a nearby gas station. Investigators say the house where the shooting happened was rented out as an Airbnb and several people were detained for questioning.

Police say several dozen shots were fired and four guns were found by officers afterward. The victim had a grazing wound on his head and is expected to recover from his injuries police say.

Police say there had been a party going on earlier but they're still trying to find out what led up to the shooting.

A 16-year-old boy and 20-year-old Chazen Rogers are in custody on complaints of Shooting with Intent to Kill.

Police say Rogers could be seen in a video shooting at the victim's car.

Anyone with information about the shooting is asked to call Tulsa Crime Stoppers at 918-596-COPS.

Courtney Bolt lives next door to the house she said it was shocking having this happen so close to home.

She woke up in the middle of the night when she heard yelling outside “directly after that I heard what sounded to me like fireworks"" Bolt said. ""Our entire block was blocked off by law enforcement. They all had their big spotlights on and I saw some of the officers had you know those big shields and that they have and like helmets and stuff on. I mean it looked like a movie it was really scary.”

Bolt said she isn't sure she feels safe in her neighborhood but has hope that the community can come together to talk about how to make it safe again. Some neighbors tell me they haven’t had any problems with this particular house in the past but have had concerns about others.

2 News wanted to know more about how Tulsa regulates short-term rentals so we talked with City Councilor Kara Joy McKee who represents this area of Tulsa. In July 2020 the City of Tulsa adopted a short-term rental ordinance as a way for the city to keep track of Airbnbs and regulate how they are used.

To be compliant an owner must get a license to run an Airbnb.

“The license means that we at the city are monitoring what they are doing and have made sure that they are in compliance with all the rules that they are connected with their neighborhood and that they are connected with the City of Tusla"" Councilor McKee said. She says one of the main goals is to prevent Airbnbs from being used as party houses.

She says the ordinance is managed by an employee who works in the neighborhoods on code compliance.

“It is the responsibility of an Airbnb to make sure that they are in compliance that they are renting to the right number of people that the right number of cars are allowed there and that it does not become a party house and that’s what we are seeing are some party houses. That’s not what Airbnbs are intended to be” McKee said.

If an Airbnb owner gets three strikes their license is revoked.

“Neighbors can report issues and we have a code compliance officer who goes out there who monitors who can go out at odd hours not just your regular 9 to 5 to make sure that these Airbnb are in compliance” said McKee.

She says while the ordinance is new they’ll make adjustments as needed.

Councilor McKee also says this isn’t the first time they’ve had issues with Airbnbs in the Owen Park neighborhood and she is working to see how they can resolve those problems.

2 News tried several times to interview the host but they declined to comment. Airbnb put out a statement condemning the violence and said the guest of the home has been banned from its platform.

In Airbnb's statement they say the host of this property specifically bans parties and did not know about the event: “Airbnb bans parties [airbnb.com] and we condemn this senseless violence which has no place in the Airbnb community. We have banned this guest from our platform.”

Chesky will reportedly run the vacation rental site from a different Airbnb listing every few weeks relying on his laptop and a strong Internet connection to run the global company.

According to Chesky the pandemic is likely “the biggest change to travel since the advent of commercial flying” with more people working remotely.

As Chesky undertakes his new project there’s a big push from the platform itself to work with the new growth of decentralized living as more remote employees take advantage of their newfound flexibility.

In its last quarter Airbnb reported that one out of every five gross nights booked were for stays of 28 days or more with half the nights booked for stays of seven days or more per the report.

Interest in remote work has also grown since the pandemic with studies showing that demand for it has continued even as the economy has opened up and some COVID restrictions have loosened.

According to Glassdoor job searches for remote work surged over 300% between June 2019 and June 2021.

Last month PYMNTS reported that while remote work has offered new opportunities to many that structure cannot work for businesses like restaurants or brick-and-mortar retail stores.

Additionally foot traffic has dwindled in downtown hubs where more employees have been working remotely. As some businesses were originally designed to cater to office workers the new focus on remote work has been a hindrance.

According to a CNN report that quoted Goldman Sachs economists office attendance has been sitting at around a third of what it was pre-pandemic with employees who work remotely logically spending less on train tickets and other items they’d typically buy in downtown business centers."

The reason why certain stocks are priced so high is usually due to the company having never or rarely having completed a stock split.

There are many ways to evaluate a stock in addition to its absolute share price. Here we take a look at some of the largest companies in the U.S. and abroad.

Key Takeaways Companies are typically valued by their total market capitalization on a stock exchange or number of shares outstanding times the share price.

Still many investors are interested in the most pricey shares available on an exchange which can indicate exclusivity.

Companies can also be ranked by revenue and profitability.

Top Companies by Stock Price

The most expensive publicly traded share of all time is Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.A) which was trading at $458675 per share as of January 2022. Berkshire hit an all-time high on Jan. 18 2022 at $487255. Thanks to spectacular shareholder gains and the idiosyncrasies of its founder this share value is unlikely to be matched by anything other than continued gains in Berkshire’s share price.

The next company behind Berkshire in terms of nominal share price is NVR (NVR) at $5154.98 per share as of January 2022. Then there is the Seaboard Corporation (SEB) which was trading at $3731.02 and Amazon.com (AMZN) at $2852.86 followed by Alphabet Inc (GOOG) at $2607.03 a share.

Top Companies by Market Cap

By market capitalization as of January 2022 Apple (AAPL) is the biggest company at $2.652 trillion followed by Microsoft (MSFT) at $2.222 trillion Google (GOOGL) at $1.725 trillion Amazon.com (AMZN) at $1.446 trillion Tesla (TSLA) at $947.92 billion and Meta (META) formerly Facebook at $843.34 billion.

Back in 2007 Chinese energy giant PetroChina (PTR) reached an estimated market value of around $1 trillion. However this valuation didn't stick. As of January 2022 PTR's market capitalization stood at just $146.95 billion.

Top Companies by Revenue

In terms of the biggest global companies by revenue Walmart (WMT) comes in as number one—according to the Fortune 500 list. Walmart's revenues were $523964 billion in 2021. Behind Walmart was State Grid with $383906 billion in revenues followed by Amazon with $280522 billion and China National Petroleum at $379130 billion.

Sinopec Group ranks fifth with $407009 billion in annual revenues and the sixth and seventh spots are covered by Apple and CVS Health with $260174 billion and $256776 billion in yearly revenues respectively.

Based on only U.S.-headquartered companies' 2020 performance Walmart still has the top spot while Amazon comes in second. Exxon Mobil ranks third and Apple ranks fourth. Healthcare companies take up the fifth seventh and eighth spots: CVS UnitedHealth Group and McKesson generating $256.78 billion $242.15 billion and $231.05 billion respectively.

Berkshire Hathaway ranks sixth with $254.62 billion in annual revenues and the ninth and tenth spots are covered by AT&T and AmerisourceBergen at $181.19 billion and $179.59 billion in yearly revenues respectively.

Based on only U.S.-headquartered companies' 2019 performance Walmart still has the top spot while ExxonMobil (XOM) comes in second with $290.21 billion a year in revenues. Apple ranks third with $265.59 billion and Berkshire Hathaway fourth with $247.84 billion. Healthcare companies take up the sixth through eighth spots: UnitedHealth Group McKesson and CVS generating $226.25 billion $214.32 billion and $194.58 billion respectively.

Top Private Companies

In terms of private companies Forbes ranks Minnesota-based Cargill as the largest private U.S. company with $134.4 billion in annual revenues. The company has 155000 employees. Second is Koch Industries with $115 billion in revenues and 122000 employees. Ranking third is the grocery chain Publix Super Markets with $44.9 billion in annual revenue and 227000 employees.

The fourth and fifth largest private companies are Mars and H-E-B which generate $40 billion and $32.8 billion respectively. Each employs over 100000 employees.

The Bottom Line

On a pure market value measure Apple has often been considered the most valuable publicly traded company of all time. Although Microsoft did briefly hit the $2 trillion market cap mark in June 2021. It is certainly possible another company’s market cap will exceed these measures and maybe—though less likely—another company will surpass Berkshire Hathaway as the highest priced single stock share.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiaGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNuYmMuY29tLzIwMjIvMDEvMjIvYW1hem9uLW1pY3Jvc29mdC1hbHBoYWJldC1zZXQtbW9yZS1kZWFscy1pbi0yMDIxLXRoYW4tbGFzdC0xMC15ZWFycy5odG1s0gFsaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuY25iYy5jb20vYW1wLzIwMjIvMDEvMjIvYW1hem9uLW1pY3Jvc29mdC1hbHBoYWJldC1zZXQtbW9yZS1kZWFscy1pbi0yMDIxLXRoYW4tbGFzdC0xMC15ZWFycy5odG1s?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Amazon Microsoft and Alphabet went on a buying spree in 2021 despite D.C.'s vow to take on Big Tech,"Lina Khan nominee for Commissioner of the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) speaks during a Senate Committee on Commerce Science and Transportation confirmation hearing on Capitol Hill in Washington DC April 21 2021. Saul Loeb | Pool | Reuters

Big Tech is ""paying a lot of attention and would like to get deals done before the administration succeeds in getting new precedent"" said Erik Gordon a professor at the University of Michigan's Ross School of Business. ""Once a precedent is set in one courtroom by one judge it's easier for other judges to follow that precedent.""

Deterrence

So far the FTC under Khan is relying on a strategy of deterrence to keep company acquisitions in check as it struggles to keep up with a historic surge in merger filings across industries. What's yet to be seen is just how far the agency is willing to go to make good on its threats of action on the antitrust front. With a budget that hasn't kept up with the pace of work at the antitrust agencies and that pales in comparison to that of the companies it takes on the FTC has instead fired messages as warning shots to indicate its seriousness. One such action was the agency's announcement that it would send letters to some companies seeking to merge letting them know the FTC would continue investigating their deals even if the statutory waiting period had passed. The letter essentially warned that businesses could merge at their own risk but the FTC may later file a lawsuit for them to undo their transaction. While such letters don't actually set new policy — it's always the case that enforcers can seek to block or undo mergers even after they've reviewed them — the change in tone marked a sharp pivot from the past. But that may not work to actually change company behavior said Gordon. Until courts decide on regulators' interpretation of antitrust law large businesses will likely keep up the torrid pace of deals hoping to close as many as possible he said. ""Once you've cracked the eggs and made the omelet it's hard to get the eggs back into the shells"" said Gordon. ""You're going to be more likely to crack the shells scramble that omelet up and put the government in a position where they go into court and say this deal has to be undone and the judge looks at them and says how are you going to do that?"" Khan in her first on-camera sit-down interview since taking the job told CNBC's Andrew Ross Sorkin and Kara Swisher host of The New York Times' ""Sway"" podcast the agency is trying to be thoughtful about sending broad messages while acknowledging its own resource limitations. ""What are instances in which certain types of actions could have a market-wide impact?"" Khan said giving an example of the type of question she would consider. ""If we are able to obtain a particular settlement or consent decree or get a good outcome in court what are instances in which that could really change the dynamic in the entire market rather than just you know here or there?"" Bill Kovacic a former FTC commissioner and current law professor at George Washington University said it's only a matter of time until the antitrust enforcers act on their threats. ""The players are in place largely the commitments have been made they have the president of the United States in his executive order from July saying 'go get 'em' "" said Kovacic referring to Biden's order directing various government agencies to consider new ways they can address issues of monopoly concentration and competition in the economy. ""If you don't do it right now in the coming twelve months you will never get this opportunity again. And I think not only do they realize they have to deliver they want to deliver.""

Time to fight

In her CNBC interview Khan said that fighting Big Tech ""takes courage"" though she stopped short of suggesting her agency would block any existing deal. ""These are enormously well-resourced companies"" Khan said in the interview. ""They are not shy about deploying those resources. We're really showing these companies but also showing the country that enforcers are not going to back down because of these companies flexing some muscle or kind of trying to intimidate us."" Big technology companies often pay dozens of lawyers both in-house and outside counsel to give advice about the chances of deal approval. Microsoft Amazon Facebook parent Meta Alphabet and Apple may be the five most scrutinized companies in terms of the type of market power they wield over society and rivals given their collective market valuations which total close to $9.5 trillion. On the surface Amazon buying a movie studio (MGM) or Microsoft acquiring a gaming company (Activision) or a health-care artificial intelligence software (Nuance) company don't ring traditional antitrust alarm bells. These aren't deals where there's a limited competitor base arguing to get even smaller such as the wireless or broadband industries. This puts Khan in a ""prove it"" position where she'll likely have to make the case that antitrust law interpretation should adjust to current capitalist dynamics. Meanwhile Congress is working on new laws that could ease enforcers' jobs of proving to a court that certain behavior by online platforms is illegal. On Thursday the Senate Judiciary Committee advanced a major bill that would bar dominant online platforms from discriminating against rivals' products on their platforms. While that bill is focused on company conduct lawmakers in the House have also considered a bill that would shift the burden of proof in merger transactions onto dominant firms. ""Deciding when moving forward and taking action is still worth it even when it's not a slam dunk case"" Khan said in her CNBC interview. ""Even if there's a risk you still may lose there can be enormous benefits from taking that risk. You might win. You lose all the shots you don't take. But what we can see is that inaction after inaction after inaction can have severe costs. That's what we're really trying to reverse.""

Making a statement

In President Joe Biden's first year in office his chosen antitrust regulators have picked two significant media and technology deals to block. The Department of Justice sued to block Penguin Random House’s acquisition of rival publisher Simon & Schuster in November and Khan's FTC sued to block Nvidia's $40 billion acquisition of U.K. chip design provider Arm in December. Both of those deals carry unusual importance because they're two of the first big cases out of the gate said Kovacic. ""It's an enormous advantage to win your first cases"" he said. ""To show you can do it. To show it's not just talk."" The relatively short amount of time enforcers have to take action during their terms also puts a ""fierce sense of urgency"" into the FTC which understands that it must build on precedent to change the way companies think about mergers and acquisition Khan said.

Former Alabama wide receiver Jaylen Waddle was drafted No 6 overall in the 2021 NFL draft by the Miami Dolphins where he would reunite with his former college quarterback Tua Tagovailoa.

While the Dolphins season ended without a trip to the playoffs the future looks bright especially with Waddle wearing aqua white and orange.

The reason why certain stocks are priced so high is usually due to the company having never or rarely having completed a stock split.

There are many ways to evaluate a stock in addition to its absolute share price. Here we take a look at some of the largest companies in the U.S. and abroad.

Key Takeaways Companies are typically valued by their total market capitalization on a stock exchange or number of shares outstanding times the share price.

Still many investors are interested in the most pricey shares available on an exchange which can indicate exclusivity.

Companies can also be ranked by revenue and profitability.

Top Companies by Stock Price

The most expensive publicly traded share of all time is Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.A) which was trading at $458675 per share as of January 2022. Berkshire hit an all-time high on Jan. 18 2022 at $487255. Thanks to spectacular shareholder gains and the idiosyncrasies of its founder this share value is unlikely to be matched by anything other than continued gains in Berkshire’s share price.

The next company behind Berkshire in terms of nominal share price is NVR (NVR) at $5154.98 per share as of January 2022. Then there is the Seaboard Corporation (SEB) which was trading at $3731.02 and Amazon.com (AMZN) at $2852.86 followed by Alphabet Inc (GOOG) at $2607.03 a share.

Top Companies by Market Cap

By market capitalization as of January 2022 Apple (AAPL) is the biggest company at $2.652 trillion followed by Microsoft (MSFT) at $2.222 trillion Google (GOOGL) at $1.725 trillion Amazon.com (AMZN) at $1.446 trillion Tesla (TSLA) at $947.92 billion and Meta (META) formerly Facebook at $843.34 billion.

Back in 2007 Chinese energy giant PetroChina (PTR) reached an estimated market value of around $1 trillion. However this valuation didn't stick. As of January 2022 PTR's market capitalization stood at just $146.95 billion.

Top Companies by Revenue

In terms of the biggest global companies by revenue Walmart (WMT) comes in as number one—according to the Fortune 500 list. Walmart's revenues were $523964 billion in 2021. Behind Walmart was State Grid with $383906 billion in revenues followed by Amazon with $280522 billion and China National Petroleum at $379130 billion.

Sinopec Group ranks fifth with $407009 billion in annual revenues and the sixth and seventh spots are covered by Apple and CVS Health with $260174 billion and $256776 billion in yearly revenues respectively.

Based on only U.S.-headquartered companies' 2020 performance Walmart still has the top spot while Amazon comes in second. Exxon Mobil ranks third and Apple ranks fourth. Healthcare companies take up the fifth seventh and eighth spots: CVS UnitedHealth Group and McKesson generating $256.78 billion $242.15 billion and $231.05 billion respectively.

Berkshire Hathaway ranks sixth with $254.62 billion in annual revenues and the ninth and tenth spots are covered by AT&T and AmerisourceBergen at $181.19 billion and $179.59 billion in yearly revenues respectively.

Based on only U.S.-headquartered companies' 2019 performance Walmart still has the top spot while ExxonMobil (XOM) comes in second with $290.21 billion a year in revenues. Apple ranks third with $265.59 billion and Berkshire Hathaway fourth with $247.84 billion. Healthcare companies take up the sixth through eighth spots: UnitedHealth Group McKesson and CVS generating $226.25 billion $214.32 billion and $194.58 billion respectively.

Top Private Companies

In terms of private companies Forbes ranks Minnesota-based Cargill as the largest private U.S. company with $134.4 billion in annual revenues. The company has 155000 employees. Second is Koch Industries with $115 billion in revenues and 122000 employees. Ranking third is the grocery chain Publix Super Markets with $44.9 billion in annual revenue and 227000 employees.

The fourth and fifth largest private companies are Mars and H-E-B which generate $40 billion and $32.8 billion respectively. Each employs over 100000 employees.

The Bottom Line

On a pure market value measure Apple has often been considered the most valuable publicly traded company of all time. Although Microsoft did briefly hit the $2 trillion market cap mark in June 2021. It is certainly possible another company’s market cap will exceed these measures and maybe—though less likely—another company will surpass Berkshire Hathaway as the highest priced single stock share.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiaGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNuYmMuY29tLzIwMjIvMDEvMjIvYW1hem9uLW1pY3Jvc29mdC1hbHBoYWJldC1zZXQtbW9yZS1kZWFscy1pbi0yMDIxLXRoYW4tbGFzdC0xMC15ZWFycy5odG1s0gFsaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuY25iYy5jb20vYW1wLzIwMjIvMDEvMjIvYW1hem9uLW1pY3Jvc29mdC1hbHBoYWJldC1zZXQtbW9yZS1kZWFscy1pbi0yMDIxLXRoYW4tbGFzdC0xMC15ZWFycy5odG1s?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Amazon Microsoft and Alphabet went on a buying spree in 2021 despite D.C.'s vow to take on Big Tech,"Lina Khan nominee for Commissioner of the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) speaks during a Senate Committee on Commerce Science and Transportation confirmation hearing on Capitol Hill in Washington DC April 21 2021. Saul Loeb | Pool | Reuters

Big Tech is ""paying a lot of attention and would like to get deals done before the administration succeeds in getting new precedent"" said Erik Gordon a professor at the University of Michigan's Ross School of Business. ""Once a precedent is set in one courtroom by one judge it's easier for other judges to follow that precedent.""

Deterrence

So far the FTC under Khan is relying on a strategy of deterrence to keep company acquisitions in check as it struggles to keep up with a historic surge in merger filings across industries. What's yet to be seen is just how far the agency is willing to go to make good on its threats of action on the antitrust front. With a budget that hasn't kept up with the pace of work at the antitrust agencies and that pales in comparison to that of the companies it takes on the FTC has instead fired messages as warning shots to indicate its seriousness. One such action was the agency's announcement that it would send letters to some companies seeking to merge letting them know the FTC would continue investigating their deals even if the statutory waiting period had passed. The letter essentially warned that businesses could merge at their own risk but the FTC may later file a lawsuit for them to undo their transaction. While such letters don't actually set new policy — it's always the case that enforcers can seek to block or undo mergers even after they've reviewed them — the change in tone marked a sharp pivot from the past. But that may not work to actually change company behavior said Gordon. Until courts decide on regulators' interpretation of antitrust law large businesses will likely keep up the torrid pace of deals hoping to close as many as possible he said. ""Once you've cracked the eggs and made the omelet it's hard to get the eggs back into the shells"" said Gordon. ""You're going to be more likely to crack the shells scramble that omelet up and put the government in a position where they go into court and say this deal has to be undone and the judge looks at them and says how are you going to do that?"" Khan in her first on-camera sit-down interview since taking the job told CNBC's Andrew Ross Sorkin and Kara Swisher host of The New York Times' ""Sway"" podcast the agency is trying to be thoughtful about sending broad messages while acknowledging its own resource limitations. ""What are instances in which certain types of actions could have a market-wide impact?"" Khan said giving an example of the type of question she would consider. ""If we are able to obtain a particular settlement or consent decree or get a good outcome in court what are instances in which that could really change the dynamic in the entire market rather than just you know here or there?"" Bill Kovacic a former FTC commissioner and current law professor at George Washington University said it's only a matter of time until the antitrust enforcers act on their threats. ""The players are in place largely the commitments have been made they have the president of the United States in his executive order from July saying 'go get 'em' "" said Kovacic referring to Biden's order directing various government agencies to consider new ways they can address issues of monopoly concentration and competition in the economy. ""If you don't do it right now in the coming twelve months you will never get this opportunity again. And I think not only do they realize they have to deliver they want to deliver.""

Time to fight

In her CNBC interview Khan said that fighting Big Tech ""takes courage"" though she stopped short of suggesting her agency would block any existing deal. ""These are enormously well-resourced companies"" Khan said in the interview. ""They are not shy about deploying those resources. We're really showing these companies but also showing the country that enforcers are not going to back down because of these companies flexing some muscle or kind of trying to intimidate us."" Big technology companies often pay dozens of lawyers both in-house and outside counsel to give advice about the chances of deal approval. Microsoft Amazon Facebook parent Meta Alphabet and Apple may be the five most scrutinized companies in terms of the type of market power they wield over society and rivals given their collective market valuations which total close to $9.5 trillion. On the surface Amazon buying a movie studio (MGM) or Microsoft acquiring a gaming company (Activision) or a health-care artificial intelligence software (Nuance) company don't ring traditional antitrust alarm bells. These aren't deals where there's a limited competitor base arguing to get even smaller such as the wireless or broadband industries. This puts Khan in a ""prove it"" position where she'll likely have to make the case that antitrust law interpretation should adjust to current capitalist dynamics. Meanwhile Congress is working on new laws that could ease enforcers' jobs of proving to a court that certain behavior by online platforms is illegal. On Thursday the Senate Judiciary Committee advanced a major bill that would bar dominant online platforms from discriminating against rivals' products on their platforms. While that bill is focused on company conduct lawmakers in the House have also considered a bill that would shift the burden of proof in merger transactions onto dominant firms. ""Deciding when moving forward and taking action is still worth it even when it's not a slam dunk case"" Khan said in her CNBC interview. ""Even if there's a risk you still may lose there can be enormous benefits from taking that risk. You might win. You lose all the shots you don't take. But what we can see is that inaction after inaction after inaction can have severe costs. That's what we're really trying to reverse.""

Making a statement

In President Joe Biden's first year in office his chosen antitrust regulators have picked two significant media and technology deals to block. The Department of Justice sued to block Penguin Random House’s acquisition of rival publisher Simon & Schuster in November and Khan's FTC sued to block Nvidia's $40 billion acquisition of U.K. chip design provider Arm in December. Both of those deals carry unusual importance because they're two of the first big cases out of the gate said Kovacic. ""It's an enormous advantage to win your first cases"" he said. ""To show you can do it. To show it's not just talk."" The relatively short amount of time enforcers have to take action during their terms also puts a ""fierce sense of urgency"" into the FTC which understands that it must build on precedent to change the way companies think about mergers and acquisition Khan said.

While the Dolphins season ended without a trip to the playoffs the future looks bright especially with Waddle wearing aqua white and orange.

In his first season Waddle broke the NFL record for most receptions by a rookie. He surpassed Anquan Boldin’s record of 101 set back in 2003 Waddle finished the 2021 season with 104 receptions.

As noted by AA insider JonNYC the following cuts will be introduced effective January 26 2022 for an unspecified duration:

Flagship Routes First Class – the first three courses (appetizer salad soup) will be delivered in one step Business Class – meal service remains unchanged Economy Class – beverage and beverage accompaniments will be offered in conjunction with the meal cart

Domestic Routes Premium Cabin – no “immediate” changes Main Cabin – on flights of 1500 miles or more the second beverage service is eliminated but additional drinks will be offered on-demand



Let me start by saying the union does not represent all flight attendants and I have flown with some absolutely amazing FAs over the last year who work so hard to provide excellent service to their passengers.

Second charges of being “lazy” are not totally unfounded. It seems to me the primary goal of this initiative is to reduce (and already reduced) workload for flight attendants which the APFA hopes will make flight attendants feel like their union dues are actually paying off.

That’s because we are already appear to be over the omicron curve and there are far more effective ways to protect flights attendants like for the union to require (and provide) N95 masks for each FA.

Furthermore won’t making additional beverage service on-demand create many more back-and-forth trips down the aisles (or congregation in the galley)? Won’t that directly undermine precisely what the union is supposedly protecting the flight attendants from? Or are passengers going to be scowled out if they dare request a second cup of water on a six hour transcontinental flight?

I believe these changes are regrettable and have little do with flight attendant safety. I am sorry to see that AA kowtowed to the union wishes in this matter.

The original article is below.

As airlines have slowly restored in-flight service to pre-pandemic levels the omicron surge has pushed a number of flight attendants via their unions to demand reductions in service. The latest is American Airlines which is asking that meal service be consolidated and beverage service reduced.

Blaming Omicron American Airlines Flight Attendants Want Service Cuts In All Cabins

A brief memo from the Association of Professional Flight Attendants (APFA) the union which represents flight attendants at American Airlines notes the highly contagious omicron variant and how the APFA is trying to reduce service onboard:

With the continued spread of the Omicron variant APFA has proposed a temporary reduction to onboard service levels and customer touchpoints. Our goal is to maintain the highest level of Flight Attendant and passenger safety as possible onboard the aircraft. These proposed changes lessen the time that a passenger will not be wearing a mask and in turn limit Flight Attendant exposure. APFA proposals include serving entreés with salad/soup/appetizers in premium cabins when possible and reducing main cabin beverage services on domestic and IPD flights. We have asked that these reductions in service be implemented immediately.

(when did “flight attendant” become a proper noun?)

IPD stands for “international premium destinations” which includes longhaul service.

The union is proposing appetizers and main courses be served on single tray instead of course-by-course (which only recently returned to American Airlines) and additional drink services be eliminated in economy class.

Already American Airlines does not serve alcohol in economy class and I’m of the opinion that cutting back service has the potential to create even unsafer conditions for flight attendants. While passengers briefly remove masks to eat or drink when drinks are eliminated passengers become more agitated which leads to the sort of onboard masks incidents that have made headlines over the last year. It also encourages passengers to bring their own drinks including illicit alcohol in larger quantities than the portion-controlled servings onboard.

It’s also alarming that APFA puts so much faith in masks when so many passengers wear improper masks like flimsy cloth ones. It underscores what a fight it will be once (if?) the federal mask mandate is lifted and airlines must battle flight attendants over whether to voluntarily eliminate their own mask mandates which were present before the federal mandate.

The APFA would be better off advocating for mandatory N95 or KN95 masks onboard instead of trying to reduce beverage service.

CONCLUSION

The union representing flight attendants at American Airlines is demanding “temporary” service cuts it says will protect flight attendants. Beyond my disgust for cost-cutting masquerading as COVID-19 protection (“hygiene theatre”) on the airline side I genuinely think eliminating additional beverage services in economy class may have precisely the opposite effect the union wants: it will lead to more bad behavior more mask incidents and also move passengers to bring their own (perhaps illicit) drinks onboard.

What are your thoughts about the proposed American Airlines omicron service cuts?",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZ2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFsamF6ZWVyYS5jb20vbmV3cy8yMDIyLzEvMjIvdXMtc3VzcGVuZHMtZmxpZ2h0cy1ieS1jaGluYS1jYXJyaWVycy1hZnRlci1iZWlqaW5nLWNvdmlkLWhhbHTSAWtodHRwczovL3d3dy5hbGphemVlcmEuY29tL2FtcC9uZXdzLzIwMjIvMS8yMi91cy1zdXNwZW5kcy1mbGlnaHRzLWJ5LWNoaW5hLWNhcnJpZXJzLWFmdGVyLWJlaWppbmctY292aWQtaGFsdA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,US suspends flights by China carriers after Beijing COVID move,"Authorities in US to cut some flights by four Chinese carriers after Beijing stopped some services by US carriers after the discovery of COVID cases.

The government in the United States has said it will suspend 44 China-bound flights from the US by four Chinese carriers in response to the Chinese government’s decision to suspend some US airlines’ flights over concerns about COVID-19.

The suspensions will begin on January 30 with Xiamen Airlines’ scheduled Los Angeles-to-Xiamen flight and continue until March 29 the Department of Transportation said.

The decision will cut some flights by Xiamen Air China China Southern Airlines and China Eastern Airlines.

Chinese authorities have suspended 20 United Airlines 10 American Airlines and 14 Delta Air Lines flights since December 31 after some passengers tested positive for COVID-19. As recently as Tuesday the Department of Transportation said the Chinese government had announced new US flight cancellations.

Liu Pengyu a spokesman for the Chinese embassy in Washington said on Friday the policy for international passenger flights entering China had “been applied equally to Chinese and foreign airlines in a fair open and transparent way”.

He called the US move “very unreasonable” and added “We urge the US side to stop disrupting and restricting the normal passenger flights” by Chinese airlines.

Airlines for America a trade group representing the three US carriers affected by China’s move along with others said it supported Washington’s action “to ensure the fair treatment of US airlines in the Chinese market”.

The Department of Transportation said France and Germany have taken similar action in response to China’s COVID-19 actions.

It said China’s suspension of the 44 flights was “adverse to the public interest and warrant proportionate remedial action”. It added that China’s “unilateral actions against the named US carriers are inconsistent” with a bilateral agreement.

China has also suspended numerous US flights by Chinese carriers after passengers later tested positive.

The department said it was prepared to revisit its action if China revised its “policies to bring about the necessary improved situation for US carriers”. It warned that if China cancels more flights “we reserve the right to take additional action.”

China has all but shut its borders to travellers cutting total international flights to just 200 a week or 2 percent of pre-pandemic levels the Civil Aviation Administration of China (CAAC) said in September.

The number of US flights being scrapped has surged since December as infections caused by the highly contagious Omicron variant of the coronavirus soared to record highs in the US.

Beijing and Washington have sparred over air services since the start of the pandemic. In August the US Department of Transportation limited four flights from Chinese carriers to 40 percent passenger capacity for four weeks after Beijing imposed identical limits on four United Airlines flights.

Before the recent cancellations three US airlines and four Chinese carriers were operating about 20 flights a week between the countries well below the figure of more than 100 per week before the pandemic.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiY2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmlucXVpcmVyLmNvbS9idXNpbmVzcy9hbWVyaWNhbi1haXJsaW5lcy1taWxlcy10aGUtcG9pbnRzLWd1eS1hcHAtbGF3c3VpdHMtMjAyMjAxMjIuaHRtbNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,American Airlines and The Points Guy are suing one another over a frequent-flyer miles app,"A dispute over frequent-flyer miles and access to customer data is at the center of dueling lawsuits filed over the past two weeks between American Airlines the dominant airline in Philadelphia and the Points Guy a travel website founded by a Bucks County resident.

The Points Guy launched an app last September billed as a “one-stop shop” where consumers can track all their loyalty rewards for airlines hotels and credit cards in one place helping travelers redeem their earned miles.

But American claims the Points Guy uses the airline’s intellectual property unlawfully and wants it to stop. Brian Kelly CEO and founder of the Points Guy says consumers should have a choice about how to use their data.

Matters escalated earlier this month when American sent a cease-and-desist letter asking the Points Guy not to collect data related to its AAdvantage members. The Points Guy or TPG then filed a lawsuit against American Jan. 11 in state court in Delaware where American is incorporated. American in turn sued TPG and its parent company Red Ventures Jan. 18 in federal court in Texas where the airline is headquartered.

American’s suit accuses TPG and its corporate parent of “essentially free-riding on decades of investment by American” in building up its AAdvantage loyalty program.

The airline says its website use agreement prohibits AAdvantage members from giving account access to “any third party on-line service including but not limited to any mileage management service mileage tracking service or mileage aggregation service” and alleges TPG is causing customers to breach that agreement for its own benefit.

“Red Ventures is accessing AA.com and AAdvantage customer account data in a way that does not comply with our standards for use of confidential information” airline spokesperson Andrew Trull said in an emailed statement. “We have been in discussions with Red Ventures hoping to amicably resolve the issues and we were surprised when Red Ventures filed its lawsuit last Tuesday. We take customer data and proprietary information incredibly seriously and want to make sure it is protected and secure.”

Kelly considers American’s actions “short-sighted” particularly at a time when the industry is recovering from declines in air travel during the pandemic.

“We believe it’s the consumer’s choice” said Kelly who grew up in Jamison and now lives in New Hope. “If our reader wants us to help them look at the big picture and take a trip that’s a win for the travel industry.”

Describing how the TPG app works in its own lawsuit the Points Guy says users “provide TPG with their login credentials and authorize TPG to gather their account information and data by accessing the relevant loyalty program websites.”

TPG claims American is “the only major U.S. airline whose loyalty program miles expire” to the detriment of consumers while the TPG app helps travelers navigate those deadlines.

American did not comment on that aspect of the suit when asked by The Inquirer.

As Kelly explained it starting April 1 AAdvantage members’ miles will expire after 18 months of no activity. That said he noted it’s “pretty easy to keep them active” such as by using a credit card linked to the program.

“That’s actually what we educate people on at the Points Guy” he said.

Kelly started the Points Guy in 2010 and it was acquired in 2017 by Red Ventures which owns a suite of consumer-facing brands that include Lonely Planet.

According to TPG’s lawsuit the company’s website has 11 million unique visitors every month and its app has already been downloaded more than 100000 times.

Kelly likened the app’s purposes to third-party sites like Mint that allow users to track their bank account activity and personal finances in one spot.

“This is the 21st century” Kelly said. “Consumers want to access their data in ways that will help them.”"

A boiler at the retired Philip Sporn Power Plant was safely dropped Saturday morning and the remainder of the demolition project should be finished by the end of this year according to a news release from the Frontier Group of Companies.

The Sporn Power Plant closed in 2015 and was purchased by FGC in 2019. It has been since been named the New Haven Industrial Park.

“Since we acquired the former power plant we have invested significant resources into repositioning this 280-acre brownfield site including preparing a plan to transform this brownfield into a modern industrial park” Chief Executive Officer David Franjoine said.

Franjoine noted the site is located near the future home of the Nucor steel mill and has the utilities and infrastructure needed to attract industrial developers.

The Nucor Corporation recently at the cost of about $ 2.7 billion.

As EV sales grow year-over-year in the US and the rest of the world charging infrastructure is growing with it. In the US specifically certain states are far better equipped than others to support the rising number of EV drivers on their roads. Below is a breakdown of some of the best states for EV charging along with some of the… less than best.

Breaking down the US by EV charging

Anyone who has visited the US can attest that it’s a rather large country with 50+ cultural and economic identities. United federally but still independent locally these states are responsible for much of their own governing and decisions as it pertains to that specific state. This includes charging infrastructure.

As the number of electric vehicles on roads grows many states are not equipped with the charging network this zero-emission shift requires. On the flip side others are much better off to start. Factors such as size geography weather conditions and even culture have all had their affect on how quickly or slowly electrification has been adapted.

Some states are working tirelessly to keep up and others are not as focused since the number of EV sales remains a small percentage in comparison to ICE vehicles.

Additionally other states have the foresight to recognize this impending demand and have already begun implementing charging infrastructure in anticipation of an EV boom.

As you will see below there is more to this equation than simply how many EVs are on roads in a given state versus how many chargers are available (although we do share that data as well). Let’s break it down.

How data for best states for EV charging was found

To determine which states are truly the best for EV charging Zutobi released a detailed report using data from US government sites. We then took this same strategy and updated it using the most up-to-date stats.

For example the number of public charging outlets in each state is sourced from the US Department of Energy’s (DOE) Alternative Fuel Station Counts by State report. This report was last updated on November 8 2021. This number was based on the total number of charging outlets regardless of charging type (level 1 2 DC fast charge).

To best determine the number of EVs charging in each state the DOE’s Electric Vehicle Registrations by State was used. The data refers to the number of registered electric vehicles as of June 2021.

To calculate the total number of vehicles registered in each state we sourced data from the US Department of Transportation’s State Motor-Vehicle Registrations 2019. The data used was the number of private and commercially owned automobiles.

Lastly the number of EVs per mile in each state was calculated using US road data from 2019 gathered by the Institute for Policy & Social Research at University of Kansas. The total length of road (in miles) was divided by the number of EV charger outlets in each state to determine how far apart chargers theoretically are on average.

This is the most up-to-date data from the US government as of the time of this article’s publishing. We will update this information from time to time.

States with the most and least EV charging points

As you can see from the data below the number of registered EVs still pales in comparison compared to the overall number of registered vehicles for each state.

Based on sheer number of charging outlets alone the top three states in the US are California New York and Florida respectively.

This make sense given all three states’ geographical size and large populations in comparison to other states. Additionally California and Florida are also the top two states with both the most registered EVs and total vehicles overall. Texas comes in at third.

Conversely Alaska has the fewest total number of EV charging outlets followed by the Dakotas. We will give Alaska a pass since nearly 50% of the state remains uninhabited but North and South Dakota have some catching up to do. Wyoming and Montana do too.

If it wasn’t already clear by now California is leading the pack in nearly every category. But as you will see below that doesn’t necessarily make The Golden State the best to charge your EV in the future.

States with the most electric vehicles per public charger port

As previously stated the best states for charging your EV are determined by more than simply the number of charging outlets. Instead we have compared the number of available charging outlets against the number of registered EVs per state to analyze those ratios and see how they stack up.

This method showcases how equipped (or not) a given state is for EV charging based on how many EVs are theoretically fighting for a charger outlet.

1. New Jersey

New Jersey tops our list by nearly four more EVs per charger compared to second place. The Garden State has an impressive 30420 registered EVs chasing its neighbor New York which only leads by 2000 more. Despite its robust EV numbers the lack of charging is apparent – just 1638 chargers averaging over 18 EVs per charger in the state. Luckily New Jersey is in a great location in the Northeast. Try Pennsylvania or Delaware as backups.

2. Arizona

If you’re one of the 28k+ EV drivers in The Grand Canyon State you may have already noticed some infrastructural issues when trying to charge. The number of registered EVs in the state puts AZ in the top half of its US class but with less than 2000 charging ports available you may find yourself waiting to get a charge more often than in other states. Mathematically there are more than 14 EVs in the state per charger..

3. Hawaii

The scarcity of EV chargers at least in comparison to the number of EVs on the islands makes sense given the Aloha State’s geographical limitations. Despite being 2000 miles from the contiguous United States Hawaii still has more registered EVs (10670) than several other states combined. However with only 743 chargers available Hawaii residents also (theoretically) face over 14 EVs per charger. Not to mention that those 743 chargers exist across multiple islands.

States with the least EVs per charge port

Using the same method there are several states have a much better ratio of chargers to EVs. That being said many of the lower ratios are the result of both low EV registrations and limited chargers.

North Dakota offers the smallest ratio of EVs per charger at 1.67 which sounds pretty ideal for EV drivers in The Peace Garden State. The issue however is that there are only 220 of them.

South Dakota tells a similar tale with 410 registered EVs and only 148 chargers. That’s 2.77 EVs per.

Vermont touts higher registered EVs with 2230 and also has 834 charging ports. That equals a ratio of around 2.67 EVs per charger and a viable state to find an open port.

The best states for public charging points based on mileage

To keep things theoretical but expose how much charging infrastructure is lacking in most states we broke things down by mileage. We accomplished this by comparing the number of charging outlets available against how many miles of road exist in each state.

From here you can see the theoretical distance between each EV charger if you were to distribute them out equidistant across each state’s roads. Many distances are manageable but other states might require over 600 miles of range just to get you to your next charge.

1. Washington DC

Alright it’s technically not a state but it probably should be. DC is the home to the federal government and so much more. This includes 684 public charging ports across the district one every 2.2 miles. The data may be slightly skewed since DC only has about 1500 miles of roads. Even so DC has over 2300 registered EVs – that’s over 10x more than North Dakota.

2. California

The largest state on the left coast comes in at second on our list with an impressive ration given its sheer numbers. California remains years ahead of all states in current EV infrastructure having 180x more registered vehicles and 50x more charging outlets than DC. Its mileage ratio is simply more evidence of such as well. While The Golden State contains over 175000 miles of roadways one of its 34k+ EV chargers is theoretically available every 5.05 miles.

3. Hawaii

Entering the top three again is Hawaii. With such limited space (you know because of mountains and volcanoes) Hawaii only offers about 4500 miles of roads. Given its 743 chargers outlined above however EV drivers should theoretically find a charging port every 6.06 miles.

States with the most spread-out charging points

While the states listed above may still have some work to do for future charging infrastructure their current ratio has them on the right path to support more electric vehicle transitions at least in manageable proximity. The following states are not so well equipped.

Montana has the third-largest distance between EV chargers – about 359 miles between each of the 205 charging ports in the state spread out evenly across the 73647 miles of Big Sky Country.

South Dakota blows that distance out of the water. With only 148 public chargers and nearly 82000 miles of roadways The Mount Rushmore State theoretically has nearly 554 miles between each charging pile.

Last and opposite of least is Dakota’s top half. North Dakota offers slightly more roads (~89000 miles) compared to South Dakota but only has 132 public chargers within its state lines. That’s a distance of 668 miles between chargers. Unfortunately there is not an EV in existence that can travel that distance on a single charge… at least not yet.

What are the best states to charge your EV?

If you take all the ratios out of the equation the best place to currently charge your electric vehicle is California by a long shot. That’s based on the mere fact that the state is currently home to nearly 35000 chargers and growing by the day.

That being said it also has the highest number of EVs in the country so there will be more people looking to charge up too. Thanks to idle fees and DC supercharging your chances of finding an open charger nearby are still pretty good.

North Dakota has the best ratio of chargers to EVs but those numbers don’t hold much water since US EV adoption is its most anemic in Roughrider Country.

Washington DC seems well equipped to handle growing EV drivers and currently has the closest ratio of EV chargers per capita albeit a tiny sample map compared to any actual state. Vermont and Massachusetts have some decent averages across the board although neither were in the top (or bottom) three states in any category.

Other sites have done similar comparisons and have used their data to create a scoring system. This report from Bumper has some of the same data plus a lot more. Check it out to see how your state stacks up in their scoring system.

Charging infrastructure in the US looking forward

President Joe Biden has been busy during his first year in office. First he vowed to make the nation’s entire federal fleet all electric. That hasn’t quite gone to plan yet. However the White House has already introduced two bills to reform the federal tax credit for EVs.

This will expand thresholds on the number of EVs manufacturers like Tesla and GM have surpassed to once again qualify for federal tax credits.

The recently passed 1.2 trillion infrastructure bill promises $7.5 billion to help establish a nationwide network of EV charging stations plus an additional $65 billion to be invested in clean energy and renewables for the US electricity grid.

As the number of electric vehicles undoubtedly grows in each state some will be better prepared than others. States like California and Florida for example are implementing charging outlets step for step with the growing number of EV sales.

Other states like Vermont and Massachusetts may not have the largest number of EVs within their state lines but if they were to continue installing chargers at the same pace they would easily stay ahead of the game on infrastructure.

Other states like the Dakotas are not so well prepared. Sure they don’t have as many EVs to worry about charging just yet but the next decade will transform our vehicle landscape and there will need to be resources in place to keep these vessels charged.

Including DC the US alone has over 1 million EVs registered and over 110000 public chargers. Not bad but there’s certainly room for growth. Especially since EVs still only account for roughly 1% of vehicles on US roads.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm55dGltZXMuY29tLzIwMjIvMDEvMjMvb3Bpbmlvbi9wYWtpc3Rhbi11bml0ZWQtc3RhdGVzLWNoaW5hLmh0bWzSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Opinion | Pakistan’s Army Is Trying to Balance the U.S. and China,"For years Chinese and Pakistani leaders have described their relationship forged by a common rivalry with their neighbor India as “sweeter than honey.” But the Pakistani Army’s view of the relationship with China appears to be souring — and diverging from the political leadership’s.

Last month after Prime Minister Imran Khan declined the Biden administration’s invitation to its Summit for Democracy the Pakistani television news anchor Kamran Khan posted a video on social media denouncing the “wrong decision” one he declared was made at China’s behest. (China was not invited to — or happy about — the summit.) The journalist lamented that with that move the prime minister had “put Pakistan openly in China’s lap.” He alleged that Beijing’s loans had “entrapped” Islamabad and he even called for an “audit” of the pros and cons of the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor which has brought billions of dollars in debt-driven energy and infrastructure investment to Pakistan.

In Pakistan press freedom and politics lie in a gray area with red lines carefully managed by the army. With a mere phone call or WhatsApp message colonels can whip a transgressive editor or lawmaker into line.

So the explicit call to reconsider relations with China by one of Pakistan’s most prominent media voices is no random hot take. It reflects the consent if not the orders of the country’s khaki masters. Indeed Pakistan’s praetorian army would have preferred according to a retired U.S. diplomat that Prime Minister Khan had attended President Biden’s summit — to reinvigorate a relationship with a superpower that’s been giving it the cold shoulder."

A spot could be yours for $30000,"Adam Schupak

Golfweek

So you want to play in the American Express pro-am? This bucket-list experience can be yours if you’ve got $30000 burning a hole in your pocket.

After a one year absence due to COVID-19 the pro-am is back this week just as it has been every year in the tournament’s 63-year history.

The American Express actually was approved for a pro-am last year but called it off shortly before the event because organizers weren’t comfortable encouraging non-essential travel when hospitals were full. That led to pent-up demand to participate this year with many of the amateurs who previously signed up asking for their spot to be reserved. By August the field was full.

“We’re not taking out ads” said tournament director Pat McCabe who noted that the field is made up of returning business inquiries from word of mouth and current players bringing clients and friends along. There are various sponsorships and packages available but the off-the-street buy-in is $30000 (a portion of which is tax deductible).

Other than the AT&T Pebble Beach which tends to be on an invite-only basis there’s no other opportunity to play alongside a Tour pro during competitive rounds.

“It’s an experience you just can’t get” McCabe said. “It would be like you get to be the catcher at a Dodgers game.”

Where else in professional sports can you rub elbows with the pros have a caddie with your name on the back of its bib and flashing on the electronic leader board? McCabe describes it as being a PGA Tour player for a week.

Once an amateur participant gets on the grounds on tournament-week Monday he is afforded a sampling of what it’s like to live in the land of milk and honey that is the PGA Tour: park in the player lot access to the player dining facility with a guest practice-range facility and practice round access to all three courses a tee prize package various hospitality such as a BMW Driving Experience this year at Thermal Track and the pro-am draft party held at the 18th green Champions Pavilion on Stadium Course as well as a VIP hospitality lounge during Friday and Saturday’s post-round concerts (Maroon 5 and Brad Paisley) and three official tournament rounds with six different Tour pros.

Bob Diamond the former Barclays CEO has played in plenty of these affairs and said what sets the American Express pro-am apart from the others is that participants are paired with a different golfer every day. On Friday he witnessed Will Zalatoris shooting 61.

“I made six net birdies and he canceled them all out” said Diamond who played PGA West’s Stadium Course on Saturday with Phil Mickelson and Rickie Fowler. “Either I was useless or his inspiration.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMijAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5wZ2F0b3VyLmNvbS9hcnRpY2xlL25ld3MvZGFpbHktd3JhcHVwLzIwMjIvMDEvMjMvaHVkc29uLXN3YWZmb3JkLXdpbnMtdGhlLWFtZXJpY2FuLWV4cHJlc3MtZm9yLXNlY29uZC10aW1lLXdpdGgtdHdvLXNob3QtdmljdG9yedIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Hudson Swafford wins The American Express for second time with two-shot victory - PGA TOUR,Tied for the lead with fellow former Georgia player Brian Harman and Francesco Molinari at 20 under Swafford pulled ahead with the eagle on the par-5 16th.

Will Zalatoris is in the hunt heading into Sunday's finale at the American Express. Steph Chambers/Getty Images

The 2022 American Express comes to an end on Sunday January 23 with the final round in La Quinta Calif. Here’s what you need to know to watch Round 4 on TV or online.

Previewing American Express Round 4

Heading into this week reigning Rookie of the Year Will Zalatoris was once again dreaming of finally capturing his first PGA Tour victory. After an incredible round of 61 on Friday which featured seven-straight birdies Zalatoris looked like he was finally within reach of the promised land. Things didn’t work out quite as well for the young pro on Saturday.

Zalatoris playing the Stadium Course which will host Sunday’s final round made just three birdies against one bogey for a two-under 70. That improved his total score to 14 under leaving him four shots back and within striking distance of the leaders with 18 holes to play.

On Sunday Zalatoris will tee off at 1:15 p.m. ET and will be paired with Denny McCarthy and Wyndham Clark. You can watch the entire final round on Golf Channel or with PGA Tour Live on ESPN+.

We got our first in-hand look at new products that have launched on Tour and PGA Tour players have been testing them at length to see if they’re the right fit.

In our first Tour Report of 2022 (which will be a weekly staple going forward) we highlight all of the notable changes WITB photos and gear reports from inside the ropes.

Before we get into the inaugural Tour Report below I wanted to provide a brief state of the union on what’s going on here at GolfWRX. I’m Andrew Tursky former Editor-in-Chief of GolfWRX and current head of Tour content. Over the past three years since leaving GolfWRX I’ve spent my time inside the ropes at PGA Tour events working for two different media outlets. Within that period I’ve built and strengthened relationships with Tour reps players and caddies. GolfWRX has given me the opportunity to bring my inside-the-ropes reports to this website — a huge ‘thank you’ to current Editor-in-Chief Ben Alberstadt. In other words: I’m back. Honestly I’ve missed GolfWRX and all of the people that make the community so fun informative and unique.

Going forward I’ll be reporting on PGA Tour gear for GolfWRX (alongside GolfWRX’s veteran photographer Greg Moore) talking about my insights on podcasts (TG2 with Brian Knudson is coming back) and doing a lot more exciting things I can’t wait to share with the GolfWRX audience. A sincere thank you for having me back.

OK. Let’s get into this week’s gear recap from The American Express…

Check out all of our photos from the 2022 American Express here.

1. Matthew Wolff’s thoughts on the new Stealth Plus driver

Young bomber Matthew Wolff has switched into the new Stealth Plus driver (9 degrees) and as he told me this week “It’s the best TaylorMade driver ever made.”

Being that he’s finding significantly more forgiveness from the Stealth Plus than TaylorMade drivers in the past Wolff says he plans on hitting more drivers this year even on tight holes. As a reminder Wolff ranked fourth on the PGA Tour in driving distance last year (averaging 315.9 yards per drive) so tightening his dispersion should help him capitalize even more on his length advantage.

Read the full story here on PGATour.com

2. Patrick Reed’s new wedges

In one of the most significant new deals of 2022 former free agent Patrick Reed signed a driver and hat deal with PXG. This week we got our first look at his new setup.

He’s currently bagging a PXG 0811X Gen4 9-degree driver which he actually started using back in October 2021. That wasn’t the only news for Reed this week though. He also put new Grindworks “Barrett collection” wedges in the bag which are named after his son and made completely custom for him. Reed and Grindworks have worked closely over the last two years shaping and developing the new wedges.

“We’ve been working really hard on designing the wedges through Grindworks” Reed told GolfWRX on Tuesday. “They’ve been really good. It’s still a work in progress trying to tweak them a hair here and there but for me it’s going to be a game-changer because let’s be honest you have to be perfect from 130 yards-and-in nowadays on Tour because that’s where you score every time.”

For more on Reed’s new wedges click here.

3. A look at the 6-foot 9-incher’s gear setup

James Hart du Preez is maybe the longest-hitting player in professional golf. The 26-year-old South African stands at 6-feet 9-inches tall and he averaged 373 yards on The Sunshine Tour last year. Making his PGA Tour debut this week we took photos of his WITB and I also talked to his Ping fitter Brad Millard about what it’s like working with a guy who hits the ball so far. Lucky for us Millard also shared a Trackman screenshot from a recent driver fitting with du Preez for us to ogle.

James Hart du Preez full WITB

4. New flatsticks abound

There’s been an influx of new putter designs hitting the Tour over recent weeks and we got our first in-hand look at them at The American Express. Scotty Cameron TaylorMade Odyssey and Axis 1 have all revealed new models.

In the coming weeks we’ll keep you informed on which players are switching into the new putters and provide more information about the new designs as they become available from the OEMs. For now enjoy all of the photos and speculation.

5. Ping Glide 4.0 and Titleist Vokey SM9 wedges

Ping and Titleist have officially revealed their new wedges to Tour players and they’ve been conducting extensive testing to see what bounce and grind options are right for each player. Unfortunately for us we’re not yet being told about the tech and design philosophies. For now we’ll just have to look at the photos of the new launches.

Here’s a look at the new Ping Glide 4.0 wedges…

And here’s a look at the Titleist Vokey SM9 wedges…

I also spoke to legendary wedge maker Bob Vokey about his design process and thoughts on the new wedges. Check out that conversation here.

6. New Cobra LTDx drivers launch

Cobra officially launched its new LTDx drivers to the public and we dove deep into the new designs.

“The LTDx driver lineup reflects our team’s continued dedication to innovation and improved performance. With the introduction of PWR-COR and H.O.T Face technology our engineers have yet again developed innovation that improves CG and MOI while making the face hotter and more forgiving.

“The resulting LTDx family of drivers are the best we have ever produced and the three distinct driver models ensure that every golfer can achieve optimized performance for their game. We look forward to seeing the LTDx on Tour and also in the hands of amateurs and weekend warriors at courses globally.” – Tom Olsavsky Vice President of R&D Cobra Golf.

At the 2022 American Express I was also able to catchup with Jason Dufner who spoke on his experiences with the LTDx model.

“One thing I have been seeing is the strikes have been really consistent off the middle of the face” Dufner told GolfWRX. “People don’t believe this but sometimes the driver can droop in different ways. The last couple models I had I felt like I had been making good swings but was catching it on the toe a little bit. So these have been really consistent off the middle. I’ve seen really good launch windows to my eye good spin windows to my eye but I haven’t tested it on Trackman yet.”

Dufner also weighed in on why he still plays a Titleist 915F fairway wood which was released in 2014. Look at that wear mark!

7. Fujikura reveals new Ventus TR shaft

Fujikura’s Ventus series shafts have undoubtedly been some of the most popular metalwood shafts on the PGA Tour and in the marketplace for the past few years. This year Fujikura has launched an all-new Ventus TR Blue version which has a strong mid-to-butt section thanks to a new “Spread Tow” carbon weave. I went deep on the technology with Fujikura’s Spencer Reynolds so make sure to check out that full Q&A here.

“Essentially there’s a standard carbon weave and then there’s a Spread Tow carbon weave” Reynolds explained to GolfWRX. “What a Spread Tow does is it takes all these individual strands of carbon and irons them flat into a tape and then weaves those over-under over-under almost like a checkerboard pattern. So there’s very little space for resin to accumulate you get super low resin content and then you also get a lot of strength in varying directions. It can take pull and load in multiple directions. Another benefit is that it’s super lightweight. You’re getting an incredible amount of strength in an ultra-lightweight package.”

8. Mitsubishi’s new MMT putter shaft

More than ever PGA Tour players are using graphite iron wedge and putter shafts taking advantage of composite materials to add consistency to their performance. In Mitsubishi’s MMT iron shafts they use a multi-material “Metal Mesh” construction that combines graphite and steel. For its new MMT putter concept shafts the company has developed a new “Speed Mesh” which is 75 percent lighter.

I caught up with Preston Toulon a Mitsubishi representative at The American Express for more insight…

“The putter shaft uses a new application of Metal Mesh Technology called Speed Mesh which is 75 percent lighter than traditional Metal Mesh you’d fine in iron shafts. What that allows you to do is instead of using it in a small portion of the shaft because it’s so much thinner and so much lighter you’re able to use it in the full length of the putter shaft. It’s a big material advancement for us.” “It makes the shaft more stable. Through player testing they tell us it makes milled putters feel like they’re struck with an insert. People are reporting it makes it feel softer. It’s intended to help your start line and improve stability and feel. It helps players release the putter head more fully.” “We did a lot of testing versus steel putter shafts mostly through GEARS motion capture system…we had face-mapping patterns and in nearly all cases there was tighter dispersion tighter impact location (more center face) more consistent feel and more speed control.” “So we’ve had a lot of early excitement.”

9. The world No. 1’s gear setup

Jon Rahm the current No. 1 golfer in the Official World Golf Rankings has some new gear in the bag including a Rogue ST Triple Diamond LS driver and a Rogue ST prototype fairway wood. Check all the photos of his equipment here.

UANI Chief of Staff Claire Jungman said on Saturday that after clouds cleared in the South China Sea they managed to spot the vessels that were transferring Iran’s crude oil east of Singapore.

“TIFANI and VORAS two vessels we've repeatedly called for sanctions on are feeding vessels that are spoofing their automatic identification system (AIS) transponders” she said in a tweet with the image.

TIFANI is currently sailing under the flag of Tanzania and VORAS is Guyana-flagged and owned by Malaysia International Shipping Corporation Berhad.

The news came just a day after Reuters reported that a US safety firm has cancelled environmental and safety classification of two tankers after UANI alerted the classification company that they had carried cargoes of Iranian oil.

Without the certification -- the so-called class cover that includes vessel safety inspections -- vessels are unable to secure insurance cover or call at most international ports.

UANI that tracks Iran-related tanker traffic through ship and satellite data informed the American Bureau of Shipping the company that provides such certifications services about the breach of US sanctions in December.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiaGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnVzc29jY2VyLmNvbS9zdG9yaWVzLzIwMjIvMDEvZml2ZS10aGluZ3MtdG8ta25vdy1hYm91dC0yMDIyLXdvcmxkLWN1cC1xdWFsaWZ5aW5nLWluLWNvbmNhY2Fm0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Five Things to Know About 2022 World Cup Qualifying in Concacaf,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='www.ussoccer.com', port=443): Read timed out.

“When we look at what exhibits we can bring in what traveling exhibitions we want to spark those ‘ah-ha’ moments” said Jessica Chavez the museum’s Chief Learning Officer. “We want students and adults alike to see themselves in STEM careers.”

The traveling exhibition features models of 20 iconic skyscrapers from around the world. Ryan McNaught one of only 21 LEGO certified professionals in the world built the towers using more than 500000 bricks. In a video introduction McNaught and his team describe how they spent more than 2000 hours recreating these landmarks at 1:200 scale.

McNaught uses the same LEGO bricks found at toy stores layering different colors of bricks to create the iridescent quality of shimmering glass. His team carefully studies several photographs and plans of the buildings to understand the engineering challenges and to recreate distinctive architectural features. One model features interior landscaping mimicking the actual landscaping of the real-life building.

The featured towers include American treasures such as the Willis (Sears) Tower in Chicago the Wilshire Grand Centre in Los Angeles the Bank of America Plaza in Atlanta and a miniature New York City with 111 West 57th Street Central Park Tower Building the Chrysler Building and the Empire State Building.

International landmarks include the Burj Khalifa in Dubai the Barangaroo Hotel Crown Resort in Sydney the Infinity Tower in Brisbane the CN Tower in Toronto the Tokyo Skytree in Tokyo and the Marina Bay Sands in Singapore. “It gives a little passport to the world” Chavez said.

Each tower is accompanied by a description of the actual building and specific challenges of creating the LEGO version. Burj Khalifa model required 48365 bricks and was too tall to fit in McNaught’s workshop. Instead the team built it in five tiers and assembled it in a car park. For the Empire State Building McNaught used dinosaur claws in front of knights’ shields to reference King Kong and the building’s Art Deco ornamentation.

Marina Bay Sands in Singapore has a skypark that resembles a boat perched on top of sloping towers. Creating the banana-shaped curves with rectangular 26400 LEGO bricks was McNaught’s greatest challenge. McNaught’s team decided to build the model of the Petronas Towers in Malaysia upside-down because they wanted the studs facing downwards so the glass bricks appear clean and sharp. It took the team 360 hours to build the model.

Perot Museum of Nature and Science

“You can come more than once and still learn something new” Chavez said.

These LEGO models are meant to inspire people to see what they can create. The exhibition includes interactive stations with thousands of LEGO bricks. “With this exhibit we really want to encourage those to think about their own towers of tomorrow so we have over 200000 blocks to do that” Chavez said.

The museum also displays the models that visitors create. Chavez noticed children are more patient than adults when they encounter a challenge while creating a structure. “We’ll come in and we’ll see kids here for 45 minutes to an hour just tinkering and designing and that’s what we want to encourage: that iterative process of it didn’t work out but how can we keep it going and redesign and tinker” Chavez said.

London Bridge is essential to London life.

It's one of the main roads over the Thames for pedestrians and traffic and it's home to Borough Market which has been nestled underneath it for centuries.

But when Americans visited it with high hopes they were left disappointed.

London Bridge is famously the star of the popular song London Bridge Is Falling Down which has been around since the 19th century.

But Kat from New York was upset when she found out it wasn't actually on the brink of collapse: ""Worst bridge in London by far! It only has 2 or 3 foundation piers no cables or suspensions nothing like the song either. So lame. I thought it was going to be the life of the party but I wasn't offered any drugs until I had already walked off of it. What gives? Never again!""

And another common theme among the tourists was confusing London Bridge and Tower Bridge something Vince from Maui fell victim to: ""I was so thrilled to be riding over the London Bridge atop the roof of a red double decker bus. Its majestic stone twin towers dwarfed traffic all while the nursery rhyme played in my head. My excitement dwindled as I learned we were actually on the Tower Bridge not the London Bridge.

""What a disappointment is all I can say as I had no idea that the inconspicuous bridge we crossed over prior to the gorgeous Tower Bridge was the real thing. It's a mainstream mundane 4-lane road with equally-wide pedestrian walkways on either side. No grandeur at all. From the side view you'd never imagine in your wildest dreams that this humdrum design was the real deal. Less is less in this case.""

Well Vince a cheeky Google beforehand might have saved you the disappointment.

""It is best know for the nursery rhyme 'London Bridge Is Falling Down' which was a regular concern of the day"" wrote John from Ormond Beach. ""Unfortunately the boring bridge pictures posted are the London bridge and the pretty bridge is Tower bridge that you can see from London bridge.""

We get it London Bridge is boring.

Alyssa from Brooklyn took it upon herself to change the lyrics of the classic song: ""London Bridge is not the bridge you think it is.

""Not the bridge not the bridge.

""London Bridge is not the bridge you think it is.

""My fellow travellers.""

Hilarious and annoyingly catchy. Thanks Alyssa.

And John from Nashville was the most disappointed of all because ""Despite being promised so in the song I did not see Fergie's knickers.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmVhdHRoaXMuY29tL25ld3Mtc2V2ZW4tb25jZS1wb3B1bGFyLWZhc3QtZm9vZC1jaGFpbnMtbm93LWNsb3NlZC_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,7 Once-Popular Fast-Food Chains That Met a Shocking Ending,"Fast-food joints are sometimes a flash in the pan–pun intended. While the staples (read: McDonald's Burger King Five Guys and the like) feel fairly indestructible and consistent not all burger and fry chains are built to last. In fact some end up meeting a surprising or tragic ending no matter their size.

Here are several restaurant brands that were once huge but ended up falling from grace and disappearing.

For more fast-food news check out 8 Worst Fast-Food Burgers to Stay Away From Right Now.

Chi-Chi's

Poor Chi-Chi's. The brand started out in the '70s and was a success story for a while taking its signature Tex Mex fast food across the United States and Europe. But by 2003 the chain had run up against financial trouble. Chi-Chi's filed for bankruptcy that same year and then things really took a turn for the worse.6254a4d1642c605c54bf1cab17d50f1e

A Chi-Chi's location in a Pennsylvania mall was at the center of the largest Hepatitis A outbreak the United States had ever seen: over 650 cases were linked to the location.

The chain ended up paying out $40 million as settlements for the victims of the outbreak and ended up closing up shop in the American and Canadian markets as a result.

All Star Café

You surely remember the All Star Café given the amount of marketing and star-power attached to promoting it. Wayne Gretzky Joe Montana Shaquille O'Neal and Andre Agassi all ended up investing in the chain of sports-themed restaurants serving ""stadium cuisine.""

All Star Café opened up in prime locations across America from Times Square to Disney World. But even with all its famous on-brand investors the chain couldn't survive the waning interest in themed restaurants. In 2007 it closed its final location.

Wag's

In the '70s and '80s Wag's was a fast-food restaurant chain founded by Walgreens and modeled after 24-hour diners serving inexpensive burgers and breakfast options. But by 1988 Walgreens sold off all 90-something locations of the chain and turmoil ensued for the brand. Wag's was out of business by 1991 but some of its locations still operate as restaurants—under the IHOP brand.

White Tower

This back-in-the-day chain stirred up quite the drama during its lifetime. Founded in Stamford Conn. in 1926 the White Tower was quickly accused of shamelessly imitating another well-known competitor: White Castle. From its white fortress-like buildings to its menu White Tower certainly wasn't trying to hide its inspiration.

And while its beef with White Castle led it in and out of court this wasn't actually what brought the chain down. White Tower's demise came due to its real estate—its restaurants were mostly located on Downtown city streets with little car access and zero parking. A bad move in a car-obsessed America that came to value the drive-in more and more.

Most White Tower restaurants eventually went out of business save for one remaining location that still stands in Toldeo Ohio.

Lum's

It's surprising that something with such a unique concept couldn't stick it out. The brand which was founded in 1956 and at one point had 450 locations was known for steaming its hot dogs in beer. Genius considering hot dogs and beer already pair so well. But unfortunately even that offbeat cooking tactic wasn't enough to keep them from liquifying their assets in 1982.

Sambo's

Sambo's fell from grace in 1982 when it went bankrupt despite having as many as 1117 locations. The last location hung on until 2020 when it changed its name in the midst of George Floyd protests. ""Sambo"" is a racist term for people of African descent so it is definitely for the better that the last of the chain's locations have either closed or changed that major detail.

Pumper Nic

While White Tower came under fire for all-around imitating the concept of White Castle Pumper Nic was in hot water its logo. Undeniably reminiscent of Burger King's the Argentinian brand went through a legal battle with the King of burgers before ultimately going bankrupt in 1999.",,,
AWK,American Water Works,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiT2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnBvbGl0aWNvLmNvbS9uZXdzLzIwMjIvMDEvMjEvbmV3LWplcnNleS10b3hpYy1kcmlua2luZy13YXRlci01Mjc2MjHSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,How a toxic chemical ended up in the drinking water supply for 13 million people,"What they found the details of which have not been previously reported is a gap in state and federal regulations that allowed an unsafe chemical to end up in an essential water supply.

There are no federal limits for how much 14-Dioxane can be in drinking water though New Jersey is proposing new rules that would limit the chemical to .33 parts per billion. Some samples from 2020 found nearly 10 times that amountin the Delaware. New Jersey officials have said they believe those levels ultimately did not “pose any immediate health risk” by the time drinking water reached customers.

Officials from across the region including the Delaware River Basin Commission the multi-state agency tasked with looking after the river set up a group to track down the source of the contamination.

Though their work continues it comes with an unsatisfying twist: Someone clearly sent the chemical into the river but it’s not clear whether anyone will face consequences for polluting one of the country’s major water supplies.

Some chemicals including 14-Dioxane remain largely unregulated. And even as New Jersey’s Department of Environmental Protection is preparing for the first time to set strict limits on the amount of 14-Dioxane allowed in drinking water it seems unlikely those rules would have prevented the Delaware River contamination.

New Jersey’s planned rules require drinking water suppliers to look for and remove most of the chemical from drinking water — but the rules don’t do more to keep polluters from putting it there in the first place.

The Delaware River incident highlights the extent to which drinking water suppliers are often on the hook for cleaning up other people’s problems even as New Jersey American is expanding its treatment process to handle 14-Dioxane and other contaminants like other “forever chemicals” the public only recently understood are unsafe.

A big part of figuring out where the pollution was coming from fell to Matt Csik the top water quality official for New Jersey American Water. He needed to know how a likely carcinogen was getting into the river and threatening his customers’ water. In a watershed that stretches from the Catskill Mountains to Rehoboth Beach Del. that was a challenge.

By Patterson Clark and Ry Rivard POLITICO Pro

So in October 2020 Csik put on his wetsuit and started taking water samples from the Delaware.

His sampling suggested the chemical was in water coming from one of the Delaware’s main tributaries the Lehigh River which cuts through Pennsylvania before dumping into the Delaware.

“It was pretty clear to me at that point that we had at least the smoke to tell us where the fire could be” Csik said in an interview.

Csik’s work helped narrow down where the larger regional search party would look and ultimately find the chemical — near a wastewater treatment plant in Allentown Pa. operated by the Lehigh County Authority. A sample taken from the Lehigh River near the treatment plant found levels of 14-Dioxane more than 100 times higher than what New Jersey‘s proposed rules would say is safe to drink.

The Allentown plant takes wastewater cleans it up then discharges it into the Lehigh at a point right before where the Lehigh empties into the Delaware. The plant handles chemicals on a federal priority list but 14-Dioxane isn’t one of them and the plant hadn’t studied how to treat it. That makes 14-Dioxane one of thousands of potentially harmful chemicals that are not an official priority for federal regulators even though they have already determined long term exposure to it may cause kidney and liver damage.

“We weren’t looking for it and didn’t know to look for it” Liesel Gross the CEO of the Lehigh County Authority said in an interview.

But now the plant needed to find out who was sending it wastewater laced with 14-Dioxane.

Most people know wastewater treatment plants handle what comes to them through sewage systems. But some plants including the one in Allentown have lucrative side businesses accepting waste from outside haulers.

The Lehigh County Authority a public agency run by local officials received about $2.9 million in 2020 treating all kinds of hauled waste including $38000 from Coim USA Gross said in an email. Coim which had been sending some wastewater to the Allentown plant Pennsylvania since 2018 from its polymer manufacturing facility in West Deptford N.J.

Coim is an Italian polymer and plastics maker and 14-Dioxane is one of its byproducts.

According to regulatory filings Coim submitted to the federal Environmental Protection Agency the company should have been sending waste containing 14-Dioxane to an incinerator near Niagara Falls N.Y.

But when the Allentown treatment plant conducted tests in June 2021 to find who was bringing 14-Dioxane to its facility it found Coim was the “main contributor.”

The treatment plant immediately stopped accepting Coim’s waste and the amount of 14-Dioxane in the Delaware dropped according to officials from New Jersey American Water and the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection both of which have the results from subsequent water samples in the Lehigh and Delaware rivers.

Coim USA’s president Michelangelo Cavallo denied responsibility for polluting the river and said the June test that found 14-Dioxane in the wastewater it was sending to Pennsylvania was the result of an accident. That time — and that time only Cavallo said — the company mixed up the tank it was sending to the Allentown plant with the one meant for the incinerator in Niagara Falls.

“It was a simple mistake” Cavallo said in an interview. “Never happened in the past and … it will not happen in the future.”

Regulators haven’t taken any formal action against anyone involved in the incident.

The EPA requires plants like the one in Pennsylvania to test for about 130 different chemicals out of what experts say are thousands of industrial chemicals that can end up in wastewater. After a plant tests for what they have to they have little insight into what else might be is going into their facilities — or what might be is coming out.

“In this case if there are not regulations that prevent a thing from occurring the thing can occur” said Shawn LaTourette New Jersey’s top environmental regulator. “I think the public has a really hard time with this and understandably so.”

Tracy Carluccio deputy director of the nonprofit Delaware Riverkeeper Network said failing to test for pollutants is long-standing problem along the river.

“But ignorance is not bliss and this is no excuse for pollution” she said.

Work is continuing to track down other sources of 14-Dioxane in different parts of the Delaware though New Jersey American’s sampling shows the primary source of the chemical threatening its supplies has substantially gone away since last summer.

Csik New Jersey American’s water quality official said the utility was fortunate to have a treatment process that helped remove 14-Dioxane and is getting ready to add another treatment process that further removes the chemical.

This is not the first time 14-Dioxane has threatened New Jersey drinking water. Several years ago the federal government asked large water suppliers throughout the country to test for the chemical. About a tenth found some level of 14-Dioxane but nearly a quarter of New Jersey suppliers found it including about 30 drinking water systems that had levels of the chemical at or above what would be allowed under the state’s newly-proposed proposed rules.

Tom Neltner the chemicals policy director of the Environmental Defense Fund a nonprofit group said incidents like the one in the Delaware are pretty common though the details are rarely reported. Tracking down the unusual toxic trail can be difficult and municipal wastewater treatment plants like the one in Allentown may not know what industrial polluters are sending them.

He said the Safe Drinking Water Act the key law that protects Americans’ drinking water may be ill-suited for a world where potent and robust chemicals like the 14-Dioxane found in the Delaware River can come from far away and be dangerous in tiny amounts.

“In many ways we use the Safe Drinking Water Act as a cleanup program to clean up the water that never should have been contaminated in the first place” Neltner said in an interview “instead of trying to prevent it from being contaminated in the first place.“",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMinwFodHRwczovL3d3dy5jb2xvcmFkb3BvbGl0aWNzLmNvbS9uZXdzL2NvdmVyLXN0b3J5LXRoaXJzdC1mb3ItYmF0dGxlLWRvdWdsYXMtY291bnR5LXdhdGVyLXByb2plY3QtaGl0cy1oaWNjdXBzL2FydGljbGVfNGE1NzgyOTAtNzdmOS0xMWVjLTllNjEtYTNmMjg3OTU3MzFhLmh0bWzSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,COVER STORY: THIRST FOR BATTLE | Douglas County water project hits hiccups,"Close Get email notifications on {{subject}} daily!

The annual report published last September by the NGO revealed that 227 environmentalists were murdered in 2020 with seven out of ten of the countries with the highest murder rate being in Latin America. Colombia alone saw 65 activists killed followed by Mexico and Brazil where there were 30 and 20 documented deaths respectively. Let’s meet some of those who in spite of these threats are putting their life on the line to defend the region’s water wildlife and biodiversity.

Ángela Maldonado jungle defender

Ángela Maldonado 48 used to keep a television playing cartoons next to her computer while she worked. This small comfort helped her as she undertook the tough job of documenting environmental crimes in the Amazon including the smuggling of illegal timber and wildlife tourism agencies holding wild animals in captivity and experiments being conducted on monkeys. “I imagine that I’m in a cartoon. I’m a little monkey and I fight against big criminals. And I go on and on fighting against the corrupt ones. And I’m winning” she says laughing among the trees near the border town of Leticia in the Amazonas department of Colombia.

Maldonado grew up in Bogotá her country’s capital. Over twenty years ago she visited the Amazon for the first time and it changed her life. At the time she was studying business administration and travelled there to free a Woolly monkey that she had helped rescue from smugglers. “I felt like I’d come home” she recalls. “The jungle is the ultimate manifestation of life on the planet. It is a treasure that we must look out for”. Several times during the interview she’s moved to tears: “I defend our future the possibility for indigenous people to continue existing”.

Since her first encounter with the rainforest Maldonado’s life took a sharp turn and she became an expert in the conservation of primates. For this she lives in the shadow of constant threats and can only be in the same place for a short period of time. Mostly she has to stay home. She avoids talking on the phone and going out alone.

A few years ago Maldonado received a death threat. It was an email saying that if she were to go back to the village of Puerto Alegria where she helped organise operations with the police she would be killed alongside others who worked for Entropika the NGO Maldonado co-founded. “That happens when you’re an activist in this country. Of course I’m scared but I won’t let them shut me up. I must be careful I’m worth more alive than dead” says Maldonado. Humour is one of her strategies to deal with psychological stress.

I made the decision not to have children. What if one day I get a bullet in the forehead? Then they would have to live without their mother. So I decided not to. Ángela Maldonado

The primatologist has spent more than ten years documenting the abuse of nocturnal monkeys winning the Whitley Award in 2010 and National Geographic’s Awards for Leadership in Conservation in 2020. Maldonado often speaks about how she identifies with the monkeys. “That’s why I fight like that. When someone destroys the jungle I feel like they’re attacking my family. And if someone attacks your family then of course you attack back right?”

Heather Iqbal a Senior Communications Advisor for Global Witness is concerned. “The murders are only the tip of the iceberg. Not all of them are recorded and then there are the threats and criminalisation of environmental activists. There are many ways to try and silence them”. Maldonado too has had several judicial cases brought against her. And her enemies are powerful. “There’s an extensive network of corruption in this region. Politicians the tourism industry smugglers and drug gangsters most people think twice before going after them”.

In the neighbouring city of Tabatinga in Brazil lawlessness ravages. According to Maldonado it only costs around 100 US dollars to have someone killed. Due to the death threat Maldonado decided to continue the fight under safe conditions and leave Leticia for a while. “The state can’t guarantee my safety so I must take care of that myself” she says.

Maxciel Pereira defender of indigenous land

On 6th September 2019 Maxciel Pereira was riding a motorcycle with family members on the streets of Tabatinga. He worked at Funai Brazil’s indigenous affairs agency and was known and loved for defending indigenous people and their territories. Tragically the 22-year-old environmentalist’s fight ended that Friday. Pereira was shot in the head on the street in front of his family. A video from the ensuing dramatic minutes shows blood pouring out of the back of his head. Many people came to his funeral and a burial chamber marks his resting place in Tabatinga’s chaotic cemetery.

Pereira had spent years fighting criminality in the Amazon such as illegal logging hunting and gold mining. A few weeks before his death he had confiscated a batch of fish that was larger than usual; many were angry about this as it meant a great financial loss for powerful people in the area. Pereira’s colleagues fearing for their lives fled the place where they worked the Javari indigenous territory which has one of the highest concentrations of uncontacted tribes in the world. Even now they’re still afraid of the consequences of talking about Pereira’s case.

This situation has been confirmed by Thiago Arruda an anthropologist from the Brazilian NGO Indigenous Work Center in Tabatinga. He mentioned a death list for people working in Funai: “Employees at Funai have been prohibited to comment the case or the death list but we who work in the area know about it”.

“Pereira’s murder marks a before and after for environmentalists here” he says. “Before people were killed in drug related crimes. We risked being shot but the gun wasn’t aimed at us. That has changed now the gun is aimed at us. Now we’ve become targets of attacks like the one against Pereira. Of course we’re scared. It is a permanent risk for us working with indigenous people – and for indigenous people themselves. Our impression is that it’s getting worse”. Arruda also mentions seeing videos being shared on WhatsApp in which fishermen celebrated Pereira’s murder with a barbecue party.

Pereira’s murder was fact-checked by Global Witness and included in the report on environmentalists killed in 2019 a total of 212 worldwide of which two-thirds in Latin America. Defining if a murder specifically targets environmental activists for their work is complex. Killings often occur in contexts where there are also problems of drug related crime or armed groups are operating. “We use at least three independent sources and look at whether the person has received threats linked to defending the environment before” explains Iqbal. “It often happens that the killings are masked as being related to drug crime”.

Celina Suárez Mantilla water defender

Since 2016 feminist activist Celina Suárez Mantilla 54 has been part of the civic committee to protect the water and páramo of Santurbán Colombia. We meet at her friend’s house in the city of Bucaramanga. Suárez Mantilla is aware of the risks that come with her work. “I sent my 18-year-old daughter into exile in Sweden because our situation is really tough”. Celina cries several times during the interview while also showing impressive strength and conviction. The activist isn’t planning to leave her homeland herself.

“I would rather die here fighting for what I believe in than be safe in exile far from my country” she states.

Páramos are unique ecosystems and the source of 70 per cent of Colombia’s drinking water. Suárez Mantilla is resolute in defending one of them in particular Santurbán which supplies water to around 3 million people in the country’s northeast. “Community leaders in Colombia are under attack especially those defending our territory. The committee has received threats from the paramilitary group Aguilas Negras. We receive news about community leaders being killed all the time. I just hope there will be no more and that it won’t happen to any of us” says Suárez Mantilla. “We try to keep a low profile when it comes to the threats to avoid scaring people away. We shouldn’t sow fear but bravery instead” she adds.

Suárez Mantilla is fighting to stop concessions for open-pit gold extraction in Santurbán which poses the risk of water contamination. “Santurbán’s páramo is essential for life in the territory not only for people but for animals and plants too. Without water there’s no life” decries Suárez Mantilla.

The fight for Santurbán is like many others in the region says Iqbal. “Mining interests are at the top as the cause of environmental activists’ murders and threats being made against them. Since Latin America is full of resources many conflicts are associated with their extraction. Agri-business and the defence of water are big drivers behind these murders”. Suárez Mantilla is aware of the severity of the situation. “We really are in danger. We’re clashing with powerful economic interests”.

The distance from Sweden to Bucaramanga is painful for the environmental activist and mother who misses her daughter. Yet she remains adamant. “I’m not going to stop now. I’ve decided to keep on fighting until the last day of my life”.

These are PCBs shaped like birds looking like birds and chirping like birds – and they are fully analog! The sound is produced by a network of oscillators feeding into each other and once tuned is hardly distinguishable from the bird songs you might hear outside your window. Care and love was put into making this bird life-like – it perches on Kelly’s arm with legs woven out of single-strand wire and talons made out of THT resistors in the exact same way you would expect a regular bird to sit on your arm – that is if you ever get lucky enough. It’s not just one bird – there’s a family of circuit animals including a goose a crow and even a cricket.

Why did these animals came to life – metaphorically but also literally? There must be more to a non-ordinary project like this and we asked Kelly about it. These birds are part of her project to explore models of consciousness in ways that we typically don’t employ. Our habit is to approach complex problems in digital domains but we tend to miss out on elegance and simplicity that analog circuits are capable of. After all even our conventional understanding of a neural network is a matrix of analog coefficients that we then tune a primitive imitation of how we assume human brains to work – and it’s this “analog” approach that has lately moved us ever so closer to reproducing “intelligence” in a computer.

Kelly’s work takes a concept that would have many of us get the digital toolkit and makes it wonderfully life-like using a small bouquet of simple parts. It’s a challenge to our beliefs and approaches compelling in its grace urging us to consider and respect analog circuits more when it comes to modelling consciousness and behaviours. If it’s this simple to model sounds and behaviour of a biological organism a task that’d have us writing DSP and math code to replicate on a microcontroller – what else are we missing from our models?

Kelly has more PCBs to arrive soon in preparation for her NYC exhibit in February and will surely be posting updates on her Twitter page! We’ve covered her work before and if you haven’t seen it yet her Supercon 2019 talk on Electronic Naturalism would be a great place to start! Such projects tend to inspire fellow hackers to build other non-conventional projects and this chirping pendant follows closely in Kelly’s footsteps! The direction of this venture reminds us a lot of BEAM robotics which we’ve recently reminisced upon as something that’s impacted generations of hackers to look at electronics we create through an entirely different lens.",,,,,,,,,,,,

The Australian arm of Apple has reported that profit and revenue grew during the financial year to 25 September 2021 while acknowledging that aspects of its business continued to be affected by disruptions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic.

The company's reported after-tax profit came in at AU$319.5 million above the AU$288 million recorded in the previous financial year.

Total revenue increased by double digits with AU$11 billion reported following last year's AU$9.79 billion. This was mostly achieved through the sales of its products which contributed a whopping AU$9.5 billion to total revenue leaving services accounting for the remaining AU$1.65 million.

""During 2021 aspects of the group's business continued to be affected by the COVID-19 pandemic with many of the group's retail stores as well as channel partner points of sale temporarily closed at various times and a significant number of the group's employees working remotely"" Apple stated.

The group paid AU$137.5 million in total tax income which was proportionate to earnings for the full year.

Apple had a current tax income expense of nearly AU$159 million deferred tax of nearly AU$20 million and over-provisioned for AU$1.55 million.

Apple is among a handful of technology companies that have all settled their tax affairs with the Australian Taxation Office (ATO).

The ATO told Senate Estimates last year that multinationals have changed their behaviour as a result of measures introduced by the Australians government to thwart tax avoidance.

Under the Multinational Anti-Avoidance Law (MAAL) companies operating with an annual global income of more than AU$1 billion in Australia are required to lodge their general purpose financial statements to the ATO if they are not already doing so with the Australian Securities and Investments Commission.

""Multinational companies are booking about AU$8 billion a year extra through their Australian subsidiaries which they previously booked to sales from places like Singapore and Ireland … our estimate for the model is that we're collecting over AU$100 million extra income tax per year from the MAAL"" ATO client engagement group second commissioner Jeremy Hirschhorn said.

During the year Apple increased its headcount from 3896 employees to 4137 with salaries and bonuses lifting marginally from AU$268 million recorded in the previous year to AU$274 million. Total employee benefits expenses jumped by just over AU$2.5 million to AU$448.5 million.

The immediate and ultimate holding companies of Apple Pty Ltd are Ireland-based Apple Operations International Limited and US-based Apple Inc.

These quarter-sized tracking devices were designed by Apple Inc. as item trackers to locate wallets car keys and other personal items. However according to Sgt. James Isaacs head of the Dearborn Police Technical Investigation Unit Airtags have been found behind license plates between and underneath car seats and in people’s personal items such as purses.

Cases involving these little $29.99 trackers are on the rise Isaacs said they had four cases involving one within the past week.

The tags are used to track vehicles and individuals for potential illegal activity such as larceny auto theft and stalking. According to Dearborn Police Dodge Chargers are frequently targeted for such illicit tracking activity.

Police say that many phones will notify a user if an Airtag is in close proximity and if they don’t recognize the device they should notify police immediately.

“People have been using GPS trackers to stalk and harass people for a long time” Issacs said. “The reason why this one has become so increasingly apparent now is I think due to the cost the cost is significantly less than a traditional GPS tracker that people would get. Therefore the ease of access is much higher.”

Apple Airtags work through connecting to a Bluetooth signal on an iPhone. Users of Androids will need to download the Apple Tracker Detect app and manually scan their surrounding area to get this type of alert notification.

“If you’re alerted that an Airtag is in your vicinity or you think someone may be following you immediately call 911 and be prepared to provide the serial number stated in the phone alert” the police department said in a statement.

In the state of Michigan it is illegal for a private citizen to track anyone with a GPS tracker without the other party’s knowledge.

Anyone with information about people using Airtags should call the police department’s anonymous phone line at any time at 313-943-3030.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiV2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmludmVzdG9wZWRpYS5jb20vYXNrL2Fuc3dlcnMvMDgxMzE0L3doYXRzLW1vc3QtZXhwZW5zaXZlLXN0b2NrLWFsbC10aW1lLmFzcNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,What's the Most Expensive Stock of All Time?,"Stock price is an indicator of a company's market value but the price of a share of stock will also depend on the number of shares outstanding. The reason why certain stocks are priced so high is usually due to the company having never or rarely having completed a stock split.

There are many ways to evaluate a stock in addition to its absolute share price. Here we take a look at some of the largest companies in the U.S. and abroad.

Key Takeaways Companies are typically valued by their total market capitalization on a stock exchange or number of shares outstanding times the share price.

Still many investors are interested in the most pricey shares available on an exchange which can indicate exclusivity.

Companies can also be ranked by revenue and profitability.

Top Companies by Stock Price

The most expensive publicly traded share of all time is Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.A) which was trading at $458675 per share as of January 2022. Berkshire hit an all-time high on Jan. 18 2022 at $487255. Thanks to spectacular shareholder gains and the idiosyncrasies of its founder this share value is unlikely to be matched by anything other than continued gains in Berkshire’s share price.

The next company behind Berkshire in terms of nominal share price is NVR (NVR) at $5154.98 per share as of January 2022. Then there is the Seaboard Corporation (SEB) which was trading at $3731.02 and Amazon.com (AMZN) at $2852.86 followed by Alphabet Inc (GOOG) at $2607.03 a share.

Top Companies by Market Cap

By market capitalization as of January 2022 Apple (AAPL) is the biggest company at $2.652 trillion followed by Microsoft (MSFT) at $2.222 trillion Google (GOOGL) at $1.725 trillion Amazon.com (AMZN) at $1.446 trillion Tesla (TSLA) at $947.92 billion and Meta (META) formerly Facebook at $843.34 billion.

Back in 2007 Chinese energy giant PetroChina (PTR) reached an estimated market value of around $1 trillion. However this valuation didn't stick. As of January 2022 PTR's market capitalization stood at just $146.95 billion.

Top Companies by Revenue

In terms of the biggest global companies by revenue Walmart (WMT) comes in as number one—according to the Fortune 500 list. Walmart's revenues were $523964 billion in 2021. Behind Walmart was State Grid with $383906 billion in revenues followed by Amazon with $280522 billion and China National Petroleum at $379130 billion.

Sinopec Group ranks fifth with $407009 billion in annual revenues and the sixth and seventh spots are covered by Apple and CVS Health with $260174 billion and $256776 billion in yearly revenues respectively.

The Bottom Line

On a pure market value measure Apple has often been considered the most valuable publicly traded company of all time. Although Microsoft did briefly hit the $2 trillion market cap mark in June 2021. It is certainly possible another company’s market cap will exceed these measures and maybe—though less likely—another company will surpass Berkshire Hathaway as the highest priced single stock share.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiaWh0dHBzOi8vYXBwbGVpbnNpZGVyLmNvbS9hcnRpY2xlcy8yMi8wMS8yMy9mYWxsLW9mLTIwMjItd2lsbC1iZS1hcHBsZXMtYmlnZ2VzdC1ldmVyLWlmLXJ1bW9ycy1hcmUtY29ycmVjdNIBbmh0dHBzOi8vYXBwbGVpbnNpZGVyLmNvbS9hcnRpY2xlcy8yMi8wMS8yMy9mYWxsLW9mLTIwMjItd2lsbC1iZS1hcHBsZXMtYmlnZ2VzdC1ldmVyLWlmLXJ1bW9ycy1hcmUtY29ycmVjdC9hbXAv?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Fall of 2022 will be Apple's biggest ever if rumors are correct,"Fall of 2022 will be Apple's biggest ever if rumors are correct

Apple's product lineup for late 2022 will include a massive amount of product launches it is believed with many product lines expected to feature updated hardware.

The typical schedule for Apple's product launches in recent years involves the company revealing the bulk of them in the fall. For 2022 it seems that the catalog update could be Apple's biggest refresh in quite some time.

Apple is chiefly expected to hold its usual iPhone launch the ""iPhone 14"" for 2022 as well as other updates around the same time. According to Mark Gurman's ""Power On"" newsletter for Bloomberg Apple's going to be showing off a lot more than usual.

Given the breadth of the potential launches this could see Apple holding multiple events such as its trilogy of fall presentations for 2020.

The report also offers the possibility that the iPad and iPad Pro may arrive sooner with the speculation that the ""more significant changes"" in the catalog could push Apple to shift its iPad updates to a late spring launch."

They have succeeded in classifying the grasping object by using the tactile signals from the hand part of the robot arm (Fig. 1). This is one of the world's first examples of robot control using an ""in-materio"" reservoir device which allows nanomaterials to carry out a computation and is expected to be used in the future for energy-saving AI systems and situational awareness functions for autonomous robots working in the home. The results of this research were published online in the German scientific journal Advanced Intelligent Systems on 4/Jan/2022.

Research Points

Success in developing a material-based physical (in-materio) reservoir arithmetic element.

The first application of in-materio reservoir computation to the recognition of grasping objects.

The developed reservoir computing device is expected to be applied to complex AI problems such as time series prediction and voice recognition in the near future.

Professor Hirofumi Tanaka's comment

Prof. Tanaka Director of Research Center for Neuromorphic AI Hardware (Neumorph Center) Kyushu Institute of Technology (Kyutech) JAPAN.

Neumorph Center at Kyutech is a research center where researchers from a wide range of fields including four research divisions materials electrical and electronic circuits numerical modeling and AI robotics working together to develop next-generation AI systems. In order to reduce the power consumption of present AI systems it is necessary for a paradigm-shift of software to hardware and also to shift from digital drive to analog drive since there is a limit to the power consumption reduction of hardware. In this process AI device fabrication based on materials engineering plays an important role. We are focusing on the fact that the chemical reactions and dynamic properties of materials themselves can be used for AI processing and are developing AI devices that work with completely new materials and principles. Neuromorphic AI hardware research is a budding field and the Neumorph Center is the first research organization in Japan in this field. With the success of the application of the In-materio reservoir device to AI robotics we will continue to work vigorously to spread this field which has a small population of researchers all over the world.

WASHINGTON/SAN FRANCISCO: Intel Corp said on Friday it would invest up to $100 billion to build potentially the world's largest chip-making complex in Ohio looking to boost capacity as a global shortage of semiconductors affects everything from smartphones to cars.The move is part of Chief Executive Officer Pat Gelsinger's strategy to restore Intel's dominance in chip making and reduce America's reliance on Asian manufacturing hubs which have a tight hold on the market.An initial $20 billion investment - the largest in Ohio's history - on a 1000-acre site in New Albany will create 3000 jobs Gelsinger said. That could grow to $100 billion with eight total fabrication plants and would be the largest investment on record in Ohio he told Reuters.Dubbed the silicon heartland it could become ""the largest semiconductor manufacturing location on the planet"" he said.While chipmakers are scrambling to boost output Intel's plans for new factories will not alleviate the current supply crunch because such complexes take years to build.Gelsinger reiterated on Friday he expected the chip shortages to persist into 2023.To dramatically increase chip production in the United States the Biden administration aims to persuade Congress to approve $52 billion in subsidy funding.U.S. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said on Friday the House of Representatives would soon introduce a bill on competitiveness to help bolster semiconductor investment and supply chains. That would include the $52 billion funding https://www.reuters.com/world/us/pelosi-says-us-house-will-soon-introduce-competitiveness-bill-2022-01-21.U.S. President Joe Biden touted Intel's investment on Friday at a White House event with Gelsinger and again made the case for congressional action.""China is doing everything it can to take over the global market so they can try to out compete the rest of us"" Biden said.U.S. Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo said at the event the current semiconductor supply chain is ""far too dependent on conditions and countries halfway around the world.""Gelsinger said without government funding ""we're still going to start the Ohio site. It's just not going to happen as fast and it's not going to grow as big as quickly.""Intel ceded the No. 1 semiconductor vendor spot to Samsung Electronics Co Ltd in 2021 dropping to second with growth of just 0.5% the lowest rate in the top 25 data from Gartner showed.As part of its turnaround plan to become a major manufacturer of chips for outside customers Intel broke ground on two factories in Arizona in September. The $20 billion plants will bring the total number of Intel factories at its campus in the Phoenix suburb of Chandler to six.Gelsinger told Reuters he still hoped to announce another major manufacturing site in Europe in coming months.It is not just Intel ramping up investments. Rivals Samsung Electronics and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co or TSMC also have announced big investment plans in the U.S. And that's raising questions about a glut in chips going forward.""We still have years in front of us before we're even having a semblance of supply demand balance"" said Gelsinger. ""Ask yourself what portion of your life is not becoming more digital.""""Yes the industry is growing and maybe the metaverse solves world hunger for the semiconductor industry. But there is a big bubble coming"" said Alan Priestley an analyst at Gartner.The U.S. build up comes as a tech war between the U.S. and China is causing a decoupling of certain technologies such as chips. Companies looking to sell technologies to China are considering basing outside of the U.S. to avoid being snagged by U.S. export control rules. China is also investing heavily in its semiconductor manufacturing capacity.While Gelsinger also touted the security and economic benefits of boosting U.S. chip production on Friday Bloomberg reported in November that the Biden administration pushed back against a prior plan by the company to boost silicon wafer production in China over national security concerns.Intel has drawn fire for its decision to delete references to Xinjiang from an annual letter to suppliers after the chipmaker faced a backlash in China for asking suppliers to avoid the sanctions-hit region.When asked about it in a briefing last month White House press secretary Jen Psaki said she could not comment on the company specifically but said ""American companies should never feel the need to apologize for standing up for fundamental human rights or opposing repression"" reiterating a call to industry to ensure that they are not sourcing products that involve forced labor from Xinjiang and urging companies to oppose China's ""weaponizing of its markets to stifle support for human rights.""Intel's Ohio investment is expected to attract partners and suppliers. Air Products Applied Materials LAM Research and Ultra Clean Technology have shown interest in establishing a presence in the region Intel said.Construction of the first two factories is expected to begin late in 2022 and production in 2025.",,,,,,

Preservationists Fight to Save a Grain Elevator in Buffalo (Published 2022),"BUFFALO — At first glance the hulking brick building on the edge of Lake Erie looks like another decaying relic of Buffalo’s once-prosperous past an image made all the worse by an enormous gash in its exterior the victim of this city’s raking winter winds.

But to the trained and loving eye the building — the Great Northern grain elevator — is a beauty a testament to ingenious engineering and turn-of-the-century chutzpah whose utility and aesthetic profoundly influenced generations of architects.

“These were the kind of cathedrals of the modern age” said Gregory Delaney a clinical assistant professor at the University at Buffalo’s architecture school noting the elevator’s unique blend of function and technology. “It’s a building that is at the same scale as a great medieval cathedral with a similar kind of monumental power.”

So it is with no small amount of consternation for grain-elevator aficionados that the building’s current owner — Archer Daniels Midland Milling Co. part of the farm and food products giant — has been pushing to demolish the Great Northern setting off a furious fight between preservationists and the company. It has also placed Buffalo’s mayor Byron Brown in the unenviable position of either allowing the destruction of a local landmark or defying a valued local employer.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMipAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5kZXNtb2luZXNyZWdpc3Rlci5jb20vc3Rvcnkvb3Bpbmlvbi9jb2x1bW5pc3RzL3Jla2hhLWJhc3UvMjAyMi8wMS8yMi9jYXJib24tY2FwdHVyZS1kYWtvdGEtcGlwZWxpbmUtbmVjZXNzaXR5LXF1ZXN0aW9uZWQtb3JnYW5pemVkLW9wcG9uZW50cy82NTY4NzU2MDAxL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Opinion: Are carbon capture pipelines necessary? Can they be fought?,"If you haven't been paying attention to the proposed carbon dioxide-carrying pipelines being discussed at meetings around Iowa now is a good time to start. Maybe you don't think they'll affect you. They will.

They'll affect you directly if you're a landowner along the route whose property could be used to lay in pipeline including through eminent domain. Such designations garnered attention not much of it positive after the Dakota Access Pipeline came through and left long-term damage to some land and crops.

But anyone who lives in Iowa has a stake in protecting the state's environment and beating back climate change.

These proposed pipelines three of which will seek approval from the Iowa Utilities Board are billed as solutions to environmental problems some Iowans weren't even sure existed. The three are Summit Carbon Solutions Navigator CO2 Ventures and Archer Daniel Midland. Navigator would take carbon dioxide emitted from ethanol and chemical fertilizer plants and transport it to a destination in Illinois where it would be dehydrated and buried deep underground.

More:Dakota Access pipeline was justified in using eminent domain Iowa Supreme Court rules

But how necessary is that? Until now CO2 has been released into the air from ethanol plants but that was downplayed as a problem. ""It calls out the lie that ethanol is clean energy"" quips Ed Fallon of Bold Iowa a nonprofit opposing the project. And if the emissions really weren’t troubling then would we embrace something classified as a ""hazardous project"" — much less want it running under our properties?

At an informational meeting in Ames this month Elizabeth Burns-Thompson Texas-based Navigator's vice president of public affairs said Iowa needs a pipeline because its geology isn't suited to burying the carbon dioxide here. The pipeline would run 1300 miles more than 800 of those in Iowa which she said represents a $3 billion investment $1.6 million of which would stay here generating 5000 jobs.

Burns-Thompson who described herself as a “farm kid from here in Iowa” said the project is of value to the agricultural community. ""This is your land. Treating it with utmost respect is our top priority"" she said of Navigator and project partners Valero Energy Corp. and BlackRock Global Energy & Power. ""The facility could reduce its carbon intensity score by 50%"" she said.

Carbon pipeline projects rely on significant tax incentives

As she acknowledged a key driver of such pipeline projects is taking advantage of federal government tax incentives. The tax benefit colloquially referred to as 45Q offers $50 per ton of permanently sequestered CO2 or $35 if it's used for enhanced oil recovery another option. Ultimately Navigator hopes to store and store 15 million tons.

But using public tax dollars for fossil fuel production isn't quite what some environmentalists have in mind. ""It's a false climate solution"" says Carolyn Raffensperger of Ames an environmental lawyer and executive director of the national Science and Environmental Health Network. She shared a report compiled by environmental historian Peter Montague of seven failed carbon capture projects in the U.S. and one in Canada. Significantly Archer Daniels Midland had one of them.

""Archer Daniels Midland does not appear to share federal officials’ enthusiasm for carbon capture and storage"" says the report which noted that a company feasibility study for cutting its corporate greenhouse gas emissions 25% didn't even include carbon capture and sequestration. The company wrote in 2020 that ""the ability to capture stack emissions and sequester them is likely 10 years out.""

Montague added: ""Nevertheless in early 2022 ADM announced that it was partnering with Wolf Carbon Solutions to develop a pipeline to carry away carbon dioxide from ADM’s facilities in Clinton and Cedar Rapids Iowa"" (emphasis mine). ""The pipeline will have a reported capacity of 12 million tons of liquified carbon dioxide per year far more than ADM alone would need.""

More:What we know about two carbon capture pipelines proposed in Iowa

Concerns are many including 'prolonging the fossil fuel era'

Some opponents say such measures would either help forestall real changes to our carbon footprint or soon become obsolete as electric cars gain favor and ethanol is no longer needed to fuel them. The Center for International Environmental Law says ""Until now carbon capture and storage (CCS) have been primarily used to 'keep the coal industry alive'"" and to benefit gas and oil interests.

A researcher for the center argues that the practice ""masks the harmful carbon emissions from the underlying source enabling that source to continue operating"" generates additional risks and costs from pipelines and ""exacerbates global warming by boosting oil production and prolonging the fossil fuel era.""

Jessica Mazour conservation coordinator at the Iowa Sierra Club says that for every ton of CO2 that's sequestered 1.2 to 1.4 tons would be generated from the extraction of fossil fuels. She calls it ""greenwashing"" a “false climate solution when we should be investing in solar wind battery storage conservation and efficiency.""

There are also concerns over conflicts of interests in Iowa's process for approving such projects. Former Gov. Terry Branstad a Republican has a financial interest in pipelines as a policy adviser for Summit Carbon Solutions. Branstad also appointed when he was governor two of the three Iowa Utilities Board members who would vote on approval. The third was appointed by Gov. Kim Reynolds who was Branstad's lieutenant governor before becoming governor.

Reynolds has also called for state investment in carbon capture solutions. On Radio Iowa she stressed state funding for Iowa State University to research how Iowa farmers could secure carbon credits for planting crops.

As it is says Raffensperger ""Iowa is the most ecologically damaged state in the union."" Yet its public universities get money to do research that benefits companies. ""Where is the funding for university research that will solve the climate problem?""

Branstad has tried to discredit the Sierra Club for its opposition to these pipelines. He signed a letter sent to people in about a third of Iowa counties asking them to support the Summit pipeline and to not be ""intimidated” by the Sierra Club: “They are not your friends and will be long gone after they have destroyed the ethanol industry and the value of your corn-producing land.”

Then there's a secrecy element. Bruce Rastetter CEO of Summit Agricultural Group Summit's parent company has asked the Iowa Utilities Board to not publicly release the names of landowners along the routes for their privacy and because that could help Summit's competitors. But the Iowa attorney general's consumer advocate sought the release of the names saying landowners who oppose the project should be able to mount a joint defense.

Opponents come from varying backgrounds and they're organized

Steve Higgenbottom a Wapello County landowner already felt burned by the Dakota Access Pipeline running through his property. Now his land stands in the path of another pipeline project. The last time crews dug 30 feet down to install the pipeline and put terraces above it but the terraces settled and now he has drainage problems ""football fields away from the pipeline."" He said the company won't return to fix the problems; he estimated it would take $100000. He calls this plan ""pie in the sky.""

To date 15 county boards of supervisors have voted to oppose eminent domain use to access people's lands according to Mazour.

The risk of a pipeline rupture and carbon dioxide leak is also a concern. It happened in 2020 in the small Mississippi community of Satartia. In The Huffington Post journalist Dan Zegart reported on two dozen people being ""overcome within a few minutes collapsing in their homes; at a fishing camp on the nearby Yazoo River; in their vehicles. Cars just shut off since they need oxygen to burn fuel. Drivers scrambled out of their paralyzed vehicles but were so disoriented that they just wandered around in the dark.""

In Satartia residents at least had a warning says Raffensperger because hydrogen sulfide which smells was mixed in with the CO2 which doesn't. If that concentrate were released in Iowa and mixed with water from a stream it would acidify the liquid making it undrinkable she said.

If there's hopeful news here it's that this time more people are paying attention. The Sierra Club is partnering with eight other nonprofits to organize a diverse group of opponents some 650 of whom meet weekly Mazour says. ""We've been told we're supposed to hate each other"" she said of the urban and rural Democratic and Republican cross-section ""but we actually have quite a bit in common. We care deeply about the land.""

Raffensperger who has read hundreds of comments submitted to the utilities board from affected parties sees an extraordinarily powerful story of landowners working with environmentalists for future generations. ""This conversation is fundamentally different than anything I've seen in Iowa"" she said.

Could that be enough to beat back the big money and powerful forces at play?

""Money is the second strongest driver in politics"" said Fallon a former Iowa legislator. The only one greater force he said ""is votes.""

The Campaign for Greater Buffalo History Architecture & Culture relied on historical documents and drone photographs and video of the grain elevator to develop the design drawings which are part of a package of materials it will present on Monday in its argument for a state Appellate Division preliminary injunction to forestall the demolition.

“It is solid. It is better built than City Hall. It’s probably more rigorously put together with higher quality and certainly greater-dimensioned steel than some of our larger buildings of the '20s through the '70s” said Tim Tielman executive director of the Campaign for Greater Buffalo History Architecture and Culture. “I mean it’s Titanic. The other innovative thing about it that we hope the drawings convey is that the steel bins themselves are part and parcel of the structure of this elevator. Everything is riveted and bolted together. It’s one solid mass.”

Exterior bricks that collapsed to the ground on the north wall of the grain elevator following a Dec. 11 windstorm are simply cladding with their own separate foundation that’s not tied to the main structure Tielman said.

James Comerford Buffalo’s commissioner of permits and inspections cited safety concerns in issuing an emergency demolition order to Archer Daniels Midland the corporation that owns the structure that was designated as a historic landmark by the city in 1990.

Great Northern supporters call for independent evaluation of historic grain elevator Supporters of the Great Northern grain elevator who rallied Thursday at City Hall cast doubt on an engineering report by Archer Daniels Midland justifying the demolition of the locally designated historic structure.

Preservationists won a temporary restraining order Jan. 14 to prevent ADM from immediately tearing the structure down. The group is seeking a preliminary injunction in the State Appellate Division for longer term protection of the landmark at 250 Ganson St. south of Michigan Avenue along the City Ship Canal.

At a State Supreme Court hearing Jan. 3 Comerford said drone footage of the grain elevator showed evidence of corrugated metal flapping on the cupola and bowing on the river side of the building. ADM which bought the building in 1993 and has sought to demolish it on three previous occasions also presented an engineering report indicating that the vacant structure posed a safety hazard to workers at its flour mill next door.

Preservationists said the engineering report is inaccurate and the building does not pose a safety risk.

Tielman and architect Paul McDonnell a former chairman of the Buffalo Preservation Board relied on photographs of the grain elevator under construction and historical diagrams of the six principal types of support columns in developing the CAD schematic.

The model shows 20 pairs of central columns supporting a network of five-foot steel I-beam rafters and in combination with 6000 pilings into the bedrock the columns are able to absorb massive amounts of weight and wind loads.

Great Northern grain elevator case renews calls for local landmark reforms A measure to be introduced in the Common Council calls for scheduled building inspections of all 144 local landmarks.

“The brick jacket that’s on there OK it has a hole in it. Fix it” Tielman said. “It doesn’t affect the structure one iota.”",,,,,,

However that account does have a $250 minimum to open the account and ATM reimbursements are limited to $8 per month.

On top of the checking account options Axos Bank offers a no-fee high-yield savings account that pays a high 0.61% APY on balances of less than $25000 along with a high-yield money market account paying a 0.25% APY on all balances.

Citibank (Citigold)

If you have accumulated significant assets as you approach or enter retirement a premium banking package from a full-service international institution might be what you need. If that’s the case the Citigold account from Citibank might tick all the boxes for you. Although the account requires a minimum of $200000 on deposit with Citi most of your accounts and services will be free. For example you won’t pay any monthly maintenance fees or fees for wire transfers and you’ll receive unlimited rebates on ATM fees. You’ll also pay $0 for online trades of stock and ETFs.

Sallie Mae Bank

Sometimes the best way to maximize your Social Security and retirement income is to simply earn the highest available yields. On top of your monthly Social Security check earning high regular dividends from savings accounts and CDs might be all that you need to cover your retirement expenses. If you find yourself in this category Sallie Mae Bank may be the answer. The bank’s no-fee SmartyPig savings account pays a very high 0.70% rate on balances of up to $10000 with a still-good 0.45% APY on higher balances. The bank’s 12-month CD rate is also among the highest available currently at a 0.60% APY. If you can keep your retirement nest egg in these types of investments you’ll earn some of the highest rates available on savings and CD accounts. As the Fed is anticipated to raise interest rates in 2022 you can expect those rates to go higher as well.

Consumers Credit Union

Consumers Credit Union is a bit under the radar but it offers an exceptional checking account yield for those willing to jump through a few hoops. The credit union’s Rewards Checking account pays a whopping 4.09% APY if you meet some banking requirements specifically:

Make at least 12 debit card purchases per month

Receive monthly direct deposits of at least $500

Spend $1000 monthly in CCU credit card transactions

You can still earn a 3.09% APY if you only make $500 in credit card transactions monthly or a 2.09% APY if you make no credit card transactions at all. These are very high rates for a checking account and can help boost your retirement income significantly on your free cash. Additionally this checking account has no fees and offers unlimited rebates of all ATM fees. All in all the account offers extremely high yields and no fees the perfect combination for maximizing savings and protecting funds in retirement.

Decoding Arthur J. Gallagher & Co (AJG): A Strategic SWOT Insight

Strengths

Robust Brokerage Segment: AJG's brokerage segment is a cornerstone of its financial stability consistently generating the majority of the company's revenue. This strength is underpinned by a diverse client base ranging from middle-market entities to individuals and a wide array of insurance products. The segment's success is driven by AJG's ability to negotiate favorable terms with insurance companies reflecting its strong market position and negotiation leverage.

Strategic Acquisitions: AJG has a proven track record of successful acquisitions such as Willis Re Buck and Cadence Insurance which have expanded its service offerings and geographic footprint. These strategic moves not only enhance AJG's revenue streams but also provide cross-selling opportunities and access to new markets contributing to the company's growth and competitive advantage.

Financial Performance: The company's financial health is solid with the latest 10-Q filing indicating a healthy balance sheet. AJG's revenue and net income figures underscore its financial resilience and operational efficiency which are critical in maintaining investor confidence and supporting strategic initiatives.

Weaknesses

Integration Risks: While AJG's acquisition strategy is a strength it also poses integration risks. The assimilation of large acquisitions requires significant resources and management attention and there is always the potential for unforeseen liabilities such as cybersecurity issues or compliance violations. These risks could lead to financial strain and distract from core business operations.

Dependence on Economic Conditions: AJG's performance is closely tied to global economic conditions. Factors such as high inflation increased interest rates and geopolitical instability can impact the insurance industry's risk-taking capacity and client demand for AJG's services. Economic downturns could lead to reduced revenues and pressure on profit margins.

""Le gouvernement du Mali à la suite d'une séance de travail avec une délégation mauritanienne a décidé d'ouvrir une enquête transparente et diligente dont les résultats seront partagés avec la partie mauritanienne"" a annoncé dans un communiqué Abdoulaye Maïga le ministre de l'Administration territoriale et de la Décentralisation.

Selon des médias mauritaniens les victimes sont des éleveurs qui se rendaient au Mali pour y rejoindre leur troupeau en quête de pâturage.

""Le gouvernement décline toute responsabilité et souligne qu'à ce stade aucun élément ne met en cause"" l'armée malienne a souligné M. Maïga assurant que ""toutes les mesures seront prises pour arrêter et traduire en justice les auteurs de ces actes tragiques"".



La présidence mauritanienne avait annoncé vendredi dans un communiqué l'envoi d'une délégation à Bamako pour ""faire la lumière"" sur la mort de ces Mauritaniens.

Cette décision faisait suite à une manifestation organisée le même jour à Nouakchott la capitale par des habitants du département de Adel Bégrou (1.100 km à l'ouest de Nouakchott) localité d'origine des victimes à la frontière avec le Mali.

Les manifestants voulaient ainsi appeler le gouvernement à assurer la sécurité des citoyens et à faire la lumière sur cette affaire.

Cet incident coïncide avec la tentative des autorités maliennes de la transition d'obtenir le soutien de la Mauritanie pour briser l’embargo de la Communauté économique des Etats de l'Afrique de l'Ouest (Cédéao).

Une délégation conduite par le ministre des Affaires étrangères Abdoulaye Diop a achevé mardi une visite en Mauritanie.

""Face à l'adversité à laquelle notre pays fait face le gouvernement trouve troublante la survenue de cet incident"" a ajouté le communiqué.

La Cédéao et l’Union économique et monétaire ouest-africaine (Uémoa) ont pris une batterie de mesures économiques et diplomatiques à l'encontre du Mali pour sanctionner les velléités de la junte de se maintenir au pouvoir encore plusieurs années.

La fermeture des frontières mais aussi un embargo sur les échanges commerciaux et les transactions financières hors produits de première nécessité sanctionnent l'engagement révoqué par les colonels d'organiser le 27 février des élections présidentielle et législatives qui auraient ramené des civils à la tête du pays plongé dans une grave crise sécuritaire et politique.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxhZGVwZWNoZS5mci8yMDIyLzAxLzIyL2FsdmEtZGVzc2luLXBlaW50dXJlLWpldW5lcy11bmUtc2VjdGlvbi1hLWRlY291dnJpci0xMDA2MTgyMi5waHDSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Valence-d'Agen. Alva dessin-peinture jeunes une section à découvrir,"L’animatrice Dominique après un beau dévouement et du beau travail durant des années pour animer la section dessin-peinture jeunes de l’Amicale laïque a souhaité arrêter pour suivre une autre voie. Le conseil d’administration de l’Alva s’est donc mis en quête d’une nouvelle personne qui au final n’est pas si inconnue que cela des artistes amicalistes. Sylvie Allard a repris l’animation de cette section début janvier. Elle était déjà intervenue il y a une quinzaine d’années assurant des cours du soir pour les adultes avant d’être contrainte d’arrêter par manque de temps. Diplômée d’une licence en arts plastiques à Bordeaux et passée par l’école des beaux-arts de Troyes elle exerce depuis cette matière dans l’enseignement public.

Libre imagination

C’est donc une animatrice expérimentée qui prend le relais avec gentillesse et un grand sourire. Elle propose des thèmes de travail dont on peut s’échapper et laisse l’imagination de ses jeunes adhérents vagabonder. Sylvie précise : ""Mon but est d’essayer de leur donner des bases techniques. Cela commence par le dessin pour aller plus loin en coloriant peignant… Aujourd’hui nous essayons de faire des trompe-l’œil en jouant sur les dégradés les nuances.""

Ambiance cool

On vient dans cette section dessin-peinture pour découvrir se perfectionner ou simplement par amour. Emma 13 ans explique : ""Je peins un peu à la maison j’aimerais apprendre l’aquarelle."" Iola 9 ans : ""J’ai toujours aimé dessiner je voudrais apprendre la peinture."" Lou 11 ans quatre ans d’adhésion : ""J’aime dessiner et peindre je trouve que l’on n’en fait pas assez à l’école."". Séléna à 12 ans fait figure de vétéran de la section : ""Comme maman et papa je dessine. J’aime aussi peindre. Nous avons plus de liberté qu’à l’école."" Tous sont d’accord sur un point : l’ambiance est plus cool qu’à l’école !

Pour adhérer. On peut encore les rejoindre essayer découvrir. Les cours sont donnés à l’ancien collège Gipoulou (en montant les marches à gauche) le jeudi de 17 h 30 à 19 heures le vendredi de 17 heures à 18 h 30 et de 18 h 30 à 20 heures.

L'occasion de retrouver la capitaine des services médicaux d'urgence Tommy Vega incarnée par Gina Torres. L'actrice est une habituée des séries car on a également pu la voir tenir des rôles majeurs dans des programmes célèbres tels qu'Alias ou encore Suits. Mais Gina Torres n'hésite pas à apparaître sur grand écran quand l'occasion se présente. Elle a notamment joué dans les deux derniers volets de la mythique trilogie de science-fiction Matrix. Un film dans lequel elle a rencontré celui qui allait devenir son mari pendant plusieurs années Laurence Fishburne.

C'est sur le tournage de Matrix Reloaded en 2001 que les regards des deux acteurs se sont croisés. Un véritable coup de foudre qu'ils ont rapidement souhaité concrétiser car les deux tourtereaux s'étaient mariés en 2002. Le couple a ensuite accueilli une petite fille en 2007 prénommée Delilah.

Mais après 15 ans de mariage leur relation avait finalement pris fin. En effet en septembre 2017 les deux stars avaient annoncé leur séparation. ""C'est le cœur lourd que Laurence et moi avons décidé de mettre fin à notre mariage à l'au­tomne dernier"" confessait Gina Torres précisant qu'elle restait tout de même en bons termes avec son ex-mari. Quelques mois avant Gina Torres avait d'ailleurs été photographiée dans les rues de Los Angeles en train d'embrasser un autre homme que Laurence Fishburne. On pouvait également la voir en train de déjeuner avec son nouveau chéri sans son alliance.

Revealed on Threads Gunn told fans to ""get ready"" for the July 11 2025 premiere date while fully revealing Corenswet's Superman. The image shows him sitting in what's presumably a Metropolis skyscraper very casually pulling up his boot while an earth shattering event takes places outside.

While this is a fresh new Superman from a fresh new DC Universe the suit itself doesn't appear particularly new as the sacred S symbol and its arms appear dirtied or faded. Though we'd already been shown the logo the new image reveals the rest of the suit and gives fans plenty more to analyze as they try to figure out Gunn's influences ahead of the film's release.

Superman previously Superman: Legacy will be the first film in the rebooted DCU's Chapter 1: Gods and Monsters but it's definitely not an origin story and also features a ton of other DC heroes and villains.

Alongside Corenswet's Superman stands Rachel Brosnahan's Lois Lane and the film also stars Nathan Fillion as Green Lantern Edi Gathegi as Mister Terrific Isabela Merced as Hawkgirl Anthony Carrigan as Metamorpho María Gabriela as The Engineer and more. Gunn confirmed these actors will play the roles in other DCU projects too.

Chapter 1 of the DCU also features TV shows and while the exact contents have shuffled a tad since Gunn and co-CEO Peter Safran announced it in 2023 an animated series called Creature Commandos will officially kick off the new universe in late 2024.

Open Extended Reactions

CINCINNATI -- Bengals quarterback Joe Burrow marked a major offseason milestone on Monday.

As the team started the second phase of voluntary workouts Burrow was in uniform and throwing a pass in a video shared by the team.

The Bengals were closed to the media on Monday. But quarterbacks coach Brad Kragthorpe told the team's website he was pleased with how Burrow looked in his first practice back since suffering a season-ending wrist surgery last November.

""He looked like the Joe Burrow we're used to seeing"" Kragthorpe said. ""I didn't see any difference. I thought the ball came out of his hand well. Confidently. I'm happy where he's at.""

HE IS SO BACK. pic.twitter.com/ZsZjzkZEmg — Cincinnati Bengals (@Bengals) May 6 2024

On Nov. 27 Dr. Thomas Graham repaired the scapholunate ligament in Burrow's right wrist a source confirmed to ESPN following an initial report by the Cincinnati Enquirer. In March Burrow told ESPN that he expected to be fully cleared following his surgery. He noted that the timetable for his return if he remained on track was no different than other offseasons.

""In a normal offseason I wouldn't be throwing until OTAs really anyway"" Burrow said. ""I can lift basically normal now which I'm excited about.""

Burrow missed the final seven games of last season after he suffered the wrist injury in a Week 11 loss to the Baltimore Ravens. It capped an injury-riddled year that started with a strained right calf that he suffered during the first week of training camp in 2023 and re-aggravated in Week 2.

The Bengals were closed to the media on Monday as they started Phase 2 of their offseason program.

The nonprofit’s ReStore is undertaking a big new endeavor both literally and figuratively.

The organization announced it has landed a lease to take over the old JCPenney building at 2080 Greeley Mall. The Greeley location was one of more than 154 stores including one in Fort Collins that were shuttered in the summer of 2020. Since its closing the building has sat empty.

“One of our former board members is a retired commercial broker so we kind of set him out on search about two years ago” said Cheri Witt-Brown executive director of Greeley-Weld Habitat for Humanity. “We frankly have been looking ever since I became the Habitat executive director since 2016.”

Habitat tried to purchase the building where it is currently located at 2400 29th St. and at one point Witt-Brown and the organization had a contract drawn up. But when the pandemic hit everything closed down and the offer was taken off of the table.

“The owner of that building decided they didn’t want to sell portions of the building they wanted to sell the whole thing” Witt-Brown said. “We were getting so worried because we knew that eventually that building would be sold which it did.”

After looking at another location in the mall the management company offered the old JCPenney spot to the organization which Witt-Brown and ReStore Director Lew Sevestre were happy to jump on.

The new location will give the store 10000 square feet of space to display items collect donations and house inventory.

The department store left all of its merchandise shelving and racks which will be used in helping set up the new store with unneeded pieces being sold or recycled Sevestre said.

Customers will also have more check stands to purchase items at with updated computer registers that can log inventory and donated items immediately after they have been dropped off and checked in.

“As soon as an item is sold it will come off of our inventory” Sevestre said.

Though the organization isn’t looking to do major remodeling to the space they have removed some of the walls to open up the area and are removing the old carpet and tile. The flooring will be replaced with polished cement which will allow for durability and ease of care. Sevestre said they also installed a new LED lighting system.

The organization received $19000 from a local lighting company for the LED lighting. For the flooring a local flooring contractor contributed more than $7000. Both helped the nonprofit complete the upgrades without having to dip into its savings.

“Again it’s generous community partners like that that really helps us make this all possible” Witt-Brown said.

The old hair salon will be transformed into administrative offices and a play area for children of parents getting assistance services.

The move to the mall will allow the organization to consolidate all of its staff to the new location which is the first time in 34 years that everyone has been housed under one roof.

Leanna’s Closet a separate nonprofit that has been sharing a spot in the ReStore will also make the move. The nonprofit provides professional clothing for women in need who are working or are applying for work.

The added space and prime location will continue to help the organization increase its revenue which has seen substantial increases over the past six years Witt-Brown said. Revenue helps cover administrative overhead costs and reinvest profit back into the organization.

“We hired Lew 4 1/2 years ago and he just turned our store around” Witt-Brown said. “We went from maybe $400000 maybe $500000 sales on a good year to almost a $1 million store.

“He was second in the nation for overall sales growth back in 2018 which is a lot because there are 1300 affiliates across the nation.”

The new location is expected host soft openings by the end of February with the grand opening set for Saturday March 5. Until then customers can continue to shop or drop off donations at the store’s current location.

Beth Wallis Bio Recent Stories

Researchers at the University of Oklahoma were awarded $1.7 million from the U.S. Department of Energy to repurpose abandoned oil and gas wells for providing geothermal energy.

The grant will allow the researchers to evaluate and demonstrate the viability of geothermal energy production from four hydrocarbon wells. The proposed project plans to use the energy to heat nearby Tuttle Public Schools.

The project’s principal investigator Saeed Salehi said the idea to upcycle the old wells is a cost-efficient way to use infrastructure already in place.

“After you have produced oil and gas from those reservoirs and they are toward the end of their life then instead of retiring those assets [we] completely repurpose them to help the community with their energy needs” Salehi said.

Salehi said because the water is being circulated from the ground and injected back into the ground it’s completely renewable.

The project is still in its infancy and Salehi said the team must first come up with a proof-of-concept before getting started on field work. Though it could be at least three years before the project is put into use Salehi hopes this novel idea will catch the attention of energy companies and put Oklahoma on the map for another form of renewable energy.

“The vision we have is to make Oklahoma the [geothermal energy capital] of the world. Because we have the resources we have these wells we have this fossil fuel industry active here” Salehi said. “And everybody’s talking about renewable energy and reducing the carbon footprint — there you go.”

Experts discuss the regulation of bank overdraft fees.

Font Size: A A A

Did you know that you can require your bank to decline a transaction instead of charging an overdraft fee?

If not you are not alone—in a recent study 70 percent of Americans who were charged overdraft fees did not know they had the right to have their bank decline the transaction instead of charging them a fee.

In 2010 rulemakers amended Regulation E to require financial institutions to provide notice to consumers and have them opt-in to overdraft fees. But some advocates believe this regulation does not go far enough to protect consumers from predatory banking practices associated with overdraft fees.

Large banks such as Capital One and Bank of America recently decided to end or greatly reduce the use of these fees despite making an average of $15 billion a year in overdraft fees. Some commentators say this shift comes on the heels of increased interest in regulating these types of fees at the federal level.

The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) for example has stated its intention to intervene in overdraft practices to restore proper competition. CFPB director Rohit Chopra expressed concerns that banks depend on overdraft fees in their profit model rather than compete for the best services and interest rates which has bad outcomes for consumers.

U.S. Senators Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) and Cory Booker (D-N.J.) introduced the Stop Overdraft Profiteering Act of 2021 last August to regulate profits from overdraft fees in the United States. They drafted the act in response to growing concerns about predatory banking practices which predominantly impact low-income communities.

According to the CFPB 80 percent of revenue from overdraft fees comes from just 9 percent of customers who are charged 10 or more times a year for spending above their balance. So low-income individuals pay three times as much to maintain their checking accounts.

In this week’s Saturday Seminar experts discuss recent scholarship on the regulation of overdraft fees.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiLWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lmtyb2xsLmNvbS9lbi9vdXItdGVhbS9jb3JleS1ibGVpbNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Corey Bleil | Corporate Finance and Restructuring,"Prior to joining Kroll Corey served as Co-Head of Transaction Opinions at Alvarez & Marsal.

James A. Iannazzo 48 was charged with intimidation based on bigotry or bias breach of peace and criminal trespass according to a police report. He had confronted store employees using a number of expletives threw a drink at one and made comments towards another referencing her immigration status according to an arrest report from the Fairfield Police Department.

Iannazzo who started his career at Merrill as a client associate in 1995 according to his former company webpage has been fired over the incident a spokesperson for the Bank of America subsidiary confirmed.

“Our company does not tolerate behavior of this kind” the spokesman said in a statement. “We immediately investigated and have taken action. This individual is no longer employed at our firm.”

Iannazzo’s lawyer Frank J. Riccio II in Connecticut said the broker “wholeheartedly regrets” the incident. He had returned to the shop after he was upset that his son had a severe allergic reaction to a smoothie that contained peanuts and had to be taken to the hospital.

“When faced with a dire situation for his son Mr. Iannazzo’s parental instinct kicked in and he acted out of anger and fear” Riccio wrote. “He is not a racist individual and deeply regrets his statements and actions during a moment of extreme emotional stress.”

“I will be extending my apologies personally to the Robek’s organization particularly the staff that was working there that night” Iannazzo said in statement provided later on Sunday by his spokesperson.

The interaction was captured in a since-deleted video that was uploaded to Tiktok and received millions of views and responses noting his status as a managing director at Merrill. (A copy of the minute-long video in which he appears to call an employee an “immigrant loser” is available on Twitter here [Warning: Explicit].)

Fairfield police said that the shop’s employees recalled Iannazzo requesting the smoothie without peanut butter but not mentioning an allergy. Iannazzo said in the statement he had advised them of the allergy.



“I was out of my mind with fear for him when I returned to Robek’s and I wish I had not done so” Iannazzo said. “I also wish they had been more careful preparing my son’s beverage.”

Iannazzo was a perennial figure on industry top broker rankings including five years in a row as one of Barron’s Top 1200 advisors by state. He managed $469 million in assets according to Forbes which ranked him #24 in Connecticut in 2021.

He is scheduled to appear in court on February 7 according to the police department’s release.

Iannazzo’s Financial Industry Regulatory Authority BrokerCheck report shows one disclosure event a customer complaint from 2015 over unauthorized trading that was denied by the firm.

The incident is another blemish on an industry that has struggled for years with its inability to grow its ranks of women and minority advisors. Merrill itself has been on a push to train and promote more diverse candidates as a “ commercial imperative ” executives have said.

LPL Financial in August cut ties with a former broker in Texas after a video purporting to show her telling employees she would not interview Black job candidates went viral on Tiktok according to media reports.

The broker said in a statement that the video was “false and defamatory” and that she and her staff had been subjected to threats after its circulation.

Raymond James Financial in June 2020 fired an employee after a confrontation over a Black Lives Matter sign in San Francisco.

With the exception of the Santa Barbara Oil Spill Bank of America burning and riots of the early ’70s Halloween in Isla Vista and the mass murder of 2014 — UCSB seldom attracts headlines. Hence universal outrage over Henry Yang’s proposed 4500-person windowless dorm is a new chapter for the campus by the sea. Or is it?

During the late 1960s after the Oil Spill and shortly before rioters burned the Bank of America then-chancellor Vernon Cheadle proposed a grand entrance to the campus to accommodate increased future enrollment to 25000 students and a projected daily vehicle count of 38000. Like Yang his interest centered in part on the fact that money for the project came from outside the university.

Billionaire Charles Munger is offering $200 million for “Dormzilla” conditional that it meets his windowless specifications. In Cheadle’s case the State Division of Highways appropriated over $40 million to extend Ward Memorial Boulevard (State Route 217) through Goleta Slough paralleling the campus and creating a new entrance. Cheadle and Yang are on a similar page a half-century apart.

Cheadle’s slough freeway and Yang’s Dormzilla differ in that the former elicited a sustained organized response from UCSB faculty. Apart from a change.org petition from the UCSB Architectural Historians Group there is no organized faculty response to Munger’s windowless edifice. In 1969 faculty formed the Campus Organization for a Pure Environment (COPE) to investigate Cheadle’s plan and propose alternatives to a freeway in the slough. A faculty poll showed 75 percent opposed the project. COPE reported to the Academic Senate and worked alongside Students for Environmental Defense Sierra Club and the Audubon Society to “Save our Slough.”

UCSB’s Academic Senate is tasked with ensuring the quality of instruction research and public service at the university — part of “shared governance” with the administration. Does building a 4500-person windowless dormitory contribute to the quality of instruction at UCSB? COPE’s sensible environmentally responsible alternative to filling in a wetland to build a freeway inspired the campus to “stand against ‘creeping civilization’” and avoid the “construction of urbanization that plagues UCLA and USC.” Their plan saved Goleta Slough and provided a blueprint for the further restoration we enjoy today thereby contributing immeasurably to the beauty and sustainability of UCSB. By planting Dormzilla and its adjoining infrastructure on the banks of Goleta Slough Yang is undoing their work damaging the wetland and eschewing UCSB’s environmentalist tradition.

In 1969 the Academic Senate’s’ multidisciplinary committee of 21 faculty recommended a “careful and thorough restudy of all the alternate routes for freeway entrances to UCSB.” Signors included ecologists Walter B. Muller Joseph E. Connell and William W. Murdoch environmental historian Roderick Nash historians of science and technology Lawrence Badash and Carroll Pursell and pioneering Native Americanist Wilbur R. Jacobs to name a few. Geographer Norman Sanders led the faculty initiative. The Academic Senate has the power to address the chancellor and the regents “in any matter pertaining to the conduct and welfare of the University.” Is the current Academic Senate so cowed by Henry Yang that they cannot take a position on enrollment? On Dormzilla?

We live in turbulent times but certainly no less so than in 1969 when UCSB’s faculty defined a new environmental movement that reverberated around the globe. To his credit Vernon Cheadle withdrew his plan for a freeway in the slough. He then faced down a chancellor’s nightmare. Riots the bank burning and the (still unsolved) murder of Dover O. Sharp damaged UCSB’s reputation to the point where increased enrollment ceased to be a major concern. Cheadle persevered but it would be years before UCSB mended its image and ties with the surrounding community.

Cheadle’s impetus for a wetland freeway was that it appeared in the 1955 Long-Range Development Plan. Likewise Yang and his administrator toadies embrace Munger’s monstrosity because the Long-Range Development Plan calls for housing 25000 students by 2025. In 1969 UCSB’s faculty joined students and environmental groups in telling Vernon Cheadle “No” while at the same time providing an alternative plan — enhance existing roads and restore and preserve the wetland.

Today’s faculty can play an identical role in telling Henry Yang “No build humane sensible housing” and meanwhile “cut enrollment.” UCSB is defined by its incomparable beauty and tradition of environmentalism — do not let Yang take that away. UCSB revised its plan in 1969 and it can do the same in 2022. It is time the Academic Senate took action."

So what are they waiting for? People there keep telling me they need asset prices of merger partners to “normalize” aka fall enough so Goldman remains in control of the combined company.

Well we’re starting to see some “normal.”

A look at the asset prices of potential partners — PNC Bank US Bancorp State Street BNY Mellon some mid-sized asset managers and even potentially brokerage firm Charles Schwab & Co. — are starting to come back to earth as the Fed begins raising interest rates.

Another factor that might force CEO David Solomon’s hand are the obvious holes in Goldman’s business model. Goldman has a long and storied rep killing it in M&A and trading.

Tough competition

But it’s tough having only two horses in the race competing against banking behemoths like JPMorgan. Sure Goldman wasn’t the only bank to experience a hiccup because of trading volatility and higher expenses (the vaunted JPM did as well). But JPM has a big balance sheet far larger than the size of Goldman’s and JPM CEO Jamie Dimon can paper over surprises such as rapid and unexpected increases in compensation costs which bedeviled Solomon in the fourth quarter of 2021 and possibly into 2022.

That’s why Goldman’s earnings miss last week has the Wall Street rumor mill spinning again.

Solomon also knows that if you’re Goldman the merger has got to be the right one or else the CEO will go down in infamy as having evaporated one of the world’s greatest corporate brands.

And this is where it gets tricky. As for potential partners Schwab — the world’s most prestigious discount broker — would be an obvious choice. Schwab’s business involves registered investment advisers selling high-end financial products to rich people which complements Goldman’s own very high-end wealth-management business.

But Schwab’s price in Goldmanese hasn’t been normalized enough. The San Francisco-based Schwab has a market value of $168 billion compared to Goldman’s $115 billion. Charles Schwab’s ego — and yes the company’s 84-year-old founder namesake and chairman is still around — won’t let him sell out a bunch of traders in New York if he doesn’t have to.

Both PNC and US Bancorp have lower market caps than Goldman and they would be attractive particularly in a high-interest-rate environment the Fed has signaled; banks make a lot of money when rates rise.

But like Schwab neither has to do a deal. The monetary-policy environment favors their business model over Goldman’s.

Asset managers that might be available — think T. Rowe Price — would get Solly around $1.5 trillion in assets and entry into the lucrative mutual-fund business.

Ask yourself though: Why ­haven’t there been more marriages between fund companies and Wall Street? Answer: Combining those cultures is a little like trying to get Hillary Clinton to play nice with Donald Trump.

With all these variables to weigh the conventional wisdom among bankers is that Goldman isn’t rushing to do anything. Solomon is doing a great job; he’s beat earnings expectations seven times before the recent fourth-quarter 2021 miss. Some analysts say his stock looks cheap compared to competitors like Morgan Stanley but Goldman has the edge in market prowess.

That’s one way to look at it; another way is the reason why Morgan Stanley beat fourth-quarter expectations: It has a huge wealth-management business that stabilized and papered over a trading slowdown.

Again Solomon and his people are smart. They know they have to do a deal and the right one at the right time.

Sensible ‘Fink think’

Larry Fink’s annual letter to CEOs is always must-read material this year even more so because he added a fair amount of common sense to the relentless push by the Biden administration and corporate America to adopt green-energy policies.

Fink the CEO of BlackRock is no stranger to this effort. He’s used his clout as chief of the world’s largest money-management firm ($9 trillion in assets) to prod companies to adopt policies that he believes will transition the country and the world to what’s known as “net zero” carbon admissions.

With that came criticism from conservatives and this column since BlackRock alumni fill the Biden White House. Yes green energy sounds good in practice and Teslas are very popular in Beverly Hills but working-class Americans can’t afford electric cars. Higher oil and gas prices are tax increases on Middle America.

Fink didn’t back off his embrace of green energy. But in the letter he also pointed out how this movement is being hijacked by environmental zealots.

He advocated for a transition that takes into account that “any plan that focuses solely on limiting supply and fails to address demand for hydrocarbons will drive up energy prices for those who can least afford it resulting in greater polarization around climate change and eroding progress.”

Let’s hope his friends in the Biden administration are listening.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMioAFodHRwczovL3JpYWJpei5jb20vYS8yMDIyLzEvMjIvZ2Vvd2VhbHRoLXJhaXNlcy0xOS1taWxsaW9uLXRvLW91dC10ZWNoLW9yaW9uLXNlaS1hc3NldG1hcmstYW5kLWVudmVzdG5ldC1vbi1yaWEtb3V0c291cmNpbmctYnV0LXRoZW4tZ29lcy1hZnRlci10aGVpci10YWxlbnQtdG9v0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,GeoWealth raises $19 Million to out-tech Orion SEI AssetMark and Envestnet on RIA outsourcing but then goes after ...,"Bill Crager is dropping CEO role after multiple shoes dropped; the company insists it was his 'decision' but vision Yodlee future uncertain

If your mother enjoys the outdoors and appreciates the delicate beauty of birds what better gift is there than a bird bath? More specifically a solar-powered bird bath fountain. It only needs a little bit of sun exposure before it begins blasting water into the air giving all of your flying friends a chance to wash off that sky dust.

(For even more ideas check out our roundups of the best Mother's Day gifts for every budget and the best last-minute Mother's Day gifts to shop now.)

Why is this a good deal? 💰

At over 30% off this matches the best price we've seen this year. It's also one of the most affordable options on all of Amazon with most other fountains starting at $17 and going up from there.

Why do I need this? 🤔

Running water makes for an attractive feature in any space and this fountain pump will spray water high into the air using nothing but solar power. You don't need to plug it in anywhere; just place it in the bird bath and after about three seconds it will begin spraying water. It doesn't store energy so it may be somewhat less effective on cloudy days.

There are also six different nozzles that you can swap out for different water patterns so you can mix things up from time to time. If you keep it in the middle of a properly-sized bird bath you won't lose a lot of water over the sides. It will minimize the amount of refilling you have to do. That said you should clean it every so often to prevent the pump lines from clogging — the company suggests doing so at least once a week.

Splish splash they were takin' a bath! Mom will enjoy the feathered fun this bird bath will bring to her garden. (Amazon)

What reviewers say 💬

With over 7900 five-star reviews a lot of fans have added this touch of whimsy to their birdbath.

Pros 👍

Despite concerns over sun exposure fans say this fountain works well even with indirect light. ""I have a bird bath with a shallow basin and only 1/2 day of direct sunlight. My concern was that I did not want to have stagnant water that could attract mosquitoes. This solar fountain pump works great. It even works at lower capacity using only reflected light when the bird bath is in a shadowy part of the day.""

Another bird-watcher said ""This little thing is beautiful. It aerates the water and the birds love it.""

It isn't limited just to bird baths either. ""I bought it for my neighbor's koi pond but he put it in his pool. It sprays water about 3 feet in the air. He loves it.""

Cons 👎

One fan said it can be a little noisy. ""I love them! I have one in my front and back garden. Only downside is they make a sputtering noise when they’re not in full sun.""

Another shopper warned that it might actually be too powerful. ""I found that they have too much power for my small birdbath. I put a half-inch square of electrical tape over one of the solar collectors and wait and watch. If the spray is too strong I put another piece on. it usually takes three pieces.""

But the Holburne Museum in Bath is staging a groundbreaking exhibition called Henry Moore in Miniature a collection of the great artist’s works that could fit into the palm of the hand.

The museum’s director Chris Stephens said its relatively small spaces meant one of the themes of its programme was to showcase the intimate in art – and the retrospective of mini Moores met the brief perfectly.

He said visitors to the exhibition which opened on Friday would be able to imagine Moore industriously working away in his studio finding new shapes and textures.

“The exhibition serves as a reminder that sculpture is as much an art of the hand – in its making and appreciation – as of the eye. An object may be small in size but large in scale” he said.

The show billed as the first of its kind features sculptures in stone wood terracotta plaster lead bronze and Plasticine and takes in themes recurrent in Moore’s work: the reclining female figure mother and child the human head the fallen warrior. It has works from every decade of his career from the 1920s to the 1980s.

The first piece the visitor encounters is a mother and child from the 1920s modelled in Plasticine which pleasingly was invented at the end of the 19th century by a teacher at Bath Academy of Art William Harbutt. It sits next to a small animal head made of boxwood in 1921.

Another intriguing display features of a pair of mother-and-childs from the 1930s modelled in plaster and cast in lead which Moore melted in saucepans on a kitchen stove. Stephens said the lead gave the pieces a “poisonous” air which perhaps reflected political times as the world headed towards war.

Seen in public for the first time is a collection of small terracotta heads that Moore modelled while planning two carved heads for a church at Much Hadham in Hertfordshire in the 1950s.

Stephens said: “These reflect his interest in classical traditions tribal masks and perhaps the graffiti carved into walls in Paris captured by the photographer Brassaï.” Moore’s fingerprints and tool marks are clearly visible in the heads.

The final displays are maquettes for yet more mother and child sculptures dating from the late 1970s and early 1980s and a cabinet of found objects from his studio that Moore worked with – bones flints stones.

Presented in partnership with the Henry Moore Foundation the exhibition features more than 60 works gathered in one room on the top floor of the museum. Moore’s daughter Mary Moore said she was delighted these smaller pieces would be seen.

She said: “An enormous amount of Henry Moore’s work – particularly the starting point for his universally familiar large-scale sculpture – began with his modelling with his turning moulding and forming in the palm of his hands.”

By way of contrast a second show that opened at the Holburne on Friday stars a very different artist – Sam Cox better known as Mr Doodle who has almost 3 million followers on Instagram sells his work for hundreds of thousands of pounds a time and has covered every inch of his Kent home with his intricate patterns.

Mr Doodle! Museum Mayhem is the first UK museum exhibition of his work with the Holburne allowing Doodle to take over parts of the building and daub it with his “graffiti spaghetti” of black ink on white background.

He has also been given the go-ahead to replace some of its pieces with his own work. For example John Constable’s Flatford Lock from the Bridge (circa 1814-17) has been replaced with Doodle House from the Gates (2024).

Doodle studied illustration at UWE Bristol and used to bring a suitcase of his work to Bath to try to barter for a meal or a drink. “That was mostly unsuccessful” he said. “It’s cool to come back and do something grander.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMihgFodHRwczovL3d3dy5tYXJrZXR3YXRjaC5jb20vc3RvcnkvYmVkLWJhdGgtYmV5b25kcy1uZXctcGFyZW50LWNvbXBhbnktc2F5cy1pdHMtc3RpbGwtd29ya2luZy1vbi13aW5uaW5nLWJhY2stcmVwZWF0LWN1c3RvbWVycy0xZDZhYmRhM9IBigFodHRwczovL3d3dy5tYXJrZXR3YXRjaC5jb20vYW1wL3N0b3J5L2JlZC1iYXRoLWJleW9uZHMtbmV3LXBhcmVudC1jb21wYW55LXNheXMtaXRzLXN0aWxsLXdvcmtpbmctb24td2lubmluZy1iYWNrLXJlcGVhdC1jdXN0b21lcnMtMWQ2YWJkYTM?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Bed Bath & Beyond’s new parent company working on winning back repeat customers,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 401 Client Error: HTTP Forbidden for url: https://www.marketwatch.com/story/bed-bath-beyonds-new-parent-company-says-its-still-working-on-winning-back-repeat-customers-1d6abda3 on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMihgFodHRwczovL3d3dy5tYXJrZXR3YXRjaC5jb20vc3RvcnkvYmVkLWJhdGgtYmV5b25kcy1uZXctcGFyZW50LWNvbXBhbnktc2F5cy1pdHMtc3RpbGwtd29ya2luZy1vbi13aW5uaW5nLWJhY2stcmVwZWF0LWN1c3RvbWVycy0xZDZhYmRhM9IBigFodHRwczovL3d3dy5tYXJrZXR3YXRjaC5jb20vYW1wL3N0b3J5L2JlZC1iYXRoLWJleW9uZHMtbmV3LXBhcmVudC1jb21wYW55LXNheXMtaXRzLXN0aWxsLXdvcmtpbmctb24td2lubmluZy1iYWNrLXJlcGVhdC1jdXN0b21lcnMtMWQ2YWJkYTM?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmdyZWF0YW5kaHJhLmNvbS9tb3ZpZXMvbmV3cy9kaWQtc2FtYW50aGEtcG9zdC1hLWJhdGhpbmctcGljLWFzLWhlci1pc3RhLXN0b3J5LTEzNzcwNNIBYWh0dHBzOi8vbW9iaS5ncmVhdGFuZGhyYS5jb20vYXJ0aWNsZS9kaWQtc2FtYW50aGEtcG9zdC1hLWJhdGhpbmctcGljLWFzLWhlci1pc3RhLXN0b3J5LzEzNzcwNC9hbXA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Did Samantha Post a 'bathing' pic as her Ista Story?..,"Samantha's ""Insta Story"" photos have gone viral online.

Previously many people reported that their vaccination status on the app was not correct or not updated. As boosters shots begin to roll out the newest dose has trouble showing up on the app even though medical staff have entered data into the system.

Some people said that even though they had receive three COVID-19 vaccine shots none appear on the app which is frequently required to enter events and buildings.

The new feature is therefore a response to the need of the people said the app developer.

The app now also includes a ‘paper wallet’ which will save photos of an individual’s COVID-related documents including the vaccination certificate test result recovery certificate and travel permits.

The app developer also said that with these new features people don’t have to physically have their paperwork with them all the time and the app also now addresses the issue where vaccination facilities have yet to update the correct information of the vaccinated people.

It is noted that the self-declaration is for reference only and the users are solely responsible for the information they provide.

BRK-B,Berkshire Hathaway,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiP2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZ0LmNvbS9jb250ZW50LzQyYmI2NjM5LTc5YTAtNDhkYS05ZjIxLTAxZjMzZTczNzBmOdIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Warren Buffett closes in on Cathie Wood as tech stocks tumble,"Print this page

Simply sign up to the US equities myFT Digest -- delivered directly to your inbox.

Cathie Wood’s flagship Ark fund is on the cusp of being overtaken by Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway in the post-pandemic performance table reflecting a dramatic shift in fortunes between the two prominent investors.

Ark Invest’s Innovation exchange traded fund — known by its stock market ticker ARKK — smashed most of its competitors in 2020 thanks to Wood’s aggressive bets on high-growth disruptive companies like carmaker Tesla. That attracted billions of dollars from investors lifting Ark Invest’s overall assets to a peak of $61bn early last year and helped make Wood the face of the bull run.

However many of Wood’s biggest bets started sagging last year and have this year tumbled further in a violent pivot towards cheaper stocks in often less glamorous old-fashioned or otherwise out-of-favour industries.

Meanwhile Berkshire Hathaway’s shares have continued to climb steadily narrowing the performance gap between Buffett’s investment conglomerate and the Ark Innovation ETF since the start of 2020 to just 8 percentage points.

The relative performance of the two fund managers has been particularly stark this month with Berkshire’s stock climbing around 2 per cent since the start of January even as Ark’s biggest ETF has slid 24 per cent. ARKK has now tumbled 43 per cent from the beginning of 2021 to Friday’s close while Berkshire Hathaway is up 34 per cent.

Wood’s Ark Invest ETF and Berkshire Hathaway are often seen as prime examples of two very different investment styles — growth and value respectively. The reversal of their share prices reflects a jarring rotation between the two tribes in recent years.

The start of 2022 has been particularly tough for often-unprofitable technology growth stocks favoured by Wood and buoyant for the steadier equities that are the hallmark of Buffett’s investing style. The power of the shift has raised eyebrows across markets and triggered speculation that a new market environment is looming.

“Does the violence of [the] rotation suggest regime change is upon us and a sustained reversal in the performance of growth versus value is under way?” Wellington Management’s analyst team mused in a recent note.

Growth investors look for companies that may not be profitable but are expanding rapidly often found in hot sectors like technology. Value investors are more price-sensitive and often look for bargains in dowdier or beaten-up industries — such as energy and banking recently.

The improving economic growth outlook and central banks shifting to a more hawkish position on inflation — led by the US Federal Reserve —have been the primary triggers for the investor rotation from growth to value. Value stocks are typically found in sectors that benefit from stronger growth and higher interest rates while the allure of growth stocks dims somewhat in such environments analysts say.

Many fund managers surveyed by Bank of America expect this shift to continue with a net 50 per cent of those asked in January predicting that value would continue to outperform growth — near a record high.

“With the Fed pivoting on towards tightening it is possible for rates to move higher with some persistence” Lisa Shalett chief investment officer at Morgan Stanley Wealth Management said in a note. “That would signal that the value-to-growth rotation we have been observing has some legs in 2022.”

The reason why certain stocks are priced so high is usually due to the company having never or rarely having completed a stock split.

There are many ways to evaluate a stock in addition to its absolute share price. Here we take a look at some of the largest companies in the U.S. and abroad.

Key Takeaways Companies are typically valued by their total market capitalization on a stock exchange or number of shares outstanding times the share price.

Still many investors are interested in the most pricey shares available on an exchange which can indicate exclusivity.

Companies can also be ranked by revenue and profitability.

Top Companies by Stock Price

The most expensive publicly traded share of all time is Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.A) which was trading at $458675 per share as of January 2022. Berkshire hit an all-time high on Jan. 18 2022 at $487255. Thanks to spectacular shareholder gains and the idiosyncrasies of its founder this share value is unlikely to be matched by anything other than continued gains in Berkshire’s share price.

The next company behind Berkshire in terms of nominal share price is NVR (NVR) at $5154.98 per share as of January 2022. Then there is the Seaboard Corporation (SEB) which was trading at $3731.02 and Amazon.com (AMZN) at $2852.86 followed by Alphabet Inc (GOOG) at $2607.03 a share.

Top Companies by Market Cap

By market capitalization as of January 2022 Apple (AAPL) is the biggest company at $2.652 trillion followed by Microsoft (MSFT) at $2.222 trillion Google (GOOGL) at $1.725 trillion Amazon.com (AMZN) at $1.446 trillion Tesla (TSLA) at $947.92 billion and Meta (META) formerly Facebook at $843.34 billion.

Back in 2007 Chinese energy giant PetroChina (PTR) reached an estimated market value of around $1 trillion. However this valuation didn't stick. As of January 2022 PTR's market capitalization stood at just $146.95 billion.

Top Companies by Revenue

In terms of the biggest global companies by revenue Walmart (WMT) comes in as number one—according to the Fortune 500 list. Walmart's revenues were $523964 billion in 2021. Behind Walmart was State Grid with $383906 billion in revenues followed by Amazon with $280522 billion and China National Petroleum at $379130 billion.

Sinopec Group ranks fifth with $407009 billion in annual revenues and the sixth and seventh spots are covered by Apple and CVS Health with $260174 billion and $256776 billion in yearly revenues respectively.

Based on only U.S.-headquartered companies' 2020 performance Walmart still has the top spot while Amazon comes in second. Exxon Mobil ranks third and Apple ranks fourth. Healthcare companies take up the fifth seventh and eighth spots: CVS UnitedHealth Group and McKesson generating $256.78 billion $242.15 billion and $231.05 billion respectively.

Berkshire Hathaway ranks sixth with $254.62 billion in annual revenues and the ninth and tenth spots are covered by AT&T and AmerisourceBergen at $181.19 billion and $179.59 billion in yearly revenues respectively.

Based on only U.S.-headquartered companies' 2019 performance Walmart still has the top spot while ExxonMobil (XOM) comes in second with $290.21 billion a year in revenues. Apple ranks third with $265.59 billion and Berkshire Hathaway fourth with $247.84 billion. Healthcare companies take up the sixth through eighth spots: UnitedHealth Group McKesson and CVS generating $226.25 billion $214.32 billion and $194.58 billion respectively.

Top Private Companies

In terms of private companies Forbes ranks Minnesota-based Cargill as the largest private U.S. company with $134.4 billion in annual revenues. The company has 155000 employees. Second is Koch Industries with $115 billion in revenues and 122000 employees. Ranking third is the grocery chain Publix Super Markets with $44.9 billion in annual revenue and 227000 employees.

The fourth and fifth largest private companies are Mars and H-E-B which generate $40 billion and $32.8 billion respectively. Each employs over 100000 employees.

The Bottom Line

On a pure market value measure Apple has often been considered the most valuable publicly traded company of all time. Although Microsoft did briefly hit the $2 trillion market cap mark in June 2021. It is certainly possible another company’s market cap will exceed these measures and maybe—though less likely—another company will surpass Berkshire Hathaway as the highest priced single stock share.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMigwFodHRwczovL21hcmtldHMuYnVzaW5lc3NpbnNpZGVyLmNvbS9uZXdzL3N0b2Nrcy93YXJyZW4tYnVmZmV0dC1mZWRlcmFsLXJlc2VydmUtaW50ZXJlc3QtcmF0ZXMtZ3Jhdml0eS1hc3NldC1wcmljZXMtdmFsdWF0aW9uLTIwMjItMdIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Warren Buffett Compared Interest Rates to Gravity in Valuing Assets,"The Federal Reserve is poised to hike interest rates in a bid to curb inflation this year.

The Federal Reserve is widely expected to combat soaring inflation by hiking interest rates this year. Higher rates have enormous implications for investors; Warren Buffett has repeatedly underlined their vital role in valuing stocks businesses and other assets.

The billionaire stock-picker and Berkshire Hathaway CEO has compared interest rates to gravity as they represent the risk-free rate of return available to investors and therefore affect the relative value of other assets. Higher rates also make borrowing more expensive discouraging leveraged bets.

Buffett has recommended ignoring any predictions about the future direction of rates and asserted that prudent long-term investors don't need to guess where rates will go next.

Here are Buffett's 8 best quotes about interest rates:

1. ""Interest rates are to asset prices like gravity is to the apple. They power everything in the economic universe."" (2013)

Advertisement

2. ""Interest rates are like gravity in valuations. If interest rates are nothing values can be almost infinite. If interest rates are extremely high that's a huge gravitational pull on values."" (2016)

3. ""There's nobody whose predictions on interest rates I would pay attention to even myself even Charlie."" (2018)

4. ""It's the same thing as predicting what business is going to do what the stock market is going to do. I can't do any of those things. But that doesn't mean I can't do well investing over time."" (Buffett was explaining that he has no idea what interest rates will be in the future.) (2020)

5. ""The value of every business the value of a farm the value of an apartment the value of any economic asset is 100% sensitive to interest rates. The higher interest rates are the less that present value is going to be. Every business whether it's Coca-Cola or Gillette or Wells Fargo — its intrinsic valuation is 100% sensitive to interest rates."" (1994)

6. ""The most important item over time in valuation is obviously interest rates. Low interest rates make any stream of earnings from investments worth more money. Any investment is worth all the cash you're going to get out between now and Judgment Day discounted back. Well the discounting back is affected by which interest rates you use."" (2017)

7. ""If I could only pick one statistic to ask you about the future before I gave the answer I would not ask you about GDP growth. I would not ask you about who was going to be president or a million other things. I would ask you what the interest rate is going to be over the next 20 years on average."" (Buffett was asked at what rate Berkshire would compound its intrinsic value over the next 10 years.) (2017)

8. ""I would say that's the most important question in the world. And I don't know the answer."" — (Buffett was responding to a question about the impact of negative US interest rates on financial markets) (2020)

He's a billionaire a world-famous investor and a well-known financial expert who has provided a wealth of financial advice.

While Buffett has many investing tips that are worth paying attention to seeing as he's amassed a fortune through strategic investments he has some other financial tips as well. Specifically Buffett has recommended a particular type of home mortgage for people looking to buy a property of their own. Here's what it is.

This is Buffett's preferred mortgage option

Buffett believes homeownership is a solid investment for individuals and families who intend to remain in the same place for many years. And the investing expert has indicated that one big reason homeownership is such a good investment is because of the 30-year mortgage.

Buffett has called the 30-year mortgage loan the ""best instrument in the world because if you’re wrong and rates go to 2 percent which I don’t think they will you pay it off"" he said. ""It’s a one-way renegotiation. I mean it is an incredibly attractive instrument for the homeowner and you’ve got a one-way bet.""

Essentially this means a 30-year mortgage works out well for homeowners because they get a low-rate loan while the bank assumes the risk of rising interest rates. And if interest rates do happen to fall further homeowners can simply refinance into a new loan with an even lower rate and pay off their existing debt. On the other hand if rates go up they can keep paying at the low rate they obtained (assuming they got a fixed-rate loan) and their principal and interest payments won't become more expensive over time.

Buffett himself obtained a 30-year mortgage when he bought his Laguna Beach vacation house in 1971 and he said he borrowed most of the $150000 price tag and only had about $30000 of equity in it.

Here's why Buffett's right about the best type of mortgage

Buffett's advice on mortgages is spot on. As he pointed out mortgage rates are affordable debt that’s easy for borrowers to renegotiate if they need to.

But there's an even better reason to opt for a 30-year loan besides the fact that doing so puts all the risk of rising rates on the lender: You can do other things with your money while borrowing the bulk of the cost of your home from the bank.

As Buffett explained he only put down a small amount of money on his home because he ""thought I could probably do better with the money than have it be an all-equity purchase of the house."" He ended up buying shares of Berkshire Hathaway with it which are now worth $750 million.

While the typical homeowner will likely not make anywhere near this much on their investments the same rule still stands. Buyers can likely earn a better return by taking out a 30-year mortgage to cover most of their home's cost and then investing any extra money they might have put down on the home (or they might have paid in larger monthly payments had they opted for a shorter loan term).

If you're buying your own property consider following Buffett's advice making a reasonable down payment on your house and opting for a 30-year loan that leaves you with plenty of cash for other investments.

A historic opportunity to potentially save thousands on your mortgage

Chances are interest rates won't stay put at multi-decade lows for much longer. That's why taking action today is crucial whether you're wanting to refinance and cut your mortgage payment or you're ready to pull the trigger on a new home purchase.

Our expert recommends this company to find a low rate - and in fact he used them himself to refi (twice!).

Initially enrolled in the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania in 1946 and later completed his higher education course at the University of Nebraska.

He later proceeded to Columbia Business School where he developed his business philosophy around value investing. As such his educational experience aligns with his career choice because he developed an interest in business at a young age. His educational experience provides a solid fundamental structure for the strategic decisions he makes during investment. For instance his ability to assess and evaluate firms before investment partly stems from his educational experience. He can use assessment tools such as SWOT and Porter’s five forces analysis among other tools to assess the value of firms before buying their shares leading to smart and effective investment decisions.

Based on this interest in business he analyzed existing businesses leading to core value investment values that have brought him success over the years. He bought his first shares from the Cities Service when he was 11 years. The stock price was 38 per piece at the time. His experience from this investment exposed him to America’s business environment. From the moment onset he developed core investment values that have been influencing his business decisions to date.

Firstly he observed that investors should buy stock in companies that demonstrate solid fundamentals. Correspondingly he observed that people should invest in firms that demonstrate reliable and sustainable growth potential over an extended period. A company’s outcomes within a short duration cannot be controlled and may not reflect its true value. As such the focus of the evaluation is whether the firm can hold its value in the long term and deliver financial success to investors within that period. He also believes that people should invest in companies that demonstrate strong potential for sustained growth over the years. Again this attribute cannot be assessed in the short-term period but is based on past performances over extended periods.

Business Philosophy and Investment Strategy

Warren Buffett’s business philosophy is one of the important outcomes of his interest in the business. His interest in business drove him to analyze America’s businesses and other businesses across the world. Based on this analysis he adopted a value investing business philosophy. Value investing involves buying stocks that trade for less than their intrinsic value.

The intrinsic value of stocks includes an objective value contained in the stocks and is often undermined in the market value of such stocks. Various methods can be used to assess the intrinsic value of shares. These evaluation methods use residual income discounted cash flows and dividend streams to arrive at the intrinsic values of the stock. Using his sound business knowledge and skills obtained from his educational preparation and experience Buffett is able to pick stocks whose market values are less than their intrinsic values or underestimated in the stock market.

Because the market overreacts to events and news the stocks of companies with significant growth and revenue potentials are often under-valued. For instance the market value for a company’s stock is likely to plunge following the news of the exit of its long-term CEO. Correspondingly the market value of several companies’ stock reduced significantly from the onset of the COVD-19 outbreak following the adverse impacts of the pandemic on businesses. Therefore people tend to overreact to news about companies in ways that do not reflect the market value of their stocks realistically

As part of his investment strategy Warren Buffett picks companies with a stock whose market values are undermined in the stock market. Such companies have significant financial potential when assessed based on their history and ability to turn things around in the long term. Buffett realized that people tend to overreact to bad or good news in ways that affect the market value for stock (Chirkova 2012). However such market values do not reflect the true potentials of companies.

In time the stock would regain its accurate market value. Based on Buffett’s analysis of the American business environment he concluded that no company truly ever dies. Some of the negative financial projections about firms and their performances are circumstantial and do not reflect their long-term potentials for growth and profitability. As such Buffett has always invested in companies whose stock are under-exterminated in the market but has immense intrinsic value. Working with this investment philosophy Buffett has always generated significant returns from his investments over the years making him a great investor.

Warren Buffett’s investment strategy has significant support from studies. For instance a study conducted by Chan Jegadeesh and Lakonishok (1995) found that investment in stocks with low price-to-book multiplier generates significant returns in the long run than stocks with a high price-to-book multiplier. According to Caj (1997) stocks with low price-to-book outperforms glamour stocks by 6% to 12% per year for five years after the formation of the portfolio.

A study conducted between 1975 and 1998 on British public companies confirms the above observation. The study indicates that value investing yields a higher return on investment than investment in glamour stocks because it exploits investors’ mistakes and tendency to overreact to information about companies (Lakonishok Shleifer & Vishny 1994). Value investments are not riskier as perpetuated in the stock investment discourse as long as companies are objectively evaluated based on their long-term potentials and financial histories. Buffett understood this fact and modelled his investment philosophy around it leading to his successful investment decisions over the years.

Investing Style

Warren Buffett’s investment style is partly responsible for his investment success over the years. His investment style includes four tenets including business decisions management decisions financial measures and value-related decisions.

His business decisions include the type of businesses he considers for investment. To meet his eligibility criteria for investment Buffett only focuses on businesses he can analyze in a straightforward manner. Such businesses must have clear and non-ambiguous operational philosophy that can be used to assess their history and predict their performances. These criteria protected Buffett from the financial losses that many investors incurred during the dot-com bubble in the early 2000s. The bubble was facilitated by the unprecedented market rise amidst increased speculation regarding high technology-related stocks. Buffett is one of the few investors who did not buy technology-related stocks because most technologies were new and unproven.

The management tenet of his investment style focuses on whether companies strive to optimize shareholder values. He analyzes companies he is interested in to determine whether they tend to re-invest part of their profits or distribute them to shareholders. He favours the distribution of profits to shareholders or the maximization of shareholder values. He also evaluates companies with great potential based on their transparency. He understands that business operations may not be easy or straightforward. However how companies bounce from temporary setbacks matters a lot to Buffett.

Correspondingly the ability of companies to demonstrate transparency is critical for developing shareholders’ trust. Lack of transparency can lead to significant financial losses for investors. Enron Corporation is a case in point where financial statements were manipulated to create a perception of a financially healthy organization. Because of this manipulation many investors bought the company’s stock. However they incurred significant losses in the long run because the market value of the stocks could not match the company’s financial potential.

Buffett avoids this mistake by evaluating firms based on their ability to demonstrate transparency even when they incur losses or mistakes in the course of their operations. Lastly Buffett focuses on firms that make strategic innovative decisions as part of their strategies for overcoming business challenges and adjusting to their environments. Innovative companies demonstrate that they can withstand shifts in their business environments and remain relevant for extended periods. Because value investing focuses on the long-term potential of firms innovative companies are safe or less risky considering that they can survive for extended periods through innovation.

His tenets on financial measurement focus on profit margins and economic value-added profits. By assessing a company’s profit margin Buffett is interested in companies with low operational costs and high profits. By keeping their operational costs low such companies offer safety against potential financial losses. Secondly Buffett evaluates companies based on their financial health following value-added calculations. This calculation reveals a company’s profit after shareholders’ stake is distributed. In other words it calculates a company’s profits minus the initial cost of acquiring capital from investors. The relevance of this calculation is to assess whether companies can sustain high-level shareholder values for an extended period giving investors a significant return on investments.

Lastly value tenets focus on a company’s intrinsic value. The intrinsic value of stocks involves an objective assessment of the value contained in the stocks that are undermined in their market values. Various methods are used to assess the intrinsic value of shares. These evaluation methods use residual income discounted cash flows and dividend streams to arrive at the intrinsic values of stock. As observed above stocks with low price-to-book generate significant returns in the long run than glamour stock (Chan Jegadeesh & Lakonishok 1995). These business tenets help Buffett to make effective investment decisions.

Conclusion

Buffett’s investment success stems from his interest in business and core business values business philosophy and investment strategy and a secure investing style. From a young age Buffett demonstrated an interest in business a characteristic that set the foundation for his investment orientation career choice purposive education and core values. Warren Buffett’s business philosophy is one of the important outcomes of his interest in the business. Warren Buffett’s investment style is partly responsible for his investment success over the years.

Yeah it's unimaginable to us too as relic-like as those mythical ""before the Internet"" days. When it comes to summertime grilling now there are a wealth of options. In beef alone you can choose from different fat levels; various cuts; grass- or grain-fed; onions and cheese in the blend—the list goes on and on. Then there's chicken salmon bison plant-based options and of course the gateway meat to this whole burger revolution: the turkey burger.

Invented by Cornell Corporation Board Member Robert C. Baker whose other contributions toward modern-day staples include chicken nuggets (can you believe these didn't exist until 1963?!) turkey has become a go-to first step for those looking to take a healthier approach to their all-American diets. In fact it was such a popular move that between 2015 and 2017 demand and consumption increased by 20% in limited-service restaurants!

Now whether this is actually a healthier swap comes down to the patties you buy. Nutritionally side by side the turkey burger's profile isn't too far off from beef's—part of what's made it such a natural swap. Sure you sacrifice a little protein iron and zinc from the red meat choice but you get more B vitamins for energy metabolism fewer calories per average serving in most cases and less saturated fat.

That said turkey burgers are a smart choice if you have a hard time processing red meat or prefer the taste of poultry and—most importantly—want to bring home the good stuff. And this taste test is how we can help you do the latter.

We selected five widely available national brand all-white-meat varieties of simply seasoned low-fat frozen turkey patties and grilled them simultaneously on a countertop George Foreman grill. All were cook-from-frozen types for convenience and we tried them first plain and hot then with simple classic burger toppings like American cheese ketchup lettuce tomato and sliced red onion on multigrain rolls to see how they played with others.

Without further ado let's talk some real turkey. And for more be sure to check out: 22 Meals to Melt Belly Fat in 2022.

Applegate Organics Organic Turkey Burger

Humanely raised certified organic non-GMO Whole30-approved and vegetarian-fed this salt- gluten- and casein-free turkey burger had a lot of fancy claims on the box. Plus it had the least amount of calories per four-ounce serving. All of that added up to the most expensive per patty of the bunch.

First off the box wasn't recloseable which was an immediate detractor and neither was the inner bag sealed. Not ideal! The dark pink patties were frozen between sheets of paper wraps and bore a striking similarity to the ""pink sludge"" its popular cousin the nugget was made of. But we all know appearances can be deceiving so we threw it on the grill to which it promptly stuck.

Cooked the hue went from mauve to dark gray like imposter meat. It also became intensely tough to cut through. ""This is a rubbery pancake"" remarked one tester of the dense patty an impression that wasn't helped by its bland flavor and a weird artificial aftertaste that followed every chew. With toppings a turkey-er flavor emerged but a very gamey rendition that felt uncomfortable.

Overall we recommend budgeting your hard-earned dollars and caloric limits toward any of our other selections as this fell incredibly short of the rest of the competition.

Butterball All-Natural Turkey Burgers 93% Lean

6254a4d1642c605c54bf1cab17d50f1e

Fortunately the ""bad"" burg streak ended right here because it was all gravy baby starting with this iconic brand's basic recipe.

Butterball is the brand leader in retail sales and after testing this burger we don't begrudge this ranking one bit. The white meat-only lean turkey patties boast no nitrates nitrites gluten or artificial ingredients. All they're made of is ground turkey sea salt and some other natural flavors which we're suspecting may include celery—a common preservative in ""cleaner"" processed meat products—based on the little peek-a-boo of flavor we got from our first bite.

The patties come in two four-packs formed in perfect but disarmingly white rounds. These also stuck a bit to the grill but didn't lose too much moisture through the breaks. In fact the burgers stayed very juicy. These were the most general ""poultry""-tasting burger starting out with the light flavor of ground white meat chicken and ending with a turkey one. Between bread and under some veggies it was a neutral vehicle for all its accouterments. Only lightly salted this is a rather clean choice that will please any palate and serves as a great base to build upon.

Jennie-O Turkey Burgers



For those who feel that one burger is never quite enough and two may be too much these ⅓-pound patties might just be their Goldilocks. The fact that the burgers are individually wrapped and sealed is also a huge plus; you're not committed to opening and eating more than you absolutely need.

Aside from weight adding to their heftier feel is the fact that they're very dense—not overly so like the Applegate but enough that it feels substantial necessitating more chew. The burgers do start off juicy when right off the grill but get drier faster than expected which was good in that it forced us to slow down.

These tasted more like straight-up white meat turkey accented with little bursts of salt flecked through it. Although they were full-bodied and meaty they weren't gamey finishing without any lingering aftertaste. Additionally they were more than willing to take a back seat to play well with others when turned into a burger remaining remarkably sturdy for toppings and standing up well to them.

Butterball Farm to Family All Natural Turkey Burgers

This new-to-the-lineup is the upgrade to the turkey giant's standard burger. They're made with all-white meat accented only with sea salt and disclose rosemary extract instead of just ""natural flavoring."" They're also enclosed in two easy-open four-packs which is always a bonus. You'll notice the bright white meat has visible air pockets that indicate that it was more lightly pressed and therefore wouldn't be tough.

This assumption proved to be true. The burgers offered a moist bite every time with great texture that crumbled in your mouth but not on the grill or before you started chewing. The overall flavor was once more closer to chicken than turkey but distinguished itself with a more assertive saltiness. The meat itself was more neutral however with no gaminess at all. Nor did it leave any remaining shadows of turkey flavor to hang around and get sour in your mouth as can sometimes happen with turkey. It became an immediately satiating sandwich that was seasoned just enough to hold its own against toppings and a bun without being forceful with its character.

Turkey Bubba Burger

Even without the claim of being ""juicier than ever"" being announced on the box we expected it to be so since it has the advantage of having 3% more fat than its competitors. And it was! And we say this with much surprise and delight since the outside of these irregularly-formed amoeba-shaped burgers developed a grill mark-friendly crust sooner than the others. Because of this we thought it'd reach well-done status too quickly but these rosy-pink patties were protected by a thick meaty density that kept the centers from losing too much liquid.

They were full-flavored and robust. Plus the thick heavy construction of the patties just invited us to pile on the toppings. What really set these apart is that they finished off with a sweetness that pleasantly persisted even after the bite was gone with a richness that wasn't found in the other turkey burgers. For a toothsome texture balanced flavor and overall satisfying turkey burger that will feel like an option and not a sacrifice this is the one to pick.

There's no way around it – laptops are expensive especially if you need powerful hardware. So if you’re looking to save some cash to make your ROI easier to obtain the HP Pavilion 15 is a great option. This mid-range laptop has a respectable amount of power while keeping the price at an approachable level. The low cost means you have less of an initial outlay to make back but because it doesn’t exactly feature the fastest GPU just be sure to keep realistic expectations on potential earnings.

With so much competition in the television space nowadays every company is incentivized to elevate its game. In short the parity between each brand is about equal — unless the company is Sony which continues to put out some of the best TVs on the market. Sony sent one of its newest releases the X90J 4K BRAVIA Television to SPY for review. We put it through its paces and had plenty to say about it.

Sony X90J 4K BRAVIA Television Review: What We Liked

The X90J is a part of the brand’s beloved BRAVIA line of units and functions as a kind of entry-level Sony television. Price-wise it’s undoubtedly in the upper portion of 4K TVs but in the lower echelon of units the brand produces. Nevertheless there are still plenty of fantastic features included in the television even for what’s considered “low-end” by Sony standards.

Setup of the X90J is pretty standard to most modern TV sets; once you remove the box and place it in your space accordingly you’ll walk through a series of prompts to connect it to the Internet and install your various connected apps. The unit leverages Google TV as its built-in interface making Sony one of the only companies to use the software. As far as an operating system goes Google TV works pretty well allowing you to customize a handful of shortcuts for your favorite applications while leveraging voice control through the included remote. The home screen can be a little cluttered but it was a breeze to navigate once I pinned my favorite apps.

As for the picture quality of the unit the image is a beauty. Sony leverages full-array local dimming (portions of the screener are lit independently which results in a much more accurate and overall better contrast) which dramatically improves the overall look. The resulting picture is richly textured with deep blacks and vivid colors that are great for all kinds of media — but especially when it comes to gaming. The unit is designed to work hand-in-glove with the Sony PlayStation 5 as there’s a dedicated 120 Hz HDMI 2.1 input that allows a 4K input at this speed (i.e. 4K output at 120 frames per second). Granted this is assuming you’ve been able to get your hands on a PS5 to begin with but it does elevate your gaming experience with the console if you have one; testing the X90J with my PS5 by playing Ratchet & Clank: Rift Apart was frankly a transcendent gaming experience. Xbox Series X owners will also be able to take advantage of the increased 120 Hz making this TV extremely easy to recommend for next-generation gamers.

In fact everything about the X90J is meant to be as future-proof as possible thanks to those previously mentioned HDMI 2.1 ports. Basically if you need a 4K TV for next-generation gaming consoles and want a TV that will last as long as the console life of the PS5 and the Series X you’ll be in luck.

Sony X90J TV Review: What We Didn’t Like

As with most TVs nowadays the viewing angles on the X90J could stand to be improved. Again this issue isn’t Sony specific but worth flagging nonetheless. Additionally the space wherein I installed the unit encountered a noticeable amount of glare. Moving it helped a little bit but you might find it difficult to view the screen in decidedly bright spaces. In addition if you’re looking for a truly 100% future-proof TV then you might be tempted by an 8K display or premium OLED TV.

For other users we know that $1000 is the upper limit of your price range. The 55-inch model we tested is currently priced at $1098 via Amazon and other retailers; however you can find plenty of 4K smart TVs from Amazon Samsung Vizio and TCL in the 65-inch range for $500-$1000. Of course these TVs can’t compete with the picture quality of the X90J and Sony TV’s have a reputation for longevity that justifies the higher cost.

The Verdict: Sony’s X90J TV Justifies Its Price Tag

The X90J is a TV that’s decidedly built for now but not without losing sight of what the future may bring. Gamers in particular will get a lot of value out of the increased framerate abilities while those who love streaming shows will enjoy a vivid picture with stunning clarity. Those looking for an upgrade to their existing TV should start their search here before going elsewhere as the unit is well-suited to being a modern-day Swiss army knife capable of providing superlative performance in just about every category.

Where Can You Buy the X90J?

Sony’s LED BRAVIA TV is widely available and can be purchased at retailers like Amazon Walmart and Best Buy. Since this TV was originally released in 2021 all three retailers have discounted the price of the 55-inch model to $1099. However you can spend $100 and get the 65-inch version for just $1200 via Amazon right now. In addition if you want to save some money Best Buy has Open Box deals starting at about $900.

“I believe the decarbonizing of the global economy is going to create the greatest investment opportunity of our lifetime” Fink wrote. “It will also leave behind the companies that don’t adapt regardless of what industry they are in.”

The CEO of the world's largest asset manager framed the situation as a money-making opportunity: Companies who want to secure returns for decades to come would be wise to heed the call for decarbonization he stressed especially as shareholders regulators customers employees and others are increasingly pushing for climate action in the private sector as well as the public sector to mitigate effects of a warming planet.

“Few things will impact capital allocation decisions — and thereby the long-term value of your company — more than how effectively you navigate the global energy transition in the years ahead” Fink stated.

Fink's comments on the investment opportunity amid this shift echoed congressional testimony from Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen in October 2021.

“There is enormous interest in the financial community in making investments that will be profitable in sustainable investments” Yellen said “and what we want to do and we're working through [the government's Financial Stability Oversight Council] to do this is to make sure that investors have the kind of information that will enable them to make investment decisions that they want to make that are profitable.”

In the letter to CEOs Fink stressed that BlackRock focuses on sustainability ""not because we’re environmentalists but because we are capitalists and fiduciaries to our clients.""

Total assets under management at BlackRock surpassed $10 trillion in the fourth quarter. Fink's letter pointed out the ""tectonic shift"" in capital allocation toward sustainable assets.

As of Sept. 30 2021 BlackRock managed $509 billion in sustainable investments. At the same time the company continues to invest in new fossil fuel production — the leading cause of global warming.

'Shades of brown to shades of green'

Two notable moves in the past year exemplify BlackRock's ambivalence toward the role of oil and gas in the green energy transition.

In June BlackRock backed a winning campaign by activist investor Engine No. 1 to install three directors on Exxon Mobil (XOM)'s board to agitate for environmentally-minded changes. In December the company took a $15.5 billion stake in natural gas pipelines in Saudi Arabia.

Story continues

“Divesting from entire sectors — or simply passing carbon-intensive assets from public markets to private markets — will not get the world to net zero” Fink wrote. “And BlackRock does not pursue divestment from oil and gas companies as a policy.”

Divestment or the practice of refusing to own investments in certain companies or sectors has become a global movement to limit the expansion of new fossil fuel production since nearly all coal reserves as well as a majority of oil and gas reserves must remain in the ground to keep global temperatures within a safe range.

Around 1500 institutions have committed to divesting nearly $40 trillion from fossil fuels. Notable institutions that have announced plans for fossil fuel divestment include Harvard University the Ford Foundation New York City's public pension fund as well as that of the state of Maine.

According to BlackRock research unearthed by a DivestNY member divested funds did not experience negative financial impacts. Nevertheless the company is taking a more gradual approach.

""Because the global economy today is itself carbon intensive the portfolios of most diversified investors — including the portfolios of BlackRock’s clients in aggregate — remain carbon intensive"" BlackRock’s Global Executive Committee stated in a previous letter to clients. ""That cannot and will not change overnight and BlackRock’s aggregate portfolio will necessarily be subject to the investment decisions of our clients.""

In his letter Fink noted that global decarbonization ""is already uneven with different parts of the global economy moving at different speeds. It will not happen overnight. We need to pass through shades of brown to shades of green.""

According to data from As You Sow 7.23% of BlackRock's assets have long-term exposure to fossil fuel stocks totaling $148.26 billion across 329 funds. BlackRock also has 2.71% ($55.65 billion) of fund assets invested in carbon reserves 1.26% ($25.75 billion) invested in coal industry and 4.28% ($87.83 billion) invested in oil and gas.

The company offers 64 funds that received an ""A"" rating meaning they have no fossil fuel exposure.

There is ambivalence here as well: The concept of ESG-focused investments was called into question by Tariq Fancy the former head of sustainable investing at BlackRock who now runs an education technology nonprofit in early 2021.

“While leading the charge to incorporate environmental social and governance considerations into all of our $8.7 trillion of investment activities at BlackRock I started realizing that there’s not a lot of value at all in this data” Fancy said in an interview published by GreenBiz in April 2021. “Worse I also started to realize that all the stuff on 'stakeholder' capitalism was hollow marketing — it seemed almost intended to dupe the public into believing that we don’t need the overdue government regulation that we need immediately to address the climate crisis.”

Fink also stressed the need for governments to step up.

“Capitalism has the power to shape society and act as a powerful catalyst for change” Fink stated in his letter to CEOs. “But businesses can’t do this alone and they cannot be the climate police. That will not be a good outcome for society. We need governments to provide clear pathways and a consistent taxonomy for sustainability policy regulation and disclosure across markets. They must also support communities affected by the transition help catalyze capital for the emerging markets and invest in the innovation and technology that will be essential to decarbonizing the global economy.”

If all goes well Fink noted companies could create shareholder value by developing novel technologies for lowering emissions — in other words making money while also saving the world.

“The next 1000 unicorns won’t be search engines or social media companies they’ll be sustainable scalable innovators – startups that help the world decarbonize and make the energy transition affordable for all consumers” Fink wrote. “And it’s not just startups that can and will disrupt industries. Bold incumbents can and must do it too. Indeed many incumbents have an advantage in capital market knowledge and technical expertise on the global scale required for the disruption ahead.”

As my husband and I zipped down Interstate 10 heading from Los Angeles to Joshua Tree the IMAX scene before our rental car began to shift — the bright city lights faded in the distance the streaming streak of cars tapered off one by one the stillness grew louder. Sporadic roadside dives supplanted trendy restaurants and bars and California's High Desert with all its sunny disposition drew closer.

""I think that's one"" I said enthusiastically pointing to a spindly scarecrow-like tree. We — and millions other that year — had made the two-hour drive to witness these whimsical wonderfully weird figures. Wondering how they got their goofy shape I flicked around my phone for a quick tutorial: ""Did you know Joshua trees are not in fact trees but plants that are part of the yucca family?"" I asked rattling off a few other fun facts.

As we continued to follow the dusty desert floor the shaggy succulents began to increase in frequency each time prompting an excited exclamation: ""There's another!"" This went on until we pulled off the main road and reached our rental — Black Rock — a midcentury modern home sitting on five acres of almost extraterrestrial land: prickly cacti shaggy junipers and stunted pinyon pines all stretching back to the ochre hills and bright-blue skies. Up here it felt like it was just us.

The charcoal façade smack in the middle of the tawny landscape was a beautiful if stark welcome adding to the far-away feeling. Inside however the two-bedroom ranch-style retreat was bright and homey with vaulted ceilings crisp white linens and surprising pops of color from its bright-red door to the pillows and framed print hanging on the wall — a sharp yet inviting deviation from the bone-dry backdrop outside. Within moments it became clear that we had arrived at an Instagram haven — and I hadn't even seen the backyard yet.

Sliding open the floor-to-ceiling doors there were mind-clearing views in every direction — nothing to interrupt our thoughts or line of vision for what seemed like miles. Though we were mere minutes from downtown Joshua Tree and all its off-beat offerings — artsy boutiques old-timey bars — we chose to maximize the next 48 hours at the house. That meant lazing on the hammocks out back playing a few friendly rounds of cornhole cooling down come afternoon in the private in-ground pool then warming up at night around the fire pit or in the hot tub. The comfy couches around the gas fireplace provided the perfect nook from which to start the brisk mornings watching the desert wake up with a cup of French press coffee from the fully stocked kitchen. There's also an adjacent casita equipped with an outdoor shower kitchenette bed and pull-out sofa to accommodate even more guests.

Though these amenities were enough to fill our days the property works with a local team that can set up everything from guided hikes in the desert to private chef-prepared dinners massages sound baths and yoga and meditation sessions in home.

""We have built a company that prides itself on knowing these communities deeply so that we can be knowledgeable hosts for guests"" said Dave McAdam founder of Homestead Modern the rental company that manages a collection of homes in the area including Black Rock.

Mollie B. Casey the company's COO added ""We think of our homes as being part of a boutique hotel offering with management and oversight as rigorous as any high-end hotel. Unlike a hotel our guests are able to have a completely supported stay without having to physically interact with another person if they do not care to.""

And during a pandemic it doesn't get any better than that. We basked in the remoteness of the Mojave — unfettered by the stresses and demands of the times. ""I could get used to this"" I said to my husband as we watched the watercolor sunset paint the sky in shades of rose orange and lavender from the poolside loungers.

The national park — just a mile from Black Rock — felt hushed too as if someone has pressed the mute button on real life. Despite the line of cars queuing up at the entrance we were mostly alone on hikes including the eight-mile Boy Scout Trail boulder-studded Wonderland of Rocks and Cholla Cactus Garden occupied by a maze of spiny cacti. Popular areas like Keys View which overlooks the sprawling Coachella Valley and Skull Rock a natural formation that mimics a skeleton's face were a bit more crowded with selfie-snapping visitors.

During our days in the park we walked through the jumble of Joshua trees — a sight out of a Dr. Seuss book — stopping every now and then to clamber up a few precarious boulders piled to form a staircase. Squeezing our hands through the crevices we'd pull ourselves up to survey the surrounds. Other times we'd watch in awe as seasoned harnessed-in rock climbers scaled hundreds of feet wondering what the view was like from up there. Deceptively bare the desert is home to lots of life: rabbits coyotes chipmunks and plenty of species of birds. There's a real mystical magnetism to the place — and it becomes even more apparent after dark.

Joshua Tree is a certified International Dark Sky Park — and coming from New York City a place largely illuminated by an artificial glow we found ourselves looking forward to nightfall.

Back at our rental dangling in hammocks under the cover of blankets we watched the final beams of sunlight drop behind the horizon. The darkness crept in slowly eventually enveloping the entire landscape with its star-splattered canopy. Gazing up we gabbed about which constellations we thought we spotted and what shapes the stars were forming — I made out a dancing frog while my husband discerned a map of India and a bearded man with a dog. A shooting star quickly whooshed across the inky tapestry and we both gasped in synchrony.

Then as the night carried on there it was — the Milky Way announcing itself with psychedelic ribbons of glittering pinpoints smeared across the pitch-black canvas drifting overhead. Spellbound my words got stuck; our mindless chatter stopped.

The desert's silence fell around us once more and what a luxury it was — not only to see something so magnificent that it left us speechless but to find peace and quiet amid the nonstop noise — both mental and physical — beyond the desert's boundaries. An absence made into presence.

“Woke” probably isn’t the first adjective that comes to mind when describing Corporate America. But some CEOs are wearing their non-wokeness as a badge of honor.

This week when BlackRock CEO Larry Fink defended his firm’s efforts to hold companies accountable for their environmental and social impact he included a nod to his critics who’ve accused him of forcing a liberal agenda on businesses.

“It is not a social or ideological agenda” he wrote in his closely watched annual letter to clients. “It is not ‘woke.’ It is capitalism.”

Translation: Don’t be angered by this do-gooder approach Wall Street — this is just what’s good for business.

To be sure Fink whose firm has more than $10 trillion in assets under management isn’t wrong: Studies show that companies with strong environmental social and governance norms tend to perform better financially over the long term.

ESG or socially responsible investing is a new lens through which companies can be evaluated by assessing them on non-financial metrics such as their impact on the environment (the “E” in ESG). The social aspect concerns companies’ relationships with employees suppliers and customers – not just stockholders. And governance encompasses how a company comports itself on such matters as executive pay shareholder rights leadership and even its own internal controls.

The messaging around ESG comes down to this: Is doing the right thing valuable in and of itself or only if it helps the bottom line?

“It’s a little bit of both” says Jon Hale the head of sustainability research for the Americas at Morningstar. “Sustainable investing…is trying to improve companies by saying ‘Hey take care of your ESG-related issues that investors used to not really prod you to do. But also let’s think about your broader impact on the world.’”

Redefining ‘woke’

Larry Fink isn’t alone. Elon Musk despite running a massively successful electric car company has also decried “wokeness” as a “false virtue.”

Part of the problem is the way the term which originates in Black American English has been appropriated by White conservatives. Where staying “woke” once meant being alert to societal injustices conservatives often wield the term now as a cudgel to disparage progressive ideas regarding race gender and the environment.

Against that cultural and political backdrop it’s become somewhat radical to suggest that companies should do the right thing simply because it’s the right thing to do.

But just two years ago the leaders of Corporate America did just that. The Business Roundtable the leading advocacy group for American corporations broke with decades of tradition in 2019 stating for the first time that businesses must serve all stakeholders — not just shareholders — ethically morally and fairly.

In other words companies should do what’s right because it’s right not only because it’s good for business. And those who don’t like it can take a long walk.

That was Apple CEO Tim Cook’s message back in 2014 when questioned by a prominent climate-change-denying group about Apple’s sustainability measures. In an exchange that became heated according to witnesses a representative for the conservative think tank National Center for Public Policy Research pressed Cook at a meeting to commit to a narrow focus on profitability even at the expense of Apple’s sustainability goals. In response Cook perhaps the most mild-mannered CEO in Silicon Valley became agitated and shot the question down.

“When we work on making our devices accessible by the blind I don’t consider the bloody ROI” Cook said. Later he added: “If you want me to do things only for ROI reasons you should get out of this stock.”

Telling climate-change skeptics to divest was a pretty bold move in 2014. Eight years later you’re unlikely to find Cook losing sleep over taking the moral high ground: Apple has since become a $3 trillion company and Cook himself received nearly $100 million in total compensation last year.

Just as investors’ obsessive focus with short-term gains helped shape the shareholder-primacy era they will also play a key role in the transition to the stakeholder capitalism era according to Morningstar’s Hale.

“Virtually every public company today is concerned about their ESG performance in a way that they were absolutely not five years ago” he told CNN Business. The standard is no longer just what companies can get away with legally he said.

“If you’re creating negative impacts on the world” Hale added “it affects your brand negatively.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMia2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZvcmJlcy5jb20vc2l0ZXMvcHJha2FzaGRvbHNhay8yMDIyLzAxLzIzL2xhcnJ5LWZpbmstc3Rha2Vob2xkZXItY2FwaXRhbGlzbS1hbmQtY2xpbWF0ZS1hY3Rpb24v0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Larry Fink Stakeholder Capitalism And Climate Action,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Max restarts limit reached for url: https://www.forbes.com/sites/prakashdolsak/2022/01/23/larry-fink-stakeholder-capitalism-and-climate-action/ on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMia2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZvcmJlcy5jb20vc2l0ZXMvcHJha2FzaGRvbHNhay8yMDIyLzAxLzIzL2xhcnJ5LWZpbmstc3Rha2Vob2xkZXItY2FwaXRhbGlzbS1hbmQtY2xpbWF0ZS1hY3Rpb24v0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen

On Friday Delaware State Police wrapped up a several-week long robbery investigation after searching a home on the 36000 block of Blackstone Drive in Ocean View Del. Police say on December 26th 2021 troopers responded to Shore Stop in the area of Lighthouse Road and Zion Church Road for a robbery.

Investigators say a male suspect got out of the passenger side of a vehicle before entering the store and robbing the clerk at gunpoint. The suspect left Shore Stop with cash and got back into the waiting vehicle. The clerk was not hurt in the robbery.

42-year-old Lucas S. Powell of Millville and 47-year-old Leck Lyons of Ocean View were identified as possible suspects. Evidence believed to be connected to the robbery was found in their home. Police also found 3.3 grams of a counterfeit substance disguised as cocaine and drug paraphernalia.

Powell was arrested during the search. A 38-year-old woman from Laurel was also arrested at the home for active capias. Lyons was later found driving Powell’s vehicle and was also arrested.

Powell was charged with first degree robbery possession of a firearm during the commission of a felony concealed carry of a deadly weapon and possession of a firearm by a person prohibited.

However Blackstone didn't reveal the investment for this public-private partnership initiative with the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC).

The fund has spent more than ₹50 crore in the redevelopment of the street a Mumbai civic body official told new agency PTI.

The one mile area has safer pedestrian pathways and community spaces for residents the PE major that owns and manages assets worth more than USF 60 billion in India said.

Maharashtra Tourism Minister Aditya Thackeray had formally opened the stretch to the public. The upgrading project took more than a year for completion said the fund that has over $20 billion in realty assets in the country across 41 properties since 2006 making it the largest foreign fund in the space.

Thanking Blackstone for its support Thackrey said it is encouraging to see the private sector step forward and collaborate with the local government and authorities to improve the city's infrastructure.

The mile-long stretch of the road sitting at the junction between Dadar Elphinstone and Lower Parel is a high-volume traffic area with more than one lakh commuters per day.

Nucleus Office Parks the real estate platform has streamlined traffic and vehicle lanes by constructing two signals and one U-turn junction. The project also created 2.5 km of pedestrian walkway and 2.5 km of dedicated cycling tracks apart from an afforestation of 1.5 acres.

Tuhin Parikh head (real estate) at Blackstone India said the firm has contributed to several initiatives to help build communities in India. The Mumbai streetscape project helps make roads safer and more accessible.

Quaiser Parvez the CEO of Nucleus Office Parks said it worked all through 2021 in upgrading one of the city's arterial streets into a world-class.

That merger initiated Boeing’s fundamental transformation into a manufacturer that cared less about quality control than its stock price. The ramifications of that makeover were plain to see in October 2018 and March 2019 when two Boeing 737 Max aircrafts fell from the sky killing more than 300 people—all because of malfeasance deliberately perpetrated by Boeing itself.

Downfall: The Case Against Boeing is rightly described by The Wall Street Journal’s Andy Pasztor as “a horrible horrible story” and Boeing’s culpability is so obvious and inexcusable that at the eventual Senate hearings over the two crashes even Ted Cruz was incensed over its egregiousness. Premiering on Jan. 21 at the Sundance Film Festival (before making its Netflix debut on Feb. 18) the film is a study of corporate greed and the permanent damage it can beget especially when the culprit in question is a company that provides what amounts to a public utility. Featuring interviews with journalists pilots analysts experts (including Capt. Chesley “Sully” Sullenberger) and Oregon congressman Peter A. DeFazio who eventually spearheaded the Transportation & Infrastructure Committee’s inquiry into Boeing’s conduct it serves as a cautionary tale about unchecked avarice and the need as Pasztor says to always remain skeptical about whom you trust.

Kennedy’s documentary begins on Oct. 29 2018 in Jakarta Indonesia when Lion Air Flight 610 unexpectedly went down killing all 189 passengers and crew members aboard. Garima Sethi the wife of the plane’s pilot Captain Bhavye Suneja recalls receiving the fateful news about the crash as well as enduring the immediate aftermath of the tragedy when Boeing mounted a considerable PR campaign to pin the blame on her husband. Two weeks later Boeing changed its tune admitting that the underlying cause of the calamity was an erroneous MCAS activation. The problem was no one had ever heard of MCAS (which stands for Maneuver Characteristics Augmentation System) and could only find mention of it in the abbreviation section of the 737 Max’s manual.

As Sethi and others soon learned MCAS was software linked to one of the exterior angle-of-attack sensors located on the front side of the plane. Because of its larger-than-usual fuel-efficient engines the 737 Max had a tendency to fly too vertically at high speeds creating the potential for the engine to stall; when its trajectory became overly severe MCAS automatically pushed the nose of the plane down so the craft could level out. In the case of Lion Air Flight 610 a faulty angle-of-attack sensor had incorrectly triggered MCAS causing nosedive-ish behavior that the pilots couldn’t rectify in time to avert disaster. Then again as later investigations revealed they never had a chance since Boeing hadn’t informed its pilots that MCAS existed much less trained them to handle it. Thus when MCAS initiated during Lion Air Flight 610’s early going Suneja had no clue what was going on—he was simply confronted by a barrage of inexplicable and frenzied warnings and readouts—nor any idea how to stop it.

Even in the aftermath of that worst-case scenario the FAA bought Boeing’s story that they’d have a swift software fix for MCAS thereby negating any need to ground the planes. Nineteen short weeks later on March 10 2019 that proved to be a grave mistake as Ethiopian Airlines Flight 302 crashed in a similar manner killing 157. Worse this catastrophe had happened even though the pilots—following Boeing’s updated advice—had reacted to the MCAS activation by turning the system off. It was now obvious that something was dreadfully wrong and though the FAA still refused to pull the 737 Max fleet out of the sky President Trump unilaterally did so thereby making it the only plane to ever be grounded by a commander-in-chief.

“ Boeing retrofitted 45-year-old 737 frames with new heavier fuel-efficient engines that in turn necessitated the MCAS. Then it lied about the significance (and power) of the MCAS to the FAA all in order to avoid additional costly pilot training. ”

Boeing’s failure to properly respond to the MCAS threat is infuriating but Downfall: The Case Against Boeing also generates outrage from its snapshot of the company’s transition from an engineer-driven outfit that made its name—and its fortune—through a commitment to teamwork collaboration and safety to an enterprise consumed with maximizing revenue. Kennedy’s documentary contends it was that directive which led to the Lion Air and Ethiopian Airlines tragedies. In an effort to retake the industry lead over their European rival Airbus Boeing retrofitted 45-year-old 737 frames with new heavier fuel-efficient engines that in turn necessitated the MCAS. Then it lied about the significance (and power) of the MCAS to the FAA all in order to avoid additional costly pilot training.

The results of that deception were broadcast around the globe in 2018 and 2019 and Downfall: The Case Against Boeing complements those terrible news reports with interviews with some of the victims’ loved ones who express shock and fury at Boeing’s callous disregard for the employees and passengers they were supposed to protect. Director Kennedy—the youngest child of the late Robert F. Kennedy—never loses sight of those who lost their lives in these two incidents and she further honors their memory by thoroughly and lucidly censuring Boeing for its numerous calculated unforgivable decisions utilizing flight simulator recreations diagrams and graphics to lay out the heinous and heartbreaking particulars of this tale.

When DeFazio’s committee finally received Boeing documentation it discovered that the company had known all along that MCAS was a problem and moreover that properly dealing with it required “greater certification and training” for pilots. In other words they ignored a safety-critical flaw then hid it from FAA regulators and finally—after the crashes—tried to besmirch the pilots whom they’d kept in the dark from the get-go. Making matters worse they had done so with the full understanding that once the MCAS system went haywire pilots would only have a measly 10 seconds to rectify their situation before death became guaranteed.

Downfall: The Case Against Boeing is so damning that it certainly won’t help the company’s share price. It may however motivate air travelers on their next trip to seek out an Airbus.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiiAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5ud3Byb2dyZXNzaXZlLm9yZy93ZWJsb2cvMjAyMi8wMS9ib29rLXJldmlldy1mbHlpbmctYmxpbmQtZXhhbWluZXMtdGhlLWJhZC1kZWNpc2lvbnMtdGhhdC1sZWQtdG8tYm9laW5ncy1jdXJyZW50LWNyaXNlcy5odG1s0gGMAWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm53cHJvZ3Jlc3NpdmUub3JnL3dlYmxvZy8yMDIyLzAxL2Jvb2stcmV2aWV3LWZseWluZy1ibGluZC1leGFtaW5lcy10aGUtYmFkLWRlY2lzaW9ucy10aGF0LWxlZC10by1ib2VpbmdzLWN1cnJlbnQtY3Jpc2VzLmh0bWwvYW1w?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Book Review: Flying Blind examines the bad decisions that led to Boeing’s current crises,"Although multi­na­tion­al cor­po­ra­tions are often accused of putting prof­it over peo­ple Peter Robison’s Fly­ing Blind: The 737 MAX Tragedy and the Fall of Boe­ing makes the case that there once was a time when Amer­i­ca’s biggest aero­space com­pa­ny was a more respon­si­ble and peo­ple-cen­tric firm focused on its the suc­cess of its busi­ness as opposed to just bal­ance sheets and stock prices.

By explor­ing and retelling Boeing’s his­to­ry Robi­son offers a pro­file of a com­pa­ny devot­ed to laud­able achieve­ments in aero­space engi­neer­ing — a com­pa­ny will­ing to sac­ri­fice mil­lions to ensure its air­craft were the safest available.

Lead­ers and engi­neers are intro­duced as proud of the com­pa­ny they work for one that is renowned for inno­va­tion as well as transparency.

Boe­ing’s rep­u­ta­tion for trans­paren­cy was well main­tained lead­ing the com­pa­ny to take full respon­si­bil­i­ty for the 1985 747 crash that killed five hun­dred and twen­ty peo­ple in Japan. Robi­son con­trasts that ster­ling rep­u­ta­tion with Boe­ing’s woe­ful pub­lic image today. By exam­in­ing Boeing’s high­est achieve­ments as well as its most dis­tress­ing fail­ures Robi­son empow­ers read­ers to bet­ter under­stand the sequence of ill-fat­ed deci­sions that have brought Boe­ing where it is today.

The first sec­tion of the book estab­lish­es Boe­ing’s rise to promi­nence start­ing with the devel­op­ment of planes like the B‑29 Super­fortress a long-range bomber air­craft flown in the lat­ter phas­es of World War II. (The Super­fortress was built in Puget Sound and gets its name from its small­er pre­de­ces­sor the B‑17 Fly­ing Fortress which was already in use at the time the war broke out.)

A major vic­to­ry for Boe­ing com­ing out of the war was the exten­sive data col­lect­ed from an Aero­nau­ti­cal Research Insti­tute in Germany.

Boe­ing engi­neers were able to dras­ti­cal­ly improve designs for their upcom­ing jet-pow­ered bomber allow­ing them to keep up with much larg­er competitors.

Robison’s first chap­ters describe Boeing’s ear­ly engi­neer­ing vic­to­ries in the pro­duc­tion of planes for the Unit­ed States mil­i­tary in lan­guage that is easy for those out­side of the engi­neer­ing field to understand.

Boeing’s most promi­nent ear­ly fig­ures whose per­son­al­i­ties are well estab­lished give the book a more per­son­al and enter­tain­ing feel.

One of Boeing’s pres­i­dents William Allen is described as “nev­er travel[ing] with­out Triscuits and a pair of eye­glass­es.” The pres­i­den­t’s res­o­lu­tions for the com­pa­ny from his per­son­al jour­nal are also dis­cussed: Be con­sid­er­ate of my asso­ciates’ views don’t talk too much let oth­ers talk make sin­cere efforts to under­stand labor’s view­point and devel­op a post­war future for Boe­ing.

The com­pa­ny’s engi­neers give life to the sto­ry illus­trat­ing a hard work­ing team from hum­ble begin­nings ded­i­cat­ed to and inspired by Boeing’s achievements.

This team called itself The Incredibles.

It includ­ed Alvin “Tex” John­ston who is described as always wear­ing cow­boy boots and once exe­cut­ed a bar­rel roll over Lake Wash­ing­ton in front of three hun­dred peo­ple all with­out telling any­one he was plan­ning to try it.

This team of engi­neers com­bined these the­atrics with a rig­or­ous devo­tion to their jobs com­ing from all across the coun­try because they believed in Boeing’s vision.

The next few chap­ters con­tin­ue through Boeing’s his­to­ry includ­ing the pro­duc­tion of the 737 and 747 reach­ing a turn­ing point and dis­tinc­tive tone shift around the ear­ly 1990s. Robi­son explains the cul­tur­al shifts through cor­po­rate Amer­i­ca that were gal­va­nized by Ronald Reagan’s approach to the economy.

This includ­ed the idea that prof­its and share­hold­ers should be the main priority.

For Boe­ing the 1990s proved to be an extreme­ly suc­cess­ful era allow­ing them to buy one of their old­est exist­ing com­peti­tors but also demon­strat­ed Boeing’s will­ing­ness to aban­don its found­ing principles.

The lega­cy of the res­o­lu­tions of for­mer pres­i­dent William Allen was replaced by a ded­i­ca­tion to max­i­miz­ing prof­its at seem­ing­ly any cost.

The board saw com­pa­ny-alter­ing turnover includ­ing the addi­tion of Gen­er­al Elec­tric’s Jack Welch who cham­pi­oned a cul­ture change at Boe­ing that de-empha­sized the impor­tance and val­ue of sound engineering.

As a con­se­quence Boe­ing engi­neers found them­selves in a dis­tinct­ly dif­fer­ent envi­ron­ment than what they had expect­ed. Peo­ple who had stud­ied and aspired for the oppor­tu­ni­ty to be like The Incred­i­bles were left very disappointed.

One unnamed man­ag­er report­ed­ly said: “I hate this new cul­ture… I don’t want to be anybody’s facil­i­ta­tor I want to come to work and kick some ass.”

The board became increas­ing­ly obsessed with push­ing Boe­ing’s stock price high­er a far cry from its past ded­i­ca­tion to aero­space innovation.

The 2010s would reveal the con­se­quences of this men­tal­i­ty for Boeing.

With air­lines demand­ing bet­ter more fuel effi­cient planes Boe­ing faced the choice of either upgrad­ing the best­selling nar­row-body 737 which was bring­ing in a third of their rev­enue or design­ing an entire­ly new plane.

The 737 MAX became the result of pick­ing the cheap­er option rather than sac­ri­fic­ing prof­its to design and con­struct some­thing new.

Addi­tions to the more expen­sive mod­el includ­ed sen­sors that could make cor­rec­tions for pilots. These cor­rec­tions could be over­rid­den in case of an error but pilots need­ed to be thor­ough­ly trained on how to do so.

Not only was Boe­ing able to receive gov­ern­ment approval to allow the MAX to go into ser­vice with­out required train­ing the com­pa­ny even reject­ed requests from air­lines for pilot train­ing. This includ­ed Lion Air whose request for pilot train­ing was denied pre­cip­i­tat­ing the 737 MAX crash that sub­se­quent­ly killed 189 people.

Robi­son focus­es his con­clud­ing chap­ters on this dev­as­tat­ing 737 MAX crash detail­ing Boeing’s respons­es and com­par­ing them to crash respons­es in the past.

Robi­son pro­vides a thor­ough account of Boeing’s cur­rent stand­ing and rep­u­ta­tion detail­ing where it all went wrong and high­light­ing some of the key vil­lains in Boeing’s sto­ry. The final chap­ters are fast paced and gripping.

Fly­ing Blind was high­ly engag­ing and espe­cial­ly thor­ough. The bio­graph­i­cal por­traits were well devel­oped and the inter­views were very illuminating.

The book’s dis­cus­sion of eco­nom­ic shifts in cor­po­rate Amer­i­ca is par­tic­u­lar­ly com­pelling. Read­ers from the Seat­tle area will like­ly enjoy read­ing sto­ries about key moments and events that took place in the Pacif­ic Northwest.

Fly­ing Blind is well worth read­ing and its nar­ra­tive style makes it eas­i­ly man­age­able for any­one who strug­gles with nonfiction.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiN2h0dHBzOi8vc2ltcGxlZmx5aW5nLmNvbS9ib2VpbmctNzM3LTYwMC1vcGVyYXRvcnMtMjAyMi_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,24 Years Since Its Introduction: Who Flies The Boeing 737-600 Today?,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with ('Connection aborted.', RemoteDisconnected('Remote end closed connection without response')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiN2h0dHBzOi8vc2ltcGxlZmx5aW5nLmNvbS9ib2VpbmctNzM3LTYwMC1vcGVyYXRvcnMtMjAyMi_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiS2h0dHBzOi8vb2tjZm94LmNvbS9uZXdzL2xvY2FsL2JvZWluZy1iLTUyLWFpcmNyYWZ0LWFycml2ZXMtaW4tb2tsYWhvbWEtY2l0edIBT2h0dHBzOi8vb2tjZm94LmNvbS9hbXAvbmV3cy9sb2NhbC9ib2VpbmctYi01Mi1haXJjcmFmdC1hcnJpdmVzLWluLW9rbGFob21hLWNpdHk?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Boeing B-52 aircraft arrives in Oklahoma City,"OKLAHOMA CITY (KOKH) - The B-52 bomber made its way to Oklahoma City on Saturday morning.

The bomber is on the last day of a three-week trip to Oklahoma City’s Boeing facility.



--

The Boeing B-52 fuselage arrived in Oklahoma on Thursday.

The fuselage has been flying since 1955 and is known as ""Damage Inc. II."" The vessel is currently making its way to the Boeing facility in Oklahoma City where it will be assembled and serve as a test prototype for modernization efforts. The modernization of Boeing B-52 was contracted from the United States Air Force (USAF) which include letting Boeing upgrade the engines on the B-52.

The iconic aircraft began its journey at Davis-Montham Air Force Base in Tucson AZ on Jan. 3 making its way through southern Arizona and New Mexico. The fuselage is scheduled to make its way through the southwest portion of Oklahoma before it will arrive in the OKC Metro area where it is expected to arrive on Jan. 22.

When the bomber arrives in OKC crews will then maneuver the aircraft into the Boeing facility for engineers to begin the process of integrating new F130 engines recently selected by the USAF. These new engines will give the 60-year-old aircraft the power range and speed necessary to remain mission ready through 2050 and beyond.

""The B-52 remains a critical part of our nation's nuclear deterrent"" said Jennifer Wong the director for the Bombers Program. ""We are so excited to partner with the U.S. Air Force and Rolls Royce as the Commercial Engine Replace Program (CERP) carries the B-52 into the future.""

CERP is the latest development in a series of enhancements to the B-52. The program will replace each of the fuselage's eight engines before the current engines in the aircraft reach the end of their life cycle. The modern fuel-efficient engines being installed in the B-52 will enhance the bomber's operational capabilities while improving its environmental impact.

In order to re-engine the legacy aircraft the Boeing team is relying upon digital engineering to design build and test the new engines in a digital environment.

""We appreciate Boeing's partnership to revive Damage Inc II in support of the B-52 modernization effort"" said Col. Louis Ruscetta Senior Material Leader B-52 System Program Office at Tinker Air Force Base. ""This is a great opportunity to reduce risk to some of our development efforts and opens doors to bring other innovative capabilities to the fleet and keep this platform flying into 2050.""

Mass. may try to have them removed,"In the bedroom community of Wilmington just south of Lowell sits a little white house with paint peeling from the trim and a mailbox emblazoned with the American flag at the end of the driveway.

Homeowners Edward Kaizer and his wife Mary Tassone-Kaizer say the house has been in the family for generations. But they were shocked when a WBUR reporter showed them a clause buried in their property records from 1897 stating the land cannot be occupied by “negroes or Irish” or anyone considered “disorderly people.”

""Oh my God"" said Tassone-Kaizer who works in accounts receivable for a local company. ""Did your parents know about that?""

""If they did they didn't say so"" said Kaizer a high school teacher in Wilmington who grew up in the house.

Kaizer held the document with a stunned look. Then he said his mother was an Irish immigrant.

""It's disgusting"" Tassone-Kaizer replied. ""We don't stand for any of that.""

Racial Covenants

So-called racial covenants can be found in property records all over the country including Massachusetts where many restrictions were written from the late 19th to mid-20th century. Some bar landowners from selling or renting to people who aren’t white others target certain immigrant groups — like Poles Italians and Irish.

A deed from Springfield in 1916 states that the “lot shall not be resold to a colored person a Polander or an Italian.” This language appears on the deeds for at least four separate properties sold by a single seller in Hampden County. (Courtesy of Hampden County Registry of Deeds)

Experts note the racist clauses have had no legal standing for decades thanks to court decisions and legislation that now makes racist deed restrictions illegal. In 1948 the U.S. Supreme Court ruled racial covenants were unenforceable. And in 1968 Congress outlawed them altogether as part of the Fair Housing Act.

The following year Massachusetts also banned restrictions on the basis of race color religion national origin and sex.

But some state lawmakers and judges remain concerned that the clauses are still included in property records a reminder of the country's — and the state's — legacy of racism. And now they are trying to figure out the best way to amend the records to reflect the fact that such clauses are no longer permitted.

The Massachusetts land court recently started letting judges add a note to deeds saying the covenants are void.

""It allows for a formal repudiation of the records"" said Lauren Reznick an administrator with the state land court ""and it does so without erasing history.""

Some say that’s not good enough.

A quarter of state lawmakers have sponsored a bill to let homeowners erase the racist language from their property files altogether.

State Rep. John Barrett of North Adams proposed the legislation after some constituents complained they couldn't remove racial covenants from their home records.

""As one said to me: 'It's just not who we are and we'd like it removed' "" Barrett said.

A deed from Edgartown on Martha’s Vineyard dated 1908 states: “said premises shall never be sold leased or hired to any person or persons other than those of the white race so-called.” (Courtesy of Dukes County Registry of Deeds)

But community organizer Ron Bell says he doesn’t want the racist history to be erased or forgotten. He says the restrictions are consistent with his experience as a Black man in Massachusetts.

""It doesn’t surprise me because I’ve lived it"" said Bell who runs the nonprofit Dunk the Vote. Bell cited the violent clashes over bussing in Boston the Charles Stuart case (in which a Black man was wrongly accused of murder) and ""just being Black in Boston.""

Bell argues the racial covenants are a reminder of that history — and that the problems persist. Black and brown residents are less likely to own homes in the state and far more likely to face discrimination by real estate agents.

A Mountain Of Records

In the cavernous records room at the Middlesex North Registry of Deeds in Lowell register Richard Howe shares an example of a racist land covenant tied to a property sold in Lowell in 1881.

Sitting at his desk holding a copy of the deed Howe read aloud:

""Said premises is being deeded under the express agreement and condition that the land shall never be deeded or conveyed to any person born in Ireland.""

""So you can't get more specific than that.""

The deed hits close to home for Howe. He said seven of his eight grandparents immigrated to Lowell from Ireland in the late 1800s and may have personally faced this kind of discrimination.

Howe an aficionado of Lowell history said the anti-Irish deed language reminds him of the sentiment expressed at the dedication of a new superior courthouse in 1898.

""The speeches were almost saying 'It's important that we have this building that communicates the rule of law because we've got all of these people who don't speak English arriving on our shores' "" he said.

Howe added that the 19th century rhetoric reminds him of the same fear of immigrants today — though now the concern is usually aimed at immigrants from Latin American crossing the southern border.

Howe says there’s no way to identify all the racist restrictions buried in old deeds — or even come up with a reliable estimate of how many there are. Property records in Massachusetts date back to the 1620s. And the vast majority are handwritten and not searchable. So any count would have to be done manually.

""It would take really going through every every document"" Howe said

Howe notes there are 14 million pages of property records in his registry alone. And there are 20 other registries across the state.

So many of the racist restrictions will likely remain buried — until Howe or someone else digging into the old records finally stumbles on the passages.",,,,,,,,,,,,

At universities and colleges across the country police are sweeping through encampments supporting Gaza trying to clear protesters from the grounds. But at Brown University’s encampment on the campus’s main green in the middle of Providence Rhode Island the biggest drama last Shabbat was that the candles would not stay lit.

This was more or less the calm atmosphere of Brown’s encampment for the six days it stood; it was not plagued by the antisemitism violence or arrests that have dominated headlines about schools including Columbia and the University of California Los Angeles. There were no clashes with counterprotesters and no police presence. The encampment’s daily schedule included tai chi and a talent show alongside teach-ins and rallies. People tossed frisbees next to the tents.

On Tuesday the protesting students at Brown reached an agreement with the university’s administration and voluntarily dismantled their encampment.

Life on the Ivy League campus wasn’t always so calm. In the wake of Oct. 7 61 students were arrested at various sit-ins. Some student groups celebrated Hamas’ massacre. People took pictures of Israeli students on campus and posted on anonymous social media with captions disparaging them as Zionists.

Fractures deepened after a Palestinian Brown undergraduate Hisham Awartani was shot in Burlington Vermont along with two other Palestinian friends; they were all wearing kaffiyehs. Brown-RISD Hillel put out a statement mourning the shooting but also castigating “a torrent of antisemitic hatred” online saying that Hillel’s “support for Israel and Zionist students is unassailable.”

Some Jewish and Israeli students who had previously been involved with Hillel broke ties calling the email “tone-deaf” and “a disgusting response to a hate crime.” At a vigil for Awartani a speaker said his blood was on the hands of Zionist students.

But around May’s encampment that vitriol seemed to have dissipated. Chants were focused on the activists’ demands — divestment not from Israel as a whole but from companies involved in the oppression of Palestinians — and not on broader statements about Zionism or Israel’s existence. Some of Brown’s most vocal Zionist students members of opposing campus group Brown Students for Israel said that they felt safe.

Students told me that the encampment chose not to chant “from the river to the sea” — common at most protests — because one student who was part of the tent group said it made them feel uncomfortable. (The chant did occur once on the encampment’s final day.)

What enabled this shift? And who planted the seeds for compromise on Brown’s central lawn?

I asked this question of many at Brown students faculty and rabbis and their answers all pointed to a willingness to cross ideological divides. Where protesters at other campuses adopted “do not engage” policies at Brown they kept talking.

“On the periphery of the encampment there were a number of students in conversation with one another some of which I think people might have imagined were unlikely pairs to be having conversations across political differences” said Jason Klein the rabbi for Jewish life in the chaplain’s office. “That’s something I think that Brown students can often do well.”

This isn’t of course to say that everyone approved of the encampment or agreed with its demands. Some students and staff at the Brown-RISD Hillel harshly criticize the campus environment. And many activists call for more extreme measures and more rigid stances — most students I spoke with mentioned more radical factions on campus that don’t fret over upsetting their peers.

But they no longer dominate at Brown.

The encampment maintained a middle ground of sorts in part due to a monthslong committed dialogue organized and run by students to talk through the toughest issues and feelings and try to understand each other.

And many students said that the relative calm and success of the protest was thanks in large part to the deep engagement of Jewish students in the campus’s activist movements.

Jews at the center

The first sit-in for divestment at Brown in November last year was composed entirely of Jewish students. In their first statement in the student newspaper The Brown Daily Herald the group mourned the murders on Oct. 7 and affirmed its “connection to the amorphous spiritual entity” of Israel but declared itself anti-Zionist.

Soon after they named themselves BrownU Jews for Ceasefire Now; many of its members were part of Brown’s encampment. JFCN as most on campus call it has organized protests or actions but also created an independent study course for those grappling with Judaism Jewish identity and Israel; organized dinners for Jews who clash over Israel; and invited other students to come and ask questions of its members promising to cast no judgment. It has also hosted weekly Shabbat services — including the one at the encampment — as well as holiday celebrations.

Maddie a senior with JFCN who spoke on condition that only her first name be used so as not to compromise her employment prospects in the Jewish professional world said the group hosts large Shabbat dinners and has created an “alternative ritual space” for Jews “who don’t want to feel like they’re praying to a flag.”

About 24% of Brown’s student body is Jewish and most of them according to Rabbi Joshua Bolton the head of the Brown-RISD Hillel “exist in a broad center and in fact they don’t necessarily feel represented by activists on either side of this issue.”

Nevertheless Jewish students comprise a significant portion — it’s not clear exactly how large — of pro-Palestinian activists on campus. Their deep engagement and leadership seems to have helped insulate the movement from becoming as divisive as on other campuses.

When an outside group from Providence came to the encampment and handed out flyers urging a global intifada over the weekend students pushed back saying that was not part of their messaging. They kept their chants focused on divestment and criticism of Brown’s leadership.

“The heavy Jewish presence in these pro-Palestine circles ensures that there will never be the extreme blatant antisemitism” said Ma’ayan Stutman-Shaw a first-year student who is not involved with the protests. “And it’s Jews who are really engaged with the Jewish community not Jews who picked up Judaism on Oct. 10 because they wanted to fight for Palestine — Jews who have been thinking about this constantly they are the ones who are leading this movement on campus.”

Of course much of the pro-Palestinian organizing has been led by non-Jewish students as well.

But much of the pushback to pro-Palestinian protests — concerns about antisemitism and what they see as calls to dismantle Israel — have come from Jewish students who are concerned about antisemitism or who have ties to Israel. And that’s where the leadership of Jewish student activists has come in.

“Jewish students are going to have a better understanding of what will trigger other Jewish students” said Asher Radziner a senior who has been leading conversations on campus.

A safety blanket

Many Jewish students I spoke to said the university encouraged conversations among students over Israel and the war but never convened any that students found inviting.

“It hasn’t really provided those spaces” said Eiden Spilker a senior involved with JFCN. “There just haven’t been contexts to engage in good faith.”

So instead students built their own.

Outside the encampment while it stood JFCN students — none of whom were camping on the green — had set up a dialogue space: a blanket and a painted canvas that said “Questions? Comments? Concerns? Come talk.”

Every day that the encampment stood at least two students sat there waiting for people to approach them. The group also facilitated conversations during a student hunger strike in February when 17 students fasted for eight days to protest the refusal of the Corporation of Brown University which governs the investment of Brown’s endowment to hear a proposal for divestment.

JFCN members said they are looking especially to engage with Jewish and Zionist students. Spilker whose father is a rabbi and whose mother is a cantor said JFCN understands where they’re coming from.

“We’ve been there and we’re in a position where we can empathize with that” he said. “It’s less about trying to convince people and more about hearing them and having dialogue and creating a space that ideally Hillel would’ve created but because of their ideology and current leadership have not been able to make.”

(“We are a home for every Jewish student” said Bolton the director of the campus Hillel when told of the criticism from some Jewish students. “That doesn’t mean that we’re a home for every type of program.”)

On blanket duty one recent morning Spilker greeted a student who introduced himself as Kareem not giving his last name and had questions. He asked about the use of the term genocide and the impact of divestment. Spilker thought before he spoke and then drew on theories he learned in classes he’d taken.

“I think it is a question of at which stage do you call it a genocide — is it just at the final stage of mass extermination?” he said.

“That’s a good point” Kareem responded. “I hadn’t heard that before that it’s a process.”

Spilker said he’s had all kinds of people come up to him at the blanket: students from the campus pro-Israel group students from settlements in the West Bank alumni faculty a local imam worried parents of prospective students who had just taken the campus tours that walked by the encampment multiple times a day.

“That was the main goal in setting this up. Like: We’re here to talk to you we’re not a threat to you” he said. “There are people who understand what we’re doing here or may not fully agree but appreciate what’s happening and appreciate that we’re opening up this space.”

Caught in the middle

One of those appreciative students is Stutman-Shaw. She doesn’t feel comfortable being part of the group but said she still agrees with much of what JFCN is doing on campus particularly its work to keep students talking to one another. Those efforts have “made me really proud to go to this school” she said.

At the same time the Jewish involvement in the protest movement has put Stutman-Shaw into a difficult position. JFCN hosts a Shabbat service each week with two options for prayer: a Reform service and a traditional-egalitarian one that uses traditional liturgy but doesn’t divide servicegoers by gender. It’s so popular that it can make it hard for Hillel to field a minyan for its own version of that service several students told me.

But JFCN’s homemade siddur doesn’t sit right with Stutman-Shaw. It has a disclaimer explaining that the word “Yisrael” in prayers doesn’t refer to the country of Israel but to the Jewish people and to the biblical parable in which Jacob wrestles with God. For Stutman-Shaw that’s not how she views her spirituality; when she prays to Yisrael she said she does think of the country and the time she’s spent there.

That means she often finds herself without her preferred mode of prayer; instead she usually attends the Orthodox minyan at Hillel.

“JFCN right now is the best egalitarian service that you can find on campus” she said citing the passion of the students involved. “Part of me feels really happy for that and part of me like that really breaks my heart because I feel like I can’t really be there fully in who I am.”

Stutman-Shaw is attempting to resuscitate the Brown chapter of J Street U which describes itself as “the political home for pro-Israel pro-peace pro-democracy Americans.” The chapter dissolved in the wake of Oct. 7 because the national organization had failed to call for a ceasefire. She hopes it will be a place where student can both condemn Israel’s actions in Gaza and support the existence of the state.

Still while she endeavors to build her own Jewish space on campus Stutman-Shaw said JFCN has been integral to the success of Brown’s pro-Palestinian movement.

“A lot of Israeli students were leading the protests a lot of Jewish students with connection to Israel” she said. “So they were really trying to emphasize the importance of diverse ideological dialogue.”

Dinners across disagreement

Stutman-Shaw has been attending an event called Dinners in Progress created by two other students who hold differing views on the conflict in the Middle East that seeks to bring groups of the not-likeminded students together to talk about Israel Gaza and the atmosphere on campus.

“For the first time since Oct. 7 I see the SJP president who happens to be Jewish and someone who is from the Gush talking about Israel” Stutman-Shaw said referring to the school’s chapter of Students for Justice in Palestine and a group of settlements in the West Bank. “And that’s so exciting.”

Radziner who is one of the co-founders said the dinners arose from the idea that “it would be great to have a dialogue space that wasn’t controlled by the university that wasn’t run by faculty or adults but run by students for students — not run by an organization like Hillel or even JFCN.”

The office of student life at Brown put him in touch with another student Zoey Fisher and gave them funding to buy dinner which is always a draw for college students.

In the three dinners so far a cohort of 14 Jewish students discussed their personal connections to Israel were able to express frustration with each other and dug deeply into their disagreements.

“It’s very easy for people who feel very strongly about something and want to act on it to get together and take action” Radziner said. “But often that comes at the expense of continued dialogue with people who disagree with you.”

The dinners he said “keep it going.”

‘I’ve had too many bad experiences’

Not everyone feels that the conversation has been quite so welcoming. Rabbi Joshua Bolton the director of the Brown-RISD Hillel critiqued what he saw as students holing up in “ideological fortresses.”

“Wisdom is revealed in places where we know very little where there’s vulnerability” Bolton said. “And so it would strike me that the opportunity before students at Brown is not to build an encampment that keeps everyone of a differing opinion out but really embrace the idea of let us go camping together in the wilderness.”

He blames the Brown faculty in part for building ideological fortresses and setting a bad example for students.

In many ways Hillel has been the target of the worst of the ire from protests. Bolton and the assistant director of the Hillel Molly Goldmeier received death threats several months ago.

“It’s just very hard for me to imagine what I’ve endured” he said “and there not being a major campus revolt on account of it.” he said. The campus he posits would be outraged had the head of the Brown Center for Students of Color received such threats.

“I think that kind of reflects where students are at right now” he added.

Teddy Horowitz a senior said he too feels unwelcome on campus because of his Zionism; he said he’d lost numerous friendships because of his love for Israel and his membership in the campus pro-Israel group Brown Students for Israel.

Horowitz largely agrees with the activists’ demands for a ceasefire and an end to Israel’s occupation but is deeply concerned about antisemitism within the movement. He said the Brown SJP chapter had expressed admiration for Hamas and that he’s seen antisemitism rise on campus social media. He also saw no place to mourn Israelis murdered in the Oct. 7 attack because of the dominance of pro-Palestinian activism on campus.

Many of his activist classmates fall into two groups he said. “There are the Jews and students who think Oct. 7 was a victory and there’s the activists who are willing to put up with that” he said. “And I don’t want to deal with either group anymore; I’ve had too many bad experiences.”

Horowitz turned to the campus Hillel and Chabad where he found community with like-minded friends. But he remains discouraged by what he sees as echo chambers on campus.

To combat this he founded a new publication the Brown Jewish Journal. “When the Jewish Journal started one of the editors was an anti-Zionist and I was really suspicious of him at first” Horowitz recounted. But as they began to read and edit each other’s work that changed. “Now I really look forward to talking about Israel-Palestine with him” he said.

Horowitz who spoke to me in the days before protesters and the university struck an agreement to dismantle the encampment said the climate on campus had improved since the weeks after Oct. 7.

“I’m really pleasantly surprised with how well this protest is going” he said of the encampment. “Recently I’ve come to the conclusion that these people might be pretty chill.”

But he still feels “betrayed” by the campus community. “I love the outpouring of empathy for Palestinians — they need it!” he said. “I just wish some of the empathy was directed our way as well.”

A campus less divided than it looks

Every student I spoke to said they think even the groups at opposite ends of the ideological spectrum on Israel actually well mostly agree.

“You’ll find a lot more in common with BSI members and JFCN members than either of them would ever admit” said Stutman-Shaw.

But they did admit it. When I spoke with them both BSI and JFCN members made the same point — that most of them agree on a lot of points including criticism of the Israeli government horror at the deaths of civilians in Gaza and a desire for a ceasefire.

Talking with students from across the campus’s Jewish community the divides largely came down to details — students who want a ceasefire but are uncomfortable with using terms such as “genocide” or “anti-Zionist.” Or students who are reluctant to try to find common ground or engage with students who reacted to Oct. 7 in a way that upset them.

But many of them on all sides are trying to push through their discomfort to understand each other even when it’s difficult.

“Movements are imperfect” Radziner said. “Once you understand that you’re all working towards the same goal with different ways of getting there it lets you start to not overlook but push through the parts that you disagree with or find challenging.”

That’s what Klein the rabbi in the chaplain’s office hopes will define Brown’s protest movement.

“I was really proud that these students were still really in it and trying to make it imperfect for everyone” he said. “Everyone gets to be uncomfortable everyone gets to learn.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiSGh0dHBzOi8vcmFjaW5nbmV3czM2NS5jb20vaG93LWJyb3duLWNyZWF0ZWQtdGhlLWxhdGVzdC13b2xmZi1ob3JuZXItc3BhdNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,How Brown created the latest Wolff-Horner spat,"The proverb ""All fair's in love and war"" is usually associated with John Lyly's 1578 novel Euphues. If we were to take that and translate it to Formula 1 some 446 years later it could be considered that ruffling the feathers of your rivals deflecting attention away from yourself and putting it on your old rival is all part of the game. Since the white-hot title battle of 2021 it is safe to say that Toto Wolff and Christian Horner are probably not on each other's Christmas card lists with the two often trading words on whatever the topic happens to be. Given the competitive state of Mercedes at the moment the ongoing tensions at Red Bull including the impending loss of Adrian Newey and the fact that Wolff is openly courting Max Verstappen as his Lewis Hamilton replacement it would make sense for the Austrian to try and further destabilise Red Bull. But over the Miami Grand Prix weekend it was not Wolff but McLaren CEO Zak Brown who with a simple comment in the FIA Press Conference laid the foundations for the latest spat between his Mercedes and Red Bull counterparts.



What did Brown actually say? Brown's initial comments were triggered when he was asked about the impending departure of Newey and whether he was surprised at the long-serving chief technical officer's decision to step away from Red Bull. ""Am I surprised? Six months ago I would have been surprised. I think given everything that's gone on since the start of the year and knowing Adrian pretty well and he's a very high-integrity individual I'm not surprised he's moving on"" he told media including RacingNews365. ""The stuff that's going on there is a bit destabilising. It's probably the first domino to fall. My guess is not the last based on the resumes that are flying around."" Later when further pushed on his initial comments Brown confirmed that ""we've seen an increase in CVs coming our way from the team. ""People want to work for people like Adrian Newey and work alongside him. ""I think they will be missing what he brings to the team from a pure technical point of view and then I think the leadership and the excitement people get from working with him will be missed.""

Wolff prefers to focus on Mercedes Wolff was relatively sanguine about the situation when Brown's comments were to put him but did back up the claim made by the McLaren CEO. However he decided not to turn the screw even further instead focusing on Mercedes' own plight and how to rebuild the team into race-winning and championship-challenging position. ""Zak is absolutely correct we are seeing Red Bull CVs through all the levels"" Wolff explained to media including RacingNews365.

""But I would say that this is nothing out of the ordinary people change teams want to change environment so I've come to the point where I'm not really interested in what is going on there with the leadership I'm not listening to anything anymore. ""It is important for us to look at our own team see how we can develop strong people get some interesting competent people from other teams into Mercedes and provide them with an exciting journey to recovery.""

Horner hits back The same could not be said for Horner as Wolff. Despite saying he would not want to be drawn into the war of words the Red Bull chief did exactly that with a barb across the bow of Mercedes when it comes to power units. Much of Wolff's strategy for trying to lure Verstappen to Mercedes stems from the fact that it aced the last significant power unit changes in 2014 and is looking to do the same again in 2026. Red Bull Powertrains is Red Bull's in-house engine division with support from Ford but there have been claims that the engine is lacking in power with Horner himself conceding RBPT has a 70-year deficit to Ferrari when it comes to making engines. That did not stop him explaining how RBPT has been on a sizeable recruitment drive from Mercedes High Performance Powertrains (HPP).



""I think it's inevitable I think the two [team bosses] involved they talk a lot. And I'm not going to get sucked into a tit for tat"" Horner explained when asked by RacingNews365 for his response to the comments from Brown and Wolff. ""But I'd be more focused on Toto's own issues that he has and I don't have any concern with the strength and depth [of Red Bull] there's always going to be movement between teams. ""I don't know how many people we've employed from McLaren this year or how many people [RB] has employed but from Mercedes we've taken 220 people out of HPP into Red Bull Powertrains. ""So when we're talking of losing people I'd be a bit more worried about the 220 people than one or two CVs."" Horner also briefly touched on the future of Sporting Director Jonathan Wheatley with reports emerging across the Miami weekend that he could be about to leave the team. RacingNews365 understands from well-placed sources that there is no truth that Wheatley will depart. ""I mean there's rumours about everybody but contracts between individuals the terms and conditions is not something that we really talk about to the public"" finished Horner.

Brown is among a small number of universities that have agreed to discuss their investments in companies that do business in Israel in order to persuade student protesters to dismantle encampments. Mr. Sternlicht in a scathing email to The New York Times which he copied to Brown’s president Christina H. Paxson said the arrangement amounted to sympathy for Hamas which attacked Israel in October and described students protesting Israel’s actions in Gaza as “ignorant.”

“There should never be a vote when people do not have the facts” he wrote. “It’s not education it’s propaganda.”

Mr. Sternlicht 63 said no deal with protesters could be fruitful because the two sides did not agree on “facts and moral clarity” as well as the scale of Israel’s invasion of Gaza after Hamas’s Oct. 7 attack in which about 1200 were killed and another 250 were taken hostage. Israel’s subsequent intense bombardment of the tightly packed area has left more than 34000 dead and drawn international condemnation.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNubi5jb20vMjAyNC8wNS8wNC9idXNpbmVzcy9icm93bi13aGl0ZS1lZ2dzLWNvc3QtY3VyaW91cy1jb25zdW1lci9pbmRleC5odG1s0gFSaHR0cHM6Ly9hbXAuY25uLmNvbS9jbm4vMjAyNC8wNS8wNC9idXNpbmVzcy9icm93bi13aGl0ZS1lZ2dzLWNvc3QtY3VyaW91cy1jb25zdW1lcg?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Why do brown eggs cost more than white eggs? Blame the bird,"New York CNN —

It’s a moment many shoppers grapple with at some point during a grocery run: Why does a carton of brown eggs cost more than a carton of white eggs?

It’s not what you might think. It’s not about one type being healthier or more natural or fancier than the other but really about the nitty-gritty of farm economics. It costs more to keep the brown egg-laying hen happy and well fed.

“Basically there is no difference between a brown egg and a white egg nutritionally. It has to do with the breed of the chicken” explained Daniel Brey owner of Brey’s Egg Farm a fourth-generation family egg farm in Jeffersonville New York. The farm produces more than 200000 white eggs a day.

Some breeds such as White Leghorn chickens lay eggs with white shells while other breeds such as Rhode Island Reds lay eggs with brown shells. According to Brey the cost and taste of the egg you buy – white or brown - is determined by what – and how much – is fed to the hen.

“It has a lot to do with the chicken feed” Brey said. “It costs more to make a dozen brown eggs because the chickens that produce them tend to eat more.”

Egg farmers say brown and white eggs are closely matched in their nutritional value. Edmund McNamara

Edmund McNamara and his wife Rose run Sova Farms in Norwich NY about 200 miles north of New York City’s Central Park. Sova Farms he said is organic certified by the United States Department of Agriculture for its brown eggs and its chicken pork and lamb.

The farm currently produces about 350 brown eggs daily but expects to bump that up to over 1000 brown eggs a day after receiving a delivery of more than 700 pullets (or young hens) on this month.

“All our eggs are brown but every once in a great while a chicken will lay a very light brown” he said adding that the eggs are sold directly to consumers in New York’s Westchester County.

Harder to find

In stores brown eggs tend to carry a premium – even if it’s just because of their color anomaly.

“Eggs come in many colors not just white and brown. Depending upon the breed some are even blue and green” said Joan Frank assistant program director dietetics with the University of California David Department of Nutrition. Still there is no difference in nutritional value of eggs based on the color of the shell she said.

“I think consumers for some reason have come to believe that brown eggs are healthier which they are not” Frank said.

Sova Farms is currently selling a dozen large brown eggs for $8. Store prices for organic pastured brown eggs can be as high as $10 for a dozen while the price of conventional brown eggs is between $4.50 to $6 in most stores.

A dozen white eggs is about $2.50 in stores according to the latest weekly government data up from $1.50 a dozen from a year ago.

Yet McNamara too said “there is really no nutritional difference between white and brown eggs.”

Phil Lempert a grocery industry analyst and editor of SuperMarketGuru.com estimated how much more shoppers typically pay for brown eggs versus their white counterpart. “If there’s brown eggs next to white eggs typically you’re going to pay anywhere between 10% to 20% more for brown eggs regardless of free range or organic” he said.

The egg-onomics of it all

David Anderson professor of agricultural economics (with a specialty in livestock economics) at Texas A&M University has studied egg pricing and factors that affect it on farms and in the supermarket.

Egg prices regardless of the color of the shell generally respond to swings in demand he said. “You have short-term seasonal events such as Easter. We always see holiday demand for eggs. In the fall we also see demand increase for eggs for holiday-related activities such as baking” Anderson said.

Thrown into the mix are other influences on egg prices such as the cost of chicken feed. “Feed costs have been falling This is helping egg producers. We had a record large crop last year in the US and we have much lower corn and soybean meal prices right now he said.

Brown eggs generally cost more in stores than white eggs. It has to do with the cost of the upkeep of the chicken breed that produces brown eggs. Edmund McNamara

On the flip side the latest outbreak of Bird Flu could keep egg prices elevated versus last year. If egg producers aren’t able to meet demand because they’ve had to cull their chicken population due to bird flu then that can raise prices.

Looking specifically at the economics of producing brown eggs versus conventional white eggs Anderson confirmed it does indeed cost more to produce the brown variety. “If it costs more to produce they’ll probably be priced higher to the consumer.”

But as to the “perception” that brown eggs are healthier than white eggs?

“It’s almost like what comes first the chicken or the egg?” Anderson said. “Did the companies advertise that first or did it come from consumers who think that brown eggs just must be healthier?”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYGh0dHBzOi8vcGVvcGxlLmNvbS9qYW5lbGxlLWJyb3duLWNlbGVicmF0ZXMtYmlydGhkYXktdHdvLW1vbnRocy1hZnRlci1zb24tZ2Fycmlzb24tZGVhdGgtODY0NDI3ONIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Janelle Brown Celebrates 55th Birthday Two Months After Son Garrison's Death,"Janelle Brown is marking a milestone two months after the death of her son Garrison Brown.

After postponing the start of her Las Vegas residency Adele surprised a group of disappointed fans with a video call at Caesars Palace.

James Mason Fox told CNN someone from the singer’s team held up a phone on Friday so Adele and fans in a pop-up merchandise shop could see each other. He said only a few people were allowed in the shop at a time because of Covid-19 protocols.

Fox shot video of the encounter and you can see Adele smiling and waving and trying to talk the group who were cheering and chanting “It’s okay It’s okay.”

“I had no clue what she was saying because we were just losing our minds” Fox said. “I could tell she was crying and you could tell on her face kind of what she was saying. You didn’t even have to hear it.”

Fox said he remembers her saying something like “this is not how I wanted it to be.”

Friday was supposed to be the first of Adele’s series of concerts at The Colosseum at Caesars Palace that were scheduled to run through April 16.

Adele announced the delay in a tearful Instagram video on Thursday saying “we’ve been absolutely destroyed by delivery delays and Covid.” She said half of her team was “down with Covid.”

Fox who flew from Nashville to Las Vegas just for the concert found out the show wouldn’t be happening just as the jet’s door closed. He said he asked if he could get off but it was too late.

Fox complained about the short notice and the lack of information in a video he posted Friday on TikTok.

He said he understands there’s a pandemic going on but he was still upset disappointed and realizing how much money he’d spent on the flight a room at Caesars Palace and other expenses.

“I’m still feeling the burn financially” he said. “Because it’s Adele I wanted to go all out.”

Later Fox got a message from Adele’s verified Instagram account apologizing and telling him when to go to the gift shop. He asked if it was really her and she sent a voice message saying “yes it is it’s me.” He shared the message in another TikTok video.

Fox said he was the first person in line at the gift shop.

Ticket holders were given gift bags with a T-shirt magnets representing her albums a keychain and other goodies.

The bag said “Hello” at the very bottom referencing her 2015 hit song.

The experience changed what would have been the worst trip ever into “literally being like the coolest story ever” he said.

“It just shows how you’re supposed to treat your fans” said Fox who said he’s a songwriter himself. “There are so many artists who would not do what she’s done.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXmh0dHBzOi8vcGFnZXNpeC5jb20vMjAyMi8wMS8yMi9hZGVsZS1jbGFzaGVkLXdpdGgtbGFzLXZlZ2FzLXZlbnVlLW92ZXItNjAtcGVyc29uLWNob2lyLXJlcG9ydC_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Adele clashed with Las Vegas venue over 60-person choir: report,"Could tension between Adele and her Las Vegas venue have led to her residency being postponed?

Sources at The Daily Mail claim that while the songstress is said to have postponed her “Weekends With Adele” residency due to “delivery delays” and her team coming down with COVID managers and the venue Caesars Palace attempted to make the “perfectionist” perform “Skyfall” with a 60-member choir when she was looking to keep the performance “low-key” and “all about the voice.”

Other insiders believe her admitted stage fright could’ve played a part in the show being postponed in the 11th hour.

The 33-year-old “Easy On Me” singer once admitted during a televised interview “I’m scared of audiences. One show in Amsterdam I was so nervous I escaped out the fire exit. I’ve thrown up a couple of times. Once in Brussels I projectile vomited on someone. I just gotta bear it. But I don’t like touring. I have anxiety attacks a lot.”

“She has cancelled shows before” one insider insisted. “She cancelled two shows in London in 2017 which she said she would reschedule and she never did.”

The Grammy-winner promised to reschedule her Vegas dates during her tear-filled apology for postponing the residency Thursday.

12 But our sources say the production had long been in jeopardy thanks to behind-the-scenes clashes

In a tearful video posted on social media she blamed the last-minute postponement on “half her crew” being off work with Covid.

But our sources say the production had long been in jeopardy thanks to behind-the-scenes clashes including with acclaimed set designer Esmeralda Devlin.

Brit Esmeralda known as Es previously worked with Adele on her world tour in 2016.

But it is understood she and the Hello singer argued in the run-up to the opening night of her latest concerts.

One source told us: “In spite of the set costing millions to put together Adele was unhappy with the result and she made her feelings very clear to Es.

‘Too much indecision’

“She was already nervous and the falling-out sent her spiralling into a panic because she was desperate that everything should be perfect.”

A second source told how the row came after the production had already been thrown into chaos by “endless changes” to the running order.

They revealed: “There was no real clarity around what Adele wanted for the show because of the endless changes being made to the production.

“It seemed that while she has always preferred a stripped-back performance she was under some pressure to come up with a huge extravaganza.

“So there was a constant ricochet between those two versions of what the show should be and it did cause some quite explosive arguments.

12 Our revelations come as Adele tried to win back favour with her fans by FaceTiming them personally with partner Rich Paul

""Most shows have teething problems of one kind or another but there has been a feeling for some time that these shows were heading for disaster.

“It is well known that Adele suffers badly with anxiety when it comes to performing live so it’s hard to imagine her going ahead if she wasn’t happy.”

While Adele’s shows sold out instantly online during the pre-sales period prices on resale websites reportedly began dropping earlier this month.

And tellingly a statement issued by Caesars Palace last week did not mention Covid but noted: “Creating a show of this magnitude is incredibly complex.”

The source added: “Adele was so excited about these shows. But when it came down to it there was too much indecision and conflict for them to work.”

Our revelations come as Adele tried to win back favour with her fans by FaceTiming them personally — and offering them free merchandise.

A message scrawled on a mirror on the Adele store in Caesars Palace yesterday read: “Hi guys I’m so upset to not be with you tonight but I know some of you are here already so please hang out and look at the outfits take pics of anything you want of yourselves and with each other.

“There’s people in the room I worked with on the store and the merch. There’s members of my management here too to show you around.

“And any of you in here who were due to come to the show this weekend can have a gift on me! I’m so sorry again Love Adele x”

Or as a fan might put it: “I came to Vegas to see Adele and all I got was this lousy T-shirt.”

12 The Brit star is said to be making £500000 for each show

Dornan and Cumming's unlikely duet JAMIE DORNAN had a secret karaoke party with thespian Alan Cumming Down Under. While shooting his hit BBC1 drama The Tourist in Adelaide last year Jamie crooned Disney songs with his fellow actor. Jamie said of their unlikely duet: “I don’t love doing karaoke. I need to be really p****d and with people that truly know me and understand me. “In saying that I ended up doing karaoke with Alan. So I brought my kids along and we sang Let It Go from Frozen. It was one of the best moments of my life.”

Oti: stylists more used to Afros now

WHEN Dancing On Ice judge Oti Mabuse started working in the UK seven years ago she said make-up artists and hair stylists didn’t know how to work with her black skin or Afro hair.

Fortunately the South African-born dancer has seen a huge improvement.

12 Oti says she has seen a huge improvement

She said: “I think I’ve got a thicker skin because of where I’m from.

""The last two years in TV have really changed a lot.

""For me seeing colour off camera behind-the-scenes has been so positive.

“Now I can walk into a room and not worry if someone has my make-up foundation shade – that side of things seems small but it’s a big deal.”

Oti is also pleased to see more women of colour fronting TV shows.

She said: “It’s so inspiring to see Alex Scott doing sports shows and Anita Rani having a game show.”

Oti who is touring the UK with her I Am Here show from April to July says she’ll meet with Strictly producers next month to decide her fate on the BBC1 show.

“She added: “Those conversations happen in February.

“It will have to be something we all talk about as a team.”

Hef fell for doc

PLAYBOY boss Hugh Hefner surrounded himself with female “Bunnies” but was actually in love with another bloke.

The claim in a new episode of US documentary Secrets Of Playboy suggests Hefner fell for his live-in doctor Mark Saginor.

12 Playboy boss was actually in love with another bloke it has been claimed

Jennifer Saginor who grew up in the famous Playboy mansion said: “It’s my belief the love of Hef’s life was my father.

""They had a physical relationship in the context of these different orgies.

""The orgies started as something that was an opportunity for people to experience their open sexuality.

“And that sort of turned into something that was a little bit more sinister.

""It was more of a transaction that was exciting and that probably stemmed from their childhood.”

Saginor was later charged with drugging girls and had his medical licence suspended.

The charges were dropped after he checked into rehab.

Jennifer said: “They did start spending time together again especially towards the end of Hef’s life.

""When Hef was passing the one by his side was my father.”

Harry homes in

WITH a net worth of around £63million Harry Styles is in a good position to invest in bricks and mortar.

The former One Direction singer has been looking at expanding his property empire to Cornwall after spending several days at a boutique hotel on the coast there.

“He likes how rugged the landscape is and enjoys connecting with nature.

“He is keen to get a bolthole there and would love to buy a home near the water.

""He’s prepared to spend up to £10million on the right property.”

Harry who already owns three homes in North London was spotted going for a dip in the sea by a fan last week.

He’d be in good company as Gordon Ramsay and Dawn French both have homes in the county.

We look forward to the house-warming . . .

A source said: “It was a lovely invitation and the girls are all excited to attend.

“It will be the first time they have all been together socially for some time so they are looking forward to the chance to really catch up.

“While Nicola has opted to wear two Valentino dresses on the big day they will have their pick of Victoria Beckham dresses if they like.”

The Sun revealed this week that Nicola had decided not to choose her future mother-in-law’s fashion label for her wedding outfits.

Let’s hope that doesn’t put Posh’s nose too far out of joint.

Kelly's hopes with Sid

AS the daughter of the Prince of Darkness the chances of Kelly Osbourne hooking up with a goody two-shoes were never high.

Her new man Slipknot rocker Sid Wilson has a lot in common with Kelly – as they have both battled drug addiction in the past.

12 Kelly revealed she went back into rehab for drink problems in October

Sid became an addict while still in school.

In an interview in 2019 he said cocaine was his least favourite drug because “other things lasted longer and were more powerful”.

He went on to reveal he used to be an “out-of-control lunatic rock star”.

But he now says he “hates drugs” after bandmate Paul Gray died of an overdose in 2010.

So hopefully Sid can help Kelly who revealed she went back into rehab for drink problems in October with any tough spells.

A source said: “Things are going well for them.

“Her dad Ozzy is also a big fan of Sid’s.

""He has said he’d love to be the tenth member of Slipknot.”

Maybe a cameo is in order.

Hilary can relate HILARY DUFF can relate to Britney Spears’s struggles after also being thrown into the spotlight at an early age. She landed the lead role in TV show Lizzie McGuire as a youngster. She said this week: “I 100 per cent relate to and feel for her. It was so unfair what we all did to her. ""Halsey shaves her head and it’s celebrated. “Britney Spears shaved her head a long time ago and it was like ‘She’s gone mental check her into the institution!’ ”

Experts discuss the regulation of bank overdraft fees.

Font Size: A A A

Did you know that you can require your bank to decline a transaction instead of charging an overdraft fee?

If not you are not alone—in a recent study 70 percent of Americans who were charged overdraft fees did not know they had the right to have their bank decline the transaction instead of charging them a fee.

In 2010 rulemakers amended Regulation E to require financial institutions to provide notice to consumers and have them opt-in to overdraft fees. But some advocates believe this regulation does not go far enough to protect consumers from predatory banking practices associated with overdraft fees.

Large banks such as Capital One and Bank of America recently decided to end or greatly reduce the use of these fees despite making an average of $15 billion a year in overdraft fees. Some commentators say this shift comes on the heels of increased interest in regulating these types of fees at the federal level.

The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) for example has stated its intention to intervene in overdraft practices to restore proper competition. CFPB director Rohit Chopra expressed concerns that banks depend on overdraft fees in their profit model rather than compete for the best services and interest rates which has bad outcomes for consumers.

U.S. Senators Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) and Cory Booker (D-N.J.) introduced the Stop Overdraft Profiteering Act of 2021 last August to regulate profits from overdraft fees in the United States. They drafted the act in response to growing concerns about predatory banking practices which predominantly impact low-income communities.

According to the CFPB 80 percent of revenue from overdraft fees comes from just 9 percent of customers who are charged 10 or more times a year for spending above their balance. So low-income individuals pay three times as much to maintain their checking accounts.

In this week’s Saturday Seminar experts discuss recent scholarship on the regulation of overdraft fees.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiNWh0dHBzOi8vZXcuY29tL3R2L3JlY2Fwcy9iaWxsaW9ucy1zZWFzb24tNi1lcGlzb2RlLTEv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,'Billions' premiere recap: Mike Prince takes charge of Axe Cap with a bombshell announcement,"At the end of Billions' fifth season Bobby Axelrod (Damian Lewis) had finally met his match. He was cornered by Chuck Rhoades (Paul Giamatti) with jail time on the horizon. Rather than accept that fate Axe left his whole life behind — including his new romance with Wendy (Maggie Siff) — and fled to Switzerland. That ending left viewers wondering what was next as Lewis chose to depart the show and spend more time with his family after his wife Helen McRory died in 2021. There was obvious worry that the show wouldn't be the same without the Axe-Chuck rivalry at its core.

Those worries are instantly put to bed with the season 6 premiere ""Cannonade."" This is very much still the Billions we know and love. Right off the bat we're treated to Chuck riding a tractor followed by some sort of mob that he's collected through the night to confront someone who's got a bunch of vintage war cannons in his front yard. What the hell is Chuck up to now? In classic Billions fashion we flash back from there and learn what led to this moment.

In the time since Axe fled the country Chuck has purchased a farm and decided to take a ""sabbatical"" doing bits and pieces of work from the farm but mostly letting Kate (Condola Rashad) run the show while he grows sweet corn and milks his cow. He's disillusioned after failing to put Axe away telling Kate that he won't come back until he finds a case that's completely solid.

Meanwhile Mike Prince (Corey Stoll) is trying his best to get everyone at the former Axe Capital to believe in his vision for the future and to see him as a leader (which is a nice bit of meta commentary on the show itself). He's not making much headway and things get worse when Wags discovers that Prince has been collecting the data from health-monitoring rings he gave everyone as a gift when he took over the company. Prince's right-hand man Scooter (Daniel Breaker) actually notices that Wags is having a heart attack and their moral obligation to call the paramedics leads to the discovery causing a slight revolt amongst the employees.

With nowhere else to go Prince goes to Wendy for ideas on how to turn the ship around and get the employees on his side because right now they're not buying into his more gentle approach to business. They're used to the decisive angry Axe and they're not convinced that this man who asks them about their feelings can lead them to more riches. Wendy — who like everyone else is reluctant to work with Prince — tells him that all he can really do is make a bold move to change the culture. He can't keep trying to make amends; he needs to show that he can take the reins and lead by example. It's time to show what he's made of rather than just telling everyone that he can take them into the future.

So Prince calls a meeting and gathers not only all the employees but all of the firm's biggest investors. Here's when he drops a bomb. He tells some of the biggest investors that Mike Prince Capital will not be managing their money anymore that he won't be working with anyone who does dirty business. He promises to clean house and change the moral compass of the company keeping only the New York City Firefighters as clients. He sends everyone else packing and the bold move endears him to the old Axe Cap employees.

Included in that banishment is not only Chuck's father but his most recent rival Melville Revere. Revere played with wonderful arrogance by Better Call Saul's Michael McKean has a tradition of setting off his vintage cannons every morning and night the thunderous blasts disrupting the otherwise idyllic nature of the community. Chuck asks him to tone it down but Revere refuses invoking the constitution like so many old white men before him.

Chuck quickly realizes that most everyone in town despises Revere and his cannons but they can't stand up to him because of his wealth. So Chuck does what Chuck does best. He offers a government conservationist funding for a number of his projects and in exchange the conservationist ""discovers"" (ie: plants them himself) rare protected bog turtles on Revere's property — meaning he's no longer allowed to fire the cannons because the gunpowder residue leaks into the stream and could kill the rare species. It's Chuck at his finest.

""Cannonade"" acts as a near-perfect reset for Billions. It doesn't totally wipe the slate clean but it does show a new way forward for the show with the dynamic between the central characters changing in interesting ways. It's good to have Billions back and even better to see that it's ready to adapt.

The 2022 Toyota Tacoma is a favorite pickup truck so it’s no surprise that it tends to kill it during the spring sales season. While many vehicles sell better in summer used pickup trucks tend to do well in the spring – and the Toyota Tacoma leads them all. What’s so great about the Tacoma and can you expect to see a good price on it in those just-warming-up months?

The 2022 Toyota Tacoma is the best-selling vehicle in the spring

According to CarMax the Toyota Tacoma is the best-selling vehicle in the spring. Considering the fact that CarMax also found that pickup trucks sell the best in the spring the fact that the Tacoma leads them all is quite a feat. So what is it that makes people love the Toyota Tacoma so much? It’s the Taco’s blend of technology capability and style.

The 2022 Toyota Tacoma is a longstanding top truck known for its technology and off-road skill. You can get either a five or six foot bed in the Tacoma. It can also tow up to 6800 pounds.

The Tacoma has a solid engine

The 2022 Toyota Tacoma’s base model has a 2.7-liter four-cylinder engine that makes 159 hp and 180 lb-ft of torque. That’s for the base model the Tacoma SR and the trim level above it the SR5. You can upgrade the engine on those trims to a 3.5-liter V6 engine that makes 278 hp and 265 lb-ft of torque. That engine comes standard on all other Tacoma trim levels including the TRD Sport TRD Off-Road Limited and TRD Pro.

In addition the Toyota Tacoma is one of the longest-lasting pickup trucks you can buy making it a great investment. 2.8% of Toyota Tacomas reach 200000 miles. While this may not sound like much considering the fact that only 1% of vehicles usually get there the Tacoma’s nearly tripled rate makes this a pretty impressive number.

The Tacoma TRD Pro takes things up a notch

The Tacoma TRD Pro is an off-road version of the Toyota Tacoma that will make anyone who likes to venture a little off the road very happy. While different model years will have different equipment the 2022 Tacoma TRD Pro demonstrates what a great truck this is. It comes with 16-inch black-painted TRD wheels with all-terrain tires LED headlights and a black grille. It also includes a hood scoop a thicker front skid plate and internal bypass shock absorbers.

In addition to all this the 2022 Tacoma comes with an upgraded exhaust multi-terrain monitor and a sunroof. You’ll also get a navigation system and some important safety features like blind-spot monitor and rear parking sensors.

The Toyota Tacoma is a pickup truck that offers a lot and people recognize that. Thanks to the Tacoma’s longevity solid engine and upscale interior it is one of the best-selling pickup trucks and the number-one-selling truck in the spring months. Throw in its off-road capability and it’s no wonder the Tacoma is consistently at the top of the sales charts.",,,,,,,,,,,,
CCL,Carnival,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiMmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnR3aW5jaXRpZXMuY29tLzIwMjIvMDEvMjMvdG9tLWJhcnJldHQv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,He is devoted to the St. Paul Winter Carnival — really devoted,"Tom Barrett figures he was in eighth grade when one of his teachers Miss Bell approached him on the playground in the Mac-Groveland neighborhood and suggested he try out for a spot on the Winter Carnival Junior Royalty.

“Do you have a suitcoat?” Yup.

Of course this St. Paul kid had attended his share of parades and events at the St. Paul Winter Carnival. He grabbed his suitcoat and off he went to the competition — without telling his parents. He walked to the contest at a nearby rec center.

And walked home disappointed.

You’d think a thing like that would put a guy off participating in “The Coolest Celebration on Earth.” Especially since his neighbor across the street who did win the junior royalty competition would regale young Tom with tales of parades and royal festivities.

But since the 1990s Barrett has been one of the key players who make the St. Paul Winter Carnival happen.

A member of the Vulcan Krewe Count Embrious in 1993; Vulcanus Rex head of the Vulcan Krewe in 2004; in charge of both Winter Carnival parades for 2022; emcee of the recent Klondike Kate contest; bus tour guide for the Carnival princess candidates for the past 15-16 years; in charge of the hot air balloons used in parades for many years. And those are only the major roles and responsibilities.

“Tommy has a huge heart for Carnival” says former board chair and past festival chair Jen Tamburo. “He’s always there to stand up raise his hand and say ‘I’ll do it.’ ”

Longtime Carnival leader Tamburo says she’s known Barrett for more than 20 years. Though she’s a 2005 East Wind Carnival princess she laughs that she and Barrett share a royal failure. She too lost out on a bid to join the junior royalty many years ago.

Barrett says that as a kid he would sneak out to try to find the Pioneer Press Treasure Hunt medallion and attend Winter Carnival parades. But an incident in 1992 was the spark for joining the Vulcan Krewe. He had a seizure “out of the blue.” He couldn’t drive.

“I started making a bucket list before bucket lists were fashionable.”

He never went back to the Royal Family side of the Winter Carnival. He donned the red jumpsuit helmet cape and goggles in 1993 and was named “Count Embrious” (the Fire King’s Chancellor of the Exchequer “the Young and Romantic One” — usually the youngest member of the Vulcan Krewe that year).

His wife Wanda was OK with that. Though Barrett 64 is no longer young “I’d like to think I’m still romantic.” He calls his wife of more than 40 years “Wonderful Wanda.”

The Barretts met when both were working for the state of Minnesota. He says he didn’t get a paycheck after his first week and went to human resources to check on it. Wanda was working there and Tom claims that when she saw he was single she asked him out. They have one son and over the years the Barretts hosted nine foreign exchange students.

Barrett was director of the Minnesota Gambling Control Board from 1990 through his retirement two years ago. Appointed by then-Gov. Jesse Ventura Barrett says he worked for one independent one Republican and a couple of Democratic governors. Before that he worked for the Minnesota Lottery.

About the Vulcans

Barrett provides a bit of history: The Vulcans have been part of the 135-year-old Winter Carnival since 1886 when the Fire King was known as Fire King Coal then Ignius Rex Fire King Rex and since 1916 Vulcan Rex or Vulcanus Rex. Vulcan Rex VI was the first Fire King to have a Krewe run with him — the first Krewe to ride a firetruck officially the first Krewe to bestow the “mark” and the first Krewe to wear a running suit cape helmet and goggles. According to Carnival legend each year the Vulcans do battle with King Boreas and his winter royal family at the close of the festivities and each year they win ensuring that heat and warmth will again return to St. Paul.

In fact when you meet Barrett he’s likely to ask whether you like hot or cold summer or winter winning or losing. Choose warmth and winners and you’re on the Vulcan side.

In 2004 Barrett led his own seven-member Krewe as the Fire King Vulcanus Rex LXVII. That was the year there was an Ice Palace constructed in the open lot across from the Xcel Energy Center.

Barrett knows talk about the Vulcans is bound to bring up stories about inappropriate behavior years ago. He says he’s always encouraged his Krewes to “do the right thing.”

“Let’s bring it to the people” Barrett says.

And that’s what the Vulcans do he adds. The Krewe visits hospitals and nursing homes usually traveling on the Vulcan firetruck named Luverne a 1932 firetruck built in Luverne Minn. and believed to be the only one of its type left. Barrett remembers a frigid day in 2004 when he and the Krewe were headed to visit a young cancer patient in Woodbury. They took the interstate and three of the Vulcans riding on the back of the truck got frostbite but the child’s reaction was worth it Barrett says.

“I’ll never forget it” he adds. “It doesn’t matter how cold it is just get out there and do it.”

“But we took a slower route home.”

He says the Krewe becomes family during the run of Carnival. And even though they battle Boreas and the royal family for control of the weather the whole group forms a bond.

Vulcanus Rex spends about $30000 out of his own pocket to be Fire King Barrett says. After their Carnival year Vulcans can join Fire and Brimstone the fraternal organization of past Vulcans.

Beyond the Carnival royals and Vulcans Barrett’s known by most everyone who’s been involved in the annual event for many years.

Molly Steinke who has been doing media and public relations for Winter Carnival for almost 15 years through the Nemer Fieger PR agency is effusive: “Tommy Barrett was one of the first people we met when Nemer Fieger began working with the St. Paul Winter Carnival in 2008” she says. “Ever since he’s been my go-to guy for any advice or questions about Carnival history and contacts. His enthusiasm for the Winter Carnival along with that big welcoming smile of his makes him so endearing. Everybody loves Tommy B! He’s truly one of the coolest people involved in the ‘Coolest Celebrations on Earth.’ ”

And then there’s the collection …

Barrett has binders filled with pins and programs piles of photos and clippings. Framed paintings and proclamations posters and pictures line the walls of the stairwell to the basement of his house. There are the buttons his son Nick designed for the 2009 Winter Carnival. At the foot of the stairs is a mannequin wearing the full Vulcan garb Barrett wore as Count Embrious with the 1993 Krewe.

In his bounty of buttons is a metal disk about the size of a dime from the 1887 Winter Carnival. He has special Carnival pins given to veterans to wear after World War II.

Framed on the wall near his Vulcan mannequin is a print of one of the first ice palaces. It was found in the wall of a house after a tornado ripped through St. Peter in 1998.

But Barrett’s basement treasures go far beyond Winter Carnival. He’s been collecting autographs and memorabilia for years — sports heroes celebrities newsmakers. The autographs are displayed with helmets album covers newspaper pages. There are baseball bats seats from the Metrodome boxing gloves. Glass cases line the walls and there’s the outfit Barrett wore when he was named “Mr. Pat” during St. Patrick’s Day festivities in St. Paul in 2008.

The Beatles Babe Ruth a 1939 Donald Duck signed by Walt Disney JFK. The front page of the St. Paul Pioneer Press from July 20 1969 is autographed by Neil Armstrong Michael Collins and Buzz Aldrin. Barrett sent the newspaper to the astronauts who signed it and sent it back.

Not all of the autographs were collected in person by Barrett but they’ve all been authenticated. His first autograph he says is the signature of the Minnesota Vikings first head coach Norm Van Brocklin. Barrett’s dad was part of a group of businessmen who helped get Met Stadium built and brought professional football to Minnesota.

He takes pieces from the collection and works them into framed wall displays that he’s entered into the Minnesota State Fair often bringing home the top ribbon.

What’s most special to him in the collection? Barrett doesn’t hesitate and walks to a photo display near the stairway. “Minnesotan Charles Lindberg” he says. “But not the famous aviator.”

Lindberg from Richfield was one of the soldiers who helped capture Mount Suribachi and raised the American flag in the Battle of Iwo Jima during World War II Barrett explains. Lindberg was in the bloody battle but he’s not in the famous photo of the flag-raising. That photo was shot hours later when the first flag was replaced.

A photo of the first (and only) female Vulcan in 1952 Kitty Ryan comes with a classic Barrett Carnival tale. Kitty Ryan was 14 at the time and chosen as a Vulcan that year because of her ability to twirl flaming batons Barrett says. He’d long been intrigued by the story but had never been able to track her down. In 2004 when Barrett was Vulcanus Rex he got a call requesting the Vulcan Krewe at a cancer benefit in Stillwater. The group was already booked and he was about to turn the caller down when she said her name was Kitty Ryan Johnson. “I have a photo of you on my wall at home” he told her.

The Vulcans went to the benefit and Barrett has another photo of Kitty Ryan from that day now hanging just below the black-and-white image of the young baton-twirler.

During the 2022 Winter Carnival which starts Jan. 28 Barrett says he’ll probably be out at the Vulcan Snow Park at the Fairgrounds every day. And he’ll be wrangling the Grande Day Parade on Jan. 29 and the Torchlight Parade on Feb. 5. (He hasn’t missed a Winter Carnival parade since 1993 he says.)

Wonderful Wanda doesn’t plan to be out as much as other years. She wants to avoid COVID-19 contact so she can spend time with their granddaughters Olivia and Mara son Nick and daughter-in-law Heather.

But former Vulcanus Rex Tommy Barrett will be there. He’ll be pretty much everywhere.

The vessel is welcoming guests back today for its first Caribbean voyage since December.

The eight-night voyage will feature calls in four ports in the Southern Caribbean including a 14-hour stop in Aruba.

Sailing year-round from Miami Carnival Horizon’s program also includes six-night cruises to the Western Caribbean in addition to varied eight-night itineraries to the Southern Caribbean.

The service resumption comes nearly two months after the 4000-guest vessel was taken out of service to fix a propulsion problem in drydock. The downtime was also used to adorn the Horizon with the brand’s new red white and blue livery.

To pick up the Horizon’s guests and itineraries from Miami Carnival brought the Carnival Liberty and Carnival Sunshine back to service.

The 133500-ton Horizon is part of the three-ship Vista-class. it originally entered service in 2018. According to Carnival the vessels series was designed to connect guests to the ocean with “sweeping views” and plenty activities outdoors and indoors.

Among the ships’ unique features is the SkyRide – a suspended open-air cycling experience. The Vista class also introduced new specialty food and beverage options such as the New England-inspired Seafood Shack – a casual indoor/outdoor dining venue.

With most of its fleet now back in service Carnival plans to have all of its U.S.-based ships sailing again soon.

Carnival Cruise Line is set to pilot new embarkation requirements for some of its cruises over the next few weeks as the cruise industry giants commit to finding the safest ways to keep on carrying out their cruises. The return of the cruise industry has been full of changes with restrictions requirements and itineraries changing on an almost weekly basis as cruise lines big and small react to the Covid-19 situation around the world.

It's been a mixed start to the new year for the cruise industry. Whilst many will be simply relieved to have started the new year with cruises underway several cruise lines have been seriously affected by the pandemic causing several planned voyages to be canceled – even mid-cruise in some cases. However Carnival's changes could put a stop to that. Here's a look at Carnival's new embarkation requirements and how they can help to keep cruises safe and smooth for passengers in the future.

Carnival's New Requirements – Information For Travelers

With so many positive cases of Covid-19 being detected on board cruise ships over the past few weeks cruise lines are reevaluating their protocols to ensure guests are kept as safe as possible on their trips. In their quest for safety and convenience Carnival have decided to trial a system that will see passengers submit key Covid-19 related information before they go on to board the cruise ship – with a little help from the airline industry.

This week Carnival revealed their plans to begin using a system that many travelers may already be familiar with – VeriFLY. A program that has been widely used in the airline industry VeriFLY allows passengers to upload various pieces of information such as proof of vaccination and of Covid-19 testing which can then be verified ahead of departure by Carnival – ensuring everyone meets the requirements needed to set sail.

The pilot program was set to begin on Saturday 22nd January in Port Canaveral Florida for guests boarding the huge 6500 passenger Mardi Gras cruise line bound for the Eastern Caribbean. Whilst it is only a trial at this stage it is expected that Carnival will move quickly to extend the use of VeriFLY for passenger status verification across its entire fleet streamlining the process for thousands of cruise enthusiasts.

Adding the use of VeriFLY isn't the only change that Carnival is planning to make cruising easier for its guests. The cruise line is also looking towards finalizing its plans to expand its testing capabilities for vaccinated passengers in-terminal prior to embarkation specifically for those passengers who are heading off on short three and four day long voyages.

Carnival also intends to keep the same operating protocols it had during the Conditional Sail Order despite the order expiring last weekend. That means the cruise line's “Have Fun. Be Safe.” rules are set to remain in place including the mandatory wearing of masks on board and the need to be fully vaccinated in order to sail with Carnival.

With how we travel having changed so much since the start of the pandemic the introduction of VeriFLY will hopefully make the cruising experience much smoother for passengers whilst moves such as keeping on-board restrictions and the expansion of in-terminal testing facilities are bound to offer passengers peace of mind and less to worry about on the open seas.

Qatar Airways has been locked for months in a legal dispute with Europe’s Airbus manufacturer over “serious and legitimate safety concerns” after a delivery of A350 jets.

Qatar’s state-owned airline is seeking compensation saying the flawed planes forced it to ground 21 of its fleet of 53 Airbus A350s in both its 1000 and 900 series.

Here are some key facts:

How did the dispute begin?

Qatar’s national carrier raised concerns over the state of its A350s in November 2020 when an attempt to repaint a five-year-old jet in World Cup livery exposed about 980 defects.

According to a Reuters news agency investigation at least five other airlines including Finnair Cathay Pacific Etihad Lufthansa and Air France raised concerns in 2016 – well before Qatar Airways – but they did not ground their aircraft.

France-based Airbus acknowledged that the flaws needed attention while insisting they were cosmetic issues and did not put safety at risk.

Qatar Airways said Airbus failed to provide a full root-cause analysis needed to satisfy unresolved questions over the airworthiness of the affected jets including the lightning protection system.

On December 20 last year Qatar Airways sued Airbus in the UK. The case is due for a hearing in late April.

What are the issues?

The airline’s complaint says the paint on the recently delivered Airbus A350s was cracking and peeling exposing copper meshing used to insulate the aircraft against lightning strikes.

It published a video on social media on Friday of the scarred exterior of grounded A350 jets.

The clip showed areas of peeling or missing paint cracks and damage to anti-lightning protection as well as what the airline described as patches of carbon fibre that were exposed to moisture and potentially damaging ultraviolet light.

The lightweight carbon-fibre jetliner relies on metallic foil embedded beneath the paint to help lightning wash safely over the fuselage which is less conductive than earlier metal.

The video showed flakes of the copper-mesh anti-lightning system which is supposed to be fixed to the plane with resin coming loose when the paint was teased away by a gloved hand.

What is the airline demanding?

Qatar Airways is pressing for compensation of $618m plus $4m a day and has stopped the receipt of 23 more A350s.

Its legal case detailed how the Qatar Civil Aviation Authority (QCAA) had started withdrawing flying permits for individual A350 planes in a series of letters from June 2021.

It said the QCAA told Airbus the aeroplane’s deterioration was “disturbing if not alarming”.

Airbus has said it will fight the claim saying there is “no reasonable or rational basis” for the groundings which have not happened elsewhere.

What is Airbus’s stance?

Airbus says that it is looking at changing the design of the anti-lightning mesh for future A350s but insists there is adequate backup lightning protection. It says Qatar Airways is undermining global protocols by seeking leverage over safety.

Airbus says it has provided the relevant information and concluded there is no airworthiness risk a view echoed by Europe’s air regulator.

On Friday Airbus cancelled a $6bn contract with Qatar Airways for 50 of its new A321neo passenger jets escalating the legal battle.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiU2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFyaXNlLnR2L3VzLXN1c3BlbmRzLTQ0LWZsaWdodHMtYnktY2hpbmVzZS1jYXJyaWVycy1hZnRlci1jaGluYS1hY3Rpb24v0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,US Suspends 44 Flights By Chinese Carriers after China Action,"The U.S. government said on Friday it would suspend 44 China-bound flights from the United States by four Chinese carriers in response to the Chinese government’s decision to suspend some U.S. carrier flights over COVID-19 concerns.

The suspensions will begin on Jan. 30 with Xiamen Airlines’ scheduled Los Angeles-to-Xiamen flight and run through March 29 the Transportation Department said.

The decision will cut some flights by Xiamen Air China China Southern Airlines and China Eastern Airlines.

Since Dec. 31 Chinese authorities have suspended 20 United Airlines  10 American Airlines and 14 Delta Air Lines flights after some passengers tested positive for COVID-19. As recently as Tuesday the Transportation Department said the Chinese government had announced new U.S. flight cancellations.

Liu Pengyu a spokesman for the Chinese Embassy in Washington said Friday the policy for international passenger flights entering China has “been applied equally to Chinese and foreign airlines in a fair open and transparent way.”

He called the U.S. move “very unreasonable” and added “We urge the U.S. side to stop disrupting and restricting the normal passenger flights” by Chinese airlines.”

Airlines for America a trade group representing the three U.S. carriers affected by China’s move along with others said it supported Washington’s action “to ensure the fair treatment of U.S. airlines in the Chinese market.”

The Transportation Department said France and Germany have taken similar action against China’s COVID-19 actions. It said China’s suspension of the44 flights “are adverse to the public interest and warrant proportionate remedial action.” It added that China’s “unilateral actions against the named U.S. carriers are inconsistent” with a bilateral agreement.

China has also suspended numerous U.S. flights by Chinese carriers after passengers later tested positive.

The department said it was prepared to revisit its action if China revised its “policies to bring about the necessary improved situation for U.S. carriers.” It warned that if China cancels more flights “we reserve the right to take additional action.”

China has all but shut its borders to travelers cutting total international flights to just 200 a week or 2% of pre-pandemic levels the Civil Aviation Administration of China (CAAC) said in September.

The number of U.S. flights being scrapped has surged since December as infections caused by the highly contagious Omicron variant of the coronavirus soared to record highs in the United States.

Beijing and Washington have sparred over air services since the start of the pandemic. In August the U.S. Transportation Department limited four flights from Chinese carriers to 40% passenger capacity for four weeks after Beijing imposed identical limits on four United Airlines flights.

Before the recent cancellations three U.S. airlines and four Chinese carriers were operating about 20 flights a week between the countries well below the figure of more than 100 per week before the pandemic.

At the intersection of the Rue Beaubourg and the Rue du Renard in Paris along the roughest edge of the Marais it took the form of a big new multipurpose public building—médiathèque cinémathèque bibliothèque musée—in tempered glass and cast steel. At a hundred and forty-nine feet tall the building was well above the general height limit of some sixty feet—established during the nineteenth-century reign of Napoleon III by the Baron Georges-Eugène Haussmann—that still gives central Paris its relentlessly charming conformity. It looked like something between an oil refinery and the deck of a container ship. It was the Pompidou Center inaugurated on that day by the President of the French Republic Valéry Giscard d’Estaing and named for his late precursor in that office Georges Pompidou. That earlier President had by acceding to an unusually wide-open 1971 design competition featuring more than six hundred entries from forty-nine countries caused the building to be designed by a small group of men who by the traditionally geriatric standards of architects were then achingly young. These were the engineers Edmund (Ted) Happold and Peter Rice (who with Ove Arup had recently helped realize the Danish architect Jørn Utzon’s Sydney Opera House) plus the designers Gianfranco Franchini and John Young and more famously Renzo Piano and his senior design partner Richard Rogers—who died in December 2021 aged eighty-eight.

At the July 1971 ceremony announcing the competition results Pompidou wore a presidential suit and tie but the other men looked like the Beatles on the cover of “Abbey Road”: the Genoese Piano sported the bushy-beard-and-tweed-and-corduroy uniform of an Oxbridge intellectual; the shaggy Anglo-Italian Rogers just like George Harrison on that London crosswalk wore head-to-toe worker’s denim in the manner of a British railwayman. A prominent design critic of the era compared the building precisely to the Beatles’ yellow submarine from the eponymous 1968 film: an uncanny vessel—colorful forcefully cheerful menacingly charismatic—that surfaces in the heart of an unsuspecting city. “When President Pompidou looked at the drawings” Rogers recalled “all he said was ‘Ça va faire crier.’ ” (“This is going to make some noise.”)

What made the Pompidou Center such an incarnation of futurity was the effort of its creators to translate the agony and ecstasy the tactical spontaneity the immediacy of the urban street protests student actions and other countercultural spatial practices of its times—Paris Vietnam civil rights Earth Day and the bomb—into the built environment. The Pompidou Center partially did this by burying half of itself underground and ceding half of its territory to a new public plaza that was ramped slightly down in the direction of the façade just as a theatre floor tilts in the direction of its stage—a tilt that enabled a crowd in the plaza to see itself. As for the plaza’s backdrop the objectives were to enable a big urban building to become as lively as a village green during a fair or as a street during a people’s occupation; to literally accelerate and mobilize such a building using high technology; to apply steel structural frames and cinema screens and scrolling signage and other mechanical marvels from construction cranes to the bright lights seen in Times Square; and to combine and deploy such devices deep within the hearts of cities. All these moving and shining parts could both harvest and catalyze the energy of the people in the streets.

The winning competition entry featured adjustable floors and illuminated interactive signs on which to post architecturally scaled texts—such as the cryptic fragment in a celebrated concept drawing “ANIMATED MOVIES PRODUCTION FOR THE COMPUTER TECHNIQUE…” or more prosaically in another drawing “CAROLINE GO TO KANSAS CITY IMMEDIATELY YOUR FRIEND LINDA HAS BEEN BUSTED.” All this was in the air back then. The Montreal Expo in 1967 and the Osaka Expo in 1970 featured geodesic domes graphic multiscreen Pop-art-adjacent cinematic projection spectacles bold supergraphics and tumescent pneumatics that expressed an improbable confluence of space-age technical acumen Parisian barricade-making and Swinging London aspirational sex appeal. Piano’s independent scheme for the Italian industrial pavilion at the Osaka Expo a stretchy tent in a delicate steel frame prompted Rogers to suggest that the two partner for the Pompidou. A direct precedent for their competition entry was the 1961 Fun Palace an unbuilt project legendary among Anglophilic and utopian designers developed by the visionary architect Cedric Price with the patronage of the theatrical director Joan Littlewood and later the collaboration of the cybernetician and psychologist Gordon Pask. Price a commanding contrarian who taught at London’s Architectural Association during Rogers’s time there as a student built almost nothing—save for an epic bird cage at the London Zoo—but influenced in the enclosed habitat that was the mid-twentieth-century trans-Atlantic architecture scene almost everything.

Price and Littlewood’s name for the Fun Palace evoked London’s historic Crystal Palace the popular success of the Great Exhibition of 1851 which gathered all the machines and marvels of the British Empire plus some tall preëxisting elms on its Hyde Park site under one vast glass-and-iron enclosure a kit-of-parts structure later unbuilt and rebuilt far south of the Thames before it burned down in 1936. The Fun Palace was designed to go even faster. It was to be a kind of life-size Erector Set or Tinker Toy an inhabitable magical box of machines and screens that could be continuously unmade and remade by its users for entertainment expression education and social action—a new kind of commons crossed with a circus—realizing Littlewood’s theatrical project of blurring the antiquated distinctions between actors and audiences. It would have been what Price called an “anti-building.” Construction sites all scaffoldings and cranes and trucks tend to be more interesting places than the buildings they eventually yield: the Fun Palace solved this problem by being designed to be forever unfinished. And like a garden it would both invite and require constant tending.

Other significant influences on the Pompidou Center’s design were the psychedelic technological visions of Archigram an informal supergroup of British architects who in the sixties and seventies published a periodical “architectural telegram” featuring vivid depictions of walking cities and wearable cybernetic devices. These were sensational sublimations of the war machines that their designers had experienced as children during the Second World War. It was at the Pompidou Center that something of all this future—with a complicating assist from state power—finally came down to Earth at scale and for real. In the early years more people went there than up the Eiffel Tower. Designed for five thousand visitors a day by the turn of the twenty-first century the building accommodated five times that amount and has seen an estimated two hundred and fifty million people since its opening. Early visitors were perhaps in an especially French way thrilled to be scandalized and scandalized to be thrilled. A critic for Le Monde called the new building “a kind of architectural King Kong.”

But you could say that this particular future of 1977 just like that great ape didn’t last long. Before the building opened the influential Anglo-American design critic Reyner Banham struck a preëmptively elegiac note observing that “Pompidou’s . . . transparency and color seem even truer nowadays to the departed aspirations of ‘the swinging 60s.’ ” “Seen against the low raking winter sunlight in the fresh snow of the last day of 1976 the west facade flashed with those ‘explosions of fire ice and light’ that we were bidden to observe with our ‘third eyes of the soul’ a psychedelic decade earlier” he wrote. Between the administrations of the liberal Pompidou and the austere d’Estaing the building’s construction budget was slashed. No more moving floors. What was left was one very big idea. The building was conceptually inside out: all of its steel structure was an exoskeleton which meant not only vast flexible hangarlike clear spans for the interiors but also a kind of structural legibility and systematic transparency that served as a case study—if only by visual allegory—for how a better society political machinery and all might work. Huge ducts and pipes—variously color-coded blue for air-conditioning red for escalators and elevators green for water yellow for electrics—all snaked across the surface of the building with the fascinating jolie laide beauty of a car engine without its hood.

A setback in the building’s own history was a decision made around the turn of the millenium to start charging people to ride the signature monumental escalator that zigzags like a glass caterpillar up its side to a spectacular observation deck above. The fact of a ticket segregated the space of the building from the space of the city turning citizens into consumers. Far from the dream of the continually under-construction Fun Palace the Pompidou Center will be fully closed between 2023 and 2027 for restoration and asbestos remediation. The jury that selected Rogers and Piano’s design included not only the pioneering modern architects Jean Prouvé Oscar Niemeyer and Jørn Utzon but also the powerful American socialite curator and designer Philip Johnson—whose lifelong specialty was the assimilation of successive avant-garde aesthetics into cultural and institutional establishments. And for all the small-“d” democratic vibes of the people’s palace that bears his name it was Georges Pompidou who as the Prime Minister for President Charles de Gaulle did much to anticlimactically conclude the Paris student movements that were 1968’s most prominent expression.

A generation older than those students Rogers had been a well-connected Florentine refugee from Fascism whose fortuitous ancestry brought him to England in 1938. Starting at age six he went through that nation’s famously punishing boarding schools from which military service plus an education at London’s Architectural Association and Yale University—under the tutelage of the American Brutalist hero Paul Rudolph—gave him a creative outlet and professional identity immune to both his then undiagnosed dyslexia and his insider-outsider status within Britain’s brittle and nativist class system.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5ld3MyNC5jb20vbmV3czI0L2JpLWFyY2hpdmUvbW9zdC1leHBlbnNpdmUtbGVnby1zZXRzLWluLXNvdXRoLWFmcmljYS0yMDIyLTIwMjItMdIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,The most expensive Lego in SA includes Star Wars sets and a scale Titanic – that cost over R10000,"This article forms part of the archives of Business Insider South Africa which was published as a partnership between News24 and Insider Inc between 2018 and 2023.

Lego is a toy that's survived multiple generations and is no longer just for kids.

The company has created a niche appeal among adults and collectors who buy sets for upwards of R10000.

Most high-end Lego sets are Star Wars-themed but other pricey buys include a Titanic scale model Caterpillar bulldozer and luxury cars.

Investing in Lego isn't exactly going to aid your retirement.

But picking the right set might make you a few grand - if you don't break the seal and know what to look for.

These are the most expensive Lego sets currently for sale in South Africa.

In 2020 Danish company Lego generated a net profit of more than R23 billion. The company has survived an expired patent increase in competition near-bankruptcy and the rise of video and mobile games to remain one of the world's largest toy companies.

It hasn't all been plain sailing though. After a financial crisis in the early 2000s the family behind Lego sold Legoland in a desperate bid to stay afloat. The once family-run business eventually changed its management structure cut unprofitable sets streamlined its production of various pieces and started licensing products alongside big movie releases.

Today many of the most expensive and sought-after Lego sets are based on a franchise or recognised brand: Star Wars Harry Potter various luxury or nostalgic vehicles and an increasing number of historical attractions.

Investing in Lego

According to the founder of an official South African Lego retailer Kiddiwinks Bryony Poulter Lego sets and even individual pieces sometimes increase in value particularly sets that contain unique pieces or characters.

""The more uncommon a piece the more it drives up the value. A great example is the Lego goat which has only ever been in one set - Mill Village Raid.""

According to Poulter a second-hand goat can sell for R1500 - which is more than the cost of the original set.

Poulter says Lego Ideas Creator Expert and some Technic sets are always good options for investors.

""This is because the demand for these sets usually remains for several years after they're retired by The Lego Group particularly given the collectability of them"" Poulter says.

Poulter says in the retail market Lego usually sets prices based on piece count size and licensing. She also points out that there isn't usually a noticeable price variation for sets that require a new piece mould which is surprising given that a new mould can allegedly cost over R3 million.

The secondhand Lego market is also a popular place for collectors and investors where Poulter says the price is almost always based on availability once Lego retires the set.

""If a set was released in limited quantities it will have a higher resale value. Good examples of this are the Lego collectable Minifigures and Lego Super Mario Character Packs. Some series release with only one or two of a particular Minifigure or character which immediately drives up the resell value of so-called 'chase Minifigures'"".

If you're looking to pick up a high-end secondhand Lego set Poulter has some advice.

""The box condition is very important in looking to purchase a set for investment so it is best to purchase from a retailer that values and looks after the boxes too"" she says.

These are the most expensive Lego sets currently for sale in South Africa:

Bugatti Chiron - R7299 each

The Lego Bugatti Chiron is consistently one of the more expensive new Lego sets you'll find in South Africa - if you can. As with the real thing getting your hands on one of these Bugattis isn't easy which is perhaps why it's 17% more expensive than it was two years ago.

Ewok Village - R7450

Kiddiwinks and Great Yellow Brick sell this set for between R13999 and R15499 when in stock but in the past it's gone for as much as R18000.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmtlbnRsaXZlLm5ld3Mvd2hhdHMtb24vZmFtaWx5LWtpZHMvd2Fsa2VkLWJsdWV3YXRlcnMtcGVhY2VmdWwtbmF0dXJlLXRyYWlsLTY1MTkxNTjSAWJodHRwczovL3d3dy5rZW50bGl2ZS5uZXdzL3doYXRzLW9uL2ZhbWlseS1raWRzL3dhbGtlZC1ibHVld2F0ZXJzLXBlYWNlZnVsLW5hdHVyZS10cmFpbC02NTE5MTU4LmFtcA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,I walked Bluewater's peaceful Nature Trail and left feeling very nostalgic,"Something went wrong please try again later.

While we are in the colder part of the year now there's no denying that a good nature walk can do an absolute world of good.

Whether you're in the throes of a stressful job or leading a life of leisure keeping in touch with nature is never a bad thing and provides a welcome chance to forget about the stack of emails in your inbox or that big meeting on Monday.

I tend to jump at the opportunity to escape on a peaceful countryside walk or nature trail to help clear out the old noggin and take a breather.

From country parks to nature reserves Kent has got so much to offer for those that like to explore the greener side of things.

What you might not know however is that you can find an equally peaceful walk through the quieter side of life on the doorstep of one of the county's favourite shopping centres.

The Bluewater Nature Trail is just outside of the main centre and offers a welcome peaceful escape for visitors at the end of a thorough shopping spree because everyone knows just how stressful spending a whole day hunting for that perfect pair of jeans can be.

Complete with a theme surrounding the beloved children's book The Very Hungry Caterpillar this trail takes you around Swan Lake and is the perfect place to cap off a trip to Bluewater.

So I took the time today to see just what the Bluewater Nature Trail had to offer.

My walk along the trail

Upon beginning the trail I was very quickly greeted by the very familiar face of one particular famished caterpillar.

Immediately I knew this walk would be an absolute hit with young ones and would provide some much needed space to blow off that built up energy after following their parents around every shop that wasn't the Lego or Disney store.

I was immediately taken aback by how quickly the surrounding sounds of a busy shopping centre seemed to drop out and I was left feeling truly peaceful.

A spot like this would do absolute wonders during the height of Christmas shopping where the simple task of finding and buying a lynx Africa box set becomes about as stressful as open heart surgery battling against the tides of shoppers.

After contending with that everyone and anyone would benefit from a peaceful stroll around Swan Lake to get those blood pressure levels back to normal before the journey home.

There is something so instantly calming and soothing about the smell of fresh air accompanied by the sounds of various wildlife going about their day.

Across my adventure on the trail I was greeted with a number of artwork pieces and sculptures built by local sculptor Steven Porchmouth relating to The Very Hungry Caterpillar that really got me in the nostalgic mindset.

(Image: KentLive)

I have a very distinct memory of doing a primary school play centred around the book in which I played the pivotal role of the chocolate cake that my teacher insisted on calling a gateau an excellent word to try and get a 6 year old to pronounce and spell.

Childhood trauma of being dressed up as a big bit of cake in front of literally all my peers aside seeing all these characters and pages from the classic picture book did get the nostalgia flowing and really added a lot to the trip.

The little ones are encouraged to find all the signs about The Very Hungry Caterpillar across the trail as well as numerous other activities along the way another great way to get them involved and get them exploring the outside world.

Along the way are some proper play areas for the kids to make the most of as well.

Clearly children were a massive focus for this nature trail which I felt was a really nice touch I spent so much time in my formative years playing outside so I'm always so supportive of getting kids involved in this sort of thing.

(Image: KentLive)

As I say this would be the perfect spot to bring the young ones after a busy day at the shopping centre sitting beside lake watching all the different wildlife really did feel rather special and is an experience I'd leap at to take part in again.

In 2016 shareholders voted to retain the asset but the fixed-term syndicate is reaching maturity and shareholders have voted to sell in the hot market for a return of capital.

At the time of completion in 2010 the building was valued at $173 million—if it sells for more than $360 million it will have doubled in value in just over a decade.

As we make big decisions in how we generate electricity provide heat to our homes and businesses and build our transportation system we can’t afford to build new fossil fuel infrastructure that will continue our dependence on fossil fuels - coal oil and so-called “natural” gas.

The fossil fuel industry really wants us to believe that ""natural gas"" is clean. The truth is that ""natural gas"" is primarily methane — a potent and dangerous greenhouse gas. It is more accurately called methane gas or fossil gas.

Our climate can’t afford methane gas

In the most recent climate report from the IPCC (Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change) methane was highlighted as a particular concern “because it has an outsized impact on the climate. The gas makes up a tiny fraction of our atmosphere — CO2 levels are more than 200 times higher. But in the first 20 years after release methane is around 80 times more powerful than CO2 at trapping heat in Earth’s atmosphere.”

Methane gas is burned in electricity-generating power plants and industrial processes and for home heating cooling and cooking. 2 out of 3 homes in Minnesota use methane gas for heating. When methane gas is burned it releases CO2 (and other air pollutants) into the atmosphere.

Methane gas is also released directly into the atmosphere during extraction (primarily through fracking in the US). A significant amount of it also leaks into the atmosphere when it is transported by pipelines. Using satellite imagery scientists are finding that more methane gas is leaking into the atmosphere than we have been estimating and much of the leakage is not being counted at all.

Methane gas is also released during oil extraction and if there isn’t a way to capture the methane it is “flared” or burned releasing CO2 into the atmosphere.

So why is it viewed as “clean”?

The fossil fuel industry has spent a lot of money to sell us lies about methane gas including promoting unsafe gas stoves placing pro-fossil fuel ads on social media and google and downplaying negative health effects of gas appliances.

Industry talking points also rely on comparing methane gas with coal. When burned methane gas releases about half of the CO2 and much less of other air pollutants than coal. However that doesn’t account for the methane gas leakage during extraction and transportation which makes the climate impact about the same for a coal or gas plant. But comparing methane with coal is missing the point entirely; methane gas isn’t currently competing with coal it’s competing with clean energy! And wind solar batteries electric stoves and electric heat pumps can cost-effectively replace methane gas without emitting climate or other air pollutants.

Are there other risks to methane gas?

Methane gas is not clean healthy or affordable.



In addition to exacerbating climate change burning gas releases other air pollutants like nitrogen oxides that impact people’s health and environment. While NOx is damaging on its own — causing coughing wheezing asthma attacks reduced lung function and respiratory inflammation — it also reacts with other chemicals in the air to form ozone.



Burning gas in homes for home heating (gas furnaces) and cooking (gas stoves) exposes people to pollutants linked to serious health risks including decreased lung function asthma attacks nervous system damage heart attacks strokes cancer and death.



Two-thirds of the methane gas used in the US is extracted through fracking a process that pollutes air and water contributes to climate change and induces earthquakes. Check out Sierra Club’s Fracking 101 Video.



Methane gas is a danger to all communities risking public health environmental devastation and climate disruption. But building new gas infrastructure is a particular danger to communities of color who bear a disproportionate burden from pipeline construction and the other consequences of fossil gas.



Fossil gas is more expensive and will be harder on MN’s pocketbooks than renewables. By retiring gas and investing heavily in renewables we can unlock a thriving clean energy economy for the long-term. Energy from sources like wind and solar power resources we produce right here in our own state are already cheaper than producing energy from new fossil gas plants.



Want to dig into the data? Read the full report on fossil gas facts from the Sierra Club and MN 350



Are we still investing in new methane gas infrastructure in Minnesota?

Unfortunately yes.



Despite widespread support and movement towards 100% clean electricity in Minnesota Xcel Energy and Minnesota Power are still proposing building NEW methane gas plants and the Rochester Public Utilities Commission is also considering building a new gas plant.



At the same time gas utilities continue to invest in the gas system for homes and businesses. Despite announcing a climate pledge last year CenterPoint Energy Minnesota’s largest gas utility is planning a $1.7 billion gas pipeline expansion (nationally) and is fighting efforts to curb fossil fuel reliance at the local level. Gas utilities like CenterPoint are also promoting fuels like “Renewable Natural Gas” as climate friendly alternatives to gas so they can justify continued investments in the gas system despite the limited opportunity and high cost.

How Can You Help?

Sierra Club is working with the Energy We Can’t Afford coalition to raise awareness about methane/fossil gas and work towards a transition from gas to clean energy. You can help by:

Spreading the word! The Energy We Can’t Afford Coalition launched a billboard and virtual ad campaign in December. Share our image on social media and make sure your community knows the risk of methane gas.



Taking Action! Join our list of action takers: Methane Gas: An Energy We Can’t Afford in Minnesota If you get your electricity from Minnesota Power sign our petition to oppose Minnesota Power’s proposed gas plant. Minnesotans Deserve 100% Clean Equitable Energy in the Northland



Climate change is here in Minnesota and methane gas is only accelerating it. We can’t commit to more pollution and climate-harming emissions by building new fossil gas infrastructure - we need a just transition to 100% clean energy. There is no room for methane gas in our clean energy future.

So what are they waiting for? People there keep telling me they need asset prices of merger partners to “normalize” aka fall enough so Goldman remains in control of the combined company.

Well we’re starting to see some “normal.”

A look at the asset prices of potential partners — PNC Bank US Bancorp State Street BNY Mellon some mid-sized asset managers and even potentially brokerage firm Charles Schwab & Co. — are starting to come back to earth as the Fed begins raising interest rates.

Another factor that might force CEO David Solomon’s hand are the obvious holes in Goldman’s business model. Goldman has a long and storied rep killing it in M&A and trading.

Tough competition

But it’s tough having only two horses in the race competing against banking behemoths like JPMorgan. Sure Goldman wasn’t the only bank to experience a hiccup because of trading volatility and higher expenses (the vaunted JPM did as well). But JPM has a big balance sheet far larger than the size of Goldman’s and JPM CEO Jamie Dimon can paper over surprises such as rapid and unexpected increases in compensation costs which bedeviled Solomon in the fourth quarter of 2021 and possibly into 2022.

That’s why Goldman’s earnings miss last week has the Wall Street rumor mill spinning again.

Solomon also knows that if you’re Goldman the merger has got to be the right one or else the CEO will go down in infamy as having evaporated one of the world’s greatest corporate brands.

3 JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon is definitely not in the market for mergers or acquisitions. REUTERS/Carlo Allegri/File

And this is where it gets tricky. As for potential partners Schwab — the world’s most prestigious discount broker — would be an obvious choice. Schwab’s business involves registered investment advisers selling high-end financial products to rich people which complements Goldman’s own very high-end wealth-management business.

But Schwab’s price in Goldmanese hasn’t been normalized enough. The San Francisco-based Schwab has a market value of $168 billion compared to Goldman’s $115 billion. Charles Schwab’s ego — and yes the company’s 84-year-old founder namesake and chairman is still around — won’t let him sell out a bunch of traders in New York if he doesn’t have to.

Both PNC and US Bancorp have lower market caps than Goldman and they would be attractive particularly in a high-interest-rate environment the Fed has signaled; banks make a lot of money when rates rise.

But like Schwab neither has to do a deal. The monetary-policy environment favors their business model over Goldman’s.

Asset managers that might be available — think T. Rowe Price — would get Solly around $1.5 trillion in assets and entry into the lucrative mutual-fund business.

Ask yourself though: Why ­haven’t there been more marriages between fund companies and Wall Street? Answer: Combining those cultures is a little like trying to get Hillary Clinton to play nice with Donald Trump.

With all these variables to weigh the conventional wisdom among bankers is that Goldman isn’t rushing to do anything. Solomon is doing a great job; he’s beat earnings expectations seven times before the recent fourth-quarter 2021 miss. Some analysts say his stock looks cheap compared to competitors like Morgan Stanley but Goldman has the edge in market prowess.

That’s one way to look at it; another way is the reason why Morgan Stanley beat fourth-quarter expectations: It has a huge wealth-management business that stabilized and papered over a trading slowdown.

Again Solomon and his people are smart. They know they have to do a deal and the right one at the right time.

Sensible ‘Fink think’

Larry Fink’s annual letter to CEOs is always must-read material this year even more so because he added a fair amount of common sense to the relentless push by the Biden administration and corporate America to adopt green-energy policies.

Fink the CEO of BlackRock is no stranger to this effort. He’s used his clout as chief of the world’s largest money-management firm ($9 trillion in assets) to prod companies to adopt policies that he believes will transition the country and the world to what’s known as “net zero” carbon admissions.

With that came criticism from conservatives and this column since BlackRock alumni fill the Biden White House. Yes green energy sounds good in practice and Teslas are very popular in Beverly Hills but working-class Americans can’t afford electric cars. Higher oil and gas prices are tax increases on Middle America.

Fink didn’t back off his embrace of green energy. But in the letter he also pointed out how this movement is being hijacked by environmental zealots.

He advocated for a transition that takes into account that “any plan that focuses solely on limiting supply and fails to address demand for hydrocarbons will drive up energy prices for those who can least afford it resulting in greater polarization around climate change and eroding progress.”

Let’s hope his friends in the Biden administration are listening.",,,,,,,,,,,,

But many things need to happen before the charter school becomes a reality including gaining approval from the Texas Education Agency and others Kurz said in an emailed statement.

""Students commonly enroll in our Premier High Schools to get their diplomas when other traditional options are no longer a fit"" he said.

More:Nonprofit ResponsiveEd seeks to open charter high school site in Wichita Falls

ResponsiveEd's intentions to open a free publicly funded open enrollment high school surfaced during a Jan. 11 Wichita Falls ISD School Board meeting. Trustees voted to tell the TEA the school would hurt the district financially.

ResponsiveEd is a nonprofit that operates the charter for Premier High Schools.

""We feel that charter schools especially Premier High Schools complement the work of our ISD peers"" Kurz said.

""In fact Premier High Schools work collaboratively with ISDs in a number of communities to help students recover credits and get back on track toward graduation"" he said.

When more students find an education better suited to their needs — and find success that is most important thing at the end of the day Kurz said.

At Premier High Schools' campuses some students tap into the mastery-based program to work at a pace appropriate for their needs and to even graduate early he said.

""Some students are looking for a more flexible schedule that allows them to better balance life work and family demands"" Kurz said.

Other students enroll to recover course credits and earn a diploma in a smaller learning environment with more individualized support from teachers he said.

And others are attracted by Premier's no-cost career and technical education options where students earn industry-recognized training and certifications Kurz said.

He said ResponsiveEd is looking into career and technical education options that align with the area's needs.

The number of teachers and staff members hired would be based on enrollment Kurz said.

The maximum enrollment for the new campus would be 250 students according to an impact statement from the Jan. 11 WFISD meeting.

""Our goal is to hire the best possible teachers and leaders at our schools"" Kurz said. ""Our teachers as in all public charter schools must be highly qualified and have a baccalaureate degree.""

According to the TEA educators at an open enrollment charter school must have at least a bachelor's degree — unless they teach special education or bilingual education.

Those teachers are required to have state certification. In addition a charter holder's leaders can set teacher qualifications above what state law requires.

A location for the proposed charter school hasn't been selected.

Kurz said ResponsiveEd has some properties on a shortlist but the nonprofit hasn't finalized anything yet.

ResponsiveEd hasn't received approval from the TEA for a new campus yet either he said.

""We have submitted the necessary paperwork which is due in March. We expect to hear something shortly thereafter"" Kurz said.

So the next steps for the proposed school are obtaining all of the needed approvals and a property for the school and updating the building to support the learning environment he said.

A ResponsiveEd representative appeared at a WFISD School Board meeting in 2016 to discuss a Premier High School campus proposed then for Wichita Falls. Trustees also approved a negative impact response to the earlier proposal.

Kurz said he had been unable to uncover any information about the previous proposal to found a Premier High School site in Wichita Falls but he will keep looking into it.

ResponsiveEd operates over 80 free public schools throughout Texas and Arkansas according to responsiveed.com.

The education nonprofit runs a family of six types of schools including Premier High Schools.

Merrill - Curtis Brian Whitson went home to Jesus on January 18 2022 at the age of 71. He was born to Chester and Clara [Bauer] Whitson on January 29th 1950 in Culver City CA. As a child Curt enjoyed spending time with his older brother Craig playing sports (especially tennis) fishing and getting into plenty of mischief.

Curtis graduated from Lutheran High School in Inglewood CA in 1968. He worked as a machinist for Chevron Oil Corporation for 30+ years. In 1992 he married Laura Toshach who unexpectedly passed in 1995. In 2005 he married Cindy Pickering in Tomahawk WI. The family relocated to Merrill WI in 2010.

Curt was a loving husband father and grandpa who adored his family and was always willing to lend a helping hand. He lived for entertaining at the family cottage and loading up his boat with as many people as possible to go jet skiing tubing and fishing (in his ""secret"" locations where the fish are known to always [or never] bite). He would even skip fishing to bait the hook and take off fish for anyone who was too grossed out to do it themselves. All followed by a fish fry and a night around the bonfire. The Packers and the Los Angeles Dodgers were his favorite teams to root for. Some of his hobbies included finding a great deal at yard sales and flea markets collecting knives woodworking reading watching old Western movies having a margarita and being involved in his church Christ Evangelical Lutheran. Curt was a devout Christian and enjoyed singing in the choir and served as the church secretary for the last 8 years.

Curt is survived by his wife Cindy and by his children: Russell (Amber) Natalie Amanda (Ryan) Daniel Leah (Cody) and Sarah as well as his grandchildren: Joshua Carly Marley Alyce Kingston Kennedy and Blake. Curt is also survived by his brother Craig (Jan) nieces nephews cousins and countless friends. He is preceded in death by his wife Laura his parents Chester and Clara his mother-in-law Barbara Toshach in-laws Don & Bev Pickering and his niece Joanna.

There will be a public visitation from 5-7 p.m. on Tuesday January 25 2022 at Waid Funeral Home in Merrill. On Wednesday January 26 2022 there will be an additional visitation at Christ Evangelical Lutheran Church in Merrill between 9-11 a.m. immediately followed by a service. Pastor Neal Behm will officiate. A private burial will take place at Restlawn Memorial Park Wausau WI at a later date.

She accessorized with high Miu Miu boots. “Wim Hof said ice baths” she captioned the post of her which has gotten over 9.3 million likes.

Jenner has been spending time in Aspen. She shared an Instagram of herself snowboarding in much more weather-appropriate clothes earlier this week.

Jenner spoke to ELLE in February 2020 about her career as a model and whether she prefers runway work or editorial shoots.

“Oooh it's tough. They're very different” she said. “Runway during the hectic fashion weeks towards the end of it you're like ‘Oh my god this is a lot.’ So many looks so many photographers. It's obviously a dream come true to get to model in a runway show but it's still very intense. What I think is the coolest part is that you get to be part of the designer's creative experience. You're there doing it with them which feels really special. But campaigns are cool because you get to immerse yourself in a character for a day. You get to explore your own creative side by creating a really sick photo and pretending to be someone else.”

She also admitted she still gets carded despite her A-list status. “I get carded a lot” she said. “I'm fine with it—honestly I kind of like it. I'm 24 and so it's still that age where it's exciting to show that I'm legal! I can order what I want to drink I swear!”

A lot of new economic data poured in Friday to give us a better sense of how the state’s recovery is going.

But first let’s talk about a livable wage which seems like a fair starting point for any worker who has settled into an occupation and plans to stick with it in the near future.

So what is a livable wage anyway?

It’s how much someone needs to earn “to support his or herself and their family” according to the Living Wage calculator from Massachusetts Institute of Technology professor Amy K. Glasmeier. It should include food child care health insurance housing transportation mobile service and internet plus a few other necessities.

For a single person in Denver MIT’s calculator puts that wage at $17.40 an hour in 2020 dollars. Add a child and the amount jumps to $36.28. The living wage for an individual changes by year and region. In Mesa County a living wage was $14.56 Pueblo was at $13.99 and Yuma County at $13.33.

The Family Budget Calculator from the Economic Policy Institute uses data to find a family’s budget — which includes paying for housing food insurance transportation child care and other necessities — and estimates what income is needed to pay for it based on costs of any given region in the U.S. This is EPI’s calculation for the Denver metro area compared to the counties of Mesa and Pueblo. (Economic Policy Institute)

But others interpret it differently. The nonprofit think tank Economic Policy Institute has its own “Family Budget Calculator.” And for an individual in Denver the income needed for a “modest yet adequate standard of living” is $41200 a year or $19.81 an hour. It drops to $33000 to $36000 in Pueblo Yuma and Mesa counties. Budget numbers are based on 2017 dollars so it’s already out of date.

Over at Prosper Co. which is part of the Denver Metro Chamber of Commerce the “scrape by” minimum is $21.63 an hour or $45000 annually for metro-area workers. The organization however said a more equitable wage is closer to the city’s annual average which was $68357 two years ago.

And if you ask both sides in the tentatively resolved King Soopers and Local 7 union labor dispute the answers are very different. King Soopers even put the comparison into a graphic earlier in the week:

King Soopers compared its proposed wage for grocery store checker with five years of experience versus the union’s proposal. (Screenshot)

That’s an annual difference of roughly $10000 a year or $5 an hour for a checker with five years of experience. Both however agreed on a starting wage of $16 an hour. Details on the new contract for Denver-area workers won’t be released until after union members vote on it Monday. It’s likely somewhere in the middle of the two proposals.

“More often than less one can define livable wage as a wage that allows you to live in Denver a wage high enough where you do not need to have multiple jobs to pay rent pay food clothing insurance etc.” said Alex Padilla an economics professor at Metropolitan State University of Denver. “Ultimately livable wage means a wage that allows you to live in the place you want to live given the costs of living of that place.”

Back in 1938 when the federal minimum wage was introduced (at 25 cents an hour!) it was considered a livable wage said David Cooper director of economic analysis and research network at Economic Policy Institute.

“But over time it became clear that it wasn’t. So it was updated” Cooper said. “But it hasn’t been updated much in the last three decades.”

The federal minimum wage is $7.25 an hour which was last updated in 2009. Colorado’s hourly minimum wage increased Jan. 1 to $12.56 and Denver’s is now at $15.83. Advocates have been pushing for a $15 federal minimum for years and when that debate returns the number may be even higher.

“I think the general (idea) of a livable wage would be the wage required for someone to be able to live with dignity to meet all their needs and to be financially stable” Cooper said. “What we’re describing as modest but adequate is you’re able to pay all those bills but you don’t have any savings leftover.”

→ Colorado’s hourly pay increases — Colorado’s average hourly earnings reached $33.28 in December according to the latest BLS business establishment survey. That’s up from $31.20 a year ago. It’s also nearly $2 more than the nation’s average of $31.31.

Colorado recovers 89% of jobs lost in pandemic

The state continues to add more jobs each month to make up for what was lost at the start of the pandemic. In December the number grew by 18000 plus November data was revised showing that we gained more jobs then initially announced.

That puts Colorado at an 89% recovery rate in regaining the 375000 jobs lost in March and April 2020. By comparison the U.S. has recovered 84% of jobs lost in the early pandemic.

That helped improve the state’s unemployment rate to 4.8% the lowest since the pandemic first disrupted lives in the spring of 2020. While we’re not back to the pre-pandemic low of 2.8% in February 2020 and we’re not near the nation’s 3.9% in December there are more people in the state’s workforce than ever before said Ryan Gedney a senior economist at the Colorado Department of Labor and Employment.

December labor participation rates reached 68.3% or 3208400. This includes people who work are collecting unemployment or looking for work. The rate was 68.7% in February 2020.

“The labor force did hit 3.2 million for the first time in its history for Colorado” Gedney said at a news conference Friday. “While the labor force participation rate is slightly lower I do think it’s encouraging that we continue to see monthly growth in those labor force totals. And again that will also help as people enter the labor force employers fill those needed job openings.”

Some regions are recovering faster than others. Notably Colorado Springs now has more jobs than it did in February 2020. Here’s where the metro areas are at in terms of job recovery:

Colorado Springs 113%

Denver 93%

Grand Junction 90%

Fort Collins 82%

Boulder 79%

Pueblo 77

Greeley 63%

47 non-metro counties: 75%

“A lot of what is causing Greeley to lag is that area’s high concentration of oil and gas which has yet to recover relative to other industries in the state” Gedney said.

Other economic indicators:

Pueblo and Huerfano counties had the highest December unemployment rates of 6.4% and 6.3% respectively.

29 counties had December unemployment rates below the U.S.’s non-seasonally adjusted rate of 3.7%

Construction was the only sector that experienced job losses in December from a year earlier though “it’s fairly small at 600 jobs” Gedney said.

There are still 154300 people who are unemployed in Colorado according to the BLS household survey which counts more than just folks collecting unemployment. The number is up from the 83000 average before the pandemic but is down about 41000 people in the last five months.

As of Jan. 8 there were 20021 Coloradans collecting unemployment or about 7.6% higher than the weekly average in 2019. >> SEE DATA

Union membership declines again but support grows

As mentioned last week in this column the public is more favorable towards unions than in the past with 68% of Americans in a Gallup poll saying they approve of unions — the highest rate since 1965. Membership in labor unions though was sharply down from a few decades ago.

On Thursday the Bureau of Labor Statistics released 2021 union data that showed the numbers dropped again down 3.9% compared to 2019. Last year union membership declined by 241000 workers to 14 million people or 10.8% of all folks employed. In 1983 the first year that comparable data was collected union membership was at 17.7 million workers or 20.1% of all those employed.

Colorado also experienced a loss of union members and dramatically so in the pandemic. Since 2019 union membership fell 30.38% to 165000 members.

But the declines don’t take away from public sentiment that favors unions or the attempts to organize at Starbucks and Amazon or the large number of labor actions nationwide Heidi Shierholz president of the nonprofit think tank Economic Policy Institute said during a news conference on the new BLS data. They show “workers want and value unions.”

“Workers have basically two sources of power with respect to their employer. They have a union or the implicit threat that they can quit their job and take another job” Shierholz said. “And that means that that implicit threat that workers could quit and take another job is very real right now and that means workers have more power. But and this is key these dynamics are unlikely to continue once the pandemic is behind us. For lasting worker power for lasting strong wage growth and decent working conditions going forward working people absolutely have to be able to join unions.”

A few policies proposed include the Protecting the Right to Organize Act or the Public Service Freedom to Negotiate Act at the national level. In Colorado a bill in the works would grant more public employees the right to unionize.

“And the fact that unionization nevertheless declined in 2021 is just a glaring testament to how easy it is for employers who oppose unions to exploit our weak outdated labor laws to thwart workers’ attempts at organizing” Shierholz said.

$3000 for restaurants that take on apprentices

Restaurant staffing shortages were an industry issue before the pandemic and continue to be. So after a successful trial run the Colorado Restaurant Foundation is expanding an apprenticeship program that provides training to students and extra help for restaurants.

The Restaurant Youth Registered Apprenticeship or RYRA launched with a $5 million grant from the U.S. Department of Labor. Colorado was one of four states participating through the Colorado Restaurant Foundation. It placed the first dozen students with restaurants in August including Chook Charcoal Chicken in Denver.

To speed up growth the foundation is awarding $3000 grants to restaurants that take on an apprentice. Restaurants don’t have to be a member of the state restaurant association and the program is open to existing student workers who are interested in a career. Applications are being accepted until March 1.

“Our overall goal for this year is to have 270 apprentices placed” said Mark Antonation a spokesman for the Colorado Restaurant Foundation. Two days after announcing the $3000 bonus 115 restaurants expressed interest.

Apprenticeship positions for students between 17 to 24 are available as line cooks and restaurant management trainees. While the employer must pay regular wages to the apprentice the program will cover the cost of training such as a ServSafe Manager certification which normally runs $179.

“People may have found reasons to not work in the restaurant industry over the past two years and are looking elsewhere for jobs. We want to give them this option and say not only can you get a running start through RYRA but by getting set up early you’ll be able to advance quicker you can make more money and you’ll know more about the industry so you can kind of pick and choose where you want to work” Antonation said. “It’s a way to show young people that this is a viable career.

To that end the organization’s advisory board includes attorney Richard St. Paul — a GOP donor who supported former President Donald Trump — and Scherie Murray a Republican who ran against Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez in 2019. Adams won the Democratic primary last year without the support of the high-profile Congress member who endorsed third-place finisher Maya Wiley instead. And since being elected he and the left wing have publicly aired their mutual discontent.

Cockfield’s PAC — which he said is unconnected to the new mayor despite featuring Adams’ photo on an invitation last fall — will soon be distributing questionnaires to candidates in upcoming special elections and plans to endorse and donate to Assembly and state Senate candidates later this year he said.

Eric Hadar head of real estate firm Allied Partners Inc. topped the list of nearly 600 donors with two contributions totaling $100000. Hadar has owned pieces of several major commercial and residential properties in New York and Miami including the Brill Building and the Citigroup Center in Manhattan. The PAC also received more than $20000 from Jon Oringer founder of Shutterstock; Edwin Gomez a New Jersey nightclub owner who had plans to expand into the city; and Zef Perlleshi a White Plains restaurateur.

Since his election last year Adams has become a prominent member of the city’s swanky night-life scene frequenting private hot spots like Zero Bond and Casa Cipriani.

The PAC also received thousands of dollars in donations from top New York real estate moguls Steve Witkoff and several corporations tied to Richard LeFrak both of whom supported Trump’s reelection.

Several of the contributions demonstrate the PAC’s connections to the mayor.

A day after Sam Darwish head of London-based global telecom firm IHS Towers gave $50000 he met with Adams. According to a tweet the retired cop who grew up poor in Queens reminded Darwish “of the beauty of the American Dream.” And Evan Greenberg who is head of Switzerland-based insurance firm Chubb Limited and gave $25000 is a member of the mayor’s transition team.

The ties between Adams and the PAC have been clear since the outset. Adams spoke at a keynote fundraiserin October. And one of his former staffers in the Brooklyn Borough President’s office Brianna Suggs was paid by Striving for a Better New York in October. After Adams’ clinched the primary in June and subsequently raised the maximum amount of money for the general election some donors still eager to support the mayor were steered toward Cockfield’s PAC according to multiple sources.

Cockfield insisted that beyond sporadic speeches the mayor is not involved in the organization’s operations.

“Is it Eric’s PAC?” Cockfield asked. “No. It is Rev. Al Cockfield’s PAC.”

An advisory board member attorney and lobbyist Brad Gerstman said the organization’s main function is to push back against the left wing of the Democratic party which he argued is too hostile to businesses. Taxes paid by companies and their owners he noted pay for much of the social services run by the city and state.

“If those people flee to Florida we will no longer have that golden goose” he said. “I think that’s what many elected officials in the Democratic Socialists of America for example either don’t comprehend or don’t care about.”

Cockfield himself has business with the Adams administration including contracts for pre-K centers he owns. He dismissed the idea that raising money for a PAC connected to the mayor now in charge of the city’s nearly $100 billion budget was a conflict of interest arguing his contracts were awarded under the prior administration.

“The work I’m doing is God’s work” he said. “It’s not a conflict.”",,,,,,,,,

It was the music that changed first. Or maybe that's just when many people at the pale brick Catholic church in the quiet Wisconsin neighborhood finally began to realize what was happening. The choir director a fixture at St. Maria Goretti for nearly 40 years was suddenly gone. Contemporary hymns were replaced by music rooted in medieval Europe. So much was changing. Sermons were focusing more on sin and confession. Priests were rarely seen without cassocks. Altar girls for a time were banned. At the parish elementary school students began hearing about abortion and hell. ""It was like a step back in time"" said one former parishioner still so dazed by the tumultuous changes that began in 2021 with a new pastor that he only spoke on condition of anonymity. It's not just St. Maria Goretti. Across the U.S. the Catholic Church is undergoing an immense shift. Generations of Catholics who embraced the modernizing tide sparked in the 1960s by Vatican II are increasingly giving way to religious conservatives who believe the church has been twisted by change with the promise of eternal salvation replaced by guitar Masses parish food pantries and casual indifference to church doctrine. The shift molded by plummeting church attendance increasingly traditional priests and growing numbers of young Catholics searching for more orthodoxy has reshaped parishes across the country leaving them sometimes at odds with Pope Francis and much of the Catholic world. The changes are not happening everywhere. There are still plenty of liberal parishes plenty that see themselves as middle-of-the-road. Despite their growing influence conservative Catholics remain a minority. Yet the changes they have brought are impossible to miss.

The progressive priests who dominated the U.S. church in the years after Vatican II are now in their 70s and 80s. Many are retired. Some are dead. Younger priests surveys show are far more conservative. ""They say they're trying to restore what us old guys ruined"" said the Rev. John Forliti 87 a retired Twin Cities priest who fought for civil rights and reforms in Catholic school sex education. Doug Koesel an outspoken 72-year-old priest at Blessed Trinity Parish in Cleveland was blunter: ""They're just waiting for us to die."" At St. Maria Goretti once steeped in the ethos of Vatican II many parishioners saw the changes as a requiem. ""I don't want my daughter to be Catholic"" said Christine Hammond whose family left the parish when the new outlook spilled into the church's school and her daughter's classroom. ""Not if this is the Roman Catholic Church that is coming."" But this is not a simple story. Because there are many who welcome this new old church. They often stand out in the pews with the men in ties and the women sometimes with the lace head coverings that all but disappeared from American churches more than 50 years ago. Often at least a couple families will arrive with four five or even more children signaling their adherence to the church's ban on contraception which most American Catholics have long casually ignored. They attend confession regularly and adhere strictly to church teachings. Many yearn for Masses that echo with medieval traditions — more Latin more incense more Gregorian chants. ""We want this ethereal experience that is different from everything else in our lives"" said Ben Rouleau who until recently led St. Maria Goretti's young adult group which saw membership skyrocket even as the parish shrank amid the turmoil. They are Rouleau said happily out of touch with a liberal city like Madison. ""It's radical in some ways"" Rouleau said. ""We're returning to the roots of the church.""

Three decades of progressive change If this movement emerged from anywhere it might be a now-demolished Denver football stadium and a borrowed military helicopter carrying in Pope John Paul II. Some 500000 people descended on Denver in 1993 for the Catholic festival World Youth Day. When the pope's helicopter landed just outside Mile High Stadium the ground shook from the stomping. The pope whose grandfatherly appearance belied an electric charisma and who was beloved both for his kindness and his sternness confronted an American church shaped by three decades of progressive change. If the church is often best known to non-Catholics for its opposition to abortion it had grown increasingly liberal since Vatican II. Birth control was quietly accepted in many parishes and confession barely mentioned. Catholic social teaching on poverty suffused churches. Most priests traded in their cassocks for plain black shirts with Roman collars. Incense and Latin became increasingly rare. On some issues John Paul II agreed with these liberal-minded Catholics. He spoke against capital punishment and pushed for workers' rights. He preached relentlessly about forgiveness — ""the oxygen that purifies the air of hatred."" He forgave his own would-be assassin. But he was also uncompromising on dogma warning about change and cracking down on liberal theologians. He urged a return to forgotten rituals. Catholics ""are in danger of losing their faith"" he told crowds at the final Denver Mass decrying abortion drug abuse and what he called ""sexual disorders"" a barely veiled reference to growing acceptance of gay rights. Across the nation fervent young Catholics listened. Newman Centers which serve Catholic university students became increasingly popular. So did FOCUS a traditionalist organization working on American college campuses. Conservative Catholic media grew particularly the cable TV network EWTN a prominent voice for increased orthodoxy.

Today conservative Catholic America has its own constellation of online celebrities aimed at young people. There's Sister Miriam James an ever-smiling nun in full habit who talks openly about her hard-partying college days. There's Jackie Francois Angel who speaks in shockingly frank detail about sex marriage and Catholicism. There's Mike Schmitz a movie-star handsome Minnesota priest who exudes kindness while insisting on doctrine. Even today surveys show most American Catholics are far from orthodox. Most support abortion rights. The vast majority use birth control. But increasingly those Catholics are not in church. In 1970 more than half of America's Catholics said they went to Mass at least once a week. By 2022 that had fallen to 17% according to CARA a research center affiliated with Georgetown University. Among millennials the number is just 9%. Even as the U.S. Catholic population has jumped to more than 70 million driven in part by immigration from Latin America ever-fewer Catholics are involved in the church's most important rites. Infant baptisms have fallen from 1.2 million in 1965 to 440000 in 2021 CARA says. Catholic marriages have dropped by well over two-thirds. The shrinking numbers mean that those who remain in the church have outsized influence compared with the overall Catholic population. On the national level conservatives increasingly dominate the U.S. Catholic Bishops Conference and the Catholic intellectual world. They include everyone from the philanthropist founder of Domino's Pizza to six of the nine U.S. Supreme Court justices. Then there's the priesthood. Young priests driven by liberal politics and progressive theology so common in the 1960s and 70s have ""all but vanished"" said a 2023 report from The Catholic Project at Catholic University based on a survey of more than 3500 priests. Today's young priests are far more likely to believe that the church changed too much after Vatican II tangling itself up in America's rapidly shifting views on everything from women's roles to LGBTQ people. ""There really aren't very many liberals in the seminaries anymore"" said a young recently ordained Midwestern priest. He spoke on condition of anonymity because of the turmoil that engulfed his parish after he began pressing for more orthodox services. ""They wouldn't feel comfortable.""

Slow shift toward orthodoxy Sometimes the shift toward orthodoxy happens slowly. Maybe there's a little more Latin sprinkled into Mass or an occasional reminder to go to confession. Maybe guitars are relegated to Saturday evening services or dropped completely. And sometimes the changes come like a whirlwind dividing parishes between those thirsting for a more reverent Catholicism and those who feel their spiritual home has been taken from them. ""You'd leave Mass thinking 'Holy cow! What just happened?'"" said another ex-parishioner at St. Maria Goretti whose family eventually left the church describing the 2021 promotion of a new pastor and a sudden focus on sin and confession. Like many former parishioners he spoke only on condition of anonymity worried about upsetting friends still at the church. Diocesan clergy did not respond to requests for interviews. ""I'm a lifelong Catholic. I grew up going to church every Sunday"" he said. ""But I'd never seen anything like this."" The new outlook has spilled across America. In churches from Minnesota to California parishioners have protested changes introduced by new conservative priests. In Cincinnati it came when the new priest abandoned gospel music and African drumming. In small-town North Carolina it was an intense focus on Latin. In east Texas it was a right-wing bishop forced out by the Vatican after accusing Pope Francis of undermining church teachings. Each can seem like one more skirmish in the cultural and political battles tearing at America. But the movement whether called conservative or orthodox or traditionalist or authentic can be hard to define. It ranges from Catholics who want more incense to Latin Mass adherents who have brought back ancient prayers that mention ""the perfidious Jew."" There are right-wing survivalists celebrity exorcists environmentalists and a handful of quasi-socialists. There's the Catholic news outlet railing against the Vatican's ""wicked entourage"" and the small-town Wisconsin priest who traces COVID-19 to a century-old prophecy and warns of looming dictatorship. There's the recent ""Catholic Prayer for Trump"" a $1000-a-plate dinner at the former president's Mar-a-Lago resort featuring a string of conspiracy theorists.

Yet the orthodox movement can also seem like a tangle of forgiveness and rigidity where insistence on mercy and kindness mingle with warnings of eternity in hell. Looming over the American divide is Pope Francis who has pushed the global church to be more inclusive even as he toes the line on most dogma. The orthodox movement has watched him nervously from the first days of his papacy angered by his more liberal views on issues like gay relationships and divorce. Some reject him entirely. And the pope clearly worries about America. The U.S. church has ""a very strong reactionary attitude"" he told a group of Jesuits last year. ""Being backward-looking is useless."" A new vision of Catholic America You can find this new vision of Catholic America at Latin Masses in Milwaukee the pews crowded with worshippers even at noon on a weekday. It's in conferences held in California wine country at reinvigorated parishes in Tennessee and prayer groups in Washington D.C. And it's at a little Kansas college built high on a bluff above the Missouri River. At first glance nothing seems unusual about Benedictine College. Students worry about unfinished essays and the complexities of dating. They wear cutoff shorts on warm autumn afternoons. Football is huge. The cafeteria food is mediocre. But look deeper. Because at Benedictine Catholic teaching on contraception can slip into lessons on Plato and no one is surprised if you volunteer for 3 a.m. prayers. Pornography premarital sex and sunbathing in swimsuits are forbidden. If these rules seem like precepts of a bygone age that hasn't stopped students from flocking to Benedictine and other conservative Catholic colleges. At a time when U.S. college enrollment is shrinking Benedictine's expansion over the last 15 years has included four new residence halls a new dining hall and an academic center. An immense new library is being built. The roar of construction equipment never seems to stop. Enrollment now about 2200 has doubled in 20 years. Students many of whom grew up in conservative Catholic families jokingly call it ""the Benedictine bubble."" And it might be a window into the future of the Catholic Church in America.

In a deeply secular America where an ever-churning culture provides few absolute answers Benedictine offers the reassurance of clarity. ""We don't all agree on everything obviously"" said John Welte a senior majoring in economics and philosophy. ""But I would say everyone has an understanding of like truth."" ""There are certain things you can just know in your mind: This is right and this is wrong."" Sometimes people here quietly admit it goes too far. Like the students who loudly proclaim how often they go to Mass or the young man who quit his classics course because he refused to read the works of ancient Greek pagans. Very often talk here echoes the 13th-century writings of St. Thomas Aquinas who believed God could be found in truth goodness and beauty. Sometimes they say that means finding God in strict tenets about sexuality. Sometimes in the haunting beauty of Gregorian chants. ""It's a renewal of like some really really good things that we might have lost"" said Madeline Hays a pensive 22-year-old senior biology major. She takes the church's rules seriously from pre-marital sex to confession. She can't stand modern church architecture. She's seriously considering becoming a nun. But she also worries about poverty and America's wastefulness and the way Americans — including herself — can find themselves slotted into the political divide without even knowing it. She wrestles with her belief in an unerring Catholic doctrine that can see good people including some of her own friends as sinners. Yet she doesn't want change. ""The church wouldn't be the church if it changed things it had set down as 'This is infallible doctrine and this will not change through the ages' "" she said. They understand that in Benedictine's small mostly closeted gay community. Like the young man once deeply religious who suffers in silence as people on campus casually throw around anti-gay slurs. He's thought many times of leaving but generous financial aid keeps him here. And after many years he's accepted his sexuality. He's seen the joy that people can get from Benedictine how some will move back to Atchison after graduation just to stay close. But not him. ""I don't think I'll come back to Atchison — not ever.""

Remodeling a spiritual home For decades the pews at St. Maria Goretti were filled with the families of plumbers engineers and professors from the University of Wisconsin just a couple miles up the road. The church is a well-kept island of Catholicism tucked into the leafy residential streets of one of America's most liberal cities. Like so many other parishes it had been shaped by the ideals of the 1960s and 1970s. Poverty and social justice became tightly interwoven with sermons and parish life. Gay people felt welcome. Some of the church's moral absolutes like the contraception ban became forgotten dogma. Change arrived in 2003 with a new bishop Robert C. Morlino an outspoken conservative. Many liberals remember him as the man who lambasted the message of acceptance in the modern hymn ""All Are Welcome."" His successor Bishop Donald J. Hying steers clear of public battles. But in many ways he quietly carries on Morlino's legacy warning about ""the tangled thinking of Modernism."" In 2021 Hying named the Rev. Scott Emerson a one time top Morlino aide as pastor of the Madison church. Parishioners watched — some pleased some uneasily — as their spiritual home was remodeled. There was more incense more Latin more talk of sin and confession. Emerson's sermons are not all fire-and-brimstone. He speaks often about forgiveness and compassion. But his tone shocked many longtime parishioners. Protection is needed he said in a 2023 service from ""the spiritual corruption of worldly vices."" He has warned against critics — ""the atheists journalists politicians the fallen-away Catholics"" — he said were undermining the church. For some Emerson's changes were welcome. ""A lot of us were like 'Hey more confession! Sweet!"" said Rouleau who ran the parish young adult group. ""Better music!""

This Sunday the lot is empty. Still people that go here did meet but instead of meeting up for a sermon they went out to serve the community all across Jefferson County.

Austin Johnson is in the kitchen of a fire station in Watertown pulling pork.

Johnson and his team put a BBQ together for city firefighters. He says serving is something we should all put into practice.

“We are led to serve just like Jesus served us as he walked on this earth and so we want to be like Jesus and do what Jesus does and one of those big things is serving and serving your community and helping others” said Johnson.

After a quick prayer it was time to dig in. The church team made enough food for both the day and night side shifts at the fire hall.

“It’s been fantastic to see some people in the community come in the food has been awesome we had great BBQ” said Watertown City Firefighter Chad Crosby.

Kids were also part of this team and got to interact with the fire engines.

Crosby says what he appreciated the most:

“For coming in and spending their time with us the food was wonderful met some great people heard some cool stories people as far way as Africa Alaska from California from Texas.”

Around 15 groups like this one served Jefferson County throughout the weekend at places like homes schools and fire stations.

That is what we believe Gartner did in 2019 calling it secure access service edge (SASE). This architectural approach forced IT to rethink how networks and security intersect as organizations change the way they connect their hybrid workforce to applications and data resources. There was just one problem: SASE at the time did not exist.

Two years later Gartner analysts Gaspar Valdivia and To Chee Eng wrote ""Convergence of WAN edge functionality specifically SD-WAN and eminently cloud-based security functions into a SASE framework is the most ‘vigorous’ trend coming out of 2020.""

Since then SASE has gained industry traction and is being viewed by customers as a vital approach to secure access to applications from any location and is especially relevant to today’s hybrid work environment. Still in its infancy SASE continues to evolve as customers look to leverage capabilities and existing offers.

Security vendors including Cisco have been working to enhance existing approaches to deliver more of the benefits of SASE. Foremost among these is the idea of a zero-trust network. In a SASE architecture anything that connects to the network is subjected to identity authentication access control and other standard threat detection procedures.

This idea could not come at a better time for the security community.

According to the European Union Agency for Cybersecurity’s Threat Landscape 2021 report “Cybersecurity attacks have continued to increase through the years 2020 and 2021 not only in terms of vectors and numbers but also in terms of their impact.”

One of the drivers for growing threat sophistication is “the transitioning of traditional infrastructures to online and cloud-based solutions advanced interconnectivity and the exploitation of new features of emerging technologies such as artificial intelligence” says the report.

These are the very trends that SASE is supposed to offer protection for. It is therefore not surprising that companies are rushing to invest in SASE architectures.

In July 2021 for example research by Cisco Investments found 98 percent of organizations “see clear and defined benefits of SASE” and zero-trust network access was a top spending priority for 42 percent of those questioned.

One challenge for these network chiefs is that SASE is still evolving. Transition to a complete SASE model will take time. Solutions with flexible deployment options are needed to meet organizations wherever they are in their SASE journeys. Gartner predicts that by 2025 at least 60 percent of enterprises will have strategies and timelines for SASE adoption.

That said many of the ingredients of the SASE recipe are already in place. And Cisco for instance offers all components of a SASE architecture including software-defined WANs cloud security zero-trust network access and observability.

Deploying these tools can already lead to measurable levels of threat reduction according to the latest Cisco Secure Security Outcomes Study. “Organizations that claim to have mature implementations of zero trust or SASE are about 35 percent more likely to report strong SecOps than those with nascent implementations” the research found.

Going into 2022 SASE will continue to be a customer priority as solutions mature. For those who deploy its various components whether separately or together the promise of direct and secure access to applications hosted anywhere is possible.

Photo: Getty Images (luza studios via Getty Images)

It's not just big organisations who lose millions as a result of cryptocurrency theft hackers also target individual users to steal small amounts new data revealed.

According to Chainalysis the blockchain data platform scammers stole a record $14bn (£103bn) in cryptocurrency in 2021 with losses from crypto-related crime rising 79% compared with 2020.

In its latest report it said sophisticated attacks take careful planning and skill to pull off but through other types of malware hackers can take a cheaper “spray-and-pray” approach spamming millions of potential victims and stealing smaller amounts. The malware families sampled received 5974 transfers from victims in 2021 up from 5449 in 2020.

It identified found four types of common “cryptocurrency-focused malware families”.

The most dangerous of these is cryptojacking possibly the most prolific of all malware families where hackers make unauthorised use of a victim device’s computing power to mine cryptocurrency. In 2020 Cisco’s (CSCO) cloud security division reported that cryptojacking malware affected 69% of its clients.

Chart: Chainalysis

Hackers also love trojans – viruses that look like a legitimate program but infiltrates a victim’s computer.

There are also clippers which hackers use to replace cryptocurrency addresses copied into a user’s clipboard with their own allowing them to reroute planned transactions to their own wallets.

A 2018 report from Palo Alto Networks estimated that 5% of all Monero (XMR-USD) in circulation was mined by cryptojackers which would represent over $100m in revenue.

Another type of malware is called info stealer which collect credentials a user may have saved on their browser. Cryptbot an infostealer that steals victims’ cryptocurrency wallet details was the most prolific malware family in this group in 2021 raking in almost half a million dollars in pilfered bitcoin (BTC-USD).

Many of these malware strains are available for purchase on the darknet making it even easier for less sophisticated hackers to deploy them against victims.

Story continues

Chart: Chainalysis

After receiving cryptocurrency from victims malware operators send the majority of funds on to addresses at centralised exchanges.

However that majority is slim and getting slimmer. Exchanges only received 54% of funds sent from malware addresses in 2021 down from 75% in 2020. Decentralised finance (DeFi) protocols make up much of the difference at 20% in 2021.

Watch: Watch: Can you live exclusively off bitcoin?

DeFi is a rapidly growing sector that aims to cut out middlemen such as banks from traditional financial transactions like securing a loan. But many of the new protocols being launched have code vulnerabilities that hackers are able to exploit.

Malware attacks aren’t necessarily carried out by the administrators of the malware family itself but instead are often carried out by smaller groups renting access to the malware family – the report said this is something law enforcement needs to keep in mind.

Studying how cybercriminals launder stolen cryptocurrency may be investigators’ best bet for finding those involved it said.

Using blockchain analysis investigators can follow the funds find the deposit addresses cybercriminals use to cash out and subpoena the services hosting those addresses to identify the attackers.

Last week Microsoft (MSFT) said it had found destructive malware on dozens of Ukrainian government and private-sector computers which as the ability to wipe computers of data and render them inoperable.

It said there are several reasons why the activity it found was inconsistent with cybercriminal ransomware activity observed by Microsoft.

""Explicit payment amounts and cryptocurrency wallet addresses are rarely specified in modern criminal ransom notes"" but were specified in this case Microsoft said.

Meanwhile in a separate report Chainalysis said North Korea seems to be the hub of crypto crime.

Hackers in the country launched at least seven attacks on cryptocurrency platforms that extracted nearly $400m worth of digital assets last year.

These attacks targeted primarily investment firms and centralised exchanges and made use of phishing lures code exploits malware and advanced social engineering to siphon funds out of these organisations’ internet-connected “hot” wallets into North Korea-controlled addresses.

Once North Korea gained custody of the funds they began a careful laundering process to cover up and cash out.

Mobile operator EE has quietly confirmed that their indoor femtocell based signal booster device (‘Signal Box‘) which used an existing fixed line broadband ISP connection to create its own indoor 3G mobile signal over a specific band (e.g. 2100MHz) will be “fully closed” (for existing customers) by 30th June 2022.

The move does not come as much of a surprise because such devices have largely already been replaced by the spread of Wi-Fi Calling across the UK’s major operators. This uses your home or other internet (broadband) connection to serve mobile calls and text (SMS) messages via WiFi. Likewise the wider UK plans to sunset 2G and 3G services represent another nail in the coffin of such devices (here).

NOTE: It’s important not to confuse these devices with indoor signal repeaters which merely boost an existing mobile signal.

As a result of the above mobile operators have been steadily withdrawing their femtocell / microcell based signal boosters (here). Similarly EE had already stopped selling their Signal Boxes to new customers. Suffice to say it was only a matter of time before the service was fully closed although in July 2021 the operator refused to say when this might occur and said they “continue to support existing customers.”

However at some point over the past month or so EE has updated their Signal Box page to state that they’re “planning to fully close the 3G Signal Box service by 30 June 2022.” The catch is that for some people Wi-Fi Calling is still far from a perfect service (i.e. support varies between Smartphones and it may struggle to work in areas of weak or congested WiFi) and they would have preferred to retain the Signal Box for a little longer. Sadly it was not to be."

But what would happen if Ryan Howard didn't tear his Achilles on that play how would the future have looked different?

It’s October 7 2011 at Citizens Bank Park. Rally towels are waving as the crowd roars in anticipation. The count is 2-2 on the man who is to that point the greatest slugger in Philadelphia Phillies history. He’s averaged nearly 41 home runs a season up to this day in 2011 but Ryan Howard is early on a curveball. He hits a weak ground ball into the shift the ballgame is over the St. Louis Cardinals win 1-0.

Howard walks off the field in silence. He needs no trainer the only thing hurt is his pride. Some Phillies remain in the dugout to watch the Cardinals celebrate. Perhaps hoping to have the pain seared into their minds to galvanize themselves for next year’s postseason.

Howard though goes straight to the clubhouse. He manager Charlie Manuel and pitcher Roy Halladay all give postgame press conferences. Their answers are canned none of them want to speak with the press. All Howard wants in that moment is the fresh Florida air of spring training and a new beginning.

Five months later the club reassembles in Clearwater Florida. They’re a year older now for most of the players that means a year closer to 40 rather than a year closer to their prime. The average age of the 2012 Phillies is just over 31 with only the New York Yankees having an older ball club.

Philadelphia stumbles out of the starting block in April. The club that won 102 games in 2011 finishes the first month of the season 11-11. But their woes do not end there. At the All-Star break the Phillies are 39-48. General Manager Ruben Amaro Jr. is giving serious consideration to trading away some of the heroes from playoff runs passed.

© Bill Streicher-USA TODAY Sports

By July 31 Philadelphia is 49-54 somewhat more respectable but still nine games back of the second NL Wild Card. Amaro Jr. moves impending free agent Shane Victorino to the Los Angeles Dodgers for two low-level prospects who fail to ever make the majors. Besides that Amaro Jr. stands pat keeping Hunter Pence and his most valuable pitching assets.

Finally now late in the season the Phillies begin to show real signs of life. On September 5 the Phillies cross the .500 win percentage threshold for the first time since April 19 at 69-68. They’re just five games back of the Cardinals and the second Wild Card now.

Led by Cole Hamels Carlos Ruiz and Howard it’s beginning to seem like Philadelphia may have a shot at six straight postseasons.

Howard hits just as he has since 2010 the MVP power is gone but beneath that is still a fearsome hitter. He has 26 home runs on September 5 and he’s batting .249/.345/.482.

However the Phillies have lost mountains of production out of their other aging stars like Halladay after placing second in 2011 Cy Young voting has missed over a month this year to injury and his ERA nears 4.00. Chase Utley has been absent almost half the season to nagging knee injuries which have plagued his entire career. Even the ever-consistent Placido Polanco has faltered at age-36. Though the Phillies are surging cracks have already formed upon their aging core.

Yet Philadelphia shock the baseball world who counted them out at the All-Star break. Rallying for six straight wins the Phillies are deadlocked with the Cardinals for the second Wild Card spot on September 12. This will be their high-water mark.

The Phillies win 10 of their last 19 games respectable but not enough to catch the Cardinals who win 13 of their last 19. The Phillies finish the season 85-77. Ryan Howard hit 29 home runs but faltered in the season’s final weeks.

Amaro Jr. still sure he can squeeze out another postseason run from his now elderly core signs yet more aging stars. He brings in former Texas Ranger Michael Young to play third base and trades Vance Worley for center fielder Ben Revere to replace Victorino.

But the 2013 Phillies are much the same story as the 2012 Phillies. They win just 76 games and still Amaro Jr. clings to his aging core. Hamels Cliff Lee Ruiz Utley Jimmy Rollins and Howard return in 2014. Between them their average age is 34.

The Phillies continue to hemorrhage talent by refusing to trade their stars in what should be a rebuilding year. Rollins is traded after 2014 but everyone else stays.

It’s become clear that Amaro Jr. will go down with the sinking ship and he does so at the end of the 2015 season the Phillies worst since 1972.

Still Howard and Ruiz continue to play out their contracts. Utley was traded for peanuts at the 2015 trade deadlin and Hamels was moved upon the Nov. 2015 arrival of Phillies new GM Matt Klentak.

2016 sees Ryan Howard hit his 400th career home run each one of them in a Phillies uniform. Philadelphia finished in the basement again that season despite Howard’s best efforts. Fans sell out Citizens Bank Park and applaud Howard lustily when he makes his final appearance on the last day of the 2016 season.

It’s obvious the Phillies will decline his 2017 club option. Though Howard never dropped below replacement level his production has declined steadily since 2012. He’s a shadow from a former era of Phillies greatness. Parents in the stands on the final day hold their young children up and tell them “There’s the man who brought Philadelphia a title.”

Howard strikes out in his final at-bat but receives a standing ovation anyways.

© Derik Hamilton-USA TODAY Sports

He retires that offseason rather than search for a minor league contract or spring training invite. He won’t make the Hall of Fame but he finishes his career with 427 home runs second only to Mike Schmidt in Phillies history.

Someday other Phillie greats will break that number but few will ever be as beloved a Philadelphia icon as the man who wore number 6.

Columnist

Owing to the generosity of one Fred Butler the Coca-Cola impresario in my neighborhood I got to enjoy the six-and-one-half-ounce Coke in the traditional contour bottle at Christmas. It made my holidays.

I drank the “contour” Coke for lunch and supper with whatever was on the home-front menu. However as much as I enjoy Coca-Cola it is not the best drink accompaniment for eggs and bacon.

If you have experienced enough birthdays to have earned senior citizen status you likely remember the days of the contour Coke bottle in ice boxes at every corner grocery store in your town.

I remember the pretty models with million-dollar smiles posing with the contour bottle. I remember a robust and rosy-cheeked Santa Claus swigging from the contour bottle. I remember too saving enough pennies to purchase a nickel’s worth of Coke in the contour bottle.

More:Teamwork and leadership define sports teams and Congress should take note

My favorite time during the recent holidays were the evenings when I grilled a Bubba Burger then raked mayonnaise across a soft bun added ketchup lettuce and tomato and took my burger and my six-and-one-half-ounce bottle of Coke to my favorite chair by a full-bodied and agile wood-burning fire — the best meal(s) of the holidays.

It made me wonder about the possibilities of making a deal with my friend Fred Butler. If I cut his grass each week would he pay me in six-and-one-half-ounce contour-bottled Cokes?

You may have brushed up against the story of a long-time friend by the name of Earl Leonard who was an executive with Coca-Cola. He was attending a reception at the White House and was summoned to the Oval Office by President Ronald Reagan who was an avid fan of the world’s most popular soft drink.

Reagan wanted to know why the six-and-one-half-ounce bottle of Coke tasted so much better than in a larger container. Earl explained that “Coca-Cola” was designed to be consumed ice cold. “In a larger container it takes longer to consume a Coke and it begins to warm up in your hands or while sitting idle on a table or desk top” Earl told our 40th President. This led to the UGA-educated Earl Truman Leonard arranging for a routine shipment of Cokes to the White House.

After much frustration at the outset the contour Coke bottle became iconic. In its early days Coca-Cola had to fight off intrusion from knock-off and outlaw operators whose bent was to confuse consumers. It took years to bring about control.

Leading the effort to give bottlers a “distinctive package” for Coca-Cola was attorney Harold Hirsch for whom the UGA law school building is named — Harold Hirsch Hall. Hirsch was a long-time benefactor of UGA and was the man who propped up Georgia football in financial hard times. One of his major efforts was to create summer employment opportunity for Bulldog players.

One of his efforts during those “knock-off” days was to send UGA footballers to places like New York for the summer. At the time fountain sales were the backbone of Coca-Cola’s business.

Often when you ordered a Coke unscrupulous drug store and cafe owners would have brought to your table a drink that might have the appearance of a Coke and a similar taste but was a cheap knock-off. The “Bulldog detectives” had a pouch in the vest pocket of their coats and a straw which they used to siphon a sample from the drink served which was sent to Atlanta where chemists would examine the contents. If it were a knock-off they would then initiate legal action against the proprietor.

A former player Harold Ketron is the reason Charley Trippi became a Bulldog. Ketron was the Coca-Cola bottler in Wilkes-Barre Penn. eight miles from Pittson Trippi’s hometown. Ketron gave Trippi his own Coca-Cola route. Trippi made more money as a part-time Coke employee than his coal mining father made full time in the mines. Early on Ketron got a commitment to play for the Bulldogs from Trippi who never wavered even when Notre Dame came calling. A great day for Georgia.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZXN0cmVldC5jb20vaW52ZXN0aW5nL3BlcHNpLXN0b2NrLWJldmVyYWdlLWNvbXBhbnktZ29lcy1mdWxsLXRoaXJzdC10cmFw0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Pepsi Stock: Company Goes Full Thirst Trap With New Product,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.thestreet.com/investing/pepsi-stock-beverage-company-goes-full-thirst-trap on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZXN0cmVldC5jb20vaW52ZXN0aW5nL3BlcHNpLXN0b2NrLWJldmVyYWdlLWNvbXBhbnktZ29lcy1mdWxsLXRoaXJzdC10cmFw0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiRmh0dHBzOi8vZm9ydW1zLnQtbmF0aW9uLmNvbS90L2RvZXMtZGlldC1jb2tlLWhlbHAtd2l0aC1mYXQtbG9zcy8yODM3MzTSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Does Diet Coke Help with Fat Loss? - T Nation Content - COMMUNITY - T NATION,"by TC Luoma

How to Burn Calories with No Increase in Appetite

Diet Coke and other sodas have a bad rep: increased appetite risk of diabetes high blood pressure etc. It's time to clear their name.

Pandemic of the Diet Coke Drinkers?

In 2017 Science Daily cast an article into the internet ether that damaged the reps of Diet Coke and every other artificially sweetened beverage. It led off with the following thunderbolt:

“Artificial sweeteners may be associated with long-term weight gain and increased risk of obesity diabetes high blood pressure and heart disease according to new study.”

Almost instantly the jaw of nearly every body-conscious diet soda drinker who read that went slack. They all looked like the shocked-face emoji. What they read seemingly defied logic. It was as if they’d just learned that mom’s chicken soup made colds and flus worse.

True the idea that artificially sweetened soft drinks are bad for you had by 2017 already been permeating through the populace for at least a couple of years but “bad for you” simply meant that they supposedly increased your appetite causing you weak-willed schlub that you are to probably gain fat in the long run. Now came this new missive from hell adding additional crimes to the rap sheet of artificially sweetened beverages.

Either way a lot of people believed that stuff and rather than parse the studies or the specific allegations made against diet sodas they stopped using them as a tool against unwanted pounds.

Further their minds probably closed shut to any subsequent studies that might have exonerated artificially sweetened drinks especially the latest one (Pearson et al. 2021) that went so far as to suggest that when mixed with meals Diet Coke – when compared to regular Coke – had positive effects on post-prandial (after eating) energy expenditure and insulin concentrations without any significant increase in appetite.

Why Some of the Previous Studies Suck

Let’s quickly kick to the curb some of those earlier studies before we get to the good stuff. The study reported on in Science Daily (Azad et al. 2017) was as pointed out by the fine people at Suppversity based on observational links between diet drinks and obesity diabetes etc. and not causal ones.

I’ll give you an example an absurd one at that but it’s just to make a point: Let’s say I conduct a study and I observe that for some unknown reason people who eat New England style clam chowder are more likely to become tap dancers than people who eat Manhattan style clam chowder. Now it should be clear to anyone whose I.Q. has a fightin’ chance at hitting 3 digits that it’s unlikely that a preference to eat New England style clam chowder would cause someone to become a tap dancer.

Regardless scientists often make these kinds of observations and dutifully report on them in their research papers but they don’t usually accept bookings on Good Morning America to discuss them. Most of them have too much integrity.

However the lay press and social media don’t have the science training to make such distinctions – they run with it/them. And that’s what happened with that Azad study from 2017 even though none of the randomized controlled studies (RCTs) referenced in the Azad study pointed to a causal relationship between artificial sweeteners and increased fatness or worsening cardiometabolic risk factors.

To be more precise none of the studies cited listed any experimental evidence that the link between artificially sweetened beverages and increased weight gain and heightened cardiovascular risk was a causal one. I mean most of the people in the referenced studies were obese and the rest were just overweight. It takes no Brobdingnagian leap of faith to assume that many got fatter all on their lonesome with or without diet sodas.

It’s also possible that drinking diet sodas convinces overweight souls that they’ve done good and deserve some sort of reward resulting in additional fattiness.

Regardless if you look carefully at the small number of RCT evidence available at the time they showed that artificial sweeteners appeared to have some beneficial effects. The studies that found contradictory evidence or that thought they did including Azad’s seem to have hung all their nay-saying ornaments on one thin branch: CPIR or “cephalic phase insulin response.”

CPIR is a spike in insulin that’s mediated by neural mechanisms. In short your brain registers a sweet taste and incorrectly identifies it coming from a carbohydrate source and then instructs the pancreas to release some insulin to counter it even though the release isn’t needed. Hypoglycemia may occur which elicits a hunger response and makes a body want to eat more.

The theory is that if it happens repeatedly as might occur with habitual diet soda drinkers fatness might ensue. But forget all that for now. Let’s look at the new study one that’s based on apparently causal links and not observational ones.

The New Study

One reason I like this new study is that it used Coke and Diet Coke products that we’re all familiar with rather than some fakakta concoction of “dihydrogen monoxide” [water] and N-(L-α-Aspartyl)-L-phenylalanine (Equal) and 1-methyl ester perfused with 35-Dimethyl-12-cyclopentanedione (caramel flavoring). Diet Coke and Coke are something we can relate to.

Anyhow Pearson et al. recruited eight healthy recreationally active college males. I won’t get into all the minutiae associated with the study but over the course of several weeks each participant completed three randomly assigned trials.

Each subject was required to eat a pre-trial meal consisting of 50% carbs 30% fat and 20% protein. Four hours later they were fed a semi-nightmarish test meal of chocolate Ensure (57 grams) heavy whipping cream (47 mL) and a ZonePerfect Nutrition bar individualized so each participant hit his prescribed macros.

The “meal” was washed down with 20 ounces of Coca-Cola Diet Coke or water. One week separated each trial and participants were restricted from consuming alcohol and caffeine or do anything else that might muck up the results.

Naturally the researchers practiced due diligence by measuring their height weight and body comp along with taking pre- and post-meal blood pressure and blood samples.

The Major Findings

Here are the biggest takeaways from their study:

Fat and Carbohydrate Oxidation: Coca-Cola suppressed fat oxidation and increased carbohydrate oxidation. (“Oxidation” is a sciencey word meaning essentially “burned for energy.”) No real surprise there. However post-meal carbohydrate oxidation was also increased in the Diet Coke trial albeit briefly.

Post-Meal Calorie Burning: Both Coca Cola and Diet Coke elevated post-meal energy expenditure. You’d expect that from regular Coke because of all the sugar but not so with the Diet Coke. Granted both drinks contain caffeine but the scientists didn’t think it was enough to explain all the results. As to how Diet Coke accomplished this increase in post-meal energy expenditure they weren’t really sure.

Blood Glucose: While regular Coke strongly affected blood glucose (raising it) they didn’t see any such effect from Diet Coke or of course water.

Insulin: Regular Coke bent the insulin curve skyward but contrary to what many other nutritionists have believed Diet Coke didn’t. This is where the aforementioned CPIR surfaces again. Sixty percent of the participants experienced this brain-activated release of insulin after Diet Coke but the scientists didn’t think it was physiologically relevant: “Chronic consumption of NS (Coca Cola or similarly sweetened beverages) can lead to reduced insulin sensitivity and ultimately the development of Type II diabetes. We conclude that the consumption of artificially sweetened beverages does not elicit the same metabolic risk as NS beverages.”

Triglycerides: Things got a little screwy with triglyceride or blood fat measurements. Coke to no one’s surprise elevated triglyceride levels but so did Diet Coke which isn’t consistent with some other studies. This is one category in which additional studies are definitely needed.

Appetite: While sweeteners particularly aspartame have been implicated in appetite stimulation as far back as 1986 the findings of the current study didn’t support it. In fact they found no differences in post-meal hunger or satiety between the three conditions (Coke Diet Coke water).

Blood Pressure: This category was a wash. While Diet Coke seemed to temporarily raise systolic blood pressure among the subjects (possibly as a side effect of ingesting one or both of the amino acids that comprise aspartame the artificial sweetener used in Diet Coke) a much bigger study of 200 college students conducted in 2017 found that aspartame lowered systolic blood pressure.

What This Means to You

Diet Coke (and presumably similarly sweetened drinks) doesn’t affect post-meal fat oxidation. In other words you’ll continue to burn fat as efficiently or inefficiently as you did before. Neither did Diet Coke negatively affect insulin levels or as a lot of people believe increase your appetite and lead to more fatness.

The biggest benefit though was that Diet Coke increased resting energy expenditure.

Together this study and several others reinstates the usefulness of diet drinks as a fat fighting tool. At the very least drinking a diet beverage instead of one sweetened with sugar or fructose is going to save you from ingesting empty calories. Oh yeah to those that think artificial sweeteners somehow change your microbiome to the worse there’s no evidence to support that.

You might still want to avoid these drinks because of the artificial chemicals they contain or the not-proven but not entirely ridiculous notion that they might somehow cause certain types of cancer but those are entirely different arguments.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMihQFodHRwczovL2JyYW5kZXF1aXR5LmVjb25vbWljdGltZXMuaW5kaWF0aW1lcy5jb20vbmV3cy90aGUtcGVvcGxlLXJlcG9ydC9yYXpvcnBheS1yb3Blcy1pbi1nYXVyYXYtcmFtZGV2LWFzLWhlYWQtb2YtbWFya2V0aW5nLzg5MDU4MTIw0gGJAWh0dHBzOi8vYnJhbmRlcXVpdHkuZWNvbm9taWN0aW1lcy5pbmRpYXRpbWVzLmNvbS9hbXAvbmV3cy90aGUtcGVvcGxlLXJlcG9ydC9yYXpvcnBheS1yb3Blcy1pbi1nYXVyYXYtcmFtZGV2LWFzLWhlYWQtb2YtbWFya2V0aW5nLzg5MDU4MTIw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,RazorpayX ropes in Gaurav Ramdev as head of marketing,"The People Report

Advanced technologies like artificial intelligence (AI) machine learning (ML) cloud computing and 5G networking are all within the scope of digital transformation.

What is a Digital Transformation Consultant?

A digital transformation consultant (DTC) is a company that will inform and guide the digital transformation process for your organization. There are many different strategies and approaches to digital transformation that can impact your business’s ultimate success so it’s important to select a DTC that aligns with your core values.

Some top considerations to keep in mind when evaluating potential digital transformation consultants include the scope of work you’ll need from them and any specialties they may offer.

Yes we must end qualified immunity now. New York State prison guards brutally pummeled Dante Taylor an inmate serving a life sentence for the murder of a Suffolk County mom driving him to suicide according to a lawsuit.

Since the summer of 2020 we have found ourselves entrenched in a national conversation about police violence and paths to reforming policing. Although videos of Black and Brown bodies being beaten or killed by officers have filled our screens for decades this moment feels quite different. Many conversations are happening across the country leading communities to ask fundamental questions about what role police should play in our society. More than ever before legitimate questions are arising about police power and the best tools to hold individuals and systems accountable when power is abused.

An essential part of these conversations is about ending qualified immunity. Across the nation we have police and correctional officers who continue to escape accountability when they break the law shielded from liability by invoking this doctrine. From advocacy groups to Congress and federal judges across the political spectrum many have called on the Supreme Court to end qualified immunity — arguing that it has no legal basis and fails to achieve its intended policy goals. That hasn’t happened.

To fully grasp why this legal doctrine must be abolished you need to understand the Civil Rights Act of 1871 section 1983. In 1871 to help realize the promise of equality protected in the 14th Amendment Congress passed the Civil Rights Act of 1871 granting individuals the right to sue state and local officials who violate their rights including police officers. In response since 1967 the Supreme Court has issued several decisions gutting this protection by inventing the qualified immunity doctrine. This action prevents officers from being successfully sued for abuse of power or misconduct unless a prior case has “clearly established” that the abuse or misconduct is illegal. No other profession holds this unique protection.

The constant stream of qualified immunity decisions tells officers that they are almost sure to avoid criminal prosecution and are highly unlikely to face any civil liability in state courts. Even when courts find that officers used too much force judges typically grant immunity on the basis of precedent.

There are many cases where Black and Brown families have been victims of qualified immunity. The details differ but the general stories are the same: law officials murdered and assaulted Black and Brown sons daughters siblings parents and grandparents and state governments looked the other way because officers invoked qualified immunity. One of many New York’s cases is the case of Dante Taylor who was 22 years old when he was brutally battered by correctional officers which subsequently led to him taking his own life. Taylor was beaten with batons and fists and kicked before he was hogtied and thrown down a flight of stairs on the night of Oct. 6 2017 at the Wende Correctional Facility outside of Buffalo. The officers responsible remain working having invoked qualified immunity.

Across the nation we have other cases. In Dallas a bicyclist was shot 17 times by five officers who were 100 yards away killing him in a case of mistaken identity. In Heber City Utah an unarmed man was thrown to the ground by an officer after being pulled over for a cracked windshield leaving the man with brain damage. In Maryland an officer shot a man experiencing a mental health crisis who was stabbing himself and trying to slit his own throat. In Euclid a suburb of Cleveland Luke Stewart a 23-year-old Black man who was asleep in his parked car when police approached him was shot five times and died. He was parked legally and he wasn’t posing a danger to anyone.

In all these cases the officers were cleared of any wrongdoing because they invoked the court-created doctrine of qualified immunity.

It is essential to highlight that ending qualified immunity does not hurt officers who follow the law in carrying out their duties. It merely stops officers who otherwise would be breaking the law from getting away with it and not being held accountable.

Sixty-six percent of people in this nation already agree that we must end it. In New York State we have an opportunity to pass the nation’s most comprehensive bill in Albany that would allow us to do away with this doctrine.

The battle to end qualified immunity can’t wait; too many Black and Brown families continue to suffer without any path for justice or retribution because of this obscure legal doctrine. End it to give them a chance to protect themselves and seek redress.

During a state media interview Mr. Jagdeo said that people are now paying fewer taxes and have more money at their disposal to weather the storm.

He said the government has also been able to generate more jobs since coming to office in 2020.

“Do we have greater disposal income today than in that period? The answer is yes. Are people paying less taxes now than they were paying on August 2 2020? The answer is yes $40 Billion less per year in taxes” the Vice President said during the Friday interview.

But the government has not increased the income tax threshold since taking office and in the past two years public servants only got a 7% salary increase much to the disappointment of the union and the workers.

He said because of the prolonged period of the pandemic there were also some setbacks pointing to a global shortage of food and supplies which he claimed has now trickled down to the Guyanese economy and has impacted the cost of living.

“So we have had a large number of successful areas but we have had some setbacks too” the Vice President said.

Mr. Jagdeo said the government was cognizant of the impact of the pandemic on the economy and a decision was taken to reopen the economy in order to bring stability.

“And so look at those countries that have gone into major economic slumps because of COVID. We did not we manage to get more people working” Mr. Jagdeo noted.

Mr. Jagdeo noted that persons can expect further tax relief measures in the 2022 National budget which will be presented to the National Assembly on Wednesday by Senior Finance Minister Dr. Ashni Singh."

Nick Ostenaa who is visiting Rochester from northern Minnesota said he and his wife have been to monster truck rallies before but Saturday’s event was the first for their son.

So what's the best thing about monster trucks?

“They're big” he said. “Big and loud.”

Ostenaa said he was looking forward to seeing the trucks catch some air during the freestyle part of the competition.

Jimmy Creten drives the ""Bounty Hunter"" monster truck has driven for the Monster Jam tour but also operates his own tour 2 Extreme Monster Truck Series which was at Mayo Civic Center on Saturday.

Creten the reigning Monster Jams racing champion and former freestyle champion said the five trucks would compete in four events during the evening with the crowd deciding the winner. Competitions included two-wheel driving spinning donuts a sprint race around the arena and the freestyle competition.

Creten started driving monster trucks not long after he started driving but his love of trucks came from his grandfather who raised him in the Kansas City area.

""I grew up in the early '80s when they started coming out with the big tires for street trucks"" Creten said adding that his tires went from 35- to 38- to 40-inches as larger tires became available. ""That's about the time they commercialized monster trucks.""

After getting downsized from his job at Colgate-Palmolive Creten decided to turn his hobby of driving monster trucks into a career.

The rest including meeting his wife Dawn Creten thanks to monster trucks was history.

Not long after meeting Jimmy in 1997 she began driving later that year.

""The first time I sat in a truck was at my first show"" Dawn Creten said. ""So I learned in the parking lot.""

Dawn Creten said driving a monster truck is a skill you learn but you ""either have it or you don't.""

Saturday night started with fans taking photos in front of the trucks in the Pit Party. Meanwhile two eight- to 10-passenger monster trucks hauled fans for 90-second rides cutting cookies across the arena floor. After two hours of rides the main event began with motocross stunt show and the variousskill competitions.

Haillie Reicks drove up with her young son from Wacoma Iowa to see the trucks.

Her son Brody said he liked the stunts the trucks performed and was impressed seeing the real thing compared to the ""little ones that I have at my house.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiigFodHRwczovL20uZWNvbm9taWN0aW1lcy5jb20vbWFya2V0cy9zdG9ja3MvbmV3cy9haGVhZC1vZi1tYXJrZXQtMTItdGhpbmdzLXRoYXQtd2lsbC1kZWNpZGUtc3RvY2stYWN0aW9uLW9uLW1vbmRheS9hcnRpY2xlc2hvdy84OTA3NjA1Ni5jbXPSAY4BaHR0cHM6Ly9tLmVjb25vbWljdGltZXMuY29tL21hcmtldHMvc3RvY2tzL25ld3MvYWhlYWQtb2YtbWFya2V0LTEyLXRoaW5ncy10aGF0LXdpbGwtZGVjaWRlLXN0b2NrLWFjdGlvbi1vbi1tb25kYXkvYW1wX2FydGljbGVzaG93Lzg5MDc2MDU2LmNtcw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Ahead of Market: 12 things that will decide stock action on Monday,"You Might Also Like: Tech view: Nifty50 holding above 17500 level key to index recovery

The benchmark S&P 500 posted its third straight week of declines ending 8.3 per cent down from its early January record high.On Friday the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 450.02 points or 1.3 per cent to 34265.37 the S&P 500 lost 84.79 points or 1.89 per cent to 4397.94 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 385.10 points or 2.72 per cent to 13768.92.European stocks slumped on Friday to mark the third week of losses as jitters over monetary policy tightening by central banks this year and weak economic data sparked steep declines across global equities. The pan-European STOXX 600 dropped 1.8 per cent and was down 1.4 per cent over the week. Mining stocks were the day's worst performers losing 3.3 per cent.Despite a strong gap-down start the Nifty50 on Friday managed to close almost where it opened for the day forming an indecisive 'Doji' candle on the daily chart. The index took support from its 50-day moving average and settled the day above 17600-500 range a key support area analysts have been pointing out for the last couple of days. Even as the index has sent a 'sell' signal on the MACD indicator and is showing weakness on weekly charts analysts do not rule out a comeback for the market next week.Even as weakness is evident on Friday Call options saw some accumulation of contracts at near-the-money counters.

Pa. (EYT) — A hearing is scheduled for Tuesday for a Sykesville man facing multiple felony charges after being discovered in possession of child pornography.

Court documents indicate 29-year-old Drue J. Crooks is scheduled to stand for a preliminary hearing in front of Magisterial District Judge David B. Inzana at 9:30 a.m. on Tuesday January 25.

Crooks faces the following charges:

– Child Pornography Felony 2 (28 counts)

– Criminal Use Of Communication Facility Felony 3

– Disseminate Photo/Film of Child Sex Acts Felony 3 (28 counts)

He remains free on $20000.00 unsecured bail.

The charges stem from an investigation that began nearly two years ago.

Details of the case:

According to a criminal complaint on April 29 2020 the Pennsylvania State Police Troop I Computer Crime Unit initiated an investigation after being contacted by the Internet Crimes Against Children (ICAC) organization in relation to a CyberTipline report generated by Google.

The complaint indicates Google advised that two images of child pornography were uploaded to the Google Gmail infrastructure on April 1 2020 and provided account information that the images were uploaded from a user identified as Drue Crooks. Google also provided the IP address used to upload the images.

The IP address was then searched and found to be owned by Comcast Cable and an administrative subpoena was issued to determine the subscriber information.

According to the complaint information from Comcast indicated the IP address was assigned to Drue Crooks.

Police then received another tip from ICAC regarding two images of child pornography uploaded to the Verizon Cloud on November 30 2020 and January 4 2021. The images were reportedly uploaded to an account associated with the same phone number listed for Crooks and provided in his Comcast subscriber information.

A search warrant was then executed on Crooks’s residence in Stump Creek Henderson Township Jefferson County. It was found that Crooks did not live at the address any longer but had lived there until June or July of 2020. Crooks was later interviewed at his new residence.

According to the complaint during the interview Crooks admitted he did search for adult pornography regularly and while searching the links he would click on would lead him to adult pornography but also sometimes to child pornography. He told police he never searched for child pornography on purpose. He also reportedly confirmed his phone number was the same number associated with the Comcast account at the Verizon report.

A search warrant was then served on Google for Crooks’s Gmail account. During a search of the email police reportedly found emails with attachments of images and videos of child pornography. A total of 20 images and videos of child pornography and six images or videos of child pornography that involved indecent contact were discovered the complaint states.

Police also served a search warrant on Crooks’ Verizon Cloud account but the complaint indicates no additional child pornography was found on the account.

Crooks was arraigned in front of Magisterial District Judge David B. Inzana on Wednesday January 5 2022.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMikQFodHRwczovL3d3dy5kZXRyb2l0bmV3cy5jb20vc3RvcnkvbmV3cy9sb2NhbC9vYWtsYW5kLWNvdW50eS8yMDIyLzAxLzIzL294Zm9yZC1wcmluY2lwYWwtc2hhcmVzLXdlbGNvbWUtbWVzc2FnZS1haGVhZC1zY2hvb2wtcmVvcGVuaW5nLzY2Mjk3MjQwMDEv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Oxford principal shares welcome message ahead of school reopening,"As Oxford High School reopens its doors to students Monday the administration will work to return to ""as close to normalcy"" as possible school principal Steven Wolf said in a welcome back message on YouTube.

""We’ve been grieving together we’ve been praying together. We’ve attended funerals vigils and memorials and we have been absolutely heartbroken"" said Wolf in the Sunday video. ""... Yet we have been determined to carry on and I am so proud to say that we are reopening our high school ... and we are reclaiming our high school back.""

Students will walk through the halls and attend classes at the school for the first time since a Nov. 30 mass shooting left Hana St. Juliana 14; Tate Myre 16; Madisyn Baldwin 17; and Justin Shilling 17 dead. A teacher and six students were also injured.

Wolf said the school had spent the nearly two months since the shooting consulting with and receiving help from outside experts in mental health and law enforcement as well as parents and students to best plan for the school reopening.

In addition to repaired classrooms windows and doors that resulted from the shooting increased security new paint in ""calming colors"" and hand-written messages of support on hearts and snowflakes were among the changes announced last week.

A team of therapy dogs will walk the hallways with handlers including where the shooting took place and trauma-trained staff will be looking for signs that students need help as they ease back into classrooms.

""Safe rooms"" have also been created where students can find solace and help from crisis counselors and a new mural has been painted across a giant wall of the sprawling school which before the shooting had about 1800 students.

""When our students return to school we will have numerous mental health resources available to them"" said Wolf. ""And students remember: being Oxford strong means asking for help when you need it because we’re all going to need some help getting through this.""

The announced return to school received mixed reactions from the school community.

Some parents said their children were excited to return to the routine of high school and see their friends after spending seven weeks away while others said they were not ready to come back after the trauma of the shooting.

Some students have enrolled in the district's virtual academy and will stay home to learn. District officials said 200 families asked for information on the program and that 20 students requested to transfer from Oxford High School to Oxford Virtual Academy.

""We know it’s gonna be really difficult for our students and our staff to come back because we’re still grieving"" said Wolf. ""And our thoughts and our prayers will continue to be with the victims of this senseless act and this tragedy and for those who continue to heal.""

""Students you have been filling us up with a tremendous amount of love and a tremendous amount of hope and we can’t wait to continue pouring that right back into you"" he added.

Wolf also reiterated in the video the school district's decision to not allow members of the media on campus when the school reopens citing guidance from mental health experts and requests from parents and students.

But amongst its more hurried city pace there are parks and green oases perfect for strolling biking picnicking and kicking back.

Some are family-friendly and attraction-packed with free concerts and museums to boot. Others are diminutive green spaces with a few benches and flower beds. Whatever your taste these are the top parks to visit in Detriot.

Belle Isle

Belle Isle is the Motor City’s most beloved park. An island idyll in the Detroit River it packs an impressive amount of attractions into its 987 acres from the kid-friendly Belle Isle Aquarium to maritime exhibits at the Dossin Great Lakes Museum. The fern-filled Anna Scripps Whitcomb Conservatory is another highlight.

Come summer families will love paddling at sandy Belle Isle Beach with its views of Detroit’s soaring skyline or spotting critters from turtles to toads at the Belle Isle Nature Center. Beyond that trails wiggle through 150 acres of woodland and you can rent bikes just across the water at Wheelhouse Detroit.

William G. Milliken State Park and Harbor

William G. Milliken State Park and Harbor spool out along the waterfront with the paved and popular Detroit Riverwalk running through it. Its centerpiece is the Milliken State Park Lighthouse a 63-foot beacon that overlooks the Detroit River.

Take a bike ride through the park’s wetlands and look out for public art – including a curious sculpture of a steel man with pipes protruding from his body. Benches are perfectly placed to take in views across the water of Windsor in Ontario Canada.

Palmer Park

Palmer Park is a green retreat from the sea of skyscrapers downtown. Located in the northern part of the city it’s a patchwork of woodland and open lawns that include hiking and biking trails plus tree-flanked Lake Frances.

There are some nuggets for history buffs too. Go out in search of the Merrill Fountain an ornate marble monument. It dates back to 1901 and once stood in front of the Detroit Opera House. You’ll also find a rustic and ramshackle log cabin that was built in the 1880s for philanthropist Lizzie Merrill Palmer (after whom the park is named along with her husband Thomas W. Palmer).

Lafayette Greens

You’ll find this urban park just west of Campus Martius. It’s dominated by row-upon-row of raised beds filled with organic vegetables plus seasonal blooms planted to attract bees and butterflies. If you’re into contemporary art there’s also a particularly striking sculpture of a sundial.

Best of all though the park is right next to Lafayette Coney Island and American Coney Island rival vendors of Detroit’s famous chili-sauce-smothered beef hot dog. Grab yours to go and eat it on one of the long wooden benches that are scattered about the garden.

Eliza Howell Park

Taking over about 250 acres of northwest Detroit and spreading out alongside the wiggling Rouge River Eliza Howell Park feels worlds away from downtown. You might entirely forget that you’re in Motor City as you wander trails winding through hardwood forest and fields bright with wildflowers.

Nature lovers will feel right at home here. The park provides a habitat for more than 100 bird species from the red-tailed hawk to swallows to blue jays. You might also glimpse a coy white-tailed deer or red fox amid the trees.

Beacon Park

One of Detroit’s newest green pockets Beacon Park opened back in 2017 and sits somewhere between an al-fresco events space and community hub. Well-kept and compact it comprises an open lawn that hosts free concerts exercise classes and eclectic food trucks plus a restaurant with a rooftop and patio. It particularly shines in the winter months when it’s bright with creative light installations.

Dequindre Cut

A favorite with cyclists the Dequindre Cut is an urban greenway that follows an old railroad line for two miles. It begins down by the river eventually spilling into Detroit’s buzzing Eastern Market. Saddle up and take to the paved pathway keeping your eyes peeled for colorful murals emblazoned on walls under bridges. Grassy patches open up on either side of the concrete – perfect if you’ve packed a picnic – and metal benches stud the route too.

Campus Martius Park

Right in the middle of downtown Detroit sits Campus Martius Park which has earned itself the moniker of Detroit’s Gathering Place – and for good reason. From families to lunching workers the neat little park attracts all kinds of Detroiters with its giant fountain food trucks and tree-shaded benches.

Its landscape shifts with the season too. In winter the place is decorated with twinkling lights and home to a large skating rink. In the summertime the ice is swapped for sand and the area is transformed into an urban beach – complete with umbrellas palms and Adirondack chairs.

Grand Circus Park

Four-legged companions aren’t forgotten in Detroit’s park system either. Grand Circus is home to the city’s top-rated dog park that plays host to everything from canine ice-cream socials to doggy pool parties.

For human park-dwellers this half-moon-shaped space has a large fountain a slew of memorial statues and plenty of tables and chairs arranged under a leafy canopy. It’s located right next to Comerica Park home of the Detroit Tigers baseball team.

Ever since new land rose above the water surface in 2015 and joined two existing islands Garvin and an international team of researchers have been monitoring changes there. The team used a combination of satellite observations and surface-based geophysical surveys to track the evolution of the rapidly changing piece of Earth.

The digital elevation maps above and below show the dramatic changes at Hunga Tonga-Hunga Ha‘apai the uppermost part of a large underwater volcano. It rises 1.8 kilometers (1.1 miles) from the seafloor stretches 20 kilometers (12 miles) across and is topped by a submarine caldera 5 kilometers in diameter. The island is part of the rim of the Hunga Caldera and was the only part of the edifice that stood above water.

Now all of the new land is gone along with large chunks of the two older islands.

“This is a preliminary estimate but we think the amount of energy released by the eruption was equivalent to somewhere between 4 to 18 megatons of TNT” said Garvin chief scientist at NASA’s Goddard Space Flight Center. “That number is based on how much was removed how resistant the rock was and how high the eruption cloud was blown into the atmosphere at a range of velocities.” The blast released hundreds of times the equivalent mechanical energy of the Hiroshima nuclear explosion. For comparison scientists estimate Mount St. Helens exploded in 1980 with 24 megatons and Krakatoa burst in 1883 with 200 megatons of energy.

Garvin and NASA colleague Dan Slayback worked with several researchers to develop detailed maps of Hunga Tonga-Hunga Ha‘apai above and below the water line. They used high-resolution radar from the Canadian Space Agency’s RADARSAT Constellation Mission optical observations from the commercial satellite company Maxar and altimetry from NASA’s ICESat-2 mission. They also used sonar-based bathymetry data collected by the Schmidt Ocean Institute in partnership with NASA and Columbia University.

For the past six years researchers from NASA Columbia the Tongan Geological Service and the Sea Education Association worked together to determine how the young terrain was eroding due to the ongoing churn of waves and occasional battering by tropical cyclones. They also noted how wildlife—various types of shrubs grasses insects and birds—had moved from the lush ecosystems of Hunga Tonga and Hunga Ha‘apai and colonized the more barren landscapes of the newer land.

Things changed dramatically in January. For the first few weeks of 2022 the volcanic activity seemed typical enough with intermittent small explosions of tephra ash steam and other volcanic gases as magma and seawater interacted at a vent near the middle of the island. The ongoing Surtseyan eruptions were reshaping the landscape and enlarging the island by adding new deposits of ash and tuff to the growing volcanic cone.

“By early January our data showed the island had expanded by about 60 percent compared to before the December activity started” said Garvin. “The whole island had been completely covered by a tenth of cubic kilometer of new ash. All of this was pretty normal expected behavior and very exciting to our team.”

But on January 13-14 an unusually powerful set of blasts sent ash surging into the stratosphere. Then explosions on January 15 launched material as high as 40 kilometers (25 miles) in altitude and possibly as high as 50 kilometers blanketing nearby islands with ash and triggering destructive tsunami waves. An astronaut aboard the International Space Station took this photo of ash over the South Pacific.

Most Surtseyan style eruptions involve a relatively small amount of water coming into contact with magma. “If there’s just a little water trickling into the magma it’s like water hitting a hot frying pan. You get a flash of steam and the water burns burn off quickly” explained Garvin. “What happened on the 15th was really different. We don’t know why — because we don’t have any seismometers on Hunga Tonga-Hunga Ha‘apai — but something must have weakened the hard rock in the foundation and caused a partial collapse of the caldera’s northern rim. Think of that as the bottom of the pan dropping out allowing huge amounts of water to rush into an underground magma chamber at very high temperature.”

The temperature or magma usually exceeds 1000 degrees Celsius; seawater is closer to 20°C. The mixing of the two can be incredibly explosive particularly in the confined space of a magma chamber. “This was not your standard Surtseyan eruption because of the large amount of water that had to be involved” said Garvin. “In fact some of my colleagues in volcanology think this type of event deserves its own designation. For now we’re unofficially calling it an ‘ultra Surtseyan’ eruption.”

For a geologist like Garvin watching the birth and evolution of a “Surtseyan island” like this is fascinating partly because there have not been many other modern examples. Aside from Surtsey—which formed near Iceland in 1963 to 1967 and still exists more than a half-century later—most new Surtseyan islands get eroded away within a few months or years.

What also interests Garvin about these islands is what they may teach us about Mars. “Small volcanic islands freshly made evolving rapidly are windows in the role of surface waters on Mars and how they may have affected similar small volcanic landforms” he said. “We actually see fields of similar-looking features on Mars in several regions.”

Geospatial Data

Drones as a service

A drone network solution offers on-demand imagery to customers in Germany at resolutions up to 50 times higher than available from commercial satellite data providers. The Beagle M drone and sensors can deliver image data at 1-cm per pixel many times faster than satellites and regardless of cloud coverage. The company’s charging hangars enable quick flights. After completing an autonomous inspection flight (up to 200 km on a single charge) the drone returns to its hangar where it charges for its next mission. The drone takes just 90 minutes to become fully charged and can then advance to its next mission without any physical contact between operator and aircraft.

Both companies have great business models ample cash runways and ever increasing market dominance.

The downside is that all of this growth has caused both stocks to become very expensive and not just from a fundamentals-based valuation perspective. To buy just one share of each company at their current stock price you would need a total of $3563.12.

Unless you’re buying fractional shares (or have a decently large account) such a sum could deter new investors. Fortunately there is a solution. By using an exchange-traded fund (ETF) such as iShares S&P/TSX Capped Information Technology Index ETF (TSX:XIT) you can gain exposure for under $50.

The right ETF for the job

As an ETF XIT holds an underlying “basket” of stocks. When you buy a share of XIT you’re buying an equivalent percentage stake in each underlying stock based on the proportion held in the ETF. Shares of XIT trade on the stock exchange and can be bought and sold like any other stock.

Currently XIT holds a total of 24 stocks from Canada’s info tech sector. The two largest holdings are SHOP at 27.21% and CSU at 23.90%. Other companies like Open Text CGI Nuvei Lightspeed Commerce Descartes Systems Group an BlackBerry are also held in smaller portions.

XIT has a management expense ratio (MER) of 0.61% which is more expensive than an index fund but typical for a thematic sector fund. The ETF currently trades at a price of around $46 per share making it an affordable way to gain exposure to some otherwise expensive Canadian technology stocks.

How has it performed?

A word of caution: the backtest results provide below are hypothetical in nature do not reflect actual investment results and are not guarantees of future results. Hypothetical returns do not reflect trading costs transaction fees or actual taxes due on investment returns.

The results are disappointing. Since inception XIT has barely outperformed the S&P/TSX 60 Index with nearly all of its outperformance coming in 2013-2014 and 2019-2020. Moreover XIT had higher volatility and worse drawdowns than the broad market index. Few investors can stomach these bouts of underperformance and turmoil.

The Foolish takeaway

In my opinion XIT is best used as a SHOP and CSU stock surrogate if you lack the capital to buy shares without either of them dominating your portfolio. You also get 22 other tech companies to diversify your holdings a bit. Regardless by buying XIT you’re making a concentrated bet on the tech sector’s continued outperformance.

Investors looking to buy now should be wary of performance chasing and recency bias. XIT is highly concentrated and is likely to underperform the broad market index on a risk-adjusted basis in the long term. 2022 might also be a year where high-valuation growth stocks face strong headwinds from inflation and rising interest rates.",,,

Usually when you have serious damage on a car the best thing to do is call a tow truck and hire a professional to fix it. Sometimes people might risk driving the vehicle themselves although we don’t recommend it. In the video posted to Instagram by account americanmusclehd a modern Dodge Challenger was taken onto the highway even though it’s crabbing or dog tracking something fierce.

Her rear tires were smoking as they uselessly spun on the icy road her pony car going nowhere.

At least this Dodge Challenger is moving but should it be? We’re taking a shot in the dark here by guessing frame damage is likely the cause although it could be something else pretty serious. Driving a car with that kind of a problem at any speed but especially over 55 mph is just asking for trouble in a big way.

The problem of cars crabbing or dog tracking certainly isn’t new if you haven’t ever seen it before. A quick Google search will pull up all kinds of videos and photos showing Ford Explorers Chevy Silverados and other vehicles looking like they’re driving sideways. On vehicles with a live rear axle it can be an issue of thrust angle.

But the modern Dodge Challenger has a five-link rear suspension so that’s why we’re guessing this muscle car has some pretty serious frame damage. It could be an alignment problem a really bad alignment problem. How could the driver not notice something is off?

It takes a mature tree an entire season to produce just a gallon of maple syrup which is why it's one of the more expensive grocery items. There are cheaper alternatives but they contain artificial flavors and high fructose corn syrup. And when it comes to the rich sweet maple flavor there's nothing like the real thing.

Many brands sell maple syrup at a premium but a higher price doesn't always mean better quality. A 33.8-ounce jug of Costco's Kirkland Signature organic maple syrup runs you $12 compared to $27.47 for 32 ounces of NOW brand at Walmart.

Rotisserie Chicken

Costco price: $4.99 per whole chicken

Boston Market price: $8.49 per half chicken plus two sides

Cooked rotisserie chicken makes for a quick and easy hot dinner in a pinch but there's a price to pay for the convenience -- unless you're shopping at Costco. Members can pick up a fully cooked hot and ready-to-serve chicken for just $4.99. Compare that price to Boston Market where you can get just half a chicken with two sides for twice the price.

Costco sold an astonishing 101 million of its famous rotisserie chickens with the never-changing price tags in 2020 alone. That's 300000 chickens a day.

Hot Dog Meal

Costco price: $1.50 including a 20-ounce drink

You don't need a Costco membership to cash in on this incredible deal at the food court. For just $1.50 you can fill up on a quarter-pound all-beef hot dog and a 20-ounce drink (with unlimited refills). Just as with its vaunted rotisserie chicken Costco could rake in untold millions if it would just raise the price of its famous hot dog deal by only a little bit but it chooses not to -- for a reason.

A filling tasty low-budget food court incentivizes otherwise reluctant shoppers to hit the store for marathon shopping trips. In fact the price of Costco's famous hot dog deal hasn't changed since Hebrew National -- then Costco's hot dog supplier -- set up its first cart outside a San Diego Costco in 1984. Costco switched to its own Kirkland brand in 2009 but the deal remains the same.

In 2021 you can't get a cheaper dog and a large drink without a time machine.

A 120-pack of 8 O'Clock pods at Walmart on the other hand will run you $73.54 -- nearly double.

Golf Balls

Costco price: $1.04 per ball

Amazon price: $3.33 per ball

Kirkland Signature even has its own line of golf balls -- and these are no raggedy shag balls either. The three-piece V2.0 urethane-covered balls have earned 4.6 stars from more than 1400 satisfied Costco golfers -- and they cost just $24.99 for 24 which comes out to about a buck per ball. A single 12-pack of Titleist Tour Speed on the other hand -- that's half as many balls -- will run you $39.97 on Amazon which vouches for the deal with its ""Amazon's Choice"" label.

Costco price: 20 cents per ounce

Target price: 23 cents per ounce

Delicious versatile and pricey olive oil is the first ingredient in everything from sauteed dishes to salads but unless you settle for the cheapest stuff on the shelf all that flavor will cost you a pretty penny -- a few pretty pennies less however at Costco.

Paper Towels

Costco price: 2 cents per square foot

Target price: 3 cents per square foot

You can save big bucks on paper towels at Costco thanks once again to the Kirkland Signature brand which offers a 12-pack of rolls for $19.99. Target's Up & Up brand too offers its own line of paper towels. Its 12-pack of ""double rolls"" sounds like a comparative bargain at $14.99 but there are only 110 sheets per roll to Kirkland's 160.

Costco price: 6 cents per tablet

Amazon price: 7 cents per tablet

For around $12.50 Costco shoppers can have breakfast covered for eight days in a row with a frozen pack of bacon gouda and egg sandwiches on ciabatta rolls.

At that price it’s roughly $1.60 per sandwich – which is significantly less than the $5 a Starbucks patron would spend on the coffee giant’s breakfast sandwich.

Louie Anderson's portrayal of a loving mother was spot on and people are reflecting on Christine Baskets' hilarious and relatable love of Costco on social media. There is a YouTube video that focuses solely on Christine's love of Costco. Toward the end of the scene Christine declares ""I've got every membership ever offered by Costco."" And ""Baskets"" fans can't get enough of it.

People have lauded the clip over time. A few years back a commenter remarked ""This video has literally sold me. I'm buying a membership to Costco because I somehow feel like I'll bump into Christine baskets while shopping there and that would make me very happy."" ""We all know that mom that constantly talks about the deals at Costco"" said another user.

Following Anderson's death a few viewers revisited that clip and expressed gratitude and sadness in the comments. As one person shared ""Coming back to this after hearing about Louie's death. RIP. Such a big loss."" Another fan wrote ""This is a great Baskets scene. Rest in Peace Louie we will miss your talent!"" Reddit is also paying tribute to Christine Baskets in a thread dedicated to her love of Costco. ""Pouring myself a Kirkland on the rocks in memoriam"" commented @arnoldosea. ""I loved him in Baskets so much. A true bulk buy icon"" said @bouncyandrea.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiS2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmVhdHRoaXMuY29tL25ld3MtdHJhZGVyLWpvZXMtaGVhbHRoaWVzdC1uZXctaXRlbXMtamFudWFyeS0yMDIyL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,5 Healthiest New Trader Joe's Foods According to Dietitians,"Trader Joe's stores may not be as big as Costco warehouses or Walmart supercenters but there are still plenty of beloved grocery items inside. While some of these chips and dips and frozen foods left shelves for good last year there's already a new line-up of products to taste test.

We asked two registered dietitians on the Eat This Not That! Medical Expert Board to take a look at the recent additions to Trader Joe's roster. Amy Shapiro MS RD CDN and Lisa Young PhD RDN author of Finally Full Finally Slim and nutritionist in private practice picked the healthiest new items to add to your cart the next time you're inside.

Organic Split Pea Soup

Though the holidays have come and gone winter is here to stay—and cold days call for soup. One of the new options at Trader Joe's that Shapiro loves is a revamped Organic Split Pea Soup made with carrots celery garlic onions and split peas.

""I love this product as the ingredients are simple the nutrition is on point [and] it is high in fiber and protein so it will be satisfying too"" she says.

Young agrees noting that this filling item makes a great addition to a meal or snack. Because it's high in sodium like other soups she recommends going easy on the salt for the rest of the day.

Organic Shelled Hemp Seeds

<span style=""font-weight : 400"">3 tbsp: 170 calories 14 g fat (1.5 g saturated fat 0 g trans fat 11 g polyunsaturated fat 1.5 g monounsaturated fat) 0 mg sodium 2 g carbs 1 g fiber <1 g sugar 10 g protein

Though these little seeds have been on store shelves since 2015 Trader Joe's searched far and wide for an organic shelled version. Both of our registered dietitians agree that the new $5.99 version is a healthy buy.

""Hemp seeds are high in omega 3 fatty acids and a complete protein source"" Shapiro says noting that they add ""healthy fats and protein"" to foods such as salads smoothies and yogurt.

Organic Lentil Vegetable Soup

<span style=""font-weight : 400"">1 container: 210 calories 2.5 g fat (0 g saturated fat 0 g trans fat) 700 mg sodium 36 g carbs 9 g fiber 4 g sugar 12 g protein

""Plant-based"" is a trendy word nowadays and Trader Joe's is hopping on the train with another soup option. This one is made from a mix of carrots green beans lentils onions potatoes spinach and tomato-based broth.6254a4d1642c605c54bf1cab17d50f1e

Shapiro likes that this soup is filled with protein and fiber which will keep hunger away. It's also a nice option for a quick meal that can fit ""nicely into any diet—plant-based or not.""

""The sodium is a tad higher than I usually recommend"" she says. ""However if you do not have a blood pressure issue this doesn't bother me.""

Gluten Free Organic Rolled Oats with Ancient Grains & Seeds

<span style=""font-weight : 400"">½ cup: 180 calories 4 g fat (0.5 g saturated fat 0 g trans fat) 0 mg sodium 29 g carbs 5 g fiber 0 g sugar 8 g protein

There's no added sugar in this breakfast option which can be enjoyed either sweet or savory depending on what toppings you pile on. (Speaking of which here are 11 Healthy Oatmeal Toppings That Help You Lose Weight.)

This option will promote healthy digestion and keep you satisfied according to Shapiro. It's also rich in protein and fiber thanks to the added amaranth black chia seeds brown flax meal and quinoa flakes.

""I love the variety of grains and seeds used too for a balanced nutritional profile!"" she adds.

Organic Chunky Homestyle Guacamole

<span style=""font-weight : 400"">2 tbsp: 50 calories 4.5 g fat (1 g saturated fat 0 g trans fat) 120 mg sodium 3 g carbs <1 g fiber <1 g sugar <1 g protein

If you've struggled with making your own guac at home the pre-made option at your local grocery store is likely a lifesaver. Now there's a new TJ's version on shelves.

""With avocados and tomatoes making up the first two ingredients this is a great choice"" Young says of the new Organic Chunky Homestyle Guacamole at Trader Joe's. Since it is ""rich in taste and healthy fat this guac makes a great spread.""

Every container is filled with Hass avocados cilantro diced jalapeño lime and tomatoes. Trader Joe's says this chunky guac can be enjoyed with tortilla chips on a slide of sourdough as avocado toast on tacos and sandwiches or on top of a homemade burrito bowl.",,,

Day three of the 2022 SHOT Show in Las Vegas is in the books and we’ve got a fresh crop of products we saw on the floor that you might want to check out.

1. Smith & Wesson CSX

Smith & Wesson’s new CSX (pictured above) is a brand-new metal-framed hammer-fired microcompact 9mm pistol designed for concealed carry. The frame is made of an aluminum alloy and offers interchangeable backstraps. It comes with a 10-round and a 12-round extended magazine and features front and rear slide serrations an “EZ tab” to make racking the slide easier a chamfered ejection port to avoid snagging on the draw metal three-dot sights and a manual right-hand-side safety that can be swapped out for the (included) left-hand release button. It’s got a single-action flat-faced trigger. The CSX weighs 19.5 ounces unloaded and is 6.1 inches long and MSRP is $609.

2. Primos Carbon Fiber Apex Tripod

This is a beefed-up version of Primos’ Apex tripod now with carbon fiber legs. Carbon fiber construction saves weight but also provides rigidity which allows for more stability. It weighs just over 6 pounds and has a thick saddle at the top that’s adjustable for width making this tripod suitable for tactical long-range rifles as well as traditional hunting rigs. Three-part legs feature angle adjusters for getting stable platform on uneven terrain and height adjustments are fast and easy thanks to Primos’ Trigger Stick system. At 60 inches fully extended the tripod allows for standing-up shots and adjusts to allow for sitting or kneeling shots as well. A removeable mounting plate makes this usable for spotting scopes and other devices too. The Apex folds down to 38 inches for easy carrying. MSRP is $499.

3. SpyPoint Flex

If you run cellular trail cameras you might know the frustration involved with network connectivity — you have to select the network when you buy limiting flexibility. SpyPoint’s Flex cellular trail cam solves that problem. It comes with a multi-network LTE preloaded with two preactivated SIM cards that ensure cross-carrier coverage. It’ll scan for the best network and if it doesn’t find it on the first SIM it’ll hop over to the second and to get you connected. And during the course of use if a network goes down or loses connection the Flex will automatically connect to another network if available so your camera doesn’t go down. It features a .3-second trigger speed 100-foot flash range 100-foot detection range 33mp quality and 1080p video with sound. Users can operate it in photo video time-lapse or time-lapse+ mode.

4. Hornady CX

Hornady is introducing the CX a monolithic copper alloy bullet that delivers 95% weight retention. It’s designed for extended-range performance greater accuracy and deep penetration. It has a heat-resistant polymer tip that Hornady says “resists aerodynamic heating and provides a consistently high BC for the bullet’s entire flight path.” Hornady is making the CX in a wide range of big-game calibers and is loading it in the company’s Outfitter ammo line.

5. Mossberg 940 Pro Turkey

Mossberg is expanded the popular 940 semi-auto shotgun line with a 940 Pro Turkey edition featuring everything you’d want in a turkey-hunting shotgun. The guns are optics-ready and feature a corrosion-resistant internal parts and finishing an enlarged loading port elongated pinch-free elevator anodized follower for smooth operation an adjustable stock that allows for 1 ¼ inches of length-of-pull flexibility signature texturing on the stock and forend and a HiVix CompSight front fiber optic sight. The durable gas system allows for up to 1500 rounds between cleanings. X-Factor ported choke tubes are included. Mossberg is offering it in two models both 12-gauge — one with an 18 ½-inch barrel (weight 7.25 pounds) and one with a 24-inch barrel (weight 7.5 pounds). MSRP is $1120.

6. Do-All Outdoors Jurassic Rock Crushed Rock

It’s no secret that deer and other animals love salt and pink salt (mined in the Himalayas or in this case in Utah) has the added benefit of a number of essential minerals — it’s practically a multi-vitamin for deer. The folks at Do All Outdoors took advantage of this with their original Jurassic Rock Mammoth Rock which serves as a traditional salt lick — but now they’re introducing pink salt products that take advantage of a better delivery system. Their crushed rock products are offered in Apple Spice and Pumpkin Spice based on two popular deer foods and come in convenient Growler size or 50-pound buckets. The Growler which retails for $5.99 comes in a reusable container that you can repurpose for storage transport or even an after-hunt drinking cup. The 50-pound bucket retails for $34.99.

7. Meprolight M22

Meprolight is a company out of Israel and they make battle optics for the IDF. The newly-released M22 is the U.S. version of the M21 reflex red-dot sight which was originally designed for the IDF. It’s half the size and one-third to a half the weight of its predecessor and takes up half the rail space. Reticle options include a 2-MOA dot a bull’s-eye or a triangle. Front “wings” protect the sight from bumps and scratches and the M22 features a QD locking mechanism. This sight is battery-free running off of fiber optics and tritium. No more worrying about replacing batteries or your sights running out of juice at a critical moment. MSRP on the M22 is $494 ($449 MAP) and Meprolight expects to have them ready to ship to dealers in Q3 2022.",,,,,,,,,,,,

Pretty much all automotive enthusiasts love a bespoke sports car or supercar. From the ground up they’re often scrutinized within an inch of their life. Engineers and designers argue about the tiniest details.

The suspension the styling and the features are all vital factors. Of course none of those aspects may get as much attention as the engine. What happens when the exact opposite occurs? Well that’s when we get a company where an engine is fitted to a car because it was available not because it was a good fit. This makes us wonder what’s the worst engine/car combo in history.

For this Question of the Day we want some deep cuts though. Let me explain. Most people will immediately point to something like the Plymouth Prowler as a great example of an interesting car with the wrong engine. Everyone wishes that they would’ve dropped a big honking V8 under that slick bonnet. Here’s the problem though: there’s a decent argument to be had for the V6.

Sure the Prowler looks like a grown-up t-bucket or hot rod but it was meant to be more than that. The 3.5-liter V6 was very light and pretty powerful for its day. We all know the famous saying “simplify then add lightness.” There’s no reason that the same logic doesn’t work with the Prowler. Still the man who made that lightness quote famous had a hand in another obvious choice for this award.

That man was Colin Chapman the founder of Lotus. And he was the same guy that signed on to help John DeLorean create the DMC-12. That’s the same DMC-12 with the notoriously weak Peugeot Renault-Volvo V6. The car wasn’t wildly heavy tipping the scales at just 2800 pounds (1270 kg) but it certainly needed more than the 130-horsepower its engine developed. Those gullwing doors simply wrote a check that the powertrain couldn’t cash.

What else can you think of? Which engines were far too good for the cars that they came in? What cars deserved far better motors than they ever received?

Vlaeminck played the opening T20I against England in Adelaide where she bowled with good pace but then reported soreness and was seen in a moonboot during the second match that was washed out on Saturday.

The injury has again occurred in the navicular bone which is the same one which ruled her out of 2020 T20 World Cup on the eve of the tournament although that fracture had completely healed and she will now miss the ODI event in New Zealand.

Australia have tried to carefully manage Vlaeminck one of the quickest bowlers in the world through the early stages of her career and she has been limited to 24 appearances across three formats since her debut in 2018.

""She's done a great job getting through to this point"" head coach Matthew Mott told Channel Seven. ""We were always going to look to manage her through. But for it to happen so early in this Ashes campaign it's absolutely shattering for her and for the whole group. It was a pretty sombre dressing room last night. I spoke to the group about what it would look like for her and we all went through it before leading into that T20 World Cup.

""She knows what it's about she's come back before and that's what we've got to hold out hope for. We'll put our arm around her and do everything we can to build her back up. She's a young fast bowler and we see it in the men's game all the time if you're going to run in and bowl as fast as you can it's a dangerous activity. So we'll do everything we can to get her back up but it's a tough couple of days for her definitely.""

Comparisons have been drawn with the journey Pat Cummins went on after his Test debut as a teenager and the subsequent injuries which then saw him not play another Test for more than five years.

""I knew Patty as a young fast bowler. It's very similar"" Mott said. ""When you're going through those flat spots and you're rehabbing over and over and it seems like there's no light at the end of the tunnel. To see what he's done off six years basically out of international cricket to come back a stronger more mature bowler it just goes to show it can be done.

""That won't give her a lot of solace at the moment. She's going to go through some tough times over the weeks and months to come and it's our job as an organisation to make sure that we can put enough support around her get her back to her best and we will see the rewards in a couple of years time.""

Australia team doctor Phillipa Inge said: ""Tayla has sustained an acute navicular stress fracture. She had a similar injury in early 2020; this fracture completely healed and Tayla made a successful return to play to international cricket in March 2021.

""Tayla reported a return in midfoot pain and subsequent images have confirmed a recurrent stress fracture of the navicular.

""The Cricket Australia and Cricket Victoria medical teams will work collaboratively on the immediate management over the coming days and a subsequent return to play plan.""

Australia's selectors will decide on a replacement for Vlaeminck in the coming days but if they want a like-for-like it could open the door for tall quick Stella Campbell who made her debut against India earlier this season. Campbell is currently part of the Australia A squad and took 7 for 25 in the WNCL at the start of January.

Vlaeminck adds to a growing list of injuries for Australia as they begin an intensive period of cricket. Legspinner Georgia Wareham is out until next season due to an ACL injury while left-arm spinner Sophie Molineux is unavailable for the Ashes due to a stress fracture of her foot but it is hoped she will recover for the World Cup."
CVS,CVS Health,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMic2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNocm0ub3JnL3RvcGljcy10b29scy9uZXdzL2FsbC10aGluZ3Mtd29yay9lbXBsb3llcnMtcmVzcG9uZGluZy10by1qb2ItY2FuZGlkYXRlcy1jaGFuZ2luZy1leHBlY3RhdGlvbnPSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Employers Are Responding to Job Candidates' Changing Expectations,"​It's a new year but the Great Resignation is expected to get worse before it gets better. Talent acquisition professionals will have to continue to pull out all the stops to solve the talent shortage crisis by strategizing new methods to incentivize candidates to apply reskilling and upskilling existing employees to prevent attrition and figuring out how to offer more flexible working conditions.

Some sectors have begun to bounce back from the coronavirus pandemic but veteran talent acquisition leaders are worried. Many say they can't remember the last time hiring was this hard and they think recruiting is unlikely to get any easier this year.

""The biggest issue is a lack of applications"" explains Greg Muccio director of talent acquisition at Southwest Airlines referring specifically to interest in airport staff roles. ""It has been the most unpredictable labor market I can recall—truly uncharted waters.""

Traditional conventions about how when and where people work have been upended accelerating major shifts in how talent acquisition is practiced. For HR and recruiting teams the near-total move to working from home has led to revamped hiring practices that include virtual technologies. But the most enduring challenge may be changed candidate behavior and expectations.

""This is a different candidate than we had in January 2020"" says Melissa Thompson global head of talent acquisition at Ford Motor Co.

Across industries recruiting leaders believe job seekers and candidates are more selective and expect something different from before. That makes it essential for employers to develop a compelling employee value proposition that includes competitive compensation and meaningful benefits especially career development opportunities and flexible work.







The War for Talent Is On



""Hiring is hard"" Thompson says especially when it comes to field technicians and call center staff. Recruiters have told her they have never before had so many job offers declined she says.

For retail pharmacy chain CVS hiring for in-store and distribution center positions has been a recruiting pain point even while the company managed to scale up staffing massively during the pandemic to meet the demand for vaccines.

""It feels like zero percent unemployment in some markets"" says Jeff Lackey vice president of talent acquisition at CVS Health which owns CVS Pharmacy stores and other businesses. He adds that across the country businesses dependent on hourly front-line workers are going under because of labor shortages. In the hospitality food and leisure industries for example 93 percent of employers are struggling to hire for entry-level positions according to Society for Human Resource Management (SHRM) research.

""We just can't find the talent we need"" has become a common refrain whether spoken about customer service representatives at Enterprise Rent-A-Car sites assembly line workers at General Motors or delivery drivers at LaRosa's Pizzeria.

To respond to the challenge HR professionals are reimagining talent acquisition strategies and deploying a variety of new tactics and technologies.

As a result organizations are experimenting with novel ideas involving benefits such as flexibility career development and holistic care and adjusting them to fit candidates' new expectations. At the same time companies are refocusing on the basics: streamlining the candidate experience reviewing pay to be more competitive and sprucing up employee referral programs.

""There definitely is a war for talent and even more than that it is an arms race to attract talent"" says Jamie Kohn research director for the HR practice at consulting firm Gartner. ""Companies are trying to get back to pre-pandemic growth and are focused on increasing headcount while job seekers feel they have more options and now expect more from potential employers.""

The power balance between employers and employees has shifted according to Amy Goldfinger senior vice president for global talent at Walmart.

""The pandemic has fundamentally changed the labor market creating a high demand/supply gap for talent and today's job seekers have higher expectations"" she says. ""We've introduced cash bonuses leave policies vaccine incentives and counseling services to help associates get through these trying times.""











Wages on the Rise

As the U.S. labor market began to rebound in the summer of 2020 and the competition for hourly workers grew fierce employers began citing labor shortages as the cause for hiring difficulties. Critics responded that the lack of job seeker interest was proof that low-wage workers simply aren't paid enough. These employees also are often asked to enforce mask mandates and risk physical harm at the hands of irate customers. In response employers such as Chipotle CVS Southwest Airlines and Walmart have given front-line workers raises.

""Employers are realizing they have to be wage-competitive"" says George Kelly senior vice president at Milwaukee-based recruiting and staffing firm ManpowerGroup. ""Wage growth in the U.S. has been incredibly slow over the last 30-plus years but since the summer of 2020 wage growth has accelerated driven by competition.""

Nela Richardson senior vice president and chief economist at payroll provider ADP notes that compensation in October 2021 grew 4.9 percent year-over-year. ""In the decade leading up to the pandemic wages never grew more than 3.5 percent from the previous year"" she says. Wages in low-paying service-sector jobs have been growing the fastest during the recovery she adds.

The number of postings on jobs sites such as ZipRecruiter that advertise pay of $15 an hour has more than doubled since 2019 says Julia Pollak the site's chief economist. The proportion of jobs that offer signing bonuses has also risen.

Practitioners tend to agree that resetting compensation is a solid long-term move but many say the increased use of signing bonuses is an ugly and unsustainable facet of the current environment.

""Because many employers thought this labor shortage would be temporary and would clear up this year they resorted to solutions like hiring bonuses"" says Niki Ramirez SHRM-CP founder of Phoenix-based HR Answers an HR consultancy for small businesses. ""[The practice is] flexible and easy to roll back but some employers have found as a consequence that workers are staying for a short period and then moving on to the next job trying to snap up multiple signing bonuses.""

Steve Browne SHRM-SCP chief people officer at Cincinnati-based LaRosa's Pizzeria says his team is reviewing compensation but does not want to end up in a reactionary predicament despite the difficulty the company is having recruiting cooks drivers and servers.

""I see companies trying to compete from a wage perspective offering signing bonuses and people just chase the dollars"" Browne says. ""I know several employers in the Cincinnati area that are offering a high wage and they still can't get applicants. If you only change wages it won't work.""

In today's talent-scarce environment employers should be conducting regular industry benchmarking and reviewing salary plans experts say. However pay is just a starting point.

Many HR professionals are working more closely with their colleagues in compensation and benefits to better understand where they need to adjust rewards in order to hire in this labor market. ""But winning the competition for talent will be more about the culture and the people and not just about the money"" Thompson stresses.











Offering Perks that Matter

A prominent feature of the war for talent has been the way companies are one-upping each other regarding employee benefits.

""Creative perks have become in vogue again"" Kelly says. These benefits many of which are designed to alleviate the stresses of the pandemic include mental health well-being and family caregiving support; financial planning; onsite child care; sponsored transportation; and allowances for home office and remote technology.

Organizations have also announced they are making big investments in workers' professional development with the idea that employers can offer their front-line workers something truly meaningful: a brighter future through upskilling an internal career path or a debt-free college education.

Walmart is investing nearly $1 billion over the next five years in career training and development. Other large employers of hourly workers including Amazon Chipotle Starbucks and Target have announced enhancements to their tuition and training programs.

Walmart's Live Better U program pays 100 percent of tuition and books for eligible associates who want to earn college degrees or learn trade skills. In addition ""Walmart Academies give us more avenues to upskill associates so they can reach for their dream job internally"" Goldfinger says. ""For example as we grow our health and wellness business we've made available degrees and certifications to support these business areas like pharmacy technicians.""

Chipotle offers to cover all expenses for 100 types of degrees across agriculture hospitality culinary technology and business studies at 10 universities says Mike Miller director of talent acquisition at the company. ""Our retention rate is three-and-a-half times higher among employees enrolled in the education assistance program and crew members participating are seven-and-a-half times more likely to move into a management role"" he adds.

Ramirez says she's seeing a renewed focus on reskilling and upskilling across organizations of all sizes as well as training and career pathing being promoted in job ads. SHRM research shows that 2 in 5 organizations plan to offer additional professional growth and development opportunities to attract more job applicants for positions that are difficult to fill.

Southwest Airlines officially launched its internal career mobility program earlier last year. Muccio says there's already been a lot of interest from employees who want to understand the roles available to them and the development opportunities that can help them land those positions.

Chipotle believes its transparent path to advancement can be a life-changing opportunity for hourly workers. ""Crew members can advance to restaurant management in just three-and-a-half years making an average salary of $100000 and leading a multimillion-dollar business"" Miller says. ""More than 90 percent of our restaurant management roles are internal promotions.""





The latest data from the U.S. Department of Labor shows there are approximately 4.2 million fewer workers in the labor force compared to just prior to the pandemic. Labor force participation today is lower than at any time in the past 20 years. But job openings a measure of labor demand stood at 10.9 million at the end of summer 2021—the highest level ever recorded. That's all the more remarkable because it occurred during a period of elevated unemployment.

At the same time the monthly numbers of people quitting their jobs are setting records. Workers tend to quit at high rates when jobs are abundant but evidence suggests that the pandemic-induced ""turnover tsunami"" has been propelled by additional factors. Workers are unwilling to return to industries that experienced severe lockdowns for example and they had been able to be more selective due to stimulus payments and enhanced federal unemployment benefits (which ended in September 2021). Employees are also motivated to change jobs for better pay and benefits as well as more flexibility. Or they may have concerns about health safety and wellness. Many are pursuing career changes or going into business for themselves. ""The leisure and hospitality sector was grounded during the pandemic opportunities shrank and employers did not realize how difficult it would be to get furloughed and laid-off employees to come back"" says Julia Pollak chief economist at ZipRecruiter. ""Leisure and hospitality and manufacturing are having the biggest troubles because so many of those jobs need to be done in person and face-to-face. One of the main difficulties is that remote opportunities have expanded in other industries."" While supply and demand for workers will eventually come back into balance experts and practitioners believe many of the changes in how companies recruit and hire talent will remain long after the pandemic subsides. ""The pandemic was a catalyst for changing things that organizations maybe knew should be changed but lacked enough incentive to make the change"" says Jeff Lackey vice president of talent acquisition at CVS Health. Greg Muccio director of talent acquisition at Southwest Airlines says ""The last 20 months have taught employers that you can't discount how people feel about their jobs their lives and their families and how important it is to take care of your employees and their families."" —R.M.



The Most Desired Benefit



Then there's flexibility the most-sought-after benefit of all according to widespread research. The demand undeniably grew out of the pandemic experience. Job seekers from all sectors and levels are making it clear that flexibility is a top priority—including for jobs that can't be done remotely. It's also a critical factor in managing employee retention.

""Where people have gotten the flexibility to be able to choose how they integrate their work with the rest of their life they are not willing to give that up"" Kohn says. ""Job seekers have so many options right now that they don't have to make the trade-offs and sacrifices they used to make and are proving unwilling to do so. That's why flexibility is the most common theme employers are promoting to attract talent.""

She adds that flexibility is different for varied talent segments. For knowledge workers autonomy is paramount. And for employers hiring for remote-friendly roles proximity is no longer a limiting factor for recruitment.

""Rethinking talent location has been one of the biggest changes"" Kohn says. ""HR leaders are pushing the business to think about which roles really need to be in the office and how often and then determining whether they can source talent from anywhere.""

Throwing off the shackles of geography-bound recruiting by offering work-from-home opportunities has helped General Motors boost its hiring above pre-pandemic levels says Cyril George the company's global talent acquisition director.

In April the automaker unveiled its ""Work Appropriately"" campaign which George describes as a culture change for its professional workforce. ""Leadership decided to put the trust in the employees and their managers in terms of deciding what works best for them based on their roles and situation"" he says.

""From a recruiting standpoint"" George adds ""it has significantly opened up the talent pool for us.""

Then there's the majority of workers in the U.S. especially in front-line roles who aren't able to work remotely. For these employees flexibility and predictability in scheduling are important specifically in support of health and wellness as well as child care and caregiving responsibilities.

""Flexibility matters to hourly workers"" Kohn says. ""Think about the struggles that front-line workers have had during the pandemic. Retail workers are leaving their jobs to work in customer service roles that can be done at home to get that flexibility that meets their core needs.""

It's not possible to offer field agents at Enterprise a work-from-home experience says Marie Artim vice president of global talent acquisition at Enterprise Holdings. ""But what we can do is offer more flexible scheduling and schedule certainty so our employees can take care of the things they have to do in their lives outside of work.""



Getting Back to Basics



The pandemic has forced organizations to be agile and to adopt creative recruitment approaches but the public health crisis has also presented an opportunity to perfect the fundamentals.

""Candidates are walking in the door with a couple of offers in hand and employers need to be ready to move as quickly as possible"" Kohn says. ""That means rethinking assessments controlling the number of interviews and postponing background checks all to eliminate any delays in the process.""

As a result many companies have streamlined their application processes. General Motors invested significantly in technology to improve the candidate experience including by integrating online job postings with its applicant tracking system so candidates don't have to duplicate their application information.

Employers have also been removing unnecessary obstacles that historically limited candidate opportunities.

""We're focused on lowering barriers to entry"" Walmart's Goldfinger says. ""For example we do not have arbitrary education requirements—even our store managers are not required to have a college degree.""

Lackey says CVS eliminated its high school education requirement for many front-line positions and now uses a simple assessment instead. In addition CVS has been recruiting against attrition in order to have roles filled prior to employee departures.

Employers have also reinvigorated their employee referral programs. ""Referrals have been a top source of new talent for us and a great way to recognize our employees"" Artim says.

Old-school sourcing channels produced stellar results for Thompson at previous employers. Those channels included reaching out to local churches and running ads for bilingual roles in ethnic community newspapers. Experimenting with a mix of old and new—including virtual hiring events—was also ""hugely successful"" she says.

The pandemic is prompting employers to rethink traditional ways of operating—and to rethink talent acquisition. As candidates at all levels weigh opportunities differently and the competition for talent continues to intensify companies will need to offer an employment experience that candidates prize.



Roy Maurer is an online writer/editor for SHRM who focuses on talent acquisition and labor markets.



Sign-on bonuses have gained widespread popularity as employers struggle to attract talent. Countless busy roads are lined with temporary signs in front of retail and hospitality businesses offering bonuses of as much as $1000 to new hires. But hiring experts warn that one-time bonuses have a range of drawbacks that employers must consider including the following:

Sign-on bonuses have to be offered consistently to all new hires regardless of position; otherwise engagement will be low for those not cashing in.

Current employees will wonder where their bonuses are and will jump ship to collect them somewhere else absent a monetary reward for staying.

Some new hires will take the money and run; even if payments are spaced out over time many workers will still leave if they don't find value in the work.

Attempting to reclaim bonuses from employees who leave early can be a legal nightmare that is rarely worth the expense.

Keeping employees on board for a year or more without offering additional bonuses may be difficult because those workers have already shown a preference for such payments. —Tony Lee

The reason why certain stocks are priced so high is usually due to the company having never or rarely having completed a stock split.

There are many ways to evaluate a stock in addition to its absolute share price. Here we take a look at some of the largest companies in the U.S. and abroad.

Key Takeaways Companies are typically valued by their total market capitalization on a stock exchange or number of shares outstanding times the share price.

Still many investors are interested in the most pricey shares available on an exchange which can indicate exclusivity.

Companies can also be ranked by revenue and profitability.

Top Companies by Stock Price

The most expensive publicly traded share of all time is Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.A) which was trading at $458675 per share as of January 2022. Berkshire hit an all-time high on Jan. 18 2022 at $487255. Thanks to spectacular shareholder gains and the idiosyncrasies of its founder this share value is unlikely to be matched by anything other than continued gains in Berkshire’s share price.

The next company behind Berkshire in terms of nominal share price is NVR (NVR) at $5154.98 per share as of January 2022. Then there is the Seaboard Corporation (SEB) which was trading at $3731.02 and Amazon.com (AMZN) at $2852.86 followed by Alphabet Inc (GOOG) at $2607.03 a share.

Top Companies by Market Cap

By market capitalization as of January 2022 Apple (AAPL) is the biggest company at $2.652 trillion followed by Microsoft (MSFT) at $2.222 trillion Google (GOOGL) at $1.725 trillion Amazon.com (AMZN) at $1.446 trillion Tesla (TSLA) at $947.92 billion and Meta (META) formerly Facebook at $843.34 billion.

Back in 2007 Chinese energy giant PetroChina (PTR) reached an estimated market value of around $1 trillion. However this valuation didn't stick. As of January 2022 PTR's market capitalization stood at just $146.95 billion.

Top Companies by Revenue

In terms of the biggest global companies by revenue Walmart (WMT) comes in as number one—according to the Fortune 500 list. Walmart's revenues were $523964 billion in 2021. Behind Walmart was State Grid with $383906 billion in revenues followed by Amazon with $280522 billion and China National Petroleum at $379130 billion.

Sinopec Group ranks fifth with $407009 billion in annual revenues and the sixth and seventh spots are covered by Apple and CVS Health with $260174 billion and $256776 billion in yearly revenues respectively.

Based on only U.S.-headquartered companies' 2020 performance Walmart still has the top spot while Amazon comes in second. Exxon Mobil ranks third and Apple ranks fourth. Healthcare companies take up the fifth seventh and eighth spots: CVS UnitedHealth Group and McKesson generating $256.78 billion $242.15 billion and $231.05 billion respectively.

Berkshire Hathaway ranks sixth with $254.62 billion in annual revenues and the ninth and tenth spots are covered by AT&T and AmerisourceBergen at $181.19 billion and $179.59 billion in yearly revenues respectively.

Based on only U.S.-headquartered companies' 2019 performance Walmart still has the top spot while ExxonMobil (XOM) comes in second with $290.21 billion a year in revenues. Apple ranks third with $265.59 billion and Berkshire Hathaway fourth with $247.84 billion. Healthcare companies take up the sixth through eighth spots: UnitedHealth Group McKesson and CVS generating $226.25 billion $214.32 billion and $194.58 billion respectively.

Top Private Companies

In terms of private companies Forbes ranks Minnesota-based Cargill as the largest private U.S. company with $134.4 billion in annual revenues. The company has 155000 employees. Second is Koch Industries with $115 billion in revenues and 122000 employees. Ranking third is the grocery chain Publix Super Markets with $44.9 billion in annual revenue and 227000 employees.

The fourth and fifth largest private companies are Mars and H-E-B which generate $40 billion and $32.8 billion respectively. Each employs over 100000 employees.

The Bottom Line

On a pure market value measure Apple has often been considered the most valuable publicly traded company of all time. Although Microsoft did briefly hit the $2 trillion market cap mark in June 2021. It is certainly possible another company’s market cap will exceed these measures and maybe—though less likely—another company will surpass Berkshire Hathaway as the highest priced single stock share.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUGh0dHBzOi8vZmluYW5jZS55YWhvby5jb20vbmV3cy90YWxhbm9hLWh1ZmFuZ2EtbWFkZS00OWVycy1oaXN0b3J5LTEzMDA1MzUxNy5odG1s0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Talanoa Hufanga made 49ers history with touchdown vs. Packers,"49ers rookie safety Talanoa Hufanga didn’t reach his stated goal of making the Pro Bowl as a special teams player his rookie year.

Defensive lineman Jordan Willis broke through the line though and got a hand on the kick. It careened into the air before falling to the snow-dusted turf at the 6. That’s where Hufanga picked it up and ran into the end zone for a game-tying touchdown.

""Hearst Magazines and Yahoo may earn commission or revenue on some items through the links below.""

Kelly Clarkson is a singer author daytime TV host and fashionista.

When she isn’t coaching her team on The Voice the Texas native is having a blast leading discussions on The Kelly Clarkson Show. Apart from featuring celebrity guests and talking about the latest news headlines Kelly shows off her breathtaking vocals in her Kellyoke segment. And if that wasn’t enough for folks to tune in every weekday the American Idol alum always steps onto the stage with a buzz-worthy outfit.

On January 12 that’s exactly what happened when the 39-year-old mother of three wore a black floor-length maxi dress with colorful stars. A closer look reveals that the long-sleeved dress has a V neckline black buttons in the front and multicolored tassel drawstrings at the cuffs.

After welcoming viewers back to her show Kelly wasted no time showing off the tassels on her incredibly cute dress. In fact a clip of Kelly playing with the tassels now lives on The Kelly Clarkson Show’s official Instagram page. “The only thing better than a dress with pockets? A dress with tassels ✨” a post of the dress was captioned.

Right on cue Kelly’s fans immediately flooded the comments section and many of them had the same question for her. “Kelly I have GOT to get this dress. How can I find out about it????” one person wrote. “Who made this dress?” another added. “Love the dress! Where from?” a different fan said.

Shortly after the episode aired Kelly's stylist Candice Lambert revealed that the artist's dress is from the brand Rococo Sand. Although we couldn't locate Kelly's exact outfit the resort fashion clothing line has two similar looks — one is black with gold sequin stars and black tassels while the second one is a white version of Kelly's colorful dress. What’s more both appear to be coverup dresses for the beach.

Either way we love the outfit and clearly Kelly's fans do too!

Wells has owned John Deere tractors his whole life. Last year the stop engine light came on his tractor.

“All it was was some water in a little old sensor wire and he walks around there and dried it out and took it off and put it back on” Wells said in an interview with AL.com

He has always gotten his tractor repaired at a local dealer so he was surprised to learn his only repair option was to call John Deere to adjust proprietary software on the machine a repair he says took a John Deere technician less than three minutes but cost over $600.

Wells on Wednesday filed suit against John Deere in federal court in Huntsville alleging the company’s proprietary tractor software is creating a monopoly that’s unfair to small farmers. His lawyers are asking the court to declare it a class action suit and say they hope to represent all affected in Alabama Tennessee and Mississippi.

“This is at its heart an antitrust case about the inability for farmers to find anybody to work on their tractors outside of a John Deere dealership because of a certain proprietary software that’s been installed on them” said Wells’s attorney Eric Artrip.

A spokesman for John Deere declined an interview telling Al.com in an email on Friday that the company does not comment on pending litigation.

According to Artrip the lawsuit is the result of efforts from a growing national “right-to-repair” movement that has resulted in legislation being introduced in statehouses around the country to protect people’s ability to independently repair hi-tech products from cell phones to farm equipment.

The complaint alleges John Deere has created a monopoly in violation of the federal Sherman Antitrust Act by stifling competition in the lucrative tractor repair market forcing small repair shops to close by creating proprietary software and driving up prices for small farmers in need of tractor repairs.

“What that means is farmers now have to pay a technician to work on their farm or they have to haul their tractor to a dealership sometimes forty miles away sometimes several hundreds of miles away to get them repaired because they can’t repair them themselves and they can’t get anybody who is not outside of a dealership or not in a dealership to work on them” he said.

The lawsuit alleges that in the early 2000′s John Deere took steps to winnow repair providers requiring businesses to become either repair or sales entities but not both. Lawyers for Wells argue that following the filing of right to repair legislation in multiple states John Deere committed to end its practice of making software proprietary but has not followed through on that commitment.

A separate federal class action lawsuit against John Deere was filed in North Dakota on Wednesday. A similar suit was filed in Illinois earlier this month.

To Wells the cattle farmer paying more than $600 for a small repair was unfair. A larger repair could represent a serious setback and eat away at profits for a small business.

“You’re pretty much at John Deere’s mercy whatever they want to charge you if you can’t fix it yourself and with these new tractors you can’t” he said.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiK2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZveG5ld3MuY29tL3ZpZGVvLzYyOTMwMjExNzcwMDHSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,John Deere facing lawsuit for allegedly creating repair monopoly,Log in to comment on videos and join in on the fun.,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMikgFodHRwczovL3d3dy5kZXNtb2luZXNyZWdpc3Rlci5jb20vc3RvcnkvbW9uZXkvYnVzaW5lc3MvMjAyMi8wMS8yMy9pb3dhLXVuaW9uLW1lbWJlcnNoaXAtZmxhdC0yMDIxLWRlZXJlLXN0cmlrZS1yZXRpcmVtZW50LXBheS1pbmNyZWFzZS82NTY1Njk1MDAxL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Iowa union membership below U.S. even after Deere strike report says,"Despite hosting the largest strike in the country Iowa’s labor movement stagnated last year.

The number of workers in the state who belonged to unions remained flat at 93000 from 2020 to 2021 according to a U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics report released last week. While Iowa temporarily bucked the national trend of shrinking union membership worker advocates and local labor leaders expressed frustration that they have not been able to capitalize on what the Des Moines Register/Mediacom Iowa Poll and other opinion surveys have shown is a rise in pro-union sentiment.

Iowa also remains far behind the nation as a whole in the proportion of its worker who belong to unions. According to the bureau 6.5% of Iowa workers were union members last year as compared to the national rate of 10.3%.

Among its neighbors Iowa had the second-lowest rate of unionization behind only South Dakota where about 4% of workers were in unions. To the north Minnesota led the region with 16%. To the east the rate in Illinois was 14%.

Iowa has trended away from organized labor in recent years. Since 2018 the number of Iowans who are members of unions has declined by about 20000 an 18% drop.

But unions in Iowa seemed to get a boost last year when about 10000 United Auto Workers members at Deere & Co. plants the majority of them in Iowa went on strike in October. The largest work stoppage in the country in 2021 and the biggest in Iowa since the Bureau of Labor Statistics began tracking walkouts in 1991 it resulted in a contract promising substantial raises for the workers and improved retirement benefits.

Coming at a time when workers were quitting jobs in record numbers expressing dissatisfaction with stagnant pay skimpy benefits and unsafe working conditions the Deere labor action was popular among Iowans. In the Nov. 7-10 Iowa Poll 58% of respondents said they sided with the workers over the company.

Pro-union views also were on the rise across the country. According to a September Gallup poll about 68% of Americans held a favorable view of unions last year the highest rate since 1965.

But there was no concomitant surge in union activity in Iowa where workers at just three companies held unionization elections last year. Employees formed a 100-member union at Clow Valve Co. in Oskaloosa and a five-member union at Midwest Air Traffic Control Service in Dubuque. They rejected a proposed 20-member union at a Cargill facility in Buffalo.

Labor leaders blamed the lack of union growth in Iowa on the challenges of organizing through the COVID-19 pandemic the realities of operating in a small state where workforces are scattered and labor laws they said unfairly favor management. University of Iowa labor educator Paul Iversen however said it may be too early to discount the rise in unions' popularity.

“I still think the current militancy wave will hit Iowa” Iversen said. “I can’t say for sure when it will happen. I can’t say it will happen at all. But there’s a lot of momentum and energy still.”

Without new laws around unionization ‘the stakes are really high’

During a news conference in connection with the release of the Bureau of Labor Statistics report members of the left-leaning Economic Policy Institute said unions nationally saw some significant wins last year.

In addition to public opinion polls showing that Americans have become increasingly pro-labor institute President Heidi Shierholz pointed out that some unions gained national attention with successful strikes last year. The UAW for example secured a new contract for Deere workers that protected a pension program boosted retirement bonuses and increased wages by 10% — about triple the wage gain most unions have secured over the last two decades.

Shierholz also pointed to the tightening of the labor market as low interest rates fed economic expansion. With increased demand for labor coming as the workforce shrank companies have had to compete for a smaller pool of workers.

But Shierholz said the trend eventually will subside as COVID-19 case counts decrease. And she said organizing will continue to be a struggle for many unions.

Nationally the number of workers in unions decreased by 241000 last year. About 10% of workers across the country are in unions roughly half the proportion when the Bureau of Labor Statistics started tracking the data in 1983.

In Iowa the number of workers in unions has decreased about 19000 since 2018 a 17% drop. Over the last decade the proportion of workers in unions in Iowa has decreased to 6.5% from 11.2%.

Shierholz called on Congress to pass the Protecting the Right to Organize Act a federal bill that has stalled as lawmakers debate debated trillion-dollar bills aimed at boosting the economy.

Among other changes the PRO Act would increase financial penalties against companies whose managers violate labor laws such as threatening to fire workers for unionizing. The bill also would allow unions to bargain for the right to charge dues to every member they represent increasing their coffers and potentially giving them more resources to start union drives at other local companies.

“If policymakers fail to act the downward trends in unionization will likely continue and the post-pandemic economy will be marked by widespread inequality and wage stagnation for people"" Shierholz said. “The stakes are really high.”

United Food & Commercial Workers Local 222 President Leo Kanne said the PRO Act would help increase the number of unionized businesses in the state. Kanne a veteran labor leader whose local is based in Sioux City said he assisted workers trying to organize a couple bargaining units over the last year.

But he said managers told employees that the company would move their factories if they organized. He said some laid off pro-union workers. Though the managers didn’t directly lay off the employees for organizing Kanne said other workers became afraid to unionize.

“Companies they can violate labor laws all the time when it comes to organizing” Kanne said. “And there’s no penalties for that. It’s just a slap on the wrist. I’m frustrated.”

Physical challenges to organizing unions in Iowa

Iversen the University of Iowa labor professor said there have been other obstacles to organizing during the pandemic.

union leaders and employees don’t have much of a path to build solidarity when so many people work from home he said. At factories and warehouses where most employees still report to work in person some workers have become hesitant to meet with the co-workers especially as COVID-19 outbreaks sickened hundreds.

More:With UAW strike concluded Deere reports record annual profit: $5.96 billion. Next year looks strong too.

“The employer has a built-in advantage (in) any union organizing campaign” Iversen said. “They have a captive audience. They can force people to listen to their meetings. Union organizers have to meet people at their homes or bars or other places. They can’t force them to be there. Organizing is a very one-on-one process.”

UFCW Local 431 President Simplice Kuelo who represents workers from Des Moines to the eastern edge of Iowa echoed Iversen on the pandemic's effect on organizing.

Union representatives employees involved in organizing drives who approached workers at their homes after hours found many wanted to keep their distance he said. He added that building a connection with a stranger while wearing masks also is difficult.

“You start a campaign you’ve got to get familiar with the people” he said. “You’ve got to build trust with the people. But how do you build trust? You’ve got to contact people. But when you contact a person they want to keep their distance.”

Then there is the issue of worker concentration or lack thereof. Des Moines is the Midwest's fastest-growing large metro but its 709000 population is a fraction of the 9.6 million people in Chicago the 4.4 million people in Detroit or the 3.7 million people in Minneapolis-St. Paul — cities where the union presence is much stronger.

As a result labor leaders don’t have a large employment center in Iowa to draw from said Iversen who used to represent unions in Minnesota. This means union leaders in Iowa often have to drive hours between factories a barrier to efficient organizing.

Colin Gordon a University of Iowa history professor said organizing also is more difficult because a greater share of people have lost or left factory jobs and found service-sector positions at restaurants and hotels.

The biggest service-sector employers grow through franchising meaning that workers at two McDonald’s locations for example are not necessarily tied together through a common ownership. Gordon said that as a result recent high-profile union drives at Starbucks locations in Buffalo New York will have no direct impact on Starbucks employees in Des Moines.

Given these challenges Iowa Federation of Labor President Charlie Wishman said the state’s local labor leaders need more help from national unions. He said locals need more money to hire organizers who increase the number of members who pay more dues which leads to more organizers.

“A lot of unions want to concentrate on the East and West coasts and things like that” Wishman said. “There’s an enormous amount of potential to grow in the Midwest — especially in Iowa. But like so many things in life the Midwest gets overlooked it feels like.”

After graduating from Iowa State University in 1956 Leonard spent 41 years as a product engineer at John Deere. And after his time at John Deere Leonard returned to ISU as an associate professor in the Department of Agricultural and Biosystems Engineering.

“I was coming home to where it all began” Leonard said in an article published in 2015 after his return to Iowa State.

Before officially returning to ABE Leonard seemed to already be here. He had the ability to do amazing things in the engineering field while still dedicating time to ABE in the process. He often returned to Iowa State to serve on the ABE department external advisory committee and later established a scholarship called the Ronald and Elizabeth Leonard Leadership in Creativity and Inspiration Scholarship in dedication of his passion to spark creativity and innovation in the minds and hearts of students.

From research to teaching and everything in between Leonard was always working on many different projects acquiring seven US patents. But amidst his work one of the many things Leonard is remembered for is his ‘always calm’ demeanor and taking the time to build relationships with his fellow coworkers.

“Ron became a good friend and mentor to me” said Steve Mickelson previous ABE department chair. “I always appreciated his calm demeanor in giving me professional advice and guidance. He was always interested in my career.”

Along with his caring personality Leonard received many awards and certificates throughout his time in engineering. He was a member of the National Academy of Engineering elected into the academy for his ‘contributions to the design and manufacturing of cotton harvesters lawn and garden machines and agricultural tractors.’ Leonard was also involved in the American Society of Agricultural Engineers as well as the Society of Automotive Engineers.

Leonard stayed active in retirement through his consulting firm – where he would sometimes do consulting with clients that wanted to do international business. Working with other national cultures was ‘especially valuable’ to him he had said.

“I always enjoyed talking to Ron about the engineering discipline’s current state and future state. Ron spent a lot of time keeping up on the latest engineering impact in our nations” Mickelson said.

Leonard did a lot in ABE and so much outside of the department too. He would always take the time to learn about the culture and people around him and was passionate about encouraging students to be the best they could be even when he was working in the industry and not the university.

“As a National Academy of Engineering member and longtime John Deere leader Ron brought tremendous insights to our department helping us reach our department goal of becoming the #1 ranked ABE department in the nation for undergraduate and graduate programs” Mickelson said.

Leonard was a passionate hardworking intelligent and caring individual whose generosity creativity and care set a tone of kindness in ABE and will forever live on as the legacy of Ron Leonard.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmR0bnBmLmNvbS9hZ3JpY3VsdHVyZS93ZWIvYWcvbmV3cy9hcnRpY2xlLzIwMjIvMDEvMjMvam9obi1kZWVyZS1hZGRzLXNldmVuLXN0YXJ0dXBzLTIwMjItMtIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,John Deere Adds Seven Startups to Its 2022 Startup Collaborator Program,"Equipped with an all-new John Deere PowerTech 13.6L engine 9 Series tractors pull wider implements faster and more precisely.

According to a federal complaint filed in the Eastern District of New York on Jan. 8 Delta Air Lines passenger Shane McInerney 29 of Galway Ireland refused to wear a mask during an eight-hour flight from Dublin to John F. Kennedy International Airport on Jan. 7 despite being told “dozens of times” to do so.

McInerney went on to throw an empty beverage can at another passenger kick the back of the passenger seat in front of him and put a fist up close to the flight captain’s face according to the complaint.

At one point McInerney walked from his economy-class seat to the Delta One-class section to complain about his food to a flight attendant the complaint says. When he began to return to his seat he “pulled down his pants and underwear and exposed his buttocks” to the flight attendant and nearby passengers it said.

The flight crew considered diverting the flight to remove McInerney but the plane continued to New York.

When the flight was on its final approach to the runway McInerney left his seat and refused to sit back down the complaint said. Authorities took him into custody upon landing.

McInerney made his initial appearance in Brooklyn Federal Court on Jan. 14 and has been charged with intentionally assaulting and intimidating a member of a flight crew a felony that carries a maximum sentence of 20 years in prison.

He made a court appearance last week and was released on $20000 bond.

His attorney Benjamin Yaster declined to comment The Associated Press reports.

Delta spokesperson Morgan Durrant confirmed the incident to USA TODAY and said the airline has ""zero tolerance"" for unruly behavior.

Airlines have had to deal with a spike in unruly passengers since a federal mask mandate was implemented in early 2021. The mandate is set to remain in place through at least March 18.

There have already had more than 150 reports of unruly passengers this year 60% of which were related to masking rules according to the Federal Aviation Administration.

The FAA can impose a fine of up to $37000 per violation for unruly passengers and each incident can result in multiple violations. The agency levied more than $1 million in fines against problem passengers last year.

Dedicated to supporting China’s new economy Sequoia China Infrastructure Fund aims to invest in infrastructure developments supporting the mainland’s digital economy new energy and life science sectors with both physical facilities and financing the two companies said in a release. The fund recently closed at an undisclosed sum after submitting an SEC filing in October of 2021.

“Sequoia China Infrastructure Fund will become another partner of choice for Chinese entrepreneurs in supporting companies’ visions with the backdrop of an exciting growth story of China’s new economy” said Neil Shen Founding and Managing Partner of Sequoia China. “We are thrilled to partner with Brookfield with its expertise in infrastructure investing globally. Together we will assist businesses to thrive in every aspect of their expansion needs.”

Brookfield which manages $650 billion in assets globally is participating in the fund as a limited partner as it has been ramping up its investment in data centres and renewable energy facilities across Asia Pacific in recent years backing strategies in Australia and India as global institutions chase the rapidly growing digital infrastructure sector.

Technology-Property Convergence

With Brookfield’s support Sequoia one of China’s most active tech investors plans to pursue opportunities in new energy and digital infrastructure ambient and cold chain warehousing tech parks and manufacturing facilities.

The fund will also provide financing for fast-growing companies with Brookfield’s global management pointing to a role for the company’s Oaktree credit division in the new venture.

“The combined strengths of Sequoia China and Brookfield together with our Oaktree franchise enable us to offer holistic solutions to entrepreneurs looking to expand their businesses” said Brookfield chief executive Bruce Flatt. “We look forward to collaborating with Sequoia China to support the growth of some of the most exciting companies in the country.”

The statement explained without elaborating that the joint venture will provide entrepreneurs with “new forms of capital to support their infrastructure requirements as they scale their businesses.”

The partners say they hope to leverage Brookfield’s expertise in managing alternative assets alongside Sequoia’s experience helping to build China’s new economy.

“We are excited to announce our latest strategic partnership as Brookfield continues to expand its footprint and capabilities in China. Sequoia China’s unrivalled insight into the country’s new economy coupled with Brookfield’s global expertise will deliver a powerful suite of solutions to business owners and entrepreneurs. We look forward to working together on the many opportunities that lie ahead.” said Brookfield’s head of China Stuart Mercier.

The fund has attracted interest from several leading institutional investors including sovereign wealth funds pension funds and asset management companies Sequoia said in a separate release.

Shen and Sequoia are well known in mainland tech circles for having backed top tech firms like Bytedance Pinduoduo and Meituan with the company having gradually edged into the real estate realm in recent years through investments in JD Logistics and DNE Group the new identity of recently merged China commercial and industrial developers D&J and New Ease.

For Brookfield which has $12 billion in assets under management in China the deal promises to expand a portfolios with already includes the 152839 square metre (1.6 million square foot) One East commercial complex in Shanghai as well as the former Pradera Asia retail portfolio which the company acquired in June last year for $1.4 billion.

Brookfield declined to disclose financial details of the fund and Sequoia China had not yet responded to inquiries from Mingtiandi by the time of publication.

Pan-Asian Expansion

Brookfield’s participation in the Sequoia fund comes just half of a year after the firm’s infrastructure division formed a 50-50 joint venture with NYSE-listed real estate investment trust Digital Realty to establish a data centre platform in India named BAM Digital Realty.

That JV made its first acquisition in July when it paid INR 600 crore ($80 million) to acquire a 30-acre plot in India’s Navi Mumbai from developer K Raheja Corp according to local newspaper Business Standard with plans to develop a data centre on the site.

That India initiative was Brookfield’s second data centre strategy in the region after the firm’s 2019 acquisition of Australian-based hyperscale data centre operator DCI Data Centre.

In addition to its investments in digital infrastructure Brookfield has in recent years been one of the largest investors in Asia Pacific logistic properties – another real estate sector closely tied to the new economy. In 2018 the company gave that logistics angle an injection of infrastructure by entering into a 50:50 joint venture with GLP to develop and operate rooftop solar panels on warehouses and commercial developments managed by Asia’s largest warehouse developer and operator.",,,,,,,,,

But the bulbs for sale were highly inefficient shorter lasting incandescent ones — the pear-shaped orbs with glowing wire centers — meaning that over time Mrs. Turner who lives in a neighborhood where a quarter of the residents are below the poverty line would spend hundreds of dollars more on electrical bills because of the extra power they use than if she’d purchased energy-saving LED lights.

It’s a pattern repeated nationwide. Research has shown that lower-end retailers like dollar stores or convenience shops still extensively stock their shelves with traditional or halogen incandescent bulbs even as stores serving more affluent communities have shifted to selling far more efficient LEDs. One Michigan study for instance found that not only were LED bulbs less available in poorer areas they also tended to cost on average $2.50 more per bulb than in wealthier communities.

“You just don’t see them in places like Dollar General” said Mrs. Turner a semi-retired addiction-treatment counselor.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnZ2bmcuY29tL2Nhci1zbWFzaGVzLXRocm91Z2gtZG9sbGFyLXRyZWUtd2luZG93LWluLXZpY3RvcnZpbGxlLXN0b3JlLWNsb3NlZC11bnRpbC1mdXJ0aGVyLW5vdGljZS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Car smashes through Dollar Tree window in Victorville store closed until further notice,"Car smashes through Dollar Tree window in Victorville store closed until further notice

The 20 Least Populated Maine Towns Maine is a vast state which can be quite remote in some areas. Amazingly Maine has numerous towns that still exist independently even with very little population. Here is a list of the 20 least populated towns in Maine.

Dollar Tree

Dollar Tree stores have for years offered everything they sell for the price of $1. Although recently the chain has declared that they will be bumping prices up by .25 on most items. They still offer a great value on a variety of items. You can find them in Central Maine in Augusta Auburn Farmington Lewiston Skowhegan and Waterville.

Mardens

Like thier saying goes ""You should have bought it when you saw it at Mardens""! Mardens has been a fixtures in Maine for years with some of the best hidden values around. You truly never know what you will find there so it is best to stop by often. With locations in Central Maine in Waterville & Lewiston it's a must stop.

Family Dollar

Unlike the Dollar Tree Family Dollar which is owned by the same corporation incidentally has products for various prices but still has many great discount values. With more locations in Central Maine than any of our other discount stores on the list you should easily be able to locate one close to you. Find them in Gardiner Richmond Fairfield Lewiston Lisbon Falls Sabattus Auburn and Lewiston.

Ocean State Job Lots

Based in Rhode Island Ocean State Job Lots has been growing and expanding all across New England. This a great discount store to score a variety of items. They always have a perfect selection of seasonal items and also a unique selection of food items too. Currently close by stores can be found in Rockland Belfast Oxford and Bangor. There has been strong speculation that Augusta will be the first Central Maine location....hopefully coming soon!

Caswell's Discount Wholesale

Caswell's is a discount store with a focus on food and grocery but they do have other general merchandise also. Some people call it a ""scratch n' dent"" store Caswell's has an amazing variety of items. I really love that you can find grocery items you won't find anywhere else except maybe in other parts of the country. This should be a must stop with only one location in Waterville it's worth the trip.

Dollar General

This is another chain discount store with locations all around the country. Some people call it a neighborhood Walmart since it is more neighborhood based and makes a great place to stop by and grab something quick. Dollar General has expanded quite quickly in recent years. Currently you can find one near you in Central Maine in Augusta Manchester Lisbon Auburn and Lewiston.

Reny's

With a slogan like ""A Maine Adventure"" how can you go wrong with a trip to Reny's. This store has been steadily expanding through out Maine with a great cross section of lifestyle products from clothing to food and a perfect place to find Maine branded items. In Central Maine you can find a Reny's in Farmington Gardiner Madison and Pittsfield with word from the headquarters that a location in Augusta or Waterville may be on the horizon sometimes soon.

Bell's Liquidation

Bell's is one of those places where you can find amazing deals on restaurant and food service close outs. This is the place to go if you have an extra freezer. They also always have a great selection of produce. Going to Bell's is a destination. With only one location on Rt. 17 in Chelsea they are currently only open on Wednesdays & Fridays. If you have never stopped put this on your map of must visit places.

Big Lot's

With Central Maine locations in Augusta Farmington and Auburn this national chain is the go-to for finding great deals on anything from furniture to food items to seasonal decorations. They also can usually locate or have shipped most items that may not be in stock this is a great feature that many of the other discount retailers don't offer.

But the bulbs for sale were highly inefficient shorter lasting incandescent ones — the pear-shaped orbs with glowing wire centers — meaning that over time Mrs. Turner who lives in a neighborhood where a quarter of the residents are below the poverty line would spend hundreds of dollars more on electrical bills because of the extra power they use than if she’d purchased energy-saving LED lights.

It’s a pattern repeated nationwide. Research has shown that lower-end retailers like dollar stores or convenience shops still extensively stock their shelves with traditional or halogen incandescent bulbs even as stores serving more affluent communities have shifted to selling far more efficient LEDs. One Michigan study for instance found that not only were LED bulbs less available in poorer areas they also tended to cost on average $2.50 more per bulb than in wealthier communities.

“You just don’t see them in places like Dollar General” said Mrs. Turner a semi-retired addiction-treatment counselor."

AKRON Ohio — Editor's note: The video in the player above is from a previously published unrelated story.

Nearly 200 residents in downtown Akron are without power today after an electrical outage.

According to officials with FirstEnergy Corp. the outage was caused by a fire that broke out in an underground vault.

Officials released the following statement to 3News regarding the issue:

× Expand A group of volunteers from MAD RVA

Fueled by community members’ participation in the three years since its inception Mutual Aid Distribution Richmond has been a showcase of the power that lies within people.

After establishing itself as a vital resource providing groceries and supplies to those in need the network of community members and organizations is working to open a brick-and-mortar grocery store that will provide access to free food.

“Folks can give what they can and take what they need — all in the spirit of solidarity not charity” MAD RVA volunteer Colleen Howarth says.

Language is important at MAD RVA and “solidarity” is a word used often. A core value adopted by the nonprofit is the idea of “power with not over” and that the organization is a circle of community rather than a linear hierarchy.

Originally founded by neighbors in response to freezing temperatures that were affecting the local homeless community the grassroots nonprofit has experienced an awe-inspiring evolution.

During the pandemic MAD RVA which now has 35 to 40 active volunteers encountered increased need among those seeking its resources in addition to an outpouring of support in the form of donations.

“Folks can give what they can and take what they need — all in the spirit of solidarity not charity.” —Colleen Howarth MAD RVA volunteer

Holding in-person and online supply drives members collected and redistributed food personal protective equipment cleaning supplies hygiene items and money using the Summit Street location of Lamplighter Coffee Roasters for six months before relocating to a larger space of their own at 711 Hospital St. in September 2020.

“So many families in the Richmond area were struggling and resources were largely inaccessible to them — the need was high and continues to be” Howarth says. “Neighbors friends and relatives showed up to support our work and we were able to raise lots of funds and bring in more volunteers to help these families.”

Over the summer the group also held a pop-up store in Chimborazo Park hosted by the Virginia Prison Abolition Collective that offered free clothes and kitchenware along with announcing a call for air-conditioning units and fans.

“We have learned so much about how to engage in mutual aid practices here in Richmond our own capacity as a collective and what we can do to be there for our neighbors” Howarth says.

× Expand Donations received by the mutual aid organization

The shift toward a free store model will help MAD RVA support more people while offering its patrons more agency in ensuring their food security. Although the site of the future grocery store has yet to be determined the organization has been focusing its search on North Side the East End and South Side areas that are more prone to food deserts and scarcity. For those who have grown accustomed to reaching MAD RVA via its now-shuttered Hospital Street space delivery will remain an option once the store opens.

“MAD RVA is excited to transform and create this next iteration of our project and to expand mutual aid even more to our neighbors and with each other” Howarth says. “A new building that has additional space and amenities also means more opportunities to collaborate with other groups in Richmond doing this work and to explore other ways to increase our reach.”

The store is intended to be a more streamlined accessible and permanent version of MAD RVA’s current efforts providing mutual aid in a new building that they plan to rent. The group also plans to set up an ongoing fundraising structure to cover rent utilities and other fees each month. Stay tuned to Instagram and their website for updates on their progress.

“We hope for the free store to be operational in early 2022 and are working hard to make it happen” Howarth says. “One of the main goals of the new building is also to just connect with folks on the importance of mutual aid and how it can be practiced in everyday life.”

The rain that had fallen for much of Friday finally shifted to a wintry mix and then snow for areas north of Oregon Inlet. Inland areas saw a faster transition to all sleet and snow late in Friday afternoon before finally tapering off this morning.

While most of the snow has melted from Kitty Hawk south and roads are clear. Through Southern Shores Duck and up to Corolla as well as on mainland Currituck many roads have improved through the day.

But with the overnight lows expected to be under freezing travel could become treacherous into Sunday morning.

“You should have seen the carpet guy’s face” jokes Design Love Fest founder Bri Emery about when she explained her plan to cover the floor sofa coffee table and credenza in her home office in a rust-colored high-pile shag. “He was like ‘What are you talking about?’”

But transforming the cozy space—a former catchall storage room in their Los Angeles home—into a ’70s-inspired conversation pit was all part of Emery and her husband’s master plan. When the pandemic hit the couple realized they needed a denlike area for working but also a lo-fi space where they could gather with a small group of friends and listen to records be creative and watch movies—or as Emery puts it “Make things not on our phones.”

So with the help of Heather Spaulding of Spaulding Company the pair installed vinyl walnut paneling from Surfacing Solution and hired local builder Santiago Mayer to construct a sofa credenza and coffee table that could be swathed in Shaw’s Ravishing carpet. (The color name? Chili obviously.) The cushions got a layer of similarly toned velvet. A set of newly installed French doors hidden by a sheer curtain would lead to the patio.

But as any good design-minded person knows a reference can get super-literal super-fast. To keep the whole look in the 2020s Emery and Spaulding added modern touches like a custom checkerboard rug from Etsy an Entler lamp and a Jenni Kayne sheepskin throw to keep things feeling fresh.

Not only is it a chill place to work or put on a record (the couple loves to spin disco and soul) it’s a guest room. When it’s time for bed the modular coffee table goes up against the sofa and the velvet sofa cushions can lie flat over the coffee table to make a cozy spot for a friend who wants to stay the night.

“The first time I stepped into the almost completed space I felt like someone had just wrapped me in a warm blanket and I had had the best nap of my life” says Spaulding. The vibes are so good in fact that the tiny nook inspired Emery and her husband to use it as a jumping-off point for their new home in New York which Spaulding is also designing. “It’s kind of crazy because we started working on it during quarantine” says Emery. “And then we had all these dreams about it being this ’60s- or ’70s-like den room—but now it’s manifested into our future house.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmloZWFydC5jb20vY29udGVudC8yMDIyLTAxLTIyLXRoaXMtaXMtdGhlLW1vc3QtcG9wdWxhci1waXp6YS1jaGFpbi1pbi1hcml6b25hL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,This Is The Most Popular Pizza Chain In Arizona,"Everybody has their go-to pizza place that serves up their favorite slices. But what does that look like on a state-by-state level?

Eat This Not That! compiled a list of each state's most popular pizza chain restaurant — and the results are fascinating. To create this list the health and wellness site used offline GPS data from millions of pizza customers from Top Data to see which pizza chains were getting the most foot traffic in each state in 2021.

In Arizona the most popular pizza chain is Little Caesars.

According to Eat This Not That! pizza delivery saw a huge uptick as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic.

""The big names of delivery pizza all saw massive sales increases in 2020: in May Pizza Hut had its best week of delivery and carryout sales in eight years; Domino's maintained double-digit same-store sales growth from the second quarter straight through to the fourth; and Papa John's closed out the year with an incredible $1 million in average unit volume"" the website said.

Whether it was a putrid offense or a run defense which ranked dead last in the league someone was going to be held accountable for the failures of the team.

However you can’t fire all the players so the vast majority of the time the people who pay the ultimate price of their jobs are the coaches. Outside of the already known vacancy at offensive line coach the Steelers saw another vacancy open Saturday night when it was announced that long-time defensive coordinator Keith Butler was retiring.

Related Keith Butler announces his retirement from the Steelers

At this point in time the next logical question is whether Butler will be the first or the only domino to fall on the Steelers’ coaching staff. Of course the vast Steelers fan base wants another title to be on the vacancy list sooner rather than later. That would obviously be the dismissal of Matt Canada as offensive coordinator.

While it looks like the Steelers might be taking this offseason as status quo it will be telling for both head coach Mike Tomlin and team president Art Rooney II. It isn’t as if they haven’t had to replace a coordinator before but you would be hard pressed to find a scenario where the coaching staff has felt this fragile during Mike Tomlin’s tenure with the team.

Consider all which has taken place this season. Adrian Klemm elected to leave the Steelers during the season to go take a lateral college job Butler calls it a career and the organization now has to consider if replacing both coordinators in one offseason would be both wise or logical.

It is already being reported Teryl Austin has the inside track on the defensive coordinator position and when you consider the outcome of this move it would be par for the course for the organization. First it is an obvious and expected internal promotion. Second Austin’s current role as Senior Defensive Assistant/Secondary Coach would likely go unfilled saving the team money.

Before going too far down the rabbit hole of front office coaching hires the team could shock us all and both dismiss Canada and look outside the organization to hire a defensive coordinator. While neither should be expected it could happen and if it did it would make a very clear statement that things might be different this time around.

But what if they don’t? What if the Steelers do what everyone is predicting/expecting them to do? What does that tell us about the future of the front office?

What that likely means is the process is the same but the outcome will be determined more by the acquisition of talent than the acquisition or hiring of coaches. As stated earlier the failure of the 2021 Steelers could be blamed equally on the players as much as the coaches if not more. As any coach knows even the best laid plans can backfire if you don’t have players to execute those plans. The hope is whoever the Steelers hire will be able to put together plans which will maximize the talents of the team taking the field in 2022.

So many fans want the organization to clean house but hopefully those same fans are realistic enough to know that is highly unlikely to happen. There is a good chance the retirement of Butler is the biggest wave made by the organization from a coaching perspective this offseason. If so all fans will have a front row seat to see if this will buck the trend of failed experiments or go as expected.

Now if the team gets word of Kevin Colbert current General Manager retiring that is an entirely new scenario which would need assessed.

Be sure to stay tuned to BTSC for the latest news and notes surrounding the Steelers as they prepare for what could be a very chaotic offseason.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnlvcmtzaGlyZWV2ZW5pbmdwb3N0LmNvLnVrL2xpZmVzdHlsZS9mb29kLWFuZC1kcmluay9iYXJmbHktdGhlLWRvbWluby1yZXZpZXctMzUzNzA3MNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,The Domino Review: an intimate underground bar which oozes class and captures the imagination,"Watch more of our videos on Shots!

I was drawn to the venue as an experience beyond simply sitting and sipping drinks and it did not fall short of my expectations. It’s pucker surroundings - all brickwork and curtains with its impressive selection of spirits flaunted proudly across the bar.

The décor with great attention to detail transports you somewhere a compelling feature of the venue which is especially pronounced in the time-warp-esque bathrooms where surrounded by old photos I wash my hands to the sound of 1920s jazz complete with vinyl crackle.

Moody pendant lamps and lit candles light the way to my seat while the bar and stage are awash with reds and blues. Though ambient I can’t quiet my Dad’s complaining voice in my head wondering how he’ll ever read a thing off the menu.

Fortunately staff are personable attentive and with a fine knowledge of the bar’s offerings more than happy to offer recommendations to a pair of long-sighted cocktail rookies.

My favourite drink was the Isle de Caprea - which delivers on all three promises made by the menu - ‘‘long tropical and alluring’ and packs a refreshing fruity smell like a starburst.

Though the drinks are not short on spectacle featuring long protrusions of leaf and legume which force my companion and I to revise our garnish etiquette the music is the deliberate and deserving focus of the venue.

On the stage sits a moustachioed man who sips on a bottle of beer between familiar covers - the likes of Justin Timberlake and Amy Winehouse - each wrought by a fine voice and a truly remarkable feat of his keyboard-playing hands.

In the early stages the hushed crowd are generally captive; early evening the Domino is a destination for lovers low-key conversations and music fans less suited to catch-ups hen-dos or other such raucous reunions.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed up 99.13 points or 0.3% at 34364.50 gaining for the first day in seven. The S&P 500 finished higher by 0.3% at 4410.13. The Nasdaq Composite gained 0.6% at 13855.13. The Russell 2000 index of small-cap shares closed up as well. The Nasdaq Composite Index turned positive after being down as much as 4.9% earlier in the session. The Dow rallied after being down 1115 points at one point. The S&P 500 closed in the green after briefly hitting a correction earlier in the session falling more than 10% from its Jan. 3 record close. Monday marked one of the best market comebacks in a long time. The session was the first time since the aftermath of the financial crisis in 2008 that the Nasdaq Composite had been down more than 4% on the session and closed up. For the Dow which was down 3.25% at its low it was the biggest intraday comeback since the wild trading of March 2020.

CNBC

JPMorgan's top stock strategist Marko Kolanovic said in a note Monday that the sell-off in equity markets was overblown. ""The recent pullback in risk assets appears overdone and a combination of technical indicators approaching oversold territory and sentiment turning bearish suggest we could be in the final stages of this correction"" Kolanovic said. ""While the market struggles to digest the rotation forced on it by rising rates we expect the earnings season to reassure and in a worst case scenario could see a return of the 'Fed put.'"" Investors began Monday's session dumping technology shares as they have all month on fears the Federal Reserve would soon aggressively tighten policy. However those shares rebounded as the day went on with Facebook-parent Meta Amazon and Microsoft closing higher. Despite Monday's rebound the S&P 500 is still down 7.5% this month on pace for its worst monthly performance since March 2020. The rout this year initially centered around the Nasdaq and technology stocks with investors rotating out of shares whose valuations look less attractive as rates rise. The market action Monday followed a brutal week on Wall Street in the face of mixed company earnings. Selling may have reached a capitulation point with the CBOE Volatility Index (VIX) known on Wall Street as the market's ""fear gauge"" hitting its highest level since November 2020 surpassing the 38 level at its intraday highs. Once the fear gauge hits those extremes the market has a tendency to snap back even if only temporarily. Investors are eyeing the Fed's policy meeting which begins on Tuesday and wraps up Wednesday.

SpaceX’s unmanned Dragon cargo ship successfully undocked from the International Space Station (ISS) Sunday morning and is making its return to Earth.

The CRS-24 cargo ship successfully exited the Space Station’s “keep out sphere” at 10:40 a.m. after a previously scheduled attempt was postponed due to bad weather at its splashdown location off the Florida coast according to statements from SpaceX. The keep out sphere is a 200-meter radius around the ISS.

NASA transmitted the undocking live on NASA TV and on its social media platforms.

The Dragon is expected to have a “parachute-assisted splashdown” off the coast of Panama City Florida at approximately 3:05 p.m CT Monday according to NASA. The splashdown will not be transmitted live but NASA’s space station blog will provide updates.

SpaceX's Dragon cargo ship has departed ISS bringing scientific investigations and medical research back to Earth. NASA

The experiments on board the Dragon will be transported to NASA’s Space Station Processing Facility at the Kennedy Space Center after landing.

“Splashing down off the coast of Florida enables quick transportation of the experiments to NASA’s Space Station Processing Facility at the agency’s Kennedy Space Center in Florida allowing researchers to collect data with minimal sample exposure to Earth’s gravity” NASA said.

The cargo ship is bringing back medical supplies along with more than 4900 pounds of valuable “cargo and research” NASA’s mission control said during its transmission.

This includes a retired light imaging microscope which has been supporting numerous scientific investigations for 12 years as well as samples from studies on colloids.

Cytoskeleton an investigation to analyze the impact of microgravity on cellular signaling molecules is also onboard the Dragon.

“This investigation contributes to our understanding of how the human body responds to microgravity and could support development of countermeasures to help crew members maintain optimum health on future missions” NASA said.

The Dragon launched on December 21 delivering hardware research and crew supplies to the ISS. The cargo ship’s return will mark SpaceX’s 24th “commercial resupply services mission for NASA” according to the space research agency.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNubi5jb20vMjAyMi8wMS8yMy9idXNpbmVzcy9tbXMtb3NjYXItbWF5ZXItZmFjZS1tYXNrLWZvb2Qtcm91bmR1cC9pbmRleC5odG1s0gFSaHR0cHM6Ly9hbXAuY25uLmNvbS9jbm4vMjAyMi8wMS8yMy9idXNpbmVzcy9tbXMtb3NjYXItbWF5ZXItZmFjZS1tYXNrLWZvb2Qtcm91bmR1cA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Bologna face masks and new M&Ms: 4 ways your food got weird this week,"New York CNN Business —

From M&Ms’ mascots becoming more inclusive to a bologna face mask there was lots of wild food news this week.

We’ve done the dutiful task of rounding it all up if you need a change of pace from the doom and gloom of all that other “news.” Here’s what happened:

Bologna mask

It quickly sold out. Kraft Heinz

Oscar Mayer debuted a bologna-inspired face mask that quickly sold out. The new product isn’t actually a slab of meat. Rather Kraft Heinz (KHC) partnered with Seoul Mamas a Korean skin care company to create a “hydrating and restoring hydrogel” mask that promotes skin elasticity improves hydration and moisture retention.

The $5 skin care product was created as a “playful spin on the often serious ‘New Year New You’ trope with its meaty take on the self-care space” Kraft Heinz said in a press release. It will be restocked on Amazon in the coming days.

M&Ms’ makeover

Their new look. M&Ms

M&Ms’ anthropomorphized chocolate characters are getting a makeover the candy maker announced this week. Their most noticeable change: new shoes.

Bear with us here: Green has swapped her go-go boots for sneakers. Brown is sporting lower more sensible heels. Red and Yellow’s shoes now have laces. Orange’s shoe laces are no longer untied. (Much safer now.) And Blue’s shoes while little changed resemble what Anton Vincent president of Mars Wrigley North America described as “a bad version of Uggs.”

Mars Wrigley which owns M&Ms is trying to make the characters — particularly the female ones — more “current” and “representative of our consumer” the company said.

The M&M logo last tweaked in 2019 is also getting an adjustment. Instead of resting on its side it’s set up straight. The new orientation is designed to emphasize the ampersand.

New cans

The new packaging. Coca-Cola

Coca-Cola (CCEP) is unveiling a new look for its flavored Coke products later this month. It’s part of the company’s renewed focus on its Coke brand as it dumps low-selling niche products and tries to drum up excitement for its core beverages.

In the United States new versions of Cherry Coke cans and bottles now come in magenta with the white Coca-Cola logo emblazoned on the regular version and a black Coca-Cola logo on the Zero Sugar version. The new Vanilla Coke cans and bottles are cream-colored and the Cherry Vanilla flavor’s new packaging is a mix of the two hues (heavy on the magenta).

The idea is to “modernize and simplify the look … [and] help consumers find the flavor they’re looking for on the shelf” said Natalia Suarez senior brand manager of Coke Choice Portfolio the company’s North America operating unit.

White Castle changes plans

Love at White Castle is getting canceled because of Omicron. The burger chain’s restaurants in select markets have long held a special dining-in experience on February 14 for lovesick couples who want to remember their special day with $1 burgers and french fries.

But as the highly contagious variant surge continues White Castle announced that it won’t be doing the event at all this year. Rather it’s marking the date with a to-go celebration in a very pink “Love Cube” meal box for two. It includes eight cheese sliders two small soft drinks and a choice of two shareable sides for about $15. And what says love better than that?

Friends and former classmates of the Pakistan-born surgeon behind the world's first pig-to-human heart transplant say they earmarked him for greatness from his medical school days.

Karachi-born Muhammad Mansoor Mohiuddin made headlines last week as the co-founder of the US university programme that successfully transplanted the heart of a genetically modified pig into a gravely ill American man.

While hailed as a medical breakthrough the procedure also raised ethical questions – particularly among some Jews and Muslims who consider pigs to be unclean and avoid pork products.



Muhammad Saeed Qureshi vice-chancellor of the Dow Medical College speaks during an interview.



None of that worried Mohiuddin's friends and former colleagues in Pakistan who remember him as an ace student with a passion for medicine.

""He would be so interested always there always available and always ready to get involved in surgery"" said Muneer Amanullah a specialist who attended Karachi's Dow Medical College with Mohiuddin in the 1980s.

College vice-chancellor Muhammad Saeed Qureshi said pride in Mohiuddin's achievement had flooded the campus.

""There was exhilaration that this has been done by a graduate from this college"" he told AFP.

Mohiuddin was quick to share the limelight with a team of 50 from the University of Maryland Medical School according to Agence France-Presse.



Doctor Muneer Amanullah (left) and Dr. Danish Saeed speak about Muhammad Mansoor Mohiuddin.



""They were all experts of their respective fields"" he told AFP by phone.

""They are the best surgeons the best physicians the best anaesthetists and so on.""

While the prognosis for the recipient of the pig's heart is far from certain the surgery represents a major milestone for animal-to-human transplants.

About 110000 Americans are currently waiting for an organ transplant and more than 6000 patients die each year before getting one according to official figures.



Allama Hasan Zafar Naqvi an Islamic scholar speaks about the transplant.



To meet demand doctors have long been interested in so-called xenotransplantation or cross-species organ donation.

""We were working on this model for 18 years"" Mohiuddin said.

""Those 18 years were dotted with different phases of frustration – as well as breakthroughs – but finally we have done it.""

The surgery is not without controversy however especially given Mohiuddin's Islamic faith.

Pigs are considered unclean by Muslims and Jews – and even some Christians who follow the Bible's Old Testament literally.

""In my view this is not permissible for a Muslim"" said Javed Ahmed Ghamdi a prominent Islamic scholar in a video blog where he discussed the procedure.

But another Islamic scholar in Pakistan gave the procedure a clean bill of health.

""There is no prohibition in sharia"" Allama Hasan Zafar Naqvi told AFP calling it a ""medical miracle.""

""In religion no deed is as supreme as saving a human life"" added Mohiuddin.

In Karachi the surgeon's fellow alumni feel their former colleague may now be destined for even greater glory – medicine's top prize.

""I think... the whole team is in for it in for the Nobel Prize"" said vice-chancellor Qureshi.

The quest for control of Kohl’s (KSS) is heating up.

On Saturday the retailer received an unsolicited $9 billion bid to go private from a consortium backed by an activist investor according to published sources. The hedge fund Starboard Value LP offered to buy the department store chain for $64 a share in cash The New York Times and The Wall Street Journal both reported.

Starboard controls Acacia Research Corp. the group making the buyout overture according to the reports. Its offer would be a significant bump up from the Kohl’s current share price which closed at $46.84 on Friday.

A spokesperson for Kohl’s didn’t immediately return a request for comment.

The company has been in the crosshairs of activist investors and short sellers for months. In December Engineer Capital said in a letter to Kohl’s board of directors “the public market is not appreciating Kohl’s in its current form” and “there is no excuse for the Board to cling to the status quo.”

It was the second push from an activist investor group in 2021. Kohl’s settled with another group in April agreeing to appoint three new members to its board.

And last week another activist hedge fund Macellum Advisors said in a letter Kohl’s board of directors and leadership team spent last year “materially mismanaging the business and failing to implement necessary” improvements. The hedge fund owns about 5% of Kohl’s stock.

Macellum said it planned to nominate a slate of new board members unless Kohl’s decides to work with the firm. If Kohl’s board won’t make changes the company should explore a sale the activists said.

In a statement Tuesday the retailer said Macellum had been “unwilling to constructively engage” with Kohl’s and said the fund’s letter and announcement were “distracting.”

The knives have been out for the Kohl’s for months as one activist investor after another has written to the board or publicly advocated for a change in leadership company strategy or both.

Brick-and-mortar giants such as Walmart (WMT)and Target (TGT) as well as discount chains like TJ Maxx (TJX) and Burlington have been pressuring department store chains for years. Some such as Sears and Neiman Marcus have been driven into bankruptcy.

But Kohl’s has taken steps to draw shoppers in recent years including partnering with Amazon to accept returns on Amazon purchases at its own stores adding new clothing and homegoods brands expanded its merchandise and even leasing out space at a handful of stores to Planet Fitness and Aldi.

Concerned residents bombarded the Trenton Fire Department’s dispatch line thinking they smelled gas.

The calls began Thursday but Trenton Fire Chief Keith Anderson said the majority of calls were reported on Friday.

The chief was told an emergency gas pipe repair was underway at the Riverview landfill and residents are likely smelling lingering effects from that.

“We have been monitoring gas levels and they have all been acceptable” Anderson said. “DTE (Energy) is on top of the situation. They would have notified us if there was anything of concern.”

Dobek who also oversees the land preserve clarified the situation Friday afternoon explaining that a leak occurred about 25 feet underground and was actually a pipe leaking oxygen not gas.

A problem was detected on Wednesday and said the pipe was in the process of being repaired and he expected it to be fixed and recovered by Saturday afternoon.

The smell should be back to normal at that time.

Dobek said communities including Trenton Brownstown Twp. and Riverview and state and county officials were sent a notification.

Riverview police also took calls from its residents but referred all questions to the landfill.

Dobek and Anderson concluded from the feedback provided by DTE Energy crews on site that there is no reason for concern.

While Riverview fire crews initially visited the site they left the area Friday after several air quality tests were performed and in the normal range.

At no time was there any threat to residents officials said.",,,,,,,,,,,,

Important safety information for customers

Ensure an adequate supply of flashlights batteries bottled water non-perishable foods medicines etc. as well as the availability of a portable battery-operated radio TV or weather radio.



Customers should make alternate shelter arrangements as needed if you will be significantly impacted by a loss of power – especially families who have special medical needs or elderly members.



If a power line falls across a car that you’re in stay in the car. If you MUST get out of the car due to a fire or other immediate life-threatening situation do your best to jump clear of the car and land on both feet. Be sure that no part of your body is touching the car when your feet touch the ground.



Ice and snow can cause hazardous driving conditions resulting in traffic accidents and downed utility poles and power lines that in turn can cause isolated power outages. If you’re driving and encounter emergency responders or other roadside work crews remember to MOVE OVER.

If you use a generator due to a power outage follow the manufacturer’s instructions to ensure safe and proper operation. Operate your generator outside; never operate it inside a building or garage.



Don’t use grills or other outdoor appliances or equipment indoors for space heating or cooking as these devices may emit carbon monoxide.



Stay away from power lines that have fallen or are sagging. Consider all lines energized as well as trees or limbs in contact with lines. Please report downed power lines to Duke Energy or local emergency services.



Be prepared for an emergency by purchasing an emergency preparedness kit from the Red Cross.

More tips on what to do before during and after a storm can be found at duke-energy.com/safety-and-preparedness/storm-safety. A checklist serves as a helpful guide but it's critical before during and after a storm to follow the instructions and warnings of emergency management officials in your area.

Shelter information

If you lose power and need to move to a shelter North Carolina and South Carolina state websites provide emergency shelter information – North Carolina South Carolina.

In addition the Red Cross maintains an update-to-date list of open shelter locations – https://www.redcross.org/get-help/disaster-relief-and-recovery-services/find-an-open-shelter.html.

Follow CDC recommendations for staying safe and healthy in a public disaster shelter during the COVID-19 pandemic.

How to protect refrigerated food during power outages

For customers who lose power and have full refrigerators and freezers the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) recommends the following:

Keep refrigerator and freezer doors closed as much as possible to maintain the cold temperature.



A refrigerator can keep food cold for about four hours if it is unopened. If the power will be out for more than four hours use coolers to keep refrigerated food cold.



A full freezer will keep the temperature for approximately 48 hours (24 hours if it is half full) if the door remains closed.

The FDA offers additional tips for proper food handling and storage before during and after a power outage at www.fda.gov/food/buy-store-serve-safe-food/food-and-water-safety-during-power-outages-and-floods.

Avoid customer scams

Customers should be alert to scammers who might call them – impersonating Duke Energy representatives and threatening to cut off customers’ power before or during the storm unless customers make an immediate payment for late bills or other charges.

Duke Energy never makes such calls.

Below are tips for customers to avoid such scams:

If it’s a recorded voice often referred to as a “robocall” be extra cautious.



Do not provide any personal information.



Duke Energy’s actual recorded calls to customers are informative only. The company’s calls never threaten to cut off power and never request personal information.



If a caller – recorded or live – specifically asks you to pay using a prepaid debit card that’s a red flag. Prepaid debit cards are like cash and the transactions cannot be reversed.



If the caller pressures you to make an immediate payment of any type – or provide personal information of any kind such as a bank account number or social security number – hang up the phone.

On Saturday morning the storm had mostly receded on the Atlantic coast. It had left as much as six inches of snow in southeastern Virginia and northeastern North Carolina according to the National Weather Service and AccuWeather. Ice and snow blanketed coastal areas from South Carolina to Virginia regions that do not often see such intense winter weather.

AccuWeather had predicted the ice storm would be a ""once-in-a-decade"" weather event for locations such as Wilmington and Myrtle Beach.

Officials on Friday and Saturday cautioned drivers to stay off slick snow-packed roads and warned of black ice.

""The snow has stopped the sun is up temps remain below freezing and roads remain hazardous to motorists"" the Virginia Department of Transportation tweeted Saturday morning. ""Stay home and avoid travel today.""

North Carolina's Department of Transportation echoed this warning encouraging people to stay at home with hot chocolate and a movie rather than driving.

Huntersville Fire Department in North Carolina said it was responding to multiple crashes and told residents to stay off roadways.

""We've suddenly seen an uptick in citizens out on the roadway"" the department tweeted. ""We're also seeing a spike in crashes.""

Southeastern Virginia and northeastern North Carolina saw 4 to 6 inches of snow paired with freezing temperatures the NWS said.

In North and South Carolina the highest amount of ice reported was half an inch the NWS said.

The icy roads caused safety concerns in North Carolina when a plane skidded off the runway Friday night at the state's icy Raleigh-Durham International Airport. Airport officials said no injuries were reported. An ambulance also slid off an icy road Friday injuring two workers aboard North Carolina’s state Highway Patrol said. Multiple crashes were reported Friday the governor's office reported.

The storm also knocked out power Friday for thousands of people in parts of North Carolina Duke Energy reported. Several thousand more lost power in coastal South Carolina.

WHAT IS LAKE-EFFECT SNOW? Crazy amounts can fall downwind of the Great Lakes

The governors of North Carolina South Carolina and Virginia each declared states of emergency as the storm approached. Several school systems canceled classes for Friday as the storm neared and officials urged motorists to stay off the roads.

As dozens of counties from South Carolina to Virginia faced winter weather advisories winter storm and ice warnings on Friday Virginia Gov. Glenn Youngkin declared a state of emergency Thursday that will remain in effect through Saturday saying his executive order allows for greater flexibility in mobilizing people and resources to respond.

“I urge all Virginians to monitor their local weather forecasts and take personal safety precautions to ensure their safety and the safety of their families” Youngkin said in a statement. He urged people to stay off roads during hazardous conditions.

North Carolina Gov. Roy Cooper signed a state of emergency midweek awaiting the second storm to hit the state in days. He said 114 National Guard troops were staging in central and eastern North Carolina to prepare to move to the affected areas.

It was the latest shot fired in a battle that began Dec. 20 when board members replaced Fire Chief John Rosenkranz with Jerame Simmons who now is serving as acting chief.

The appointment touched off controversy because Simmons was convicted of arson as a teenager 24 years ago and because he's the son of Herb Simmons mayor of East Carondelet and executive director of the St. Clair County Emergency Management Agency. Some critics also questioned Jerame Simmons' training and safety record.

The shakeup led many of the district's 13 firefighters to resign including Rosenkranz and his wife Laura a former captain and assistant chief. Accusations have been flying both ways ever since.

At Wednesday's meeting board President John Parke said the Rosenkranzes hadn't returned their district-owned helmets valued at about $330 each.

""We have sent them registered letters and they have not responded to the mail"" Parke said. ""... They have not picked up their letters I guess refusing to sign for it and we still don't have the helmets.""

Parke and board member Bryan Reddick voted to file a police report over the ""helmet theft."" Member Randy Bolle was absent.

Prairie Du Pont is a volunteer fire department that serves about 2500 people who live in a 14-square-mile area that includes East Carondelet and some homes with Dupo Cahokia Heights Millstadt and Columbia zip codes.

Monthly board meetings are normally held at the Engine House No. 1 fire station. The January meeting was moved to East Carondelet Community Center due to ""massive cleaning and construction"" at the station according to the district's new Facebook page.

Officials also expected a crowd according to Simmons but only about 10 people showed up. No one spoke during the public-comment section. The Rosenkranzes didn't attend the meeting.

Laura Rosenkranz later said she hadn't turned in her helmet because it's common for firefighters leaving departments to be given the option of buying or keeping their helmets and that's what she planned to do.

John Rosenkranz said ""My helmet was left at the fire station along with all my gear and now it's missing according to them.""

Finances at issue on both sides

John Rosenkranz 37 of East Carondelet joined Prairie Du Pont in 2003. He was appointed as chief nearly three years ago earning $750 a year.

Last month board members called a special meeting to replace Rosenkranz with Simmons 42 of Dupo a move that made national news and sparked a social-media debate due to Simmons' arson conviction.

Board members released a statement saying they had lost confidence in Rosenkranz's leadership and no longer had a good working relationship with him. Parke later called Simmons ""absolutely qualified.""

Rosenkranz accused the board of illegal actions and ""reckless"" decision-making over the years that allegedly put firefighters at risk. He said their relationship deteriorated when he was repeatedly denied access to financial records needed to apply for grants to upgrade equipment.

At Wednesday's meeting Capt. Jeremy Gleich one of the firefighters who didn't resign questioned the conduct of Laura Rosenkranz. She had served as treasurer of the non-profit Prairie Du Pont Firefighters Association which raises money and otherwise supports the district.

""There have been some financial discrepancies found and there will be a third-party audit upon completion of an internal audit and we will determine if formal legal action needs to be taken"" said Gleich the association's president.

Gleich maintained that Rosenkranz received a $500 donation from a local company in October and failed to deposit it into the association's bank account until January after she had resigned. He also told board members that she had refused to sign paperwork relinquishing control of the account.

Rosenkranz said the bank had asked her to sign a liability waiver that she didn't feel comfortable signing without her attorney reviewing it. She denied any impropriety related to the donation or other record-keeping.

Rosenkranz said the district is trying to ""pull something"" to make her and her husband look bad.

""We left (the association) way better than we found it I'll tell you that"" she said. ""I did reports every month on everything that was spent. Nothing was spent unless we had motions or a trustee approving it. ... Before I took over we didn't even have treasurer's reports.""

Claims of poor stewardship

Simmons was a Prairie Du Pont firefighter in 1998 when he was accused of setting fire to a vacant home and lighting toilet paper and ceiling tiles in the basement of Dupo Senior High School. He pleaded guilty to one count of felony arson as part of a plea agreement. Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker pardoned him in May.

Simmons has worked for several other volunteer fire departments in the past 25 years. He returned to Prairie Du Pont in August. The board appointed him assistant fire chief about two weeks later.

Simmons made his first report to the board as fire chief on Wednesday night. He spoke mainly about ongoing cleaning and renovation projects at fire stations and maintenance on fire trucks and other equipment.

After the meeting Simmons said much of the department's equipment had been neglected or maintained improperly; many files were unorganized or missing; and fire stations were filthy and in disrepair including major plumbing issues in one bathroom.

John Rosenkranz countered that many district problems have resulted from board mismanagement and a tendency to ""cut corners"" instead of spending the necessary funds.

""They're playing a game"" he said.

The Rosenkranzes and other firefighters who resigned from Prairie Du Pont over Simmons' appointment have been circulating petitions asking for district board members to be removed by the St. Clair County Board and for John Rosenkranz to be reinstated as fire chief.

Capt. Gleich a Missouri police officer who joined the fire department 14 years ago said he couldn't comment on why the other firefighters quit.

""I stayed because I've got a lot of time invested here"" Gleich said. ""... A lot of the allegations and things that (the Rosenkranzes and other firefighters) were saying were done wrongfully were not done wrongfully and I was not going to on a knee-jerk reaction up and leave.""

Earlier this month Parke said the Prairie Du Pont board plans to elevate Simmons from acting fire chief to fire chief in the near future. Parke has been in the fire service for 35 years most notably as a firefighter and emergency medical technician in Smithton.

Simmons said he is building the fire department back up with several former firefighters already in service and several others who have turned in applications that are being reviewed.

Eastman and Loop Industries have just announced new investments that are expected to significantly increase plastic packaging recycling capacity in Europe.

World’s largest molecular plastics recycling facility

Global specialty materials producer Eastman plans to invest up to USD 1 billion in a material-to-material molecular recycling facility in France. This facility would use Eastman’s polyester renewal technology to recycle up to 160000 metric tons annually of hard-to-recycle plastic waste that is currently being incinerated.

According to Eastman the investment would recycle enough plastic waste annually to fill Stade de France national football stadium 2.5 times while also creating virgin-quality material with a significantly lower carbon footprint.

Innovation center

Eastman also plans to establish an innovation center for molecular recycling that would enable France to sustain a leadership role in the circular economy. This innovation center would advance alternative recycling methods and applications to curb plastic waste incineration and leave fossil feedstock in the ground.

The plant and innovation center - whose location has yet to be decided - are expected to be operational by 2025 creating employment for approximately 350 people and leading to an additional 1500 indirect jobs in recycling energy and infrastructure.

Eastman’s project has also garnered support from numerous brands including: LVMH Beauty The Estée Lauder Companies Clarins Procter & Gamble L’Oréal and Danone are leading the way by signing letters of intent for multiyear supply agreements from this facility.

70000 tons of recycled PET resin

For its part the Canadian group Loop Industries which specializes in the production of 100% recycled PET [1] plastic is investing in its first European Infinite Loop manufacturing facility in partnership with French environmental services group Suez.

The two companies have selected a 130000 m² parcel of land in the region of Normandy in Northern France. The capital investment required for the project is expected to be EUR 250 million. Construction of the facility is expected to begin in 2023 with commissioning approximately 18 months later.

The new facility is designed to produce 70000 tons of PET resin made from 100% recycled content per year. It will provide an opportunity for global CPG brands based in France to gain access to locally produced virgin-quality PET plastic and polyester fiber made entirely from waste material. At full capacity the facility is projected to save over 255000 tons of CO2 annually when compared to virgin PET resin made from fossil fuels. “The majority of the incoming waste plastic feedstock for the facility is currently not recycled and contributes to the waste plastic pollution problem” said Loop Industries in a statement.

“We are very pleased to know that Loop technology will soon be available in France to supply recycled PET plastic for our products” said Jacques Playe Head of Packaging & Development at L’Oréal.

Loop client and international cosmetics brand L’Occitane en Provence also voiced its support of the project. “This new Loop Industries plant in France will enable us access to locally sourced 100% recycled PET plastic. The innovative technology they provide is a game-changer that can help us fundamentally contribute to solving the growing global concern about plastic pollution” stated David Bayard R&D Packaging Director at L’Occitane.",,,,,,,,,,,,

Unfortunately the team wasn’t able to take down Oregon State despite some impressive individual bouts.

UNC (4-3 1-2 Big 12) fell to Oregon State (4-2 1-0 Pac-12) at the Bank of Colorado Arena 30-15.

“It never feels good to lose a dual meet. We want to come in here and win” UNC coach Troy Nickerson said. “I think this team wants to win. We are a little short-manned tonight and that obviously makes our job a lot more challenging. I think the guys that did compete competed with a lot of heart and you know did what they needed to do to try to win.”

Graduate student Alan Clothier (197 pounds) started the dual when he pinned opponent Ryan Reyes. The pin his second of the year and a fall gave Clothier and the Bears a 6-0 early lead. Additionally the captain participated in an extra match at the end of the night earning a win by major decision.

“My mindset by going into it was ‘I’ve got to step up’” Clothier said. “Being a captain of this team you’ve got to go out there and you’ve got to do the do the small things the details.”

Freshman Cody Eaton (165) from Milliken picked up an important win after trailing 4-1. Lance Stigall took the lead in the first period but Eaton came back to pin his opponent and earn the win. The Windsor graduate cut the Beavers’ lead to six points after being down 15.

Graduate student Jacob Seely (285) also returned to the mat picking up a 5-2 decision over opponent JJ Dixon. Seely has battled multiple injuries during his time at UNC and missed qualifying for the NCAA Tournament last season. His career was expected to end last March but received an additional year of eligibility.

“I’m just looking for our guys to continue to improve” Nickerson said about his goals for the coming weeks. “Obviously we want to win these next matches but it’s about 55 days from now — the national tournament in March. That’s what we’re continuing to prepare for.”

UNC is scheduled to host California Baptist at 6 p.m. Friday. Fans are encouraged to wear white for its “White Out” match and will receive discounted tickets the day of. Pre-sale tickets are available through the UNC ticket office.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiW2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxlZ2FjeS5jb20vdXMvb2JpdHVhcmllcy9ncmVlbGV5dHJpYnVuZS9uYW1lL2plYW4tY2hhZHdpY2stb2JpdHVhcnk_aWQ9MzIzNjExMTbSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Jean Chadwick Obituary (1927 - 2022) - Greeley CO - Greeley Tribune,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.legacy.com/us/obituaries/greeleytribune/name/jean-chadwick-obituary?id=32361116 on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiW2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxlZ2FjeS5jb20vdXMvb2JpdHVhcmllcy9ncmVlbGV5dHJpYnVuZS9uYW1lL2plYW4tY2hhZHdpY2stb2JpdHVhcnk_aWQ9MzIzNjExMTbSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNiYy5jYS9uZXdzL2NhbmFkYS9uZXdmb3VuZGxhbmQtbGFicmFkb3IvcmFwaWQtdGVzdC1raXRzLWhhcmQtdG8tY29tZS1ieS0xLjYzMjMwMTfSASBodHRwczovL3d3dy5jYmMuY2EvYW1wLzEuNjMyMzAxNw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,As stock flies off the shelves 'rapid' tests live up to their name for these N.L. businesses,"In a small shopping plaza on the Conception Bay South highway a business that specializes in health and safety training is seeing a surge in sales due to COVID-19 rapid tests.

Eastern Safety Services starting selling the kits on Dec. 30 says Jason Oliver the company's director of training and supply.

""We had an overwhelming response to the point where we had to temporarily suspend sales to get our orders updated"" said Oliver this week.

They've already sold 30000 units and Oliver expects to reach the 60000 mark by next week. The boom in sales has come as a shock to the company which has been in business since 2006.

""We weren't expecting the blowup that we did have"" said Oliver. "" A lot of resources have gone into this with our limited staff that we do have.""

Jason Oliver of Eastern Safety Services says he hopes to soon be selling rapid tests across the province. (Jeremy Eaton/CBC)

At one time there were lineups of people eager to get their hands on the tests but the company has moved sales solely online. They've become so popular that the business is now offering them in other parts of the province.

""We are starting up distribution in Carbonear Lewisporte Corner Brook and into Labrador possibly in the next couple of days"" said Oliver.

In Gander the owner of Fresh Faces Laser and Medical Cosmetics is getting endless calls and messages about rapid tests but she is having trouble get her hands on them.

""They are very difficult to to get"" said Robin White. ""I ordered them before Christmas now they are on back order.""

White a registered nurse doesn't sell the testing kits but administers them for clients a service her business started offering in October to help people who need a negative result to go to work.

""It was a business opportunity to other businesses so they could continue to operate so we brought in some tests to see where that market would go.""

The rapid tests quickly became highly sought after with the prevalence of Omicron she said.

""It was a bombardment basically of everyone looking for tests especially for the fact that it fell right around the holiday"" said White.

""It's not 100 per cent accurate of course; however it is one extra thing you can do to give yourself some other reassurance.""

White doesn't know how many tests she's given in the past few months but estimates it's in the hundreds.

She's been telling people to be patient and keep checking her company's social media sites for updates.

""It is an extra layer of security and hopefully we will get back to a point where we have more of them and people can use them as needed.""

This we know. It’s not only the highest-grossing gaming franchise but the highest-grossing media franchise in general in the entire world currently sitting at an estimated $109 billion dollars of revenue. Despite primarily being a video game series that isn’t where most of the money actually comes from - licensed merch accounts for a whopping $82.805 billion eclipsing the revenue from the games ($24.452 billion).

As such it goes without saying that there’s a lot of merch. And a lot of it particularly the older stuff is really weird. Not to mention the even weirder unlicensed stuff that follows in its wake. I set out on a grand quest through the fantastical region of eBay not to be the very best but find the very worst and this is what I discovered.

Before we get started be sure to check out the trailer for Pokémon Legends: Arceus below.

Cursed plushies

I’m a sucker for plushies of every variety and so it’d be remiss of me not to begin this whole thing with some of the greatest abominations I could find.

Uncomfortable Pikachu -

daviwilliam_327 via eBay

As you’d imagine when browsing Pokémon merch there’s one particular electric rodent who absolutely dominates the search results. As such it was incredibly difficult to narrow down which of the many weird Pikachus I should forcibly share with the world but this one was a particular favourite. I don’t know if it’s the wonky eye sparkles the fact that one arm is longer than the other or his delightful round body but what a charming little lad he is. Ahh who am I kidding of course it’s that facial expression that wholly suggests he tried to sneak out a fart and discovered the hard way that it was something far far more. Good luck little buddy. If you wanna give this guy a home here’s the link.

A duo of slightly wrong Squirtles -

alexbar-8320 via eBay

Look neither of these Squirtles are having a very good existence and their placement next to each other on the search results just exacerbated that fact further. Neither of them have the correct limbs with one having these weird oversized paws for both his arms and legs and the other having the tiniest little nubby limbs ever. Not to mention the second one’s nostrils. And the tail…emerging from the front of his body? The less said about that bit the better. You can find this dynamic duo here and here.

Stoke-on-Trent big toed Pikachu -

roxy-rockett via eBay

While this particularly chunky friend doesn’t immediately seem to have a whole lot to complain about at least in comparison to the Frankenstein-esque Squirtles and his Pikachu brother who just isn’t happy at all to be here he still has a story. Please can we just draw attention to his feet? Those toes are more defined than any Pikachu’s toes ever should be. Just to rub it in a bit this is doubled with the branding - Europleasure. I’m so uncomfortable. I do however particularly love that the seller of this one specifically showed off the label which proudly exclaims this Pikachu hails from Stoke-on-Trent. Do all Pokémon from Stoke-on-Trent have such oddly detailed feet? Actually no don’t answer that I don’t want to know.

You know what we need more of in the world? Unnecessary plastic. Guess what this category is full of? Yaaaay.

Where do I even begin with this one? Perhaps I should start with the fact that this is apparently a talking fridge magnet which isn’t a thing I even knew existed before now. That’s bizarrely not the weirdest thing about this one though. Those eyes have seen things and they may be things related to his very ominously chewed tail. Not to mention that mouth gaping so wide that his chin rests on his chest. This Meowth looks like what I see when I catch myself in the reflection of my Switch in handheld mode. And no one wants to see that. If you want this in your home for some reason be my guest.

Brock has seen things -

Anime figures have apparently improved a lot since 1998 if this one is anything to go by. There’s not a whole lot wrong with this one at least until you get to his face. What happened? The soulless dots that stare on into the abyss doubled with the creepy smile slapped on the front are just the perfect combination of elements to haunt your dreams. Also what is he holding? It kind of looks like a Pringle and with no additional explanation that’s just what I’m going to choose to believe. Sour Cream and Onion probably. Put him out of his misery here.

Ass Ketchup and friends -

I’ll be honest when I first saw this one I didn’t see anything wrong with it. Just a box full of different Poké Balls - neat! But these aren’t Poké Balls dear reader oh no. These are Elf Balls from the hit series Pet Elf Go. With charming characters like Ass Ketchup and his partner Picklechew it’s fun for all the family. Seriously though of all the Pokémon to stick on the box why Lairon? I can kind of understand where Ivysaur came from (even though it’s still a bit odd) but Lairon? Well at least they got creative with it. Grab your own here if you so desire.

Look I know I said this was all about merch at the top of this but it’s important to remember where we came from. Besides these aren’t exactly your usual overpriced copies of Emerald and HeartGold.

You were walking down the street and that’s when you saw it. Nestled into a rubbish bin a mysterious Pokémon game. You decided to take it home and found it worked perfectly despite being discarded like that. But is that a team full of Unown spelling out “UR DEAD”?! God the horror! You guessed it this mysterious cartridge is home to a creepypasta game ROM just in case you ever wanted to live out some spooky haunted video game dreams in real life for the low low price of £250. If you really want to splash that cash grab it here.

Picklémen Silver -

Ah the ever raging debate - can video games be classed as art? It’s a fairly divisive question although more people do seem to be leaning towards “yes” these days. Regardless of your stance on the topic I’m sure we can all agree that this is art. The seller says it all: “Just the cartridge which is in debatable condition some would say it’s in poor condition as the original sticker has been removed. Some would say otherwise as I have since replaced the sticker with a far superior one.” The GAMINGbible team were moved to tears over this masterpiece and as such decided to give it a good home which I’m sure is the wholesome ending you were hoping for after all this.

Source: Battlefield 2042 EA Dice

Steam appears to be offering refunds for Battlefield 2042 beyond the service’s normal window due to the game’s extreme number of bugs and glitches.

RELATED: EA Dice To Introduce Non-Binary Specialist In Battlefield 2042

Steam typically does not offer refunds on games that have been played for more than two hours or past 14 days of purchase. despite fans begging for them unproven claims some were getting refunds and even guides by gaming news outlets [1 2].

However amid fans desperately begging for them unproven claims that some were having their requests honored and even guides on how to obtain one from gaming outlets CharlieIntel reports that Steam is now offering refunds for the recent EA release.

In a Steam Support message exchange presented by the news outlet as evidence of Steam offering refunds a user who eventually received their money back first reached out to the digital retailer and explained “I would have less than 2 hours of playtime if I didnt spend 2h in the settings because of the bug where the game was resetting my controls or not allow me to rebind them.”

“The broken state of the game and its bugs did not allow me to test the game properly which is the reason I wish to refund the game” they added. “And my refund request was within the 14 days but was declined due to 4h playtime.”

The user concluded their message “Once again I ask you to reconsider and provide me with a refund for this broken buggy game. I am using Steam for 15 years and I hope you can make an exception and refund me the game. I am very frustrated and annoyed with this game as I am sure you are aware of the situation with it.”

In response Steam Support acquiesced to the customer’s request informing them “As a customer service gesture we issued the refund for this purchase. The item has been removed from the account and a credit has been applied to your Steam Wallet.”

Battlefield 2042 currently holds a Mostly Negative rating on Steam with only 32% of 88888 reviews at the time of this article’s writing recommending the game. According to third-party metric monitoring website Steam250 it’s currently the 14th worst rated game on Steam.

The title has since gone on to become the worst rated entry in the series’ history. While briefly Steam’s most played game on launch it lost 70% of its players on Steam a mere two weeks after launch with player numbers on Steam rapidly dropping well below those of even Farming Simulator 22.

Reviews on Metacritic fare just as poorly [1 2 3 4 5]. Critic review scores (out of a possible 100) averaged out to 64 across 109 reviews for PC PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X|S along with two reviews on last generation consoles giving the game 40 and 65.

Meanwhile across the site’s 6585 user reviews – of which there is admittedly no way to verify if a given reviewer has played the game – Battlefield 2042 holds average score of a little over 2 out of 10.

The main reasons behind these low scores seem to be the use of operators making the game feel more like a “hero shooter” akin to Overwatch the lack of features from prior games and the deluge of aforementioned bugs and glitches the amount and severity of which almost rivals those seen in Cyberpunk 2077.

Aside from graphical bugs the worst offending issues can see players hurled across the map to their death clipping into buildings or beneath the ground and damage not registering on foes. You can even ride a hovercraft up the side of a building.

You can find a one hour compilation of the bugs here or a shorter collection below.

Developer response to player frustrations has also done little but flame the fans of disappointment and outrage.

In a now deleted tweet EA global communications director Andy McNamara came off as dismissive when he told players “Back to work today check reddit & twitter and Battlefield fans are p—-d we didn’t do enough updates or communication during the holiday break. Guys people gotta rest. We have things in motion but we have to figure out what is possible. We will address it when are 100%.”

“Let us get back from break and get back to work” the former Game Informer journalist pleaded. “Love you guys but these expectations are brutal. These things you want take time to scope design and execute.”

Feeling their critiques of the game were being swept away as demanded entitlement over Christmas with others further inferring a derisive tone from McNamara the game’s official subreddit took the comments – according to the headline of the subreddit’s most popular thread on the topic – as “EA/DICE finally responds to the Backlash.”

In particular the “expectations are brutal” comment was the main source of fans’ ire despite the fact said comment could have meant the “expectation” of working over Christmas as many felt they had been sold what was essentially a broken game and were receiving little communication from the responsible parties.

RELATED: Official Halo Subreddit Temporarily Shut Down Over Weekend Due To “Toxicity” Over State of Halo Infinite

This thread grew to over 2000 comments and was eventually locked by moderators noting there were “direct insults.” Later moderators threatened to shut down the Battlefield 2042 subreddit for a time if needed in order to counter “toxicity.”

“Over the past few days we have seen insults harassment and vile comments directed towards members of our community and DICE employees” wrote /u/Battlefield2042mod. “We are making this statement to give you fair warning that we will not tolerate this anymore. We are letting you know what your options are in regards to how this subreddit functions in coming days.”

The mod continued “It’s an understatement when we say that this subreddit has grown incredibly toxic. It’s near impossible to have a simple discussion without insults being flung around at each other – and it’s really starting to harm the entire Battlefield community and each of us that are part of it.”

“We mods have always been very laid back as far as moderation goes – we try our best to let everyone’s voice be heard no matter how upset or angry but we’ve always been of the position that insults or harassment directed to any individual will never be tolerated” they asserted. “We’ll do whatever it takes to drive that sort of toxicity down. If it means shutting down for a period of time we will. The mods have an obligation to follow the rules set out by Reddit and if we are found to be in breach of not enforcing them or doing a poor job at enforcing them we risk the community getting banned altogether.”

RELATED: China Reportedly Bans International Version of Steam

“With that said here are the options we are considering” the mod then explained. “Option 1) If toxicity goes down we will leave the subreddit open without further restrictions Option 2) If toxicity stays at current levels we will begin locking threads early on a majority of posts [and] Option 3) If toxicity increases we will lockdown the subreddit for a period of time.”

“Yes the last two options seem nuclear and we don’t want to use them but we said we will do whatever it takes to drive the current toxicity down” they concluded. “If that means you can’t comment in the majority of posts or you can’t view the subreddit for a period of time we will go down that route. The choice is in your hands. If you don’t like the options available to you you are welcome to unsubscribe and create your own community outlet.”

Eventually it seems moderators realized after over 3000 comments and only 22% upvotes that this threat had been ill-received.

In a later thread mods provided an update on the state of the subreddit and moderation thread days later saw mods clarifying that critique of Battlefield 2042 Electronic Arts and Dice was allowed stating that they were focused on abusive comments and clarifying that they themselves were not affiliated with Electronic Arts or Dice.

“Recently we made a post discussing the state of the sub in terms of ‘toxicity’ levels and outlined potential options to deal with said toxicity” wrote the mod team. “We discuss things as a team and try to make correct decisions but feel we may have made mistakes in some of our choices and communication which resulted in misinformation as to what we’re actually trying to combat – which is insults threats and harassment.”

They further elaborated “To clarify when we speak about toxicity we don’t mean criticizing the game. We don’t mean negativity toward the game. We don’t mean criticizing EA/DICE. We mean comments/posts like: ‘X developer should never have been born’ ‘X person is a piece of shit who should burn in hell’ ‘I wish X and family would get COVID and all die Or making calls to violence like ‘who wants to come with me and burn down DICE HQ?’ As well as making posts like “DICE developers deserve abuse. Yes these are real examples of what we remove on a day to day basis.”

The mods then explained “It’s not just attacks on developers or EA/DICE as a corporate entity that have increased. Redditors attacking other Redditors within comments has also continuously been increasing in both frequency and degree; ‘you’re a f—–g idiot for enjoying X’ ‘just stop playing the game you piece of s–t’ ‘anyone that likes X should just kill themselves.’ ”

“THIS is what we truly have issues with” they asserted. “We don’t have issues with your completely valid criticisms of the game. While it may not be the majority causing these problems we are a community and that makes us all responsible for curbing this behavior together.”

“Be upset. Be angry” they invited fans. “Voice your criticisms and concerns here. We empathize and even align with a lot of the complaints you the community have. However we simply cannot allow the behavior of the nature as exampled above.”

Eventually McNamara deleted his original tweets later clarifying “Deleted the tweets. Seems my message wasn’t clear. Apologies.”

Tensions seem to be riding high with both fans developers and community moderators.

Perhaps all of us still remember the Paul Walker’s (in movie character Brian O’Conner) customized 1995 Mitsubishi Eclipse from The Fast and The Furious franchise. The main protagonist of the highly acclaimed franchise sort of faded away with the tragic death of the kind-hearted actor who won millions of hearts during his time and even more after he left us all. The Eclipse has had a magnetic charm in the yesteryears and till date due to its highly customizable capabilities making it favored canvas for tuning experts too. Not to forget the cool-looking ride featuring in the Need for Speed franchise by Electronic Arts and the Midnight Club arcade racing video game published by Rockstar Games.

Designers: Advait Taware and Karan Adivi

So I can safely say the Eclipse is one cool tuner sedan that’s overshadowed by those dripping hot supercars from the 90s and 2000s era. Keeping the influence of the original Eclipse alive while giving it a modern interpretation is not easy. That’s exactly what this concept designed by Advait Taware and Karan Adivi is all about. The duo has sprayed their magic of digital art to make the Eclipse rise from the ashes like a phoenix. Without compromising the strong connection between the car and the owner the designers have created this stunning render of the electric Eclipse using Unreal Engine 4.

They take things a step further with a lower footprint interpretation of the car which is reduced in size when it docks in the garage at home. It virtually folds into itself and the passenger module is separated to make the folding action possible. When the rider is ready for the next ride it changes the shape the module is attached back in place and Eclipse is transformed into a four-wheeler. Talking of the design aesthetics the car has a clear windshield that runs right alongside the boot area giving it a very refreshing and chunky overall feel. The interiors bear a very upbeat styling with all the technological influences in place to make the rider feel at home. It’s like a modern sportscar anyone would dream of taking for a spin on the freeway!",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiRmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFzaWFvbmUuY29tL2RpZ2l0YWwvZmlmYS1tb2JpbGUtZ2V0cy1zZXJpb3VzLW1ham9yLWNoYW5nZXPSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,FIFA Mobile gets serious with major changes Digital News,"Mobile gaming has undoubtedly been on the rise and over at Electronic Arts the company behind many of the sports games franchises is making sure they are taking full advantage. For the new season EA is transforming EA Sports FIFA Mobile as a live service title together with even more major changes.

Players can expect enhancements to pretty much every area of the game with tweaks made to gameplay visuals and audio which further improve the virtual football experience.

Having switched out the underlying gameplay engine the game will look even better on smartphones and tablets providing the kind of details one would expect at a football match. With a 60FPS experience of smooth and responsive gameplay it is definitely getting a much-needed upgrade.

Settings can also be adjusted so that players on all kinds of devices can enjoy the new update without necessarily needing an upgrade.

New team management options will let players take full control of substitutions in-game positions and set-piece takers allowing them to control the fate of their team. Features including stamina and skill moves will add a new layer of authenticity to the EA Sports FIFA Mobile gameplay experience where players must keep an eye on their squad and make the appropriate moves throughout a match to come out on top.

In addition players will also be able to see the action like never before with the new ability to switch between four camera angles in real-time during a match with new camera options available for goal kicks free kicks corners and penalties as well as in broadcast replays to further immerse players into the most intense and celebratory moments of a game.

EA Sports FIFA Mobile is also adding a series of new stadiums that can be unlocked along with unique weather for the location as well as time of day options allowing matches to be played during the day dusk or night.

“Today marks the beginning of the future for FIFA Mobile giving tens of millions of players worldwide a truly revolutionary football experience and the flexibility to enjoy the game on a huge variety of generations of devices” Lawrence Koh head of EA SPORTS FIFA Mobile shared.

“This was a monumental effort between our studios in EA China and EA Vancouver which further solidifies FIFA Mobile as the place for football fans globally to team up and compete wherever they are. We could not be more excited to see both veteran and new generations of gamers join in the action for years to come.”

In one of the most player-requested features to date FIFA Mobile’s latest update will introduce live audio commentary from legendary commentators around the world. Commentary will be available in 11 languages including English Spanish Latin American Spanish Brazilian Portuguese Russian Italian German Dutch Arabic Mandarin and Japanese.

From the table above you can clearly see you can grab at least one of the 85 OVRs with the minimum amount of Foundation Points that you can achieve from the Challenge Mode. Once again your rewards will only be maximized based on your performances in the Challenge Mode.

If you can complete the challenges then the 87 OVRs are possible free-to-play as well! Save your gems too in case you have to restart in the Challenge mode. Gather the maximum rewards that you can from there as it takes around 200 gems for a restart.

Targets

Additionally if you claim the maximum possible rewards from the Challenge Mode it leads you to 1276 Foundation Points just around 80 points shy of the 89 OVR Players. Well guess what if you target for Foundation Points from the Targets chapter then on getting them two times of 40 Foundation Points each just two times will reward you with the deficit thereby suddenly making even the 89 OVR Players free-to-play! Therefore

83 OVR Players are free-to-play if you only focus on the daily path every day and totally ignore Challenge Mode

are free-to-play if you only focus on the daily path every day and totally ignore 85 OVR Players are free-to-play if you focus on the daily path and achieve the bare minimum from Challenge Mode

are free-to-play if you focus on the daily path and achieve the bare minimum from 87 OVR Players are free-to-play if you focus on the daily path and maximise your gain from Challenge Mode

are free-to-play if you focus on the daily path and maximise your gain from 89 OVR Players are free-to-play if you focus on the daily path maximise your gain from Challenge Mode and additionally pick up Foundation Points as they appear on Target chapter atleast twice.



Last as always don’t go in for any of the daily rewards in the Targets chapter until you have 24 Target Tokens saved up in the bank that way you are guaranteed your desired reward target on the said date. As for the Star Pass since it’s the first month now might be the best time to buy it if you ever were to give you the big bump for your buck.

In the UFC 270 main card opener Saturday Morales (13-0 MMA 1-0 UFC) made his promotional debut against former RFA champion Trevin Giles (14-4 MMA 6-4 UFC) and won via TKO at 4:06 of Round 1.

Morales who earned a UFC deal on an episode of Dana White’s Contender Series in 2021 was the first to absorb a knockdown strike – but he wasn’t the last. After he regained himself Morales unleashed havoc on Giles who struggled to stay upright but eventually found his way.

Giles did not stay upright for long however as another brutal Morales combination sent him back down to the canvas. As Giles grabbed hold of Morales’ leg he received dozens of punches to his head. Referee Mike Beltran saw enough and much to the dismay of Giles waved off the fight.

(Alan Mbathi/IPB News)

The sounds coming from inside Perry Preschool and Child Care on this brisk fall morning suggest just how hectic things are today. Two staff called in and aren't coming to work while a third is taking a pre-planned day off.

Paige Schank is the chief financial officer for the Tell City Electric Department. This isn't her typical morning; today she's using vacation time to volunteer at the center where her two kids come for care.

""So I was in an 8 o'clock meeting the meeting got over I told my boss. Thankfully he's very very understanding. And I've been here the last three hours – in ratio"" she said.

That ratio is important because licensing rules limit the number of kids per staff member in each room. Without Schank here the center would have been forced to turn families away at the door this morning.

It's happened before.

""The world stops and you're like 'this is way more important than I thought it was at first'"" Schank said. ""You don't know how bad you need it until it's gone.""

The center is so understaffed it's been closed just as often as it's been open in the past six months. But Schank being here isn't a fix-all; she can't volunteer in the rooms her kids are in and she has to go back to her actual job soon.

Erin Emerson is the executive director of the Perry County Economic Development Corporation and is the president of Perry Preschool and Child Care's volunteer board. There's a sense of despair and exhaustion in her voice as she describes what it's been like running the center lately.

""COVID added an entirely new layer of difficulty to something that was already impossibly difficult"" she said.

Essentially it boils down to two things: a lack of sustainable financial support and a complex web of licensing rules. Because of those combined with the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic staffing in particular has been an increasingly difficult problem to solve.

Hiring people takes a lot of time because of different requirements and training needed before they start the job and that makes it tough to find and keep them on board. Fingerprinting for potential hires is done once a week in Perry County meaning it could take weeks – sometimes more than a month – to process every part of an applicant's materials especially when business offices close more often around the holidays.

And as the pandemic changes the workforce landscape people aren't sticking around for $9 an hour anymore.

""There are people that are no longer willing to work for poverty level wages and when that's what you're paying – it really caused a fundamental shift"" Emerson said.

It's just one example of how limited services in the rural county come with major consequences.

Unpredictable or even planned closures mean parents trying to return to work like Schank have to rely on their workplaces and family members for support. Some parents quit their jobs. One family is considering selling their house to move somewhere with more – or any – options.

Emerson doesn't blame families for wanting to leave. It's difficult to find solutions for everything it takes to keep the center open without raising costs for families. Enthusiasm from community funders has waned over time and management of the center has fallen to Emerson and others willing to take on the extra work.

""It's really exciting when you get a center going and you raise the money to get it up and going and you open the doors and you feel like you've solved it"" she said. ""But that is only the beginning and you still have to figure out how to keep it in operation every single day according to licensing guidelines while also running a tremendous annual operating loss.""

Some people think answers hinge on finding more ways to share the load.

Adam Alson is the board president of Appleseed Childhood Education in Jasper County which plans to open a 70-seat center sometime in 2022. He said strong partnerships are why it can work; a local community foundation helped collect and provide startup funding and an experienced child care nonprofit will manage the center. That allows board members to focus on raising money – because child care isn't a money-making industry.

""It's Appleseed's responsibility to find the building which we have and it is our responsibility to fund the annual operating loss the center will generate"" he said.

It's not an entirely new concept. A small center in nearby Goodland opened a year ago with the same model and it's already having an impact. One parent opened a new café because her son started going there.

Brienne Hooker is the executive director of the Jasper Newton Foundation the group helping facilitate community partnerships and startup funding for Appleseed and other centers. She said people living in rural communities aren't there by accident.

""I mean we live in a Hallmark movie right? That's what I think. So we value this space we value the quiet we value the sunrises and sunsets we value the small schools"" she said.

Part of maintaining that value she said means keeping different high-quality early learning and care options available for families who need them.

""Early childhood education with a concentration on that zero to three and zero to five – before formal education starts – is just you know raising the tide that raises all boats."" she said.

There are policy changes that could help rural child care centers like Perry stay open and ease the financial burden on groups like Appleseed. Emerson Hooker and Alson all suggest government or community funding designed specifically for rural providers would be a start. And a review – with some possible revisions – of the long and comprehensive list of licensing rules wouldn't hurt either. Emerson said some of the methods for collecting and analyzing data on rural child care in Indiana need updating too.

More people are taking notice especially as the pandemic adds to the challenges families and providers face. A proposed bill in the legislature – HB 1052 – would direct the state to ensure federal funding is applied fairly to different counties. During the pandemic millions of dollars in grant funding has been awarded to providers and families to help more Hoosiers find and afford care.

But plenty of other changes are still needed – including at the federal level – and parents who are still struggling don't have time to wait.

For now Emerson Alson and Hooker all agree that it's up to rural communities to decide if they want child care or not and commit to whatever decision they make.

""At the end of the day federal funding doesn't get to rural areas state funding doesn't necessarily get to rural areas in Jasper and Newton counties. And so in order for us to solve this problem we have to solve it locally"" Alson said.

Schank the CFO and parent from Perry County said if communities decide not to it won't just be Perry Preschool and Child Care at risk of closing for good.

""You have to support the kids of the community if you want your community to grow. Because if you're not growing you're dying"" Schank said.

And most investors will agree that the strength of the founder is key to the company’s success.

VCs have come up with many different frameworks to assess founder teams. While these frameworks are better than the ""gut feel"" processes that used to dominate founder evaluations are still falling investors and founders short. Methods are still too rigid and static meaning investors are missing some of the best founders. And great founders aren’t getting a chance.

This is the first part of a series on founder evaluation in Europe. In the second part I’ll share more in depth what the state of the art looks like across European venture funds.

Founder diligence: what is it?

To understand what’s wrong with founder diligence first it’s important to understand what founder diligence looks like right now.

In the best firms evaluation happens in two stages: 1/ the individual stage (looking at the founder/founders as individuals) and 2/ the group stage (how well they work together what are the team dynamics?). That way investors can differentiate between top players and their team dynamics.

Evaluations should be a team effort with the talent partner providing the structure that the investment team uses. They can follow either an interview format or focus on external diagnostic tools. They can be structured or unstructured; they can be framed as a casual conversation or as a dedicated founder interview depending on what the deal dynamics allow for.

Here’s a matrix of best practice for what that can look like based on interviews with investors and talent partners at Northzone HV Capital Digital+ Partners EKA Ventures and Entrepreneur First.

This matrix works along two axes:

Are investors using founder evaluation to filter out teams in the diligence process or rather in order to inform their support offering post-investment? Are they using their precious portfolio teams as a benchmark for new teams (backwards-looking) or are they using (predominantly external) frameworks that have been backed by research or validated by data?

The impact of these evaluations on the investment decision varies from fund to fund. In some marginal cases they simply offer a route to a veto on a decision. Others make evaluations a mandatory part of their due diligence and involve talent partners. Still others use assessments after a positive investment decision has already been made to put the founders onto a development programme and create a plan for building an executive team. Some funds share their findings with founders while others don’t. It really is a wild mix.

To make matters worse the hot funding market is increasingly shortening diligence timelines for investors. So they find themselves in a tough spot having to make decisions in a compressed time window.

Personality tests don’t apply

Many VCs rely on personality tests they might have encountered in a corporate career such as Myers-Briggs which streams people by personality type. Ironically by relying on such rigid definitions of personality types VCs can end up selecting exactly the kind of 'fixed mindset' they are trying to select against.

Ironically by relying on such rigid definitions of personality types VCs can end up selecting exactly the kind of fixed mindset they are trying to select against

“I have seen a few funds use psychometric tests and for those firms who do they are mostly Silicon Valley-based. Many of them use Hogan Assessments” says Maddy Cross of executive search firm Erevena.

Yet even the best personality tests have little to no reliable data on high growth entrepreneurs. On top of that some of the tests on the market have no scientific backing at all.

Polly Barnes people and talent operating partner at EQT Ventures adds: “Founders are starkly different from corporate executives. Successful founders uniquely display both creative and analytic capabilities. In standard evaluation frameworks that would be used in corporates these two traits would sit at opposite ends of the spectrum. So we have to keep developing.”

Venture needs a customised approach to human evaluation

Despite the great thinking out there many VCs still use imprecise overly simplistic evaluation methods that apply better to corporate than entrepreneurial contexts.

Most VCs think of personal development in rudimentary terms: ""fixed"" versus ""growth"" mindset. Success in entrepreneurship is about the ability to outgrow quicker than the rest yet almost all personality evaluation is focusing on how founders show up at one fixed moment in time.

The bottom line is that founders are a unique breed. The specific combinations of traits and qualities investors are seeking are not necessarily the ones being sought by talent hunters in other industries — and even when they are all the more reason for the savvy investment outfit to devise the best tools to seek out those individuals ahead of the competition. So it makes sense not to submit founders to the same tests of character as other industries.

Neither do any of the out-of-the-box evaluation tools look at the question ""How fast can this person grow?"" Instead they frequently rely on personality at one point in time and build a picture of someone based on a comparison with other patterns. While pattern recognition may absolutely capture the notion of ""able to rapidly evolve psychologically and functionally"" it sadly also promotes bias. Not something the industry needs when we are desperately trying to back underrepresented founders.

It is clear that out-of-the-box off-the-shelf tools for this express purpose do not — and might never — exist. For this reason proactive forward-thinking VC are developing evaluations that are tailored to their unique requirements. I will dive into some of the best examples across Europe in the next article in this series next week.

It's as though for more than 400 years your opponent has been able to go around the Monopoly board without ever giving you a chance to play she said. Then suddenly you're allowed to play but you don't have the accumulated wealth knowledge or properties to keep up with other players.

""It's equality because I can get on the board but it's not equity"" Patton said. ""I'll never catch up.""

As a real estate agent and certified U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development housing counselor Patton has experienced the barriers to homeownership facing Las Vegas’ Black community firsthand and is looking to help even the playing field through the Las Vegas Coalition to Make Homes Possible a public-private partnership backed by the tech real estate company Homie and focused on helping 25000 Black families into homeownership over the next decade.

The coalition consisting of various organizations and community leaders is working to connect the Black community with resources and information to overcome barriers to Black homeownership that include a lack of capital for down payment and closing costs inadequate access to credit and poor credit history insufficient financial literacy and lack of knowledge about the home buying process.

""Homeownership and buying property is a long game"" Patton said ""Even though we are in 2022 we still feel the effects of things that happened back in the 40s 50s and 60s.""

That long game is why more than 50 years after the passage of the federal Fair Housing Act which outlawed housing discrimination based on race color religion and national origin the gap in homeownership rates between Black and white communities remains at essentially the same level as it did when the act passed in 1968.

U.S. Census data shows that in 1970 close to 42 percent of Black households owned their own homes compared to around 65 percent of white households. In 2020 that number was 45 percent almost 30 percentage points lower than the rate for white citizens.

In Las Vegas the gap is similar: As of 2019 the homeownership rate for white people was around 70 percent and 42 percent for Black people. It’s a gap that scholars and historians say was produced by decades of discriminatory housing policies and racist lending practices.

Historical barriers

Claytee White an oral historian and the inaugural Director of UNLV's Oral History Research Center said disenfranchisement of the Black community has been a constant presence throughout the nation's history.

But the root causes of barriers affecting Black homeowners are grounded in the historical exclusion of people of color from government programs and the practice of refusing to insure mortgages or approve loans on homes in and near Black communities — a policy known as ""redlining.""

In the mid-1930s when Congress established the Federal Housing Administration (FHA) and rolled out programs to increase home-buying opportunities African Americans and other people of color were left out of the plan. Some of the programs explicitly excluded people of color through requirements stipulating that homes built with subsidies from the FHA could not be sold to Black families. Homeownership programs geared to veterans allowed banks to deny mortgages to Black veterans and Black real estate agents were kept out of the National Realtors Association through policies that allowed for the exclusion of members based on race and sex.

White said African Americans who migrated to Las Vegas during World War II for work had high incomes including earning good money working at the Basic Magnesium Incorporated plant for the U.S. government. Still they struggled to purchase homes because they could not qualify for housing programs or receive loans and were effectively barred from living in white neighborhoods.

""So they had to build their own homes. Our community looks different from any other community because of that today"" White said. ""There was no sewage streetlights or sidewalks until the mid-1950s. Starting like that means that you just don't have the ability to keep up. Your community doesn't look as good and even when haphazardly you begin to get those amenities it just doesn't compare with a new community in a white neighborhood.""

Tyler Perry an assistant professor of African American and African Diaspora studies at UNLV said as Las Vegas' Black population grew white developers and other power brokers effectively relegated the Black community to one area of the city west of the railroad tracks.

""The Westside was from its inception designated as an underdeveloped area"" Perry said. ""There were very few sidewalks a number of people lived in what were described as shacks and slums. And the other thing to note is that it wasn't even based upon class. The Westside was essentially at least according to studies in the 60s a mixed-income area.""

Perry said that negative stereotypes led to an indifference outside of the Black community that resulted in less investment into the area's infrastructure schools and neighborhoods. He noted that discrimination redlining and other segregationist practices had long-lasting effects on residential patterns neighborhoods' economic health and household accumulation of wealth in Las Vegas and cities across the country.

Closing the gap

Patton has worked in the real estate industry for close to 16 years and served as the regional vice president for the National Association of Real Estate Brokers the oldest minority trade association in America. Black realtors established the association in 1947 as an alternative for African American real estate professionals excluded by the National Association of Realtors.

Despite her time in the industry she experienced the barriers many of her clients face after her divorce. She scrambled to find a place for her and her three children eventually landing on a rental home.

Close to two years later her landlord sold the house. With poor credit and eight rental denials (because of income fluctuations) she was unsure of her next steps. Luckily a friend helped connect her to resources including a Nevada grant that helped cover closing costs and housing counseling that allowed her to buy a home.

""I started using resources that I knew were out there but never once thought it was for me"" Patton said. ""I've never had relief like that until I moved my kids into a home that was ours that we wouldn't have to ever move out of unless we chose to do that.""

The experience showed her that resources are available to help Black potential homebuyers but that a lack of outreach and trust remains a stubborn roadblock between organizations and the Black community.

So when Homie a real estate company with a significant presence in Las Vegas approached Patton about finding a way to help close the homeownership gap in Las Vegas following the height of the George Floyd protests in 2020 Patton was intrigued but skeptical.

""I grilled them for at least the first 30 days looking for the holes"" Patton said. ""I've been in this community almost my whole life. [Community members] know me and they trust me and whatever we say we're going to do that's exactly what we are going to do.""

Elias Benjelloun a social impact manager for Homie said the company wanted to use its real estate knowledge and connections to address the historic repression of Black communities.

“[The George Floyd protests against police brutality and racism] really caused us at Homie a moment of pause … We took a moment to really evaluate ourselves and our role in racial equality in America” Benjelloun said.

What followed were numerous conversations that eventually led to the creation of the Las Vegas Coalition to Make Homes Possible and the goal to get 25000 Black families into homeownership in Las Vegas over the next 10 years. The coalition aims to connect Black families with existing homeownership resources and programs.

Patton said she and other organizers decided to have a 10-year goal because it can take years to catch up on student loan payments or reach financial stability. She added that the coalition's goal is to build long-term generational wealth not just help those who are ready to purchase a home.

Four of the coalition's five leaders including Patton are African American women. Patton said this shows the integrity of the initiative and helps her and other organizers target messaging and efforts to reach out directly to the Black community.

One program the coalition aims to connect families with is the state’s Home Is Possible down payment assistance program. The program includes a homebuyer education course and offers a three-year no-payment no-interest forgivable loan that helps homebuyers with up to five percent of the home loan amount. A portion of the loan is forgiven one month at a time for three years until it no longer remains. The loan acts as a second mortgage and is designed to incentivize buyers to stay in a newly purchased home.

""Currently we have been programmed to understand that if the messaging does not say it is for us to keep moving on"" Patton said. ""None of us are new to this but to the community we are because they've never been there because no one's talking to them.""

White individuals whose parents purchased or owned a home between the 1930s and 1970s benefited from the redlining of communities. Patton said that home purchases during the period allowed families to have the equity necessary to send children to college or start a business — all of which came at the expense of the Black community.

Homes in Black neighborhoods or owned by Black families are statistically valued at lower prices than ones in white communities. Black workers still make less money than white ones on average and there is a significant gap in wealth and education between white and Black populations. But Patton said her work with the coalition is one way she can contribute to closing a 400-year-old gap.

""To truly close the gap of homeownership we really will have to change policies and the country will have to deal with the fact that for generations other people benefited off the backs of the Black community"" Patton said.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMib2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWd1YXJkaWFuLmNvbS9idXNpbmVzcy8yMDIyL2phbi8yMi9idWlsZC10by1yZW50cy1nbGl0enktZ29sZHJ1c2gtcmFpc2VzLWZlYXJzLWZvci1zb2NpYWwtaG91c2luZ9IBb2h0dHBzOi8vYW1wLnRoZWd1YXJkaWFuLmNvbS9idXNpbmVzcy8yMDIyL2phbi8yMi9idWlsZC10by1yZW50cy1nbGl0enktZ29sZHJ1c2gtcmFpc2VzLWZlYXJzLWZvci1zb2NpYWwtaG91c2luZw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Build to rent’s glitzy goldrush raises fears for social housing,"The Keel a converted former HMRC office block overlooking Liverpool’s waterfront is billed as the solution to dull impersonal renting.

Welcome to the fast-growing world of “build to rent” an asset class that is shaking up the housing market luring renters with the promise of more professional management than individual private landlords and sucking in a flood of money from banks pension funds and even retailer John Lewis.

Build to rent now accounts for 20% of all new housing in England a figure that rises to 40% for London according to research consultancy Molior. Research from estate agency Ascend Properties shows that planning permission requests for build-to-rent units across the UK rose 52% during the pandemic.

“For a long time residential property hasn’t been seen as a viable asset class; it’s really messy to manage with huge operational costs” said Frances Brill a University of Cambridge geographer specialising in build to rent.

But with interest rates so low commercial property yielding shaky returns and Britain facing a chronic housing shortage it had become an attractive bet. “Investors sense there’s money to be made if you’re able to provide quality housing” she said.

Well-established players such as US developer Greystar – which last month partnered with Abu Dhabi in a £2.2bn deal to build London rental homes – have led the charge. Macquarie the Australian bank that stripped out huge dividends during its ownership of Thames Water has set up a rental business Goodstone Living. US private equity giant KKR is funding 4000 luxury homes. High-street names such as John Lewis Lloyds Bank and Legal & General (L&G) are also joining the goldrush. Lloyds plans to own 50000 homes within a decade under a strategy developed by new boss Charlie Nunn the Financial Times reports.

Investors ploughed a record £4.1bn into the sector last year according to property adviser CBRE. The boom is set to continue as demand for rentals outstrips supply. In Leeds L&G is turning Tower Works the city centre’s Grade II listed former factory into 245 rental apartments. Developers are also eying suburban areas rolling out pet-friendly larger homes designed to encourage longer-term contracts. L&G has announced a 117-home scheme in Peterborough for families seeking out-of-town properties with office space and gardens.

Experts say while interest from private equity firms comes from experience the biggest draw for pension funds is they can raise the rent roughly in line with inflation. Dan Batterton head of build to rent at L&G said investors took about 4% from annual rent income linked to inflation. “The need for housing makes the rental market less volatile” said Batterton.

A big pension fund can’t afford to become known as an awful landlord. No one wants to kick a granny onto the streets Frances Brill build-to-rent specialist

For tenants there’s the promise of well-managed homes for people who cannot afford to buy and are fed up with rogue landlords. In the UK there are almost twice as many people looking for rentals as there are spots available – a ratio that rises to 10 to one in Salford according to research by insurer Admiral.

“Especially in such a new market a big pension fund can’t afford to become known as an awful landlord” said Brill. “No one wants to kick a granny on to the streets.”

She sees Switzerland – where 60% of households rent – as a success story: pension-fund-owned housing there is well kept with stable rents. “There’s a glimmer of hope of what the UK market could be if build-to-rent landlords’ actions are sufficiently regulated.”

But not all communities can afford to buy into the lifestyle. “While build-to-rent developers are obliged to provide nominally ‘affordable’ homes this doesn’t mean they are building more social housing” said Brill. “It doesn’t address the affordability crisis because it’s so expensive.”

Homelessness charity Shelter has warned that build to rent is likely to be aimed at the higher end of the market making it unaffordable to lower-income households. And while it has boomed during the pandemic affordable housing starts fell by 16% in England in 2020-21 according to government data.

In Elephant and Castle London’s ‘“Latin American quarter” a £3bn regeneration project including a big slice of build to rent is driving out the current population of social housing tenants. About 4000 social housing units have already been demolished in the area with many residents forced to move to suburbs more than six miles away.

Delancey the developer best known for its partnership with the Qatari royals to buy and develop London’s former Olympic village will replace the shopping centre with homes to rent. It has permission for 979 build-to-rent homes of which 116 will be social housing. Its initial proposal for just 33 affordable homes was rejected by the council. Corporately branded and just streets away from the demolished Heygate council estate the block due to be completed in 2030 is a metaphor for the borough of Southwark’s socioeconomic tensions.

With 16000 households on Southwark’s housing waiting list families are often pushed into overcrowded properties. Down the road from the Delancey development Milton 53 his wife Cecilia 50 and two children live in a private rented studio flat. They have been waiting on the council register for a three-bedroom flat for three years. “It’s been a very hard time not only for me but for my children since they translate for me and help me with the documents I present to the council” said Milton who declined to give his full name. His children eat sleep and do their homework in the same room.

“Housing shouldn’t be an asset” said Elizabeth Wyatt from campaign group Housing Action Southwark and Lambeth. “Good quality social housing where communities can thrive and build roots should be a right.”

Southwark council said: “The 35% affordable housing offer which included 116 social rent homes was the maximum we could reasonably secure for the Elephant and Castle development. We are committed to providing 2500 new council homes across the borough by May 2022.”

Others think these expensive developments will take more refining. “There is some smoke and mirrors happening with these developers” said John a marketing manager and resident of Hurlock Heights a new tower in Elephant and Castle (he declined to give his full name). The building hosts a mix of properties; build to rent shared ownership and homes for sale. He feels his flat doesn’t match the leafy high-spec complex in the brochure and residents have complained about high service charges.

“Our rooftop garden is kept in such a poor state. Because residents are walking their pets there the grass is all dead” said John. He said not being a pet owner was even more frustrating because when he originally bought the flat nothing in the advertisement or contract said animals were allowed.

There are lessons for the build-to-rent developers from elsewhere in Europe. In Germany Berliners last year voted on a controversial property expropriation bill to take 240000 properties or 11% of all apartments in Berlin from corporate landlords.",,,,,,,,,

Eastman and Loop Industries have just announced new investments that are expected to significantly increase plastic packaging recycling capacity in Europe.

World’s largest molecular plastics recycling facility

Global specialty materials producer Eastman plans to invest up to USD 1 billion in a material-to-material molecular recycling facility in France. This facility would use Eastman’s polyester renewal technology to recycle up to 160000 metric tons annually of hard-to-recycle plastic waste that is currently being incinerated.

According to Eastman the investment would recycle enough plastic waste annually to fill Stade de France national football stadium 2.5 times while also creating virgin-quality material with a significantly lower carbon footprint.

Innovation center

Eastman also plans to establish an innovation center for molecular recycling that would enable France to sustain a leadership role in the circular economy. This innovation center would advance alternative recycling methods and applications to curb plastic waste incineration and leave fossil feedstock in the ground.

The plant and innovation center - whose location has yet to be decided - are expected to be operational by 2025 creating employment for approximately 350 people and leading to an additional 1500 indirect jobs in recycling energy and infrastructure.

Eastman’s project has also garnered support from numerous brands including: LVMH Beauty The Estée Lauder Companies Clarins Procter & Gamble L’Oréal and Danone are leading the way by signing letters of intent for multiyear supply agreements from this facility.

70000 tons of recycled PET resin

For its part the Canadian group Loop Industries which specializes in the production of 100% recycled PET [1] plastic is investing in its first European Infinite Loop manufacturing facility in partnership with French environmental services group Suez.

The two companies have selected a 130000 m² parcel of land in the region of Normandy in Northern France. The capital investment required for the project is expected to be EUR 250 million. Construction of the facility is expected to begin in 2023 with commissioning approximately 18 months later.

The new facility is designed to produce 70000 tons of PET resin made from 100% recycled content per year. It will provide an opportunity for global CPG brands based in France to gain access to locally produced virgin-quality PET plastic and polyester fiber made entirely from waste material. At full capacity the facility is projected to save over 255000 tons of CO2 annually when compared to virgin PET resin made from fossil fuels. “The majority of the incoming waste plastic feedstock for the facility is currently not recycled and contributes to the waste plastic pollution problem” said Loop Industries in a statement.

“We are very pleased to know that Loop technology will soon be available in France to supply recycled PET plastic for our products” said Jacques Playe Head of Packaging & Development at L’Oréal.

Loop client and international cosmetics brand L’Occitane en Provence also voiced its support of the project. “This new Loop Industries plant in France will enable us access to locally sourced 100% recycled PET plastic. The innovative technology they provide is a game-changer that can help us fundamentally contribute to solving the growing global concern about plastic pollution” stated David Bayard R&D Packaging Director at L’Occitane.",,,,,,,,,

The company or PR agency provides all or most review samples. They have no control over my content and I provide my honest opinion.

[Update] Please be warned I originally recommended several Etsy straps but it seems these won’t be compatible. The pins on the Epix are not removable so you have to use something with the Quickfit clip.

You will be pleased to know that the latest Garmin Fenix 7 and Epix Gen 2 use the same watch straps as the preview Garmin Fenix 6 Series.

The Epix is the same size as the 47mm Fenix 7 so both of these use the same straps.

The 47mm Fenix 7 and Epix Gen 2 use a 22m Quickfit band

The 51mm Fenix 7X uses a 26mm Quickfit band

The 42mm Fenix 7S uses a 20mm Quickfit band

Garmin Bands

Garmin has a large number of their own bands available for Fenix and Epix devices.

As you’d expect they are quite expensive but they will likely have the best overall quality. They have some premium material options too.

Garmin doesn’t make things easy when it comes to finding a compatible band. You’d think all 22mm Quickfit bands would work on any watch but this is not always the case.

The Marq Series has its own premium straps which no doubt people would love to put on their Fenix or Epix. But not all are fully compatible.

Via Reddit

In this Reddit thread a user confirms that the curved end strap fits the Fenix 6. However in this Reddit thread a user had to take a Dremel to the strap to get it to work. That strap was the red model number 010-12738-17 which is £75. I don’t really want to be grinding away parts of a £75 watch strap.

If you look at the Garmin website they do provide a compatible watch list which is the most reliable way of knowing if they are compatible.

Apart from your generic rubber bands there are some nice alternative materials they all cost a fortune though.

The Jacquard-weave Nylon Strap is £180 which is ludicrously expensive this is listed as being compatible with the MARQ strap and the Fenix 7 and Epix. Colour options include indigo heathered black black yellow/green pine green and red.

The leather bands are also compatible in either Italian Vacchetta or Genuine Horween Black for £180.

A titanium band will set you back £270 but stainless steel is £100 less at £170.

All the Fenix 7 and Epix compatible watch bands appear to be on this page

Etsy

I had previously recommended several Etsy straps but one commenter pointed out that the pins of the Epix are not removable so you are forced to use Quickstaps. This is a bit of a scummy move by Garmin in my opinion.

One solution is to buy a Quick-Fit Metal Watch Band Adapter which will allow you to use any standard watch strap.

Some nylon straps slide under the current pins which would therefore work.

This strap is well-reviewed looks good and is priced at £30.

Amazon

Amazon have a good selection of cheap straps especially if you just want a rubber strap. Overall they are not as attractive as the options on Etsy.

There are some alternative materials available including nylon and metal but some of the reviews are mixed.

By Gretchen Webster

WESTPORT — Tall trees are being cut down along the railroad tracks in Westport as the power company Eversource carries out its “vegetation-management” program sparking anger among neighbors.

Constituents are complaining said Matthew Mandell a Representative Town Meeting member from District 1. The railroad tracks running through his district abut people’s homes which are left exposed when the buffer line of trees comes down.

“They’re completely denuding it” he said of the Eversource project. “They’re really making it an eyesore … Where is the infrastructure and the beautification?”

Maintenance lacking

Although Public Works Director Peter Ratkiewich agrees that Eversource hasn’t been maintaining the trees for years at this point they need to be taken down to protect the primary wires that bring power to Westport and other Connecticut towns he said.

“If you want reliable power you have to do aggressive clearing” said Ratkiewich who has been with the Department of Public Works for more than 30 years.

Eversource has not regularly maintained trees along the railroad right-of-way as a result “When you have trees that are 60 feet tall and growing into the wires they have to come down” he said.

“It’s a shocker for some people.”

Trees vs. reliable power

Eversource spokesman Mitch Gross said the tree removal and vegetation management program will take about three to four weeks to complete.

“We understand our customers’ concerns [but] there are some very tall trees within that right-of-way that need to be removed” he said. The project covers 18 miles through not only Westport but Norwalk Darien Stamford and Greenwich.

The trees have to be removed “to reduce the possibility of power outages public safety issues and disruption to train service along these tracks” Gross said.

“Our customers expect strong reliable service. This work is necessary to prevent power loss for tens of thousands of customers” he added. “Connecticut is one of the most heavily forested states in the country and trees are the number one cause of outages.”

Eversource does have a plan to replace the trees but it will take time and the replacement vegetation will be low growing and will not provide as much shade according to Ratkiewich. But he agrees the overgrown trees need to be taken down immediately to protect power lines during storms.

Climate change severe storms mean tree management is critical

“Climate change is real and has adverse effects on weather” Ratkiewich said. “And things are getting worse.”

Mandell said neighborhood residents have been unhappy with the proposed tree-cutting project for months and attended meetings with Metro-North and Eversource to protest since last summer.

“Eversource and Metro-North never maintained these trees for years” Mandell said. “Now they’re just cutting them all down. How do you do it more reasonably?”

Ratkiewich said he understands that for people who have lived near the railroad tracks many years the tree cutting has been upsetting. “The problem is that people have lived there for 30 years or more without any removal by Eversource and now they’re taking the trees” he said.

“It’s compounded by the fact that a lot of people are working from home and a lot of people have moved into town recently” and don’t understand what is happening he said.

Town focusing more attention money on trees

For the past 10 years the town of Westport also has been more aggressive about taking down or pruning trees on public property and rights-of-ways he added.

After extensive damage caused by increasingly powerful storms such as Tropical Storm Irene in 2011 and Super Storm Sandy in 2012 and a fatality in town caused when a tree fell during a 2013 winter storm the town adopted a more vigilant tree-management program.

About $100000 of the American Rescue Plan Act funding allocated by the federal government to Westport will be earmarked for the town’s tree removal and management budget Ratkiewich said.

“It’s a regional problem for power companies not just Westport” he noted.

Residents are angry when they lose power such as with Tropical Storm Isaias in 2020 when Westport was one of the towns hardest hit by widespread power outages.

But now residents are angry that trees that can bring down power lines have to go. “You can’t have it both ways” Ratkiewich said.

“This is a necessary evil to make sure that the main port lines through the southwest corridor are intact.”",,,,,,,,,,,,

There are no ground-level windows on the front facade of the house.

Now before you picture a home devoid of light it’s important to note that the back walls of the home are covered in windows and doors that let in plenty of sunlight. Listing agent Pogir of Briggs Freeman Sotheby’s International Realty said this was an intentional feature because the homeowners wanted privacy.

The house is the work of architect Mark Domiteaux and builder Robert Hopson and it was built in 2019 according to the listing information. Pogir said the home has a C-shaped layout that creates that sense of privacy and focuses on the views in the backyard. Pogir said that the architect designs in a “concise” way with clean and clear lines throughout.

“There’s no wasted space” Pogir said.

The home has five bedrooms five bathrooms and two half-bathrooms in 5649 square feet.

A study and a guest bedroom suite are just off of the home’s foyer on the first level. The home’s main living spaces have an open-concept design with a few notable features. The kitchen has a large island that houses the sink the cooktop cabinet storage and countertop space and extra room for dining. Pogir said this home has a considerable amount of storage space thanks to numerous cabinets closets and drawers throughout the home especially in the kitchen.

“If a person loves to be organized this is the house to be organized in because it has closets everywhere” Pogir said.

The living room is next to the kitchen in the open-concept design and there are a wet bar and a wine room on one side that both serve the space. A striking contemporary-style fireplace on the opposite side of the living room divides the space from the dining room. All of these rooms have views of the property thanks to a wall of window-paned doors that overlook the pool and patio. Pogir said the doors were custom-designed for the house and they open on a pivot and create the opportunity for indoor-outdoor living.

His ruminations matter in America’s oil industry for he is the boss of Exxon Mobil the largest Western oil major. His firm has historically been less enthusiastic than rivals about taking climate change seriously. But a shareholder revolt last May placed three green-tinted directors on its board. That has put pressure on the Texan company’s management to curb emissions with more ambition.

On January 18th Mr Woods unveiled the firm’s long-awaited update to its climate strategy. “Is society sincere in its desire for a lower-emissions future?” asked the veteran oilman when pressed on the thinking behind the plan. It is he says. “And so are we.” Evidence for this lies in a newfound willingness to commit to hard targets for cutting greenhouse-gas emissions.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnN0YWJyb2VrbmV3cy5jb20vMjAyMi8wMS8yMi9uZXdzL2d1eWFuYS90aHJlZS13b21lbi1tb3ZlLXRvLWNvdXJ0LXRvLXN0b3AtZXh4b24tZnJvbS1mbGFyaW5nLWdhcy_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Three women move to court to stop Exxon from flaring gas,"Three Guyanese women have filed a case against Guyana’s Environmental Protection Agency to put a stop to flaring of gas offshore by ExxonMobil.

According to Sinikka Henry a lecturer at the University of Guyana “ExxonMobil started production in December 2019. In January 2020 we first began to hear from fishermen that ExxonMobil was flaring. ExxonMobil didn’t tell us to begin with. Then we heard that they were flaring billions of cubic feet of natural gas. People protested. ExxonMobil told us they had to flare because their gas compressor wasn’t working. For more than 2 years ExxonMobil has been using faulty equipment flaring and making climate change worse and putting toxins into the air” a release on behalf of the trio said.

Sherlina Nageer another litigant on the case flayed ExxonMobil

“Lies and more lies- that is Exxon’s hallmark. They lied to the American people for decades about the reality of climate change and they have lied to the people of Guyana for almost two years now about the amount of flaring going on at their Liza Phase 1 operations.” Nageer noted that ExxonMobil lobbyist Keith McCoy had confirmed that ExxonMobil spent millions funding groups that denied and discredited climate science.

She also warned about the secrecy and lack of regulation of ExxonMobil’s operations.

“The fact is that Guyanese have no way of knowing how much gas is actually being flared by Exxon- not only do we lack the technical capacity to conduct independent verification we are also hobbled by a government and ‘regulators’ who care more about short term monetary gains than actually protecting the environment and preventing long term damage” she contended.

The release said that the litigants have asked for orders directing the Agency to provide reports on the amount of gas flared and the toxins released. They are also asking for an independent and expert probe of Esso’s compliance with manufacturer’s standards for operating its gas compressor.

Andriska Thorington the third litigant and currently a student at the University of Guyana urged other young people in Guyana to stand up for themselves.

“As a young person I cannot stand by and watch my future burn up. Young people everywhere are acting to stop oil and gas from destroying the planet. I call on young people in Guyana to question this oil and gas and all the propaganda about jobs and money and benefits. The youth should be mindful of the fact that the purported money and benefits will cease to matter if our environment is destroyed.”

The release said that Esso Exploration and Production Guyana Ltd an offshore company wholly owned by ExxonMobil has been flaring associated gas almost continuously since it began production in December 2019 despite undertaking to reinject the associated gas not flare it. In May 2021 after ExxonMobil had flared billions of cubic feet of associated gas the Environmental Protection Agency purported to modify Esso’s permit to allow it to flare gas.

The litigants also argue that the Agency’s decision to modify Esso’s environmental permit to allow flaring was irrational and unlawful and that it should be quashed by the Court. They also argue that the Agency breached the Environmental Protection Act Cap 20:05 by purporting to allow Esso to flare in return for paying a fee.

GEORGETOWN Guyana--In keeping with the government’s mandate of ensuring maximum benefits from Guyana’s oil and gas sector the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) amended Esso Exploration and Production Guyana Limited’s (EEPGL’s) environmental permit for the Liza Phase Two development last week. This asset is located in the prolific Stabroek Block.

In the amended permit seen by the Department of Public Information (DPI) ExxonMobil’s subsidiary EEPGL will now be required to pay US $45 per tonne of carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2e) emitted offshore Guyana at the Liza Unity operations as a result of excess flaring.

For context flaring is the practice of burning the natural gas to ensure safe operations onboard the floating production storage and offloading (FPSO) vessel. In the case of Guyana ExxonMobil was last year forced to flare above the pilot level due to a defective gas compressor.

The EPA listed permissible instances of flaring only in the commissioning of equipment; start-up when oil production commences and special circumstances. The latter category includes cases of emergency whether they be controlled or as a safety response; maintenance; and the restarting/resumption of operations on the FPSO vessel.

Where condition of any of the mentioned special circumstances is expected to exceed 14 days the permit holder being EEGPL will have to seek an approval from the EPA for flaring within the first 96 hours of its commencement. Further where flaring during start-up is expected to exceed 60 days EEGPL will seek an approval from the EPA for flaring no later than five days prior to the end of the 60 cumulative-day period.

The permit states that the subsidiary shall submit CO2e payment calculations within 28 days from the date of expiration of the approval granted by the EPA. CO2e emission payments shall be made payable to the EPA within 14 days of the EPA’s approval of the calculation.

In May 2021 the government moved to amend the Liza Phase One Environmental Permit which saw the introduction of a flaring. Initially the fee stood at $30 per tonne of CO2e emitted but it was later increased to $45.

With this payment mechanism the EPA has since collected approximately $900 million from EEPGL for its excess flaring.

During a press conference last year Vice President Dr. Bharrat Jagdeo had noted concerns that Guyana might have to compensate the ExxonMobil-led consortium for any fine imposed on it because of the stability clause within the Stabroek Block’s Production Sharing Agreement.

The clause which was agreed to by former Minister of Natural Resources Raphael Trotman in 2016 forbids the government from imposing new taxes or fees on the companies. If it does Guyana would have to compensate those companies.

The vice president gave assurances that no compensation would be offered.

The fish getaway. All over we deh searching. We went to Berbice. We went till to North West side fishing trying to find a good area but we nah find the fish…” a frustrated Tony Persaud said on his return from his latest fishing expedition in the vicinity of North West District.

The move was to scope out profitable fishing grounds as he and other fishers have been forced out from the area they once operated – 15-17 miles out from the Liliendaal foreshore – by vessels supporting oil and gas activities here.

For the past five months fishermen who are accustomed to fishing in the area of the Liliendaal seawall said they were instructed to move by crew members of vessels supporting ExxonMobil’s offshore operations as they were now working in the area.

According to Persaud on his last trip in December last year a vessel bearing the name “Atlanta Spirit” pulled up next to his fishing vessel and requested that he move away from the area.

“It was not the first they ask me to move. I go back after they tell me move but the last time they come up next to my fishing boat and tell me pick up my seine and move or they will call the coast guards. They even take pictures with me and my boat. They are not Guyanese men on the vessel” he related as he spoke of what occurred on his last trip to the area.

His story was echoed by other fishermen who stated that they were instructed to move at least three to four times.

Since the request to move the group of fishers have been complaining bitterly of low catches.

“Five six time we get move out and they take pictures of our boat. From what we understand they say a survey going on in that area and we can’t deh within ten square miles of that area…. Where they want to us go fishing? Where? We drive from Berbice to North West and still can’t get no fish” Sohan (only name given) one of the fishermen who work along with boat owners lamented.

Stabroek News understands that the particular area is deemed lucrative for fishers who harvest butterfish bangamary and trout.

“The area is by the mouth of the [Demerara River] meeting with the Atlantic Ocean. So the sweet and salt water meets together and that is where the fish feeds making it a good place for us to fishing” Persaud explained.

“You see when we fish there we drop seine like two times a day when the tide is right and we get a good catch but now we don’t have that. We setting seine but barely picking up couple baskets at the end of the day” another fisherman pointed out.

The boat owner related that after his expedition to the North West District he only returned with five baskets of fish and was not able to fully cover his expenses.

Additionally the fishermen opined that the suggestion of operating out of marine fish cages will not work for catching the species of fish they focus on.

“That is a waste of money to come with because catching ‘banga’ [bangamary] don’t work like that. Those things are for red snappers but we don’t catch that. It won’t work. Catching banga and butter fish you have to work with the tide; the fish runs with the tide” Roodi Persaud a seasoned fisherman and boat owner explained.

With reports across the country of low catches President Irfaan Ali had announced that his government was looking at innovations to curb the issue.

“We are not sitting back. We have a responsibility to find solutions and that is what we are doing. We are working every single day on finding innovative solutions” he announced at a recent forum on agriculture innovations.

The president stated that the marine cages “can bring in a net value of close to $8 million annually. And you could pay back for the investments within six months.”

But the fishers do not think this will be profitable.

Moreover Latchman Persaud related that government particularly the Department of Fisheries needs to speak with them as they remain unclear as to what is occurring at sea.

“We have families to feed and mortgages to pay we cannot keep going to sea and not making money to feed we self. It is a large investment now to go to sea and not coming back with enough to cover your expenses… It really hard for us fishermen out here” he stressed.

When contacted yesterday ExxonMobil’s Guyana Head of Media and Communications Janelle Persaud promised a response to new queries from this newspaper but unto press time Friday no statement was provided.

In response to a previous report she had said “We have not received such claims but I can assure you that ExxonMobil Guyana has not prohibited any fisher folk from carrying out their operations.”

She had gone on to explain that with the planned laying of the fibre optic cable in the coming weeks they have worked with the Ministry of Agriculture’s Fisheries Department and compensated fishermen who are likely to be affected.

“We do intend to begin the laying of fibre optic cables from our offshore facilities to onshore cable landing stations in Georgetown and Ogle in the coming weeks. The Fisheries Department identified several licensed fisher folk with pens that required removal from the approved installation route. These individuals have been compensated the value of which was determined by several factors including information from the fisher folk themselves Fisheries Department market value and administrative costs” she had explained.

Before they were forced to move the fishermen said they said that in one haul they would normally collect seven baskets of fish. From one of those trips they would make over $150000 after selling to wholesalers.

“It is a real struggle these days. I work as a taxi driver but I get a boat to brace me. But now the money from the taxi work going into the fishing business. Every time you go you have to keep investing and you are not getting back your money. My debt is probably close to $300000 because we just keep losing from every trip” Rajendra Boodhoo said.

“The fishes carry prices now but we are not getting the catch. The area we normally would have a good haul they don’t want to us fishing there anymore. Bangamary selling for $340 a pound now. Last year it was $120 but we are not getting enough fish to get a good market” he lamented.

According to him an average investment for a trip out at sea is approximately $50000.

Stabroek News’ efforts to solicit a comment from the Ministry of Agriculture were futile. Calls to both the Minister of Agriculture Zulfikar Mustapha and Chief Fisheries Officer Denzel Roberts went unanswered.

In recent months fishermen up and down the coast have complained about low catches and questions have been asked about what studies the Ministry of Agriculture and ExxonMobil have been doing to determine the cause."

The Los Gatos California company added 8.3 million worldwide subscribers during the October-December period about 200000 fewer than management had forecast. Besides releasing its fourth-quarter results on Thursday Netflix also projected an increase of 2.5 million subscribers during the first three months of this year well below analysts’ expectations for a gain of four million according to FactSet Research.

The disappointing news caused Netflix’s stock price to plunge by about 20 per cent in extended trading after the numbers came out deepening a steep decline during the past two months.

It capped a challenging year for Netflix after it revelled in eye-popping gains during the pandemic lockdowns of 2020 that drove homebound people to its service.

Netflix picked up 18.2 million worldwide subscribers during 2021 its slowest pace of annual growth in five years. It came after Netflix gained more than 36 million subscribers during 2020. The service now boasts nearly 222 million worldwide subscribers more than other video streaming leader.

But other services backed by deep-pocketed rivals such as Walt Disney Co and Apple have been making inroads in recent years and a bevy of other networks also are wading into video streaming in an attempt to grab eyeballs and a piece of household budgets. The escalating competition is one reason Netflix decided to expand into video games last year.

“The 2022 backdrop for Netflix seems to have been set with a theme of competition abound” said Third Bridge analyst Joe McCormack.

While acknowledging the competition is having a “marginal” effects on its growth in its quarterly shareholder letter Netflix emphasised its service is still thriving in every country where it’s available.

In a Thursday conference call Netflix executives also said uncertainty caused by the ebb and flow of the pandemic during the past year has made it more difficult to gauge future growth.",,,,,,,,,,,,
FICO,Fair Isaac,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZvb2wuY29tL2ludmVzdGluZy8yMDIyLzAxLzIyL2hlcmVzLXdoYXQteW91LW5lZWQtdG8ta25vdy1hYm91dC11cHN0YXJ0LWluLTIwMjIv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Here's What You Need to Know About Upstart in 2022,"This fintech has an incredible story to tell if the meme stock traders would just get out of the way.

Upstart Holdings (UPST 6.62%) may not be a household name right now -- but give it time. Sooner or later (and probably sooner than later) there's a good chance you or someone in your household will become familiar with the young company. That's because it offers a much-needed solution to a long-standing problem that the financial industry had largely given up on solving.

In simplest terms Upstart offers lenders a more effective method for judging a prospective borrower's creditworthiness. That task that has long been co-handled by the big three credit bureaus -- TransUnion (TRU 3.46%) Equifax (EFX 1.89%) and Experian (EXPG.Y 0.68%) -- along with Fair Isaac (FICO 4.16%) which considers the credit bureaus' data to come up with the FICO scores ultimately used by banks and other lenders when deciding whether or not to extend loans and on what terms. However the world has changed since FICO scores became the lending industry standard back in 1989 while the credit rating business hasn't.

This growing disconnect opened a door of opportunity; Upstart's founders simply walked through it launching the company in 2012 with a completely different kind of credit scoring in mind. Rather than relying on a number that's based on only a few factors and that may or may not paint an accurate picture of an individual's creditworthiness Upstart uses an artificial intelligence algorithm that looks at more than a thousand data points to figure out how likely it is an individual will repay borrowed funds. That approach works even better than the FICO score-based method. The dozens of banks and credit companies that have utilized Upstart's service are seeing 75% fewer defaults on loans they make with no fewer loan approvals.

Other lenders are catching on.

With that as the backdrop here are the four key things current and prospective shareholders need to know about Upstart headed into 2022.

1. This is the new creditworthiness norm

Don't misread the message. Most lenders and credit card issuers still rely on FICO-based scores to decide if a consumer is a justifiable lending risk. That is changing though even if slowly. Upstart reported in November that during the third quarter four of its banking partners stopped considering FICO scores in favor of using its AI-based methodology.

Look for more banks and lenders to make similar decisions for a couple of different reasons.

One of those reasons is the most obvious one -- lower loan losses. The other stems from a broad cultural movement that favors the idea of improving access to credit for people who may not be credit risks but who simply don't have enough of a credit history to support a conventional credit score.

2. The stock is priced richly but for growth Upstart is apt to achieve

Kudos to Upstart for bringing a real solution to a real problem to the table. And congratulations are in order for its actual profitability -- something that eludes too many of its start-up peers. But the stock is anything but cheap. Though it expects 50% revenue growth this year will drive its annual earnings up from $1.95 per share to $2.35 per share Upstart is still trading at a heady forward price-to-earnings ratio of 45.

This is one of those times however where prospective investors need to look at the probable growth more than a year down the road. Analysts expect Upstart to report a top-line result of just over $800 million for 2021 but by 2025 they see its revenue swelling to nearly $2.8 billion lifting its earnings to $3.70 per share.

It may seem like a pie-in-the-sky outlook -- but it's hardly out of reach. TransUnion Equifax Experian and Fair Isaac are now doing about $15 billion worth of annual business between them and they're not doing a particularly great job.

3. Analysts see the value right now even if most investors don't

Given their optimistic growth outlook it's no surprise these same analysts are sticking with firmly bullish price targets even as the stock continues to peel back from its October peak.

As of Thursday's close Upstart shares were priced around $107. That's around one-quarter of last year's admittedly overheated high of just over $400. But it's also less than half the current consensus target price of $255.30. In the view of the analyst community this stock is sporting a 140% upside if the company can just get more investors to understand and embrace its story.

4. It's a fintech for better and worse and a meme stock to boot

So how does a stock wind up with a stock price that is so far removed from a sensible level in the first place? In Upstart's case two factors are working against it.

First it's a fintech company and fintech stocks have been running very hot or very cold as a group of late. That's not unusual. Most names within the same sector or industry move somewhat in sync often regardless of how well or how poorly an individual company is performing. Fintechs like Block and PayPal Holdings have fallen out of favor in recent months dragging Upstart lower with them. As long as the group remains seen as offering more risk than reward Upstart shares will struggle to recover. The good news is that once fintechs become hot again Upstart could easily lead that rally.

Second Upstart has become something of a meme stock making it a target of traders looking to artificially push or pull a stock's price away from what could be considered normal. Its volatility hasn't been quite as over-the-top as meme stocks like GameStop or AMC. However those traders have been putting pressure on the stock creating the kind of volatility that makes it a tough equity for long-termers to own.

Patience will pay off

While Upstart is down and seemingly out don't read too much into its recent price action and don't worry that the downtrend will last forever. Time will allow the underlying business's story to spread and meanwhile the company will continue to grow. Meme stock traders will also lose interest over time as their coordinated efforts have less and less impact. Indeed long-term investors who can truly commit to a holding (and ignore the short-term oscillations) may find Upstart's pullback over the past few months has created a fantastic entry point into what is a great growth prospect.",,,,,,,,,,,,

Today through February 10 at 12:00 a.m. ET fans can cast their vote for each category at nfl.com/fedex via a Twitter poll on the @NFL official handle or the NFL Mobile App.

For 19 years FedEx has recognized the NFL quarterbacks and running backs voted by fans each week to be delivering the best performances for their fans and teammates each season. You can help celebrate these standout performances by voting for the FedEx Air & Ground NFL Players of the Year.

During the 2021-22 NFL regular season FedEx worked with the Thurgood Marshall College Fund (TMCF) the largest organization exclusively representing the Black College community to identify Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs) across the country to receivedonations to support needs-based scholarships through the 2022-23 school year. Each week of the regular season a $2000 donation was made in the name of the winning quarterback and running back (for a total of $4000).

To celebrate the FedEx Air & Ground NFL Players of the Year FedEx will donate $20000 each to the HBCU choice of the winning quarterback and running back. Similar to the regular season donations the $40000 donation will help support needs-based scholarships. For the year more than $100000 will be granted among select HBCUs to support student scholarships.

FedEx will announce the 2021 FedEx Air & Ground NFL Players of the Year winners at NFL Honors presented by Invisalign a two-hour primetime awards special to air nationally on Thursday February 10 from 9-11 p.m. (ET and PT) on ABC and simulcast on ESPN+ and NFL Network from YouTube Theater at the SoFi Entertainment District in Los Angeles.

A closer look at the FedEx Air NFL Player of the Year finalists:

Tampa Bay quarterback Tom Brady led the league in passing yards (5316) completions (485) and touchdown passes (43). Brady’s 485 completions set a new league record and his career-high 5316 passing yards were the third-most in a single season all-time. He had a league-high six games with at least four touchdown passes and has a league-record 39 career games with at least four touchdown passes. Brady joined Drew Brees as the only players in NFL history to record 5000 passing yards in multiple seasons and joined Aaron Rodgers as the only quarterbacks with three career seasons with 40-or-more touchdown passes.

Los Angeles Chargers quarterback Justin Herbert ranked second in the NFL with a career-high 5014 passing yards and ranked third with 38 touchdown passes. He recorded nine games with at least 300 passing yards tied with Brady for the most in the league this season and became the third player in NFL history to throw for at least 5000 yards within one of his first two seasons joining Patrick Mahomes and Pro Football Hall of Famer Dan Marino. Herbert has the most passing yards (9350) touchdown passes (69) and 300-yard games (17) by a quarterback in his first two seasons in NFL history.

Los Angeles Rams quarterback Matthew Stafford ranked second in the NFL and tied his career-high with 41 touchdown passes and ranked third with 4886 passing yards. Stafford had nine games with at least three touchdowns passes most in the league this season while his seven games of at least 300 passing yards this year ranked third behind only Brady (nine games) and Herbert (nine).

A closer look at the FedEx Ground NFL Player of the Year finalists:

Cleveland Browns running back Nick Chubb finished the season ranked second in the league with 1259 rushing yards and had eight rushing touchdowns in 14 games played. He recorded five games with at least 100 rushing yards tied for the second-most such games this year. Chubb who has at least 1000 rushing yards in each of the past three seasons became the sixth player all-time to record at least 950 rushing yards and eight rushing touchdowns in each of his first four seasons.

Cincinnati Bengals running back Joe Mixon produced a career season in 2021 finishing the year ranked third in the league with a career-high 1205 rushing yards and fourth in the NFL with a career-best 13 rushing touchdowns. Mixon recorded a scrimmage touchdown in nine consecutive games from Weeks 4-13 the second-longest streak in the NFL and he became the first running back since 2006 to record two-or-more scrimmage touchdowns in four consecutive games (Weeks 8-12).

Sutter is an astrophysicist at SUNY Stony Brook and the Flatiron Institute host of "" Ask a Spaceman "" and "" Space Radio "" and author of "" How to Die in Space ."" Sutter contributed this article to Space.com's Expert Voices: Op-Ed & Insights .

On Oct. 19 2017 Robert Weryk an astronomer at the University of Hawaii at Manoa spotted an intriguing new object with the Panoramic Survey Telescope and Rapid Response System (Pan-STARRS1) in Hawaii. It was from the moment of its discovery a weird object — weird orbit weird speed weird properties.

The strange object later dubbed ' Ouamuamua  was the first known interstellar object to visit the solar system. But astronomers were able to observe the odd visitor for only 11 days before it appeared too small and too dim to be detected. Considering the scant information obtained from such a short observation window the true nature of 'Ouamuamua remains a mystery even today.

'Oumuamua: The solar system's 1st interstellar visitor explained in photos

'Oumuamua a Hawaiian word that roughly translates to ""scout"" is an apt name; the object is an emissary a representative of some distant (and unknowable) star system. It had been wandering the cold empty interstellar depths of the Milky Way for hundreds of millions or perhaps billions of years before encountering the sun .

'Oumuamua isn't large; its biggest side is between 10 and 100 meters (33 to 330 feet) wide; it could fit comfortably inside a football field.

Reflected sunlight from 'Oumuamua continually dimmed and brightened telling astronomers that the object was tumbling end over end every few hours. Based on that variation in the light astronomers determined that 'Oumuamua is much longer than it is wide by a factor of five to 10 meaning it's shaped like either a cigar or a pancake.

By the time 'Oumuamua was detected it was already on its way out of the solar system . Given the object's incredible speed and steep angle relative to the rest of the system 'Oumuamua was not gravitationally bound to the sun.

Astronomers monitored 'Oumuamua with a variety of ground- and space-based observatories for about 11 days. That’s it: 11 days. Those observations are all the information we'll ever have about this mysterious visitor; 'Oumuamua is already too distant and too dim to be seen with even our most powerful instruments and no rocket could ever hope to catch up with it.

It's gone forever.

Known unknowns

'Oumuamua is perhaps the strangest object we have ever seen inside the solar system. No other known asteroid or comet has a shape that extreme (although to be fair our catalog of objects 100 meters or larger isn't exactly complete). 'Oumuamua has a dusty red color which is similar to the hues of other deep-solar system objects. But it didn't act like a comet  the most common small object at those distances from the sun.

The interstellar visitor entered the solar system with a velocity very close to the local standard of rest which is the average velocity of stars in our neighborhood. However most of those stars have individual velocities much higher than that. So why should 'Oumuamua have something very close to the average number? It remains a mystery.

Lastly on its way out of the solar system 'Oumuamua gave astronomers one more giant mystery: It appeared to be accelerating moving away from the sun at a slightly faster pace with every passing day. This wouldn't be the weirdest thing for comets which can have abnormal acceleration profiles due to outgassing of materials. But observations of 'Oumuamua revealed no such activity.

Ultimate origins

In the years since the original discovery only one other interstellar visitor has been spotted. And that object called 2I/Borisov looked and acted like any other comet . Nothing like 'Oumuamua has ever been seen before or since.

So what is 'Oumuamua? The debate continues; speculation is ripe in such a data-poor environment. Harvard astronomer Avi Loeb has used the lack of data to propose that ' Oumuamua is an alien spaceship . But considering intelligent aliens may be capable of doing whatever they want this could be an explanation for pretty much any observation.

Astronomers have also offered a range of non-alien explanations. One idea is that perhaps ' Oumuamua is a nitrogen iceberg that chipped off of a Pluto-like object long ago. However Loeb and his colleague Amir Siraj a Harvard undergraduate said that's impossible because pure nitrogen is very rare on Pluto and in the universe at large. They calculated that the mass of exo-Plutos required to generate a pure nitrogen 'Oumuamua to be mind-bogglingly high.

Other researchers have suggested that perhaps 'Oumuamua is a block of solid hydrogen  formed in the outskirts of a giant molecular cloud as a byproduct of solar system creation. Others hold that 'Oumuamua is a comet after all — an alien one that got booted from its native solar system by a gravitational interaction or one that formed here in our own solar system and then migrated far outward before circling in for one last dance.

Ultimately we'll never know. And maybe like that strange visitor we should just move on.

Researchers say that Mimas Saturn's smallest innermost moon — whose resemblance to Star Wars' infamous battle station inspired its nickname — revealed the first clue that it could be a ""stealth ocean world"" after NASA's Cassini probe spotted a strange wobble in the moon's rotation.

Now new research published Jan. 19 in the journal Icarus suggests that the wobble could be the result of the sloshing of a liquid ocean trapped just beneath the icy surface of the 246-mile diameter (396 kilometers) moon. If this is the case researchers say that Mimas is an entirely new type of world. The discovery of the tiny moon's secret ocean could mean that water and the possible life it can sustain could be far more abundant in our solar system than first thought.

""If Mimas has an ocean it represents a new class of small 'stealth' ocean worlds with surfaces that do not betray the ocean's existence"" study first author Alyssa Rhoden a geophysicist at the Southwest Research Institute in San Antonio Texas said in a statement .

Interior water ocean worlds (IWOWs) such as Saturn's Enceladus or Jupiter's Europa are not new to scientists but inner tidal processes tend to fracture their surfaces and they show other signs of geological activity. Mimas on the other hand looked at first glance like it was ""just a frozen block of ice"" Rhoden said.

""Turns out Mimas' surface was tricking us and our new understanding has greatly expanded the definition of a potentially habitable world in our solar system and beyond"" she added.

To investigate the possibility of a hidden ocean under Mimas' frozen surface the researchers built a model to see if its gravitational interactions with Saturn could produce the tidal forces necessary to heat the moon's interior keeping the water below its 15- to 20-mile-thick (24 to 31 km) exterior ice shell warm enough to remain liquid.

""Most of the time when we create these models we have to fine-tune them to produce what we observe"" Rhoden said. ""This time evidence for an internal ocean just popped out of the most realistic ice-shell stability scenarios and observed librations [planetary wobbles].""

The findings make Mimas a ""compelling target for further investigation"" Rhoden said. By studying the moon's ability to support an ocean scientists could glean a better understanding of other potential hidden ocean moons tucked farther out in our solar system such as the moons of Uranus.

AKRON Ohio — Editor's note: The video in the player above is from a previously published unrelated story.

Nearly 200 residents in downtown Akron are without power today after an electrical outage.

According to officials with FirstEnergy Corp. the outage was caused by a fire that broke out in an underground vault.

Officials released the following statement to 3News regarding the issue:

""The outage in downtown Akron was due to a fire in an underground vault. The outage impacted 175 customers. Our utility crews are currently working as quickly and safely as possible to make repairs and restore power to customers by 4 p.m.""

This comes as some Akron residents are also dealing with natural gas outages which Dominion Energy says that they are working to restore.

""Dominion Energy Ohio crews worked through the night and work is continuing today to restore gas service to customers in downtown Akron. Additional teams arrived from Ashtabula Canton and Youngstown to help with repairs. Contractors are also on site assisting. Teams responded to an outage Saturday morning and discovered water in the lines caused by a water main break"" officials said in a release Sunday morning.

This is a developing story. Check back with 3News for updates as we receive them.

The fire started around 9 a.m. in an underground electrical vault located at Main Street and West Market Street in Downtown Akron.

Crews from the Akron Fire Department responded to the scene and out out the blaze using foam. After the fire was out crews had to work to clear the smoke and foam from the vaults which delayed the assessment process the power company said.

The cause of the fire is unknown at this time but left around 175 FirstEnergy accounts without power.

FirstEnergy crews plan to reconfigure the circuits in order to restore power but called it a ""long involved process.""

Customers left without power are expected to have their service restored between 12 a.m. and 6 a.m. Monday.

The Akron Municipal Court will be closed Monday due to a power outage and lack of heat in the Harold K. Stubbs Justice Center. All hearings including arraignments will be rescheduled later in the week.

That's the world in which Darius Garland is living.

Garland now in his third NBA season has been one of the most important players in the Cavs' turnaround. As Garland has taken a significant step forward in not only his production but also his leadership on a young team so too have the Cavaliers.

Garland is averaging 19.8 points 3.4 rebounds and 8.0 assists on 46.9 percent shooting per game for an 18.48 Player Efficiency Rating all of which are career highs. Particularly with Collin Sexton lost for the season Garland has evolved into a go-to scorer and facilitator. And those around the league have noticed including stars LeBron James Steph Curry and others.

""Steph reached out. Steph reached out a lot"" Garland said on a Zoom call on Friday. ""Donovan Mitchell his compliments are really cool. And then just like some of my close friends in the league like some of my big brothers like Tristan [Thompson] Bron Kevin Durant Damian Lillard. Like they are just telling me to keep going and keep pushing. I mean that's pretty cool to hear that from some of the best basketball players to touch a ball.""

But with great power comes great responsibility — to deal with the added attention in a productive way at least. With Garland becoming a focal point of not just finishing but starting many offensive sets with the game on the line he's also had to deal with increased defensive attention. It means the Cavs have to make defenses regret sending extra help his way.

""You gotta make them pay"" Cavs coach J.B. Bickerstaff said. ""That’s where we feel confident that our big guys have skill and can make the right play. So if they’re going to trap him he has to embrace that get our big guys the ball and then let our big guys make the next play. I think we’ve seen that time and time again where they catch the ball in the pocket we end up with a dunk or a wide open 3.""

It's another reason why the Cavs big men being able to handle the ball within the offensive sets — namely Lauri Markkanen and Evan Mobley — is so crucial and why the Cavs have clicked at that end of the floor this season.

""At the top of the floor we’ve seen Lauri get that slot shot ... when they want to commit two to the ball"" Bickerstaff said. ""So I think you make them pay and then they’ll have to get out of that. They’ll make a decision either to keep on it we keep making them pay or they’ll make the adjustment and now he can shake free.""

It also lends itself to a high level of trust in Mobley as a 7-foot rookie to make the proper decisions. The Cavs haven't shied away from putting Mobley in those spots.

""It talks about the trust that we have in him and that his teammates have in him"" Bickerstaff said. ""Very rarely would you want to put the ball in a rookie’s hands in the fourth quarter. But he’s so dependable and he’s so confident in what he’s able to do and his teammates are that they put the ball in his hands in fourth quarters and trust him to make the right reads.""

Garland feels the success this season is garnering some attention from around the league as well.

""We’re getting some wins so we’re putting the league on notice"" he said. ""We have a target on our back now so a lot of teams are trying to come at us and get wins off us. We definitely have a target on our back. On the radar. One of the top teams in the league and one of the top teams in the East. We’re definitely getting more attention.""

Garland is one of the Cavs hopefuls who are vying for an All-Star spot. The 2022 NBA All-Star Game is set for Feb. 20 at the Rocket Mortgage FieldHouse. When asked if he feels he's played like an All-Star Garland had a direct answer.

""Hell yeah. I think I'm an All-Star"" he said.

Allen earned an ejection and a flagrant-2 foul after throwing Alex Caruso to the court to prevent a breakaway dunk in the Bulls’ 94-90 road loss to the Bucks.

But those repercussions couldn’t offset the ensuing disaster for the Bulls — the play fractured Caruso’s right wrist an injury that requires surgery and will sideline the guard for at least six to eight weeks the team announced Saturday.

Caruso will join Zach LaVine Lonzo Ball Javonte Green and Derrick Jones Jr. on the Bulls’ injury report.

The Bucks stoked outrage hours before Caruso’s injury was announced tweeting a video of Allen playfully biting into a doughnut to promote their Saturday night game against the Sacramento Kings.

The Bulls shot back in the replies — “Seriously???” — as Bulls fans flooded the Bucks account’s mentions.

The Bucks later deleted the tweet but their cavalier approach reflected that of Allen who grinned and laughed at fans in the Fiserv Forum stands as he was escorted off the court. Caruso said Allen didn’t check on him at any point after the foul.

The foul came off a transition drive sparked by Ayo Dosunmu who dished the ball to Caruso for a two-handed dunk attempt that was quickly interrupted. Allen hooked his left hand around Caruso’s forearm twisting midair to swipe with his right hand. The force of the foul sent Caruso crashing to the court.

Caruso managed to half-catch himself on his way down so his shoulder and wrist absorbed most of the impact. After several minutes of medical attention he played the rest of the game.

Coach Billy Donovan was fuming over the foul after the loss.

“He could’ve ended his career” Donovan said. “And (Allen) has a history of this. That to me was really dangerous and I really hope the league takes a hard look at that because he could’ve really really seriously hurt him.”

Caruso’s reaction was even more blunt: “It was kind of (expletive).”

Donovan called for the NBA to pursue further action against Allen citing the guard’s history of fouls dating to his time at Duke. Allen earned an unsavory reputation for incidents including a hip check against North Carolina trips against Florida State and Louisville and a kick aimed at an Elon player.

Allen managed to tamp down the tripping in the NBA but that didn’t keep him out of trouble. He was tossed from a Summer League game against the Boston Celtics while playing for the Memphis Grizzlies in 2019 — that time for shoving Grant Williams to the ground then taking a swing at his head on the ensuing play.

That history only stoked the ire of Bulls fans who were provided a full minute of the foul in slow-motion replay during the broadcast of the game.

Allen’s reaction to the foul sparked criticism across the league. Former NBA player and current ESPN analyst Richard Jefferson wrote on Twitter “Grayson Allen giggling after receiving a flagrant 2 and being ejected seems pretty on brand for him.”

The teams won’t face each other again until March 4 at the United Center.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMihwFodHRwczovL3d3dy5qc29ubGluZS5jb20vc3Rvcnkvc3BvcnRzL25iYS9idWNrcy8yMDIyLzAxLzIyL21pbHdhdWtlZS1idWNrcy12cy1jaGljYWdvLWJ1bGxzLWZpc2Vydi1mb3J1bS1nYW1lLXNjb3JlLXVwZGF0ZXMvNjYwNTkwOTAwMS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Bucks 94 Bulls 90: Milwaukee's Big Three lead the way in first victory over Chicago,"It’s been a long time hasn’t it?

It can be argued the last regular-season games between the Milwaukee Bucks and Chicago Bulls that mattered were… in the 2014-15 season when the Bucks were trying to finish a season with a .500 record? The longtime Central Division cohabitants haven’t really had a “rivalry” in the truest sense since the 1980s as neither team has finished a season with a winning record together since the 1990-91 season.

That looks to be changing this season as the Bulls have held the top spot in the Eastern Conference since the calendar turned to 2022 and 36 total days since the start of the season. Only Brooklyn (43) has held that position longer to date.

The defending champion Bucks have had their ups and downs but a nearly complete roster helped them topple the Bulls 94-90 Friday night. The Bucks are now 18-3 when Giannis Antetokounmpo Khris Middleton and Jrue Holiday play together and are 29-19 overall.

Box score:Bucks 94 Bulls 90

“I wouldn’t say its just us three"" Middleton said. ""Anytime we’re missing any player it’s a huge missing piece for us. But I think we complement each other well because we do three different things on the ball and off the ball. I’m more of a shooter mid-post a little bit pick-and-roll play. Giannis is very dominant in the paint and with his playmaking and attracting crowds when he has the ball.

""And then Jrue he’s little bit of everything a little bit of post a little bit perimeter a little bit making plays pick-and-roll everything. Then we know how to play off each other.

""We know when to give each other space when to cut when to try to find our open areas or different spots on the floor where other guys are working at.”

The trio combined for 59 points and Middleton hit a pair of key free throws with 15.8 seconds left to seal the game.

This came after Holiday picked up 7-foot Bulls center Nikola Vučević one-on-one in the post with a chance to tie the game in the final 39 seconds and Holiday forced the big man to kick the ball out to DeMar DeRozan who missed a three-pointer with 23 seconds left. Middleton rebounded it and it appeared most of the players thought the Bucks would call timeout but they didn’t. Instead Middleton slowly crossed halfcourt at which point he was fouled by Coby White.

“Jrue is very very unique in how he can guard bigger guys” Bucks head coach Mike Budenholzer said. “I think his center of gravity his strength his toughness his hands. So I think it’s something that we do occasionally and there’s different ways that it may end up happening and I thought his individual defense was good to force the long shot.

""Khris I think they’re probably going to foul in that situation. I think the game clock said 22 (seconds). We had a timeout I think if the foul wasn’t called but he got fouled like three times and they eventually called it.”

The Bulls missed their final three shots.

The game was a slow back-and-forth affair as the game was tied 15 times and the lead changed 16 times. Milwaukee finally took some semblance of control in the back half of the fourth quarter breaking a 76-76 at the 7-minute 34-second mark with a 9-3 run to take a 85-79 lead with 4:09 to play. They opened that run with three second-chance points an area of the game they dominated 20-6.

""The Bucks also countered a bad shooting night (38.2 overall 19.4% from behind the three-point line) by controlling the paint with a 42-20 advantage inside.

Chicago came into the game as the league’s best shooting team (47.5%) and the best three-point shooting team (38.8%) but Milwaukee locked them down defensively. The Bulls made just 7 of their 38 three-pointers and shot 36.5% overall.

“We talk about versatility in a lot of different ways and I think you gotta be versatile in the kind of games you can win” Budenholzer said. “So very proud of the guys for them to find a way to win tonight. We had to earn that.”

Like most teams the Bulls had weathered roster tumult due to the ongoing coronavirus pandemic but they hobbled into Fiserv Forum without their starting backcourt in point guard Lonzo Ball and shooting guard Zach LaVine.

MVP candidate DeRozan scored 35 points and made 17 of his 18 free throws but Milwaukee held rookie Ayo Dosunmu (18.0 points per game over the last three) and 2019 lottery pick Coby White (17.8 points the last four) to a combined 5 of 24 shooting and 12 points. White missed all nine of his three-point shots.

The Bulls are now 28-16 and have lost six of their last eight.

Each team is now 12-12 against opponents with a .500 record or better.

“At the end of the day a win is a win” Antetokounmpo said. “We did the right things. We created good habits tonight. There are some areas that we gotta improve but the end of the day we got the win and we’ve got to keep on moving forward and keep getting better.”

Since Budenholzer took over in 2018 the Bucks are 13-1 against the Bulls with last season’s regular-season finale featuring the Milwaukee bench players the only victory for Chicago. The Bulls haven’t finished a season with a winning record since 2015-16 and the teams last met in the playoffs in 2015 a six-game Bulls victory.

The teams will face one another three more times before the end of the regular season with the next meeting happening on March 4 at the United Center in Chicago.

Bobby Portis had 13 rebounds and 12 points for the Bucks while Vučević had 19 points and 11 rebounds and Matt Thomas scored 11 off the bench for Chicago.

Chicago took a 69-68 lead after three quarters thanks to making more three-pointers in the frame (three) than they did the entire first half (two) along with nine points from DeRozan. Milwaukee kept up on the scoreboard thanks to nine points from Holiday including a buzzer-beater from 20 feet. Inconsistent shooing that began in the first half for each team continued through the period and the Bucks weren’t helped by the fact starting guard Grayson Allen was ejected with 5:45 to go in the quarter for a Flagrant 2 foul on Bulls guard Alex Caruso.

Allen exited with five points on 2 of 5 shooting.

The Bucks led by as many as five points but DeRozan prevented them from pushing the lead further and closed the quarter with six of the Bulls’ last nine points.

A cold-shooting first half was punctuated with free throw shooting from the two stars with DeRozan going 10-for-10 and Antetokounmpo 6-for-8 as the Bucks took a 45-44 edge into the break. Antetokounmpo scored 16 points and had seven rebounds while DeRozan had 18 — 14 of which came in the second quarter.

The pair carried the load for their respective teams as the Bucks shot 36.4% from the field and the Bulls shot 38.1%. The Bucks made up for a 5-for-19 effort from behind the three-point line by outscoring the Bulls 20-10 in the paint and turning five takeaways into six points. DeRozan’s performance which included a 4-for-6 start the floor countered a 2-for-17 start from behind the three-point line.

The lead changed 12 times and the scoreboard was knotted 10 others as neither team could string together strong offensive possessions. In fact runs highlighted the half. The Bulls used a 10-3 run to go up 10-8 early in the first quarter which the Bucks followed with a 10-2 run later to go up 22-16 before going into the second quarter with a 24-18 lead.

Chicago flipped the scoreboard back to its side with an 8-0 spurt early in the second quarter which naturally the Bucks followed with a 10-4 jaunt to go up 38-34 with 4:53 left. The teams essentially traded baskets the rest of the quarter.

Portis (7 points 6 rebounds) Middleton (5 points) and Holiday (2 points) combined to make just six of their 19 shots. The Bucks held White to 2 of 10 shooting including 0-for-6 from behind the three-point line. Dosunmu started 1-for-5 for three points but had four assists for Chicago.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMi3gFodHRwczovL3d3dy5jaGljYWdvdHJpYnVuZS5jb20vMjAyMi8wMS8yMi9oZS1jb3VsZHZlLWVuZGVkLWhpcy1jYXJlZXItZ3JheXNvbi1hbGxlbnMtZmxhZ3JhbnQtZm91bC1vbi1hbGV4LWNhcnVzby1yZXN1bHRpbmctaW4tYS1mcmFjdHVyZWQtd3Jpc3QtZHJhd3MtdGhlLWlyZS1vZi10aGUtY2hpY2Fnby1idWxscy1hZnRlci1hLTk0LTkwLWxvc3MtdG8tdGhlLW1pbHdhdWtlZS1idWNrcy_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,'He could've ended his career': Grayson Allen's flagrant foul on Alex Caruso — resulting in a fractured wrist — draws ...,"The Chicago Bulls suffered another big loss Saturday when Alex Caruso was declared out for at least six to eight weeks with a fractured right wrist suffered on the flagrant foul by Grayson Allen in Friday’s 94-90 loss to the Milwaukee Bucks.

Though Caruso said after the game that X-rays on the wrist were negative further tests revealed he’ll require surgery.

Now the Bulls must regroup again without their best defensive player coming on the heels of the loss of Lonzo Ball who also will be out six to eight weeks from the time he undergoes arthroscopic surgery on his left knee which is scheduled to take place this week.

Coach Billy Donovan wasn’t available on Saturday’s off day in Orlando Fla. but the normally low-key coach had plenty to say about Allen late Friday calling on the league to investigate the Bucks guard for what he felt was a reckless decision.

The incident occurred with 5 minutes 45 seconds lef in the third when Caruso went up for a driving dunk when Allen fouled him hard. Caruso who had just returned to the lineup after a monthlong absence from a foot sprain and a stint in the NBA’s COVID-19 protocols remained down on the court for more than a minute as his teammates huddled around him. Allen was ejected after video confirmed it was a flagrant-2 foul.

Donovan called it a “really really bad” foul and suggested Allen’s history should be considered if the league looks into it.

“For Alex to be in the air like that and take him down like that he could’ve ended his career” Donovan said of Allen. “And he has a history of this. That was really dangerous and I really hope the league takes a hard look at that because he could’ve really really seriously hurt him. He’s dealing with a wrist right now. I don’t know what the extent the wrist is but just being there it’s really really dangerous.

“It wasn’t good. … And for a team to be extended to a flagrant-2 and be thrown out of the game clearly the officials must have felt there was some intent there the way he yanked him and snapped him (hard enough) for his head to bounce off the floor. A really really dangerous play.”

Caruso was attempting a two-handed slam and said he didn’t know what had happened when he came down. But after looking at tape Caruso said “the dude just grabbed me out of the air.”

“It was kind of (expletive)” he said. “I don’t know what you can do about it. I’m just glad I didn’t have any major scary injuries right away.”

Allen did not say anything to Caruso after the play and was seen on TV cameras smirking on the Bucks bench.

Donovan said he didn’t know what Allen would say about the play but pointed to Allen’s “history of doing that all the way back to college” at Duke where he famously tripped a player.

Asked about Donovan’s remarks on Allen’s history Caruso pleaded ignorance.

“To be honest I don’t watch too much Duke basketball” he said. “I don’t watch a lot of any basketball other than the team I’m with. I don’t really have anything to comment on that.”

Donovan said he thought about sitting Caruso the rest of the game but Caruso insisted he wanted to go back in. Caruso said afterward that his right wrist was “a little sore” and “banged up” and the fact it was his shooting wrist made things difficult.

Donovan noted the Bulls also lost Patrick Williams to a left wrist injury at the start of the season on a flagrant foul by the New York Knicks’ Mitchell Robinson but he felt Robinson was making a “legitimate play” on the ball unlike Allen.

“God forbid this guy (Caruso) was a in a stretcher going out of the building right now” he said. “That would not be good. Listen I know it’s a physical game and there are plays at the basket and a lot of contact and things like that. There’s a right way. You can go up and have physicality like that. But not that way in my opinion.”

The Bucks apparently had no problem with Allen’s foul and featured him munching on a doughnut on their Twitter account Saturday which led to quote tweet from the Bulls’ account that simply said “Seriously?”

The Bulls aren’t looking for moral victories at this point in the season but Friday’s loss was a little easier to digest than some of the games in their recent skid. They’ve lost five of six.

“Fun game” DeMar DeRozan said. “Those are the type of games you want to be in. The defending champs we were going in there short-handed. No excuses. I’m proud of our guys. We went out there and competed. … All you can do is hope to have a chance late in the game and we did that.”

Despite a 35-point night from DeRozan who connected on 17 of 18 free-throw attempts the Bucks managed to hold on late. Trailing by seven with less than two minutes left Nikola Vucevic sank a 3-pointer and DeRozan hit a pair of free throws pulling the Bulls within two with 1:10 to play.

The Bulls took possession on a jump ball and had a chance to either tie or take the lead but DeRozan missed a 3-point attempt. Kris Middleton then hit a pair of free throws with 15.8 seconds left to make it 94-90 effectively ending the Bulls’ comeback. The Bulls misfired on three 3-point attempts in the final seconds.

A few thousand Bulls fans made the trip to Milwaukee making for a festive night.

“It was one of those games playoff atmosphere-like with our fans their fans” DeRozan said. “You want to play in games like that. It sucks we didn’t pull out the win. But it showed a lot about our character.”

Now the team’s character will be tested again with Caruso out of the rotation only days after rejoining the lineup from his COVID-19 stint. After Friday’s loss Caruso was asked if their performance against the defending champs was something the Bulls could still feel good about.

“As far as trying to build habits and compete to win and execute defensive schemes yes” Caruso said. “But we want to win games.”

That task became a lot more difficult thanks to Allen’s reckless play."

Shepherd at Osheim & Schmidt Funeral Home,"Gary Leonard Shepherd 72 passed away peacefully at his home in Spearfish SD on Saturday January 22 after a 2 year battle with cancer. Gary was born October 28 1949 in Rapid City SD to Leonard and Arlene (Brammer) Shepherd. Gary took great pride in being a native Rapid Citian. He graduated from Rapid City High School in 1967 and attended Southern State College in Springfield SD graduating with an Associates Degree in 1969. He married Susan McNeil on November 29 1969 in Rapid City. He and Sue lived in Minneapolis MN where he was a machinist apprentice at FMC Corp. until January of 1972 when he entered the USAF and was stationed at Ellsworth AFB until his discharge in 1976. His son Bryan was born in December of 1972. He joined the Rapid City Fire Department on March 17 1976 where he began a 32 year career rising through the ranks and becoming Fire Chief on July 4 1998 retiring from service on January 8 2008. He had a passion for serving the Rapid City Community through his role in the RCFD. He took great pride in his involvement in the organization of the Rapid City/Pennington County Dive Rescue Team in bringing the ambulance service to RCFD his involvement in the Rapid City Sister City Fire Fighter Exchange program with Apolda Germany and his time working with the United Way.

Gary grew up roaming the hills around Chapel Valley with his neighborhood friends playing Little League Pony League and Post 22 baseball and much to his dismay he took accordion lessons which most likely lead to his musical interest later in life. Throughout his life Gary enjoyed hunting deer elk and pheasants fishing trips to Canada and he recently found a love for fly fishing. He loved traveling with friends to Spring Training games in Florida or Arizona annual spring road trips with Dakota Corvettes and trips to Rapid City’s Sister City Apolda Germany and he especially valued all the great friendships made in Germany. He enjoyed spending time in the beauty of the Black Hills: whether it be driving his Corvette through the hills driving the UTV on trails near his home or sitting on the deck with family and friends enjoying the view that he loved. His other retirement hobbies included building stringed instruments etching glass flying his drone and “tinkering” around the property.

Gary and Sue were very fortunate to have shared 52 years making great memories. Gary was incredibly proud of his son Bryan and daughter-in-law Neala and the life they have made for their family. The true light of his life were his two grandchildren Camden 18 and Braxton 12.

Gary is survived by his wife Sue his son Bryan daughter-in-law Neala granddaughter Camden and grandson Braxton all of Mt. Horeb WI; brother Lee (Ann) Shepherd Rapid City SD; sister-in-law Maria Roes Schreiner; and nieces and nephew.

He was preceded in death by an infant sister his mother Arlene (Brammer) Shepherd his father Leonard Shepherd stepmother Arlene (Reynolds) Shepherd and his stepbrother LeRoy Roes.

Funeral services will be Thursday January 27 2022 at 11:00 AM at the Calvary Lutheran Church with burial following at 1:30 PM at BH National Cemetery. A luncheon will be held at Calvary Lutheran Church following the burial.

By Heath McAlpine

For more than 50 years Formula Ford has been the development category of choice for many racers straight out of karting. As Heath McAlpine discovered most of the country’s top professional drivers learned their craft in Formula Ford.

It’s amazing to think how many of this country’s – let alone the world’s – top drivers have come out of Formula Ford.

A majority of the drivers on today’s Supercars grid a few the current crop of Formula 1 drivers and many more front runners got their very first taste of car racing in the Ford-powered open-wheel class.

Established as a transition category from karting and as a training ground to teach drivers the art of car control and racecraft the tightly controlled category was born in the UK in 1967.

The premise was simple … a rear-engined spaceframe chassis powered by a 1600cc Ford engine from the Cortina wrapped in a flimsy fibreglass body with no aerodynamic embellishments.

With little change Formula Ford continues to exist in that form around the world today.

Australia saw its first demonstration race in 1969 and the first series raced in 1970 won by Richard Knight in a locally built Elfin. Legendary Larry Perkins won it in the same car in 1971 and since then the rollcall of winners includes just about every big name in the sport here.

Jamie Whincup Craig Lowndes David Reynolds Will Davison Garth Tander Russell Ingall and Mark Larkham are among the earlier era champions and since 2009 there was a run of young gun titlists … Nick Percat Chaz Mostert Cam Waters Jack Le Brocq and Anton De Pasquale.

Formula Ford lost its national championship status in 2013 with the controversial introduction of Formula 4 which ironically it has now outlived.

And it is also no longer a consistent support series to the Supercars Championship having found a balance to its schedule between predominantly state-based events with the odd national-level meeting thrown in.

In a bid to reduce costs and make the category more relevant to its contemporary road car range Ford Australia introduced its 1.6 litre Duratec engine to Formula Ford to replace the almost historic Kent engine in 2006.

The Duratec was the only eligible engine for several seasons until the category took a step back from championship to series status in 2014 allowing the use of the Kent engine in a sub-class.

It is also no longer a consistent support series to the Supercars Championship having found a balance to its schedule between predominantly state-based events with the odd national-level meeting thrown in. Cost-cutting has been a major factor in the recent resurgence of the Formula Ford category which up until a couple of years ago awarded a trip to America to contest the Road to Indy Shootout to the series winner.

Accessibility for competitors has grown due to not only the choices made by the Formula Ford Association in terms of its calendar but also through technical regulations which put an emphasis on keeping costs down.

This has helped open the class up to genuine father and son teams who prepare their entry together.

Alternatively some competitors prefer driving for a professional Formula Ford team.

Borland Racing Developments headed by Mike Borland the creator of the Spectrum chassis Mick Ritter’s Sonic Motor Racing Services which utilises the French

Mygale chassis BF Racing led by Brett Francis or Justin Cotter with Synergy Motorsport are among the professional alternatives.

That does not mean that father-son teams have no chance against the big teams in fact last year’s runner up Zac Soutar was an example of a family-orientated squad pushing a big operation such as Sonic.

Carrera Cup racer Cameron Hill is another example of this when he won the series in 2015 while Cody Burcher and Cody Donald are two further father-son operations and among the favourites for this year’s title before it was cancelled recently.

Iccy Harrington competed in Formula Ford during the 1990s and today heads up the category for the Association.

Harrington identified the importance of providing the value for money especially more than ever today due to the growing number of categories targeting the same competitor market base such as the Toyota 86 Race Series and Hyundai Excels.

“We try and keep the costs down as much as possible” said Harrington.

This is why the national series runs a seven-round calendar on a variety of events.

“Our aim is to maximise the racing for as little cost as possible that’s why we compete on various different platforms” he continued.

“We do like to do one Supercars round per year it gives the young drivers an opportunity to operate at that level and it’s good for their profile but the costs jump up so much.”

First there is a championship registration fee of $1600 though an early bird offer cuts that price down to $1400. If a competitor completes less than three rounds a season a round-by-round $250 fee applies at each.

Due to the different event platforms the category races on entry fees vary.

At a Victorian State Circuit Racing Championship round the entry fee is $415 but at a Supercars event this jumps to $1650. If a garage is added the cost rises by at least $350 though this varies from venue-to-venue.

A weekend includes Friday practice at an extra cost of $210 but again this varies followed by a 20-minute qualifying and three races.

Tyres is a constant as national competitors are required to purchase eight sets throughout the season one per round and two at the opening event. This is done to further save costs as tyre buffing was becoming a problem within the category.

“Competitors have to buy eight sets of tyres which eliminates anyone messing around with buffing” Harrington told Auto Action.

“If you don’t control it it gets out of hand and the costs get ridiculous. It was a tough thing to decide on because it locks competitors into eight sets a year but it puts so much control on the rest of the aspects.”

A set of Yokohamas cost $1016 a set.

Another cost-cutting measure is the free supply of lubricants as part of a deal with Castrol which was to begin this year after a long association with Shell.

Harrington explained that a major recent development in the category has been the technical alliance between the bigger teams and father-son operations.

“A privateer aligning with an existing team through a technical alliance is a popular way of competing and managing costs by doing all the labour-intensive work themselves then getting someone experienced to oversee” he said.

However these big teams offer predominantly arrive and drive national programs with the top-tier approximately costing around the $150000-$200000 mark. This is a complete package consisting of car rental maintenance a dedicated mechanic and engineer catering accommodation car transportation testing tyres entry fees and much more.

The next rung is around the $120000 mark but the package of support is not as comprehensive though still includes the on-track components such as testing entry fees mechanic and engineer tyres etc.

A State-level program is more accessible at $65000 for five meetings and six test days.

Accident or engine damage due to negligence are not included in these costs.

Prizes are offered at the end of the year to the top three drivers in the national title.

The winner receives a Porsche Experience test day in Queensland with leading Carrera Cup team McElrea Racing place second a day at Norwell Motorplex coached by Paul Morris and third prize is a Freem motorsport clothing package.

The pole position award is a $200 Freem voucher for both the Duratec and Kent class.

Harrington believes the costs involved in the category are just right now but says increases will be hard to avoid.

“We’re always keeping an eye on it and we don’t want it to get higher than it is now it’s in a good place” he explained.

“It’s inevitable that prices (will) creep up. A few years back we changed around a lot and reduced costs but they’ve crept up a little bit the last couple of years.”

Interested? The next step is to purchase a car.

There are two Formula Ford manufacturers that dominate the Australian scene Spectrum and Mygale while a smaller company in Sydney Listec is also making its mark.

Enter Mike Borland. His Australian designed and manufactured Spectrum chassis has won multiple titles worldwide plus launched the careers of many racing stars.

To buy a new Spectrum chassis you would expect to pay $75000-$80000 for a rolling chassis and this includes everything needed to hit the track except the Duratec engine which for a new unit costs $20000.

The engine is a controlled unit sourced from Victorian-based Cylinder Head Innovations which also handles the rebuilds.

“It’s basically supply an engine pay the price there have a seat and have a day Winton then off they go” explained Borland to Auto Action.

“It’s a complete rolling drive out the door solution.”

Value can be found in the second-hand market with a title contending late model chassis priced for between $45000-$55000.

But Borland advises that a car that is priced lower than that could need an engine rebuild.

“If you’re going to buy a used car if the engine’s done its three years and it needs a rebuild the next year you might pay $40000 for the car. If the car has an engine that has just been rebuilt prepare to pay more” Borland advised.

“An early early Duratec can be bought for the $30000 mark but those need a lot of work though they are good state level cars.”

The importance of all this is clearer when the cost of a rebuild is revealed.

“The things that change the price of the car is the engine” said Borland.

“You’d probably get two-three years out of an engine rebuild unless you do something wrong. Engine rebuilds are expensive at $9000 but you only do it every three years.

“We budget $3000 on engines a year now however back when I ran Mark Winterbottom we budgeted $24000 on engines so that’s how good the Duratec is now.”

The tight regulations around engine development is where this large cost saving has been found.

“When we came up with the rules for the Duratec we were pretty strict with the rules so you didn’t have to spend hours and hours on the dyno” Borland explained.

“There is a really small window that you can run with your exhaust system.

“We’re running the same system that we ran in 2006 when we built the first car.”

Moving onto the consumables Borland Racing Developments change brake pads every meeting and test day so a national competitor uses 13-14 sets a year at $150 each provided by Ferodo. State competitors expect to use 10-12 sets a season.

National runners use two sets of rotors per season state racers again won’t go through the same amount. These sets are made in-house by Borland and cost $200-$250 each.

The purchase of new tyres is not a requirement for state competitors so six sets will be used across the season as well as for testing.

“The Yokohamas are quite different to drive on than the Avons because they are road radial tyre and stiff in the sidewall. They require a bit of a particular driving style that takes people a bit of time to get used to” described Borland of the tyres.

“The driving style is very similar to a Supercar where they have to really stop the car and lean on the tyre in the corners a lot so it’s actually good training for Supercars with the tyres they are on and the driving style required.

“Dollar per mile though they are just fantastic.”

The four-speed Hewland dog box with open diff is largely bulletproof but because of the tyres being heavier it is harder on the drivetrain. A development in the gearbox is Borland’s diff carrier which further enhances reliability and is run by most teams through the field.

A downside is the $20000 price of a new gearbox though a rebuilt item is just as good.

“When we install one into a car it is generally a rebuilt second-hand gearbox with all new internals because it’s way cheaper to do that than buy a new one” said Borland.

Borland works through a routine when maintaining his fleet to ensure there are no failures during race meetings.

“We generally do things on a three-meeting cycle so we’ll pull bits apart and do crack testing on components because we don’t want things to break” he said.

“We’ll crack test the input shaft driveshaft and a couple of other components in the drivetrain. We try to make the cars less resistant so we don’t run seals and wheel bearings so we need to service those and uprights regularly.”

Borland’s next rising star is New South Wales driver Cody Burcher who with his father Shane has contested the past two Australian Formula Ford titles.

Burcher senior is very hands on completing the maintenance and preparation himself while receiving aid from Synergy Motorsport on race weekends in terms of data and set-up.

Burcher purchased a chassis for his son with the help of Borland three years ago for $45000 then altered a few items to better suit their needs costing a further $2000.

Support from Borland is provided at every meeting through a parts truck but Burcher also has a small selection of components that are generally needed throughout the weekend.

“I’ve always been independent so I keep a small inventory of parts such as control arms push rods gears dog rings clips bolts and springs that (can) get you out of trouble on the day” he explained.

Burcher outlined the tie-in with Synergy Motorsport.

“It’s purely data” Burcher said. “Last year I took over preparing the car completely transporting it but when we get to the track Justin [Cotter team owner Synergy] scales it and set it up. If something needs to be changed Justin tells me to do it so I handle that. Justin then takes over helping Cody with his driving through data.”

This comes at a cost of $1200-$1500 depending on the round.

Servicing is no problem. Burcher shares the same sentiments that Borland holds in advising that a set of plugs and leads might be needed at the start of the year then a change of oil and filter halfway through the year and that is really all.

Dog rings and gears is where serious money can be spent Some competitors may spend up to $1200 on gears but the Burchers only go through one gear and dog ring per event. The clutch costs $200 but is very sturdy.

Prep for each event takes roughly a day but if it is a major service then expect to at least double that time.

“If it was just a smaller prep it takes me eight hours by the time you do a wheel alignment and a few other items” Burcher said.

“If it was a big one like wheel bearings or clutch or change the thrust bearing in it you’d double that to 16 hours with that being checked every 30-40 hours.”

Burcher estimated that 40-litres of fuel is used across a race weekend purchased through Race Fuels at a cost of $60 over the course of a race event.

At $6000 per round and a budget of approximately $42000 a season the Burcher’s are almost frugal but frontrunners nonetheless.

“You don’t have to be with a big team you don’t have to do that. You can be a father and son team plus have someone there to help you on the day with data” Burcher advised.

“There are heaps of people around but they don’t ask they just assume you have to go with a team and pay big money to do it.”

Cody Donald is another participating in the series as part of a father-son operation and noted that an onboard camera and radio device are required at the national level.

“A GoPro camera for national events is compulsory at a cost of around $400” said Donald.

“Radio communications are also a necessity to speak to the driver and communicate when (there are) incidents are out on circuit.”

A radio set-up costs approximately $2000.

Formula Ford remains one of this country’s strongest development pathways and the work undertaken during the past five years has led to the category’s rejuvenation.

And for those on a tight budget or just wanting a bit of fun cost-effective racing the Kent Class is ideal and surprisingly competitive with the Duratec cars.

M-Sport celebrate a dream start to the 2022 World Rally Championship with a double podium on the Ford Puma Hybrid Rally1’s first ever event as Craig Breen and Paul Nagle finishes third overall on their debut with the team.

Claiming a total of six stage wins throughout the event four of those in an epic back-to-back surge to the top spot on Friday Loeb’s first drive for M-Sport was exceptional from start to finish. Sitting 21.5 seconds behind Ogier heading into Sunday Loeb took first blood on the opening stage of the day reducing the gap by 1.1 seconds but Ogier would fight back on the second stage increasing his lead to 4.6 seconds. Then some classic World Rally Championship drama saw Ogier suffering a puncture in the latter part of SS16 turning the deficit into a 9.5 second advantage for Loeb with just the final Power Stage to run. Loeb would stay calm show his talent taking the event victory and the first ever win in the new hybrid-era of WRC. For co-driver Galmiche it was her first WRC event alongside Loeb becoming the first female co-driver to take overall victory in WRC in 25 years.

The M-Sport Ford World Rally Team sits on top of the manufacturers' leaderboard while Breen and Nagle sit fourth in the Drivers' and Co-Drivers' Championships respectively.

On what is Craig Breen’s first ever full season campaign the Irishman together with co-driver Paul Nagle set competitive and consistently strong times throughout the course of the weekend. Breen commented how comfortable he was feeling in the car and congratulated the team back in Dovenby Cumbria for their outstanding work over the past few months. Breen gained pace over the weekend ending Sunday with consistent top three-times during the final stages of the event.

The Ford Puma Hybrid Rally1s dominated the top spots as Gus Greensmith finishes the event in fifth place after consistently delivering over the weekend. A puncture and some technical issues caused him to drop time in two stages on Saturday but the young Brit battled his way back to fifth position by the evening. Greensmith’s highlight of the weekend was undoubtedly taking his first ever WRC stage win as he gained 1.5 seconds on Neuville to claim the win in SS7 on Friday adding to Loeb’s wins to give the team its fifth stage victory in a row that day.

Although a disappointing weekend for Adrien Fourmaux after an accident in SS3 on Friday morning the Frenchman was carrying excellent pace into the stage and has discussed how impressed he was with the car.

This maiden victory for M-Sport Ford comes after an incredible amount of hard work and dedication and the team’s return to the top spot has been long-awaited.

Sébastien Loeb first overall said:

""I'm really happy I didn't expect so much. When I came here I didn't really know what to expect I was just hoping I would be in a good rhythm and able to fight with the guys in the front. In the end it was more than we expected we were able to fight with Ogier to boast for the win and to finally win the rally at the end like this is just amazing.

""It comes ten years after my last championship I haven't done too many rallies since then so to still be able to fight is just a great moment and I'm really proud of what we did. With Isabelle it was a very good weekend she did a good job. The feeling with the car has been good since my first test and that gave me some confidence but I didn't really know what level I would be at but now we have the confirmation that we are able to fight at the front so it's just exceptional for us. A big thanks to all the team they did a great job and the car was perfect all weekend so a big thank you to everybody.""

Craig Breen third overall said:

""Obviously really happy with how the weekend went perhaps not the strongest of weekends pace-wise but we really settled into the car with every stage. Ultimately today we definitely found our feet our pace was really good and we managed to bring home a podium result. It's great for the team great to get two cars on the podium and looking forward to Sweden now.""

Gus Greensmith fifth overall said:

""Really happy with the weekend a one-three-five for the team so pretty much the perfect start for the year. We definitely had the potential to fight for the podium this weekend so we can use that as great encouragement for the rest of the year. Obviously the highlight was taking the maiden stage win for my career the car is weapon and its been brilliant. I'm really happy for all the guys and girls for all the hard work they've put in. We've got this result so let's move forward.""

Adrien Fourmaux said:

“It’s really disappointing for all the team it’s not what I wanted for them after the hard work they put in over Christmas. It was a mistake with big consequences and I paid the price. So I’ll do my best to try to fix that and try to make sure that mistake doesn’t happen again.

""The car was amazing. I’m very happy with the feeling in the car the guys have done a really good job. It is a really good result coming from Séb Craig and Gus and with all the work over the last two years to prepare for 2022 it is really great for the team.”

Rich Millener Team Principal said:

“Obviously I’m incredibly happy. To put everything together and for everyone to be so stressed out and busy working just trying to get everything in place to build up to what is an incredibly tough rally and to do so well is fantastic for the team and all the drivers. It’s a dream result that will take a while to sink in and we’re going to enjoy it while we can. I want to thank everybody including all our friends from Ford the M-Sport team the drivers and the sponsors who made this happen. Without them we simply couldn’t do it.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMid2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmF1dG9ldm9sdXRpb24uY29tL25ld3Mvc3RvcC1oYXRpbmctY2FyLW93bmVyc2hpcC1lc3BlY2lhbGx5LWlmLXlvdXItYnVzaW5lc3MtbW9kZWwtcmVsaWVzLW9uLWl0LTE3OTc4MS5odG1s0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Stop Hating Car Ownership Especially if Your Business Model Relies on It,"Photo: Screenshot from YouTube

For example the latest statement that caught my attention was made by the Vice President and Head of Turo in Canada Cedric Mathieu. I am sure that he is very good at what he does but there was a part of his statement about car ownership that does not make any sense or is just ironic. To clarify it does not make any sense to me.In the company's latest release which was a study on car ownership in Canada he stated the following: ""Car ownership is an inefficient model but the alternatives are limited for Canadians who still need access to a vehicle."" The latter probably is true but the former is ironic to say the least.In fairness he also stated that there is a ""paradox when it comes to car ownership. It is clear that car ownership is still a central part of Canadian life but these cars largely go unused while costing owners thousands of dollars a year.""In his view ""peer-to-peer car sharing is one solution that helps reconcile these realities –making car ownership more affordable for those who need a vehicle while expanding accessibility to one for those who don't. This model paves the way for a future where cars are put to better use allowing for fewer cars on the road but accessed by more people.""With those quotes above can you see what I saw? Let me point it out. The Vice President and Head of a company that runs an app that is developed strictly for peer-to-peer car sharing said that ""car ownership is an inefficient model."" Well yes it is expensive to own a car but if nobody owned one there would be no cars available for peer-to-peer renting. Do you see where this is going?To the best of my knowledge Turo does not own any cars that are rented through the app Uber does not have drivers as its employees or owns vehicles Airbnb does not own property and the list goes on. Similar statements were made  in various forms by CEOs of ride-sharing companies as they call themselves.In reality they are ride-hailing companies as each “shared car” comes with a driver who is usually its owner. Those CEOs have also criticized individual car ownership as being faux pas but if people did not own cars who would drive “your” customers around and in what?Might I underline the fact that without people who own cars and do not drive all the time the business you represent would not have a point existing? That is without mentioning the fact that in Eastern Europe for example people are sick of the idea of sharing things with their peers and prefer to own whatever they use. Communism does take a toll on people and it lasts even after it is gone.It is easy to criticize people for simply owning cars and then to claim that your company provides an excellent service that eliminates the need to own a personal vehicle. That may be true in most cases but there is always a but here  and Canadian car owners underlined it twice. They said they needed cars for commuting and convenience.Knowing that you have a car that you can use which has fuel in its tank and can be driven right when you require it is great if you have an emergency in the middle of the night or you just need to transport a heavy item. Or you live somewhere a bit more remote and public transportation is nonexistent. Why pay to rent someone's car if you can afford to own one?While commuting can be done with public transportation in many countries the convenience part is where the apps can make a living except for one thing and it is availability. I was interested in using a few of these car rental services that worked through apps when they first were available where I live.Some services just offered e-scooters bicycles or electric mopeds. I only rented those e-scooters just to see how they work and for a bit of fun but never required anything else.I liked the idea of being able to get on something that would be faster than walking but did not require waiting for someone else. They did not work out for me and I have yet to rent a car through an app for personal use but I did rent one for work purposes.So with that please stop criticizing people for owning cars . Private property is a right that people have died for and not owning things is fine if people choose so  not if you make it seem as being obsolete.It is perfectly normal to own a car and the automotive industry would fall on its face if people stopped buying vehicles so that they could rent from others instead. When everyone tries to do so what are we left with? Who are you going to rent a car from if no other people own one and they want to rent a car from you? These are rhetorical questions do not bother answering.Vehicle manufacturers might attempt to offer the solution in the form of mobility subscriptions but these may only work for some people. Those who cannot afford a new car or who struggle to get a beater just for basic transportation will be left without a means of transportation. Either that or they will stay in a circle of poverty where they will have to work to be able to afford to go to work in a rented vehicle."

(Photo: Stephane Cardinale - Corbis via Getty Images)

Bravely invoking a doomed power couple before them Kanye West and Julia Fox officially made their red carpet debut as an item in matching denim ensembles.

Weeks after going public with their romance the duo arrived in style at Paris Men’s Fashion Week on Sunday putting their own stamp on the Canadian tuxedo.

Checking off a major relationship milestone in high-fashion get-ups that probably elicited more than a few cringe emojis in the Kardashian family group chat West and Fox continued their full-court-press offensive at the Kenzo Fall/Winter 2022/2023 fashion show.

The “Donda” rapper — who legally changed his name to “Ye” last fall — opted for a puffy jean jacket and matching trousers from his favorite fashion house as of late Balenciaga which he accessorized with all-black sunglasses gloves and tall Red Wing boots.

But all eyes were on the “Uncut Gems” star who’s making a habit of taking fashion risks. Fox paired a cropped Schiaparelli denim jacket outfitted with conical breast details and baggy low-cut pants that she borrowed from the company’s creative director Daniel Roseberry.

“I took the pants off of his body and he was very kind to let me wear them” she told WWD at the show.

Fox finished off the look with dramatic winged eyeliner and golden brass earrings resembling heart-shaped buttocks.

While the double-denim outfits were a clear send-up to the matching ensembles Britney Spears and Justin Timberlake famously wore to the 2001 American Music Awards Fox might have also been referencing a different pop music superstar.

The jacket details recall the iconic Jean Paul Gaultier cone bra bodysuit Madonna wore during her “Blond Ambition” tour back in 1990. Fox and Madonna recently spent time together amid rumors that she’s up for the role of the singer’s best friend Debi Mazar in the upcoming biopic about her life.

The newly established couple has embarked on a whirlwind romance since they started dating on New Year’s Eve on the heels of the rapper’s separation from Kim Kardashian West.

Earlier this month Fox confirmed their relationship in a candid essay for Interview magazine in which she wrote about their “instant connection” and how West wooed her with an “entire hotel suite full of clothes.”

The one-shoulder number featured a gray lining and asymmetric hem which stretched to her thighs. Fox’s look centered on the dress framed by a long black leather trench coat and silver pyramid-shaped earrings.

Similarly to their outfits this morning West continued the narrative with a coordinating outfit: a black leather jacket and pants over a black hoodie and wrapped cloth face covering. His go-to shoes of late vintage knee-high Red Wing boots were also part of this look.

In my case I’ve been using the units for almost two months and often side by side. An Epix on one wrist and a Fenix 7 on the other. So I’ve got direct comparison data including battery burn charts for long 7-hour activities on how they actually handle the real world with all the features enabled.

Now at a high level undoubtedly the display is the main difference. But that display actually drives quite a few other factors that are less obvious. Things like map clarity graphing detail how the unit reacts when on your wrist and even general day-to-day visibility. And it’s probably important to set aside any perceived notions around ‘pretty display’ units from a few years ago. Or even from Garmin’s own line-up. The just-released Venu 2 Plus shares the same screen but doesn’t feel anything like Epix. That’s because Garmin appears to have done everything possible to make Epix mirror the Fenix rather than approach it as a broad mid-tier consumer device like the Venu series.

So with that this post is divided up into two basic parts:

A) A quick overview of the Fenix/EPIX models

B) A deep-dive into all those nuanced differences between the Fenix & Epix

Now you can hit Play on the video above which in this case is probably the best thing to do because many of these are display-based and it’s easier to see those in the real-world with real video footage of how the units react and display.

The Model Options:

For the moment I’m not going to belabor all of the Fenix 7 Series models in this post. There are 22 of them in total plus other country-specific SKUs. For example the UK has a different shade of grey than the rest of the world on certain models. I’m not kidding. It’s a different SKU there. Here’s the official chart of listings from Garmin for at least the US market.

The most important thing to know is that all these units share the same software features across the board. They all have music the same optical heart rate sensor the same GPS chipset manufacturer the same contactless payment support the same WiFi/Bluetooth/ANT+ and all the same sport profiles and related features. Same. Same. Same.

Instead deciding on a model is all about three sorta simple things:

A) Size

B) Solar

C) Sapphire edition or not

To recap at the high level you’ve got basically three Fenix 7 Series sizes to choose from and a single Epix Series size:

Fenix 7S – The Smallest: This is a 42mm case with a 1.2” screen

Fenix 7 – The Middle Bear: This is a 47mm case with a 1.3” screen

Epix – The Only Bear: This is identical to the middle Fenix 7 in size at 47mm and 1.3”

Fenix 7X – The Biggest: This is a 51mm case with a 1.4” screen.

Then if choosing Fenix 7 you need to decide whether or not you want solar or not. In general think of solar as incremental power. If you go out for a 45-minute walk in the winter in the sun it’ll add a relatively trivial amount of power (and zero power under a coat). Whereas if you spend an entire day in the summer in the sun it’ll add a very substantial amount of power. I have battery charts later on showing exactly how much. But there is no solar on Epix.

Fenix 7 Series: Solar offered

Epix Series: No solar offered

Ok so then we get to the question of ‘Sapphire’ edition or not. In the case of the Fenix 7 Series the ‘Sapphire’ tag kinda replaces the ‘Pro’ tag in the Fenix 6 series. There are no Fenix 7 Pro units. Sapphire is the new Pro.

Sapphire on both Epix and Fenix 7 does four very specific things:

A) Gets you Sapphire glass: This is more durable against scratches but also has slightly dimmer visibility. In 2022 I wouldn’t overthink the scratch element the glass they use on the regular non-sapphire units is very strong and I rarely scratch watches with it despite treating them like crap.

B) Gets you titanium bezel/case: The Sapphire units have a Titanium bezel and case so they’re officially swankier looking. Some also have DLC coating too.

C) Gets you Multi-band GPS: This is the new dual-frequency GPS which theoretically is the holy grail of GPS accuracy. In practice it’s slightly better but really only in very specific challenging situations (like up against massive cliffs and sometimes against exceptionally tall buildings). It’s not perfect and it’s not yet the holy grail. Maybe with updates in a year it will be. COROS added this to their Vertix 2 last summer and I have seen slight/incremental improvement since then. They share the same chipset as Garmin.

D) Gets you 32GB of storage instead of 16GB: This is primarily for map usage (or music) but it also gets you pre-loaded maps for your region. In the case of non-Sapphire units you simply tap the ‘Map Manager’ within the watch and choose your region (continent). You’ll wait a few hours for that to sync over WiFi and then you’re done. I detail the sizes of the maps in my in-depth review but the short version is that North America and Europe are about 8-10GB each so you can’t fit both together on a 16GB unit. You’d have to swap back and forth.

Here’s a chart that Garmin has that actually explains it way better than I could possibly do with MSPAINT:

At this point I wouldn’t let either the Multi-band or map storage bits be a decision driver individually however they could be together. For example I often travel back and forth – so having the maps for both continents is handy for me. And since I’m a geekier person I’m interested to see how multi-band GPS will play out over the next year or two. Thus I’m more likely to go for a Sapphire edition. I find zero value though in the sapphire glass or titanium bezel case.

Of course you do you; I’m just giving you my thinking.

The Key Epix vs Fenix Differences:

Now I’ve broken up these into a list of bulleted sections. Because I like compartmentalized sections…and lists. This list also mirrors the order of the video above (which also has chapters). I even went as far as asking Garmin’s product team last week for any other trivial differences between them. Also note that while the basis for my real-world comparison is Epix Sapphire vs Fenix 7 Solar Sapphire that none of the items below change when going non-Sapphire except that the non-Sapphire visibility is generally a little bit better (less dim). But I don’t have any non-Sapphire units to compare.

1) The Price: Fenix 7 starts at $699 and goes over $1000 whereas Epix starts at $899 and goes to $999. So if you compare like models – Fenix 7 Solar Sapphire to Epix Sapphire it’s a span of a $100 difference ($899 for Fenix 7 Solar Sapphire to $999 for Epix Sapphire). If you compare non-Sapphire to non-Sapphire it’s a $200 difference between base models ($699 for Fenix vs $899 for Epix).

2) The Display Mode Variants: Let’s start with the easy one. The Fenix 7 screen is legit always-on all the time. Twenty-four hours a day no matter what you or the watch are doing it’s on. Though it does have a sleep-mode if you want it. It also has a backlight which is configurable in steps of 5% increments from 0 to 100% depending on whether you’re in sleep or regular mode.

Then there’s the Epix. At its base/default configuration it has two core modes:

A) Always-on EPIX: In this config as long as there’s some (even tiny like typing) movement the screen remains on. If you turn your wrist towards you it brightens the display but it’s usually perfectly readable without the added brightness. If you leave it on a table for 60-seconds unattended it’ll turn off the display. Similarly if you’re sitting perfectly still reading a book the display may turn off depending on how still you are. I’m apparently not a very still person as this virtually never goes off for me – instead it just goes back and forth between dim-but-easilyviewable mode and bright mode. In any case in this always-on mode the watch lasts 6 days in smartwatch mode. I can confirm that over the past month+ this number is very valid and matches my real-world usage with ~1hr of workouts each day on average (GPS or indoors) using a default watch face.

B) Gesture-based EPIX: In this mode the display turns off when you’re not actively looking at it. As you raise your wrist it turns on. It’s worthwhile noting though you can set this differently for workout vs general usage. So in workout mode you can say always-on but the rest of the day gesture-based. In the overall gesture-based mode it gets 16 days of smartwatch battery life.

Note that in the case of Epix it presumes the display goes to sleep each night. The default is 10PM to 6AM but you can change the timing and behavior within the Sleep Mode settings though. I explain this more in the ‘dimming’ section below.

3) Display Technology: Next the biggie the display itself. You’ve got that AMOLED display which is 65000 colors instead of the Fenix 7 series 64-colors and transflective MIPS screen. The AMOLED display is the same as the Venu 2 series which has been received well. The size of both screens are identical listed as 1.3” and the internal viewable size of both screens is also identical (the solar ring is ‘outside’ of that viewable area).

Probably the easiest way of illustrating this vast color difference is a simple watch face I created using the Connect IQ app. These are with the backlights enabled at default settings upon wrist raise. Of course it’s also hard to make out the clarity in a photo of a photo.

Now as an interesting aside if you do create a custom watch-face it will likely go into gesture-mode (as was the case above). Garmin does have specifications for created AMOLED-series always-on watch faces but the stock ‘Face It’ feature to make your own faces doesn’t make always-on faces – so those force me into gesture mode on the Epix whereas on the Fenix it’s there the entire time. We’ll talk about burn-in in a moment.

4) Resolution: Next we’ve got the resolution of the display which is how many pixels it has. Essentially the more the better. With more pixels you can show more detail. The Epix screen is 416x416px while the Fenix 7 screen is 260x260px (Fenix 7s is 240x240px and 7X is 280x280px). However since the physical size of the screen is the same this results in more pixels per inch (PPI – remember that from printing days?). In the case of the Fenix series it’s 200ppi whereas the Epix series is 326ppi – so dramatically higher. Now by itself this isn’t super obvious in basic running fields. Where it’s more important is charts data graphs maps and anything where detail is needed So let’s look at that.

5) Map Detail & Visibility: One of the easiest examples of this is simply in mapping. While both units use the *EXACT SAME MAPS* the Epix displays details better at a higher zoom level. This is shown in countless scenarios but in my video above I walk through a very specific one that I’ve screen captured below. Both of these units are showing the exact same spot at the exact same zoom level (300m) and both of them are set to defaults for screen brightness with a popularity routing map shown. Notice how the Fenix 7 (left) is missing numerous trails that the Epix (right) shows. For example that trail that cuts along the top of the screen. Or the added mountain symbols. Or the entire selection of trails cutting across the middle-bottom of the screen. Or the names of the mountains. None of that detail can be shown (yet) on the Fenix because it doesn’t have the resolution to pull it off. Instead you don’t see that detail till you zoom further down. In which case again the Epix shows other details that Fenix lacks until you zoom down yet again. It’s a never-ending cycle.

This is more than just maps though. You see it in golf courses for example as well as even ski resort/ski trail maps. Plus of course just clarity in things like the charts too.

6) Brightness: Next is brightness the AMOLED is by far brighter in my experience in every scenario – including in direct sun. At least with the two Sapphire editions I have. In bright sunny sun on top of a volcano amidst desert-like lava fields the AMOLED display is super bright and easy to read. And the same is true in a jungle under dense tree cover. While the Fenix 7 series is certainly easy to read in direct sun it’s the less bright scenarios that the Epix really shines – without having to utilize the backlight – or change the backlight settings. By default the Fenix 7 series uses a 20% backlight option which of course you can increase to get it brighter. But as you can see here it’s not really even close (Epix left Fenix 7 right):

Here’s another:

Looking at some direct sun scenarios here’s my wrist in direct sun on an island in summer-like weather and the Epix is easily read:

Point being I wouldn’t be concerned about brightness with Epix. Whereas at least with the slightly dimmer Sapphire edition of the Fenix 7 there are cases where it’s not as visible especially in early evening or darker conditions where the Epix really shines.

7) Dimming: Now let’s go the opposite direction – how visible is it when you want it to be dark? In that case both units actually have sleep mode options. For Epix it’ll be enabled by default and you’ll configure your sleep time and then it goes into a do-not-disturb sleep mode with a simplified watch face. In this mode the watch display is off and to see the display you’ll just press a button. Simply touching/taping it won’t change anything.

The Epix actually has a lower dimness setting for sleep mode than regular mode. Thus it won’t blind you at night. I’ve had no issues with the Epix display dimness levels at night (a concern from some other AMOLED units in the past). Here’s the Epix in sleep mode once a button is pressed (I show the Fenix in sleep mode in the video too as well as how to configure it).

Whereas for the Fenix 7 series at night the display is still ‘on’ though no backlight unless you specify it. One thing to keep in mind is that in a dark room at night (like a bedroom) you won’t be able to see the time either unless you press a button. So basically for the middle-of-the-night scenario a button press is required no matter the watch. And you can use gesture backlight for both watches too (which is by default off in sleep mode).

Oh and quirky geek aside. The Epix and Fenix actually have two different control levels for brightness. During normal daytime usage the Epix display brightness has three options. But at night in sleep mode it becomes four options. Similarly the Fenix 7 normally adjusts backlight brightness in 10% blocks with 20% being the default. Whereas in sleep mode it’s 5% blocks with 5% being the default.

8) Battery Considerations: So within the battery camp we’ve basically got two core scenarios to consider: Day to day smartwatch wear and workout GPS times. Let’s start with a simple chart from Garmin which outlines the claimed battery levels for each model:

Now in my testing I primarily focused on the Epix Sapphire & Fenix 7 Solar Sapphire and in an always-on configuration. Without question I’ve been hitting that 6-day always-on claim near perfectly using the default settings and inclusive of ~1hr of workout time per day (blend of GPS and indoor workouts). Some days more workout time some days less. But a safe average of an hour a day here in December. In terms of the Fenix 7 that too seems to trend towards its battery claims for watch mode but honestly given they’re so high it’s hard to judge precisely.

So what about workout modes? Well let’s go big! Here are two workouts using the watches effectively side by side with ‘all the things’ enabled. I’ve got the Epix Sapphire on my left wrist and the Fenix 7 Solar Sapphire on my right wrist. For this first one a 7hr 15min ride I’ve got always-on display enabled multi-band satellites enabled optical heart rate enabled course/route following/navigation loaded and enabled ClimbPro enabled an ANT+ power meter connected Bluetooth connectivity to my phone enabled with LiveTrack enabled. In other words literally everything is turned on at the highest possible settings to burn as much battery as possible. Here’s the Epix at the start (sorry the photo isn’t super crispy as it’s a screenshot from a video I took).

The ride started in the sun then went into the forests for a few hours of climbing and then above the tree-line for a few hours of lava fields before descending back down into the forests and out of the sun. For the Epix it started at 92% and ended at 59% (a 32% decrease) the projected battery capacity then based on this ride was 21.72hrs. Whereas the Fenix 7 Sapphire Solar went from 98% to 77% (a 21% decrease) with a projected battery duration of 34.12hrs.

You’ll notice that in both cases these estimated battery calculations are actually *ABOVE* the Garmin claims for multi-band GPS. And Garmin’s battery claims don’t even assume the battery-draining course navigation either. Meaning I could easily significantly increase my estimated capacity further by not turning on all the features.

If we switch to a 5-hour long jungle hike with the exact same setup except minus the sun (overcast conditions and under dense tree cover for quite a bit of it). You’ll see again very strong numbers – estimated 18.91 hours capacity for Epix versus 20.83hrs for the Fenix 7 Solar Sapphire. The denser trees would have likely caused the unit to increase power to the GPS to try and increase signal reception and the Fenix 7 Solar would have had less solar power here due to lack of sun from clouds and trees. But again remember – EVERYTHING was turned on here in a worst-case scenario.

Now why might my battery times be better in the long ride than Garmin’s official estimates? Well likely because those estimates were done months ago. They haven’t changed since despite Garmin’s firmware and efficiency getting better and better. And in fact if I look at long rides in the sun on similar islands from early December the battery capacity was more akin to Garmin’s official claims (lower). In other words I think they’re actually pretty conservative at this point and it wouldn’t surprise me to see those battery claims eventually adjusted upwards.

(Pro Tip: You can create your own battery charts using the DCR Analyzer. This will properly display battery durations for devices from Garmin Wahoo Stages and Hammerhead. COROS is aiming to add support this spring. Inversely note that Garmin’s Vivoactive & Venu series units do not write this information to the .FIT files.)

9) Flashlight: The Fenix 7X has a flashlight on it (the other Fenix 7 units do not) this flashlight can be used in a variety of scenarios including simply finding your way around your home in the dark at night to illuminating a trail ahead of you while you run to an impromptu bike light. The 7X flashlight is comprised of two white LEDs and one red LED. The brightness level is roughly in the ballpark of my iPhone 13 Pro maybe a smidge less. It’s more than enough to blind anyone in the same dark room though. Finally it also has a running-cadence driven flashlight that will match your running cadence and flash white and red lights either forwards or backwards based on your arm swing. In practice I didn’t find this works super precisely but it still manages to let people know that you’re there/visible – so I’m not sure it’s a huge deal that it’s not perfectly timed. Overall though the Fenix 7X flashlight is awesome and super useful let’s be clear about that.

The Epix series does not (very sadly) have a dedicated flashlight but does have a flashlight mode. Just like with the Fenix 7X you can simply double-tap the upper left button which goes to a flashlight user interface with multiple levels of white light as well as red light. It’s not ideal for lighting up a trail but is plenty bright to light up a bedroom at night or blind your significant other lying in bed. Like with the 7X the red-light option is less harsh and honestly a better late-night option. I show how this works in the video up above.

Note that the other Fenix 7 units do have this same feature as well though it’s not nearly as bright as the Epix screen – simply because the backlight of the AMOLED is essentially a lighthouse compared to the Fenix 7’s backlight being a small candle. Still I’ve also used the Fenix 7 flashlight nonetheless to find things in the dark. So it does work in a pinch too.

10) Accuracy (GPS & HR): This one is easy – they’re virtually identical. Now I’ve done far more detail on this in my in-depth reviews on both but in almost every scenario they acted virtually identical (both good and bad). And that makes sense they’ve got the exact same optical HR sensor the exact same GPS chipset and the exact same size and case materials. Now you may (and probably will) see optical heart rate differences between the different sized Fenix 7 models as typically speaking heavier models can introduce more bounce which degrades accuracy. Though ironically in my testing the Fenix 7X actually handled perfectly in even hard and cold-weather interval runs. But I have less 7X HR data than I do 7/Epix direct comparison data. This is also true for barometric altimeter accuracy where they were in absolute lockstep on all my test activities.

The point being that the two units appear identical in this area (both good and bad).

11) Pixel Burn-In Potential: Pixel display burn-in can occur in AMOLED/OLED (and other types of) screens when bright images are left on for an extended period of time without change. For example a very bright-white watch face with sharp lines. Companies (both watchmakers and phone/tablet/TV/etc makers) mitigate this through a variety of methods. For example in Garmin’s Venu & Epix series they do what’s called pixel-shifting which slightly moves an image a pixel or two in a different direction occasionally to turn off/on pixels. Generally speaking this isn’t obvious/viewable to your eye. Whereas the Fenix series has no issues with burn-in.

In terms of potential for pixel burn-in on the Epix watch I suspect we’re in a far better place than Garmin was with the original Venu (which uses a different display and a handful of people have seen burn-in issues). I don’t believe I’ve seen any reports on the Venu 2 series for burn-in which is the same screen as Epix. Though it’s also only about 8-9 months old. We’ve seen Garmin since introduce specific guidelines around Connect IQ watch faces to be enabled in always-on mode plus there are aspects like the sleep mode dimming and powering off after 60-seconds of non-movement. All of which are designed to substantially reduce the chances of burn-in. I’m personally not worried about it in normal usage in 2022 given the measures that have been taken and the lessons learned Garmin has with other units but ultimately only time will tell.

12) Weight: This obviously varies considerably by which model you choose (size-wise materials etc…). However if comparing the two Sapphire units to each other there is only 3g in difference between them. I measured the Fenix 7 Solar Sapphire and it was 74g whereas the Epix Sapphire was 71g. I suspect most of us would consider that basically a wash for practical purposes.

13) Connect IQ Support Levels: Both Epix & Fenix 7 support the same Connect IQ System Level (System 5) however Epix supports a greater subset of features within it due to its higher resolution display. Meaning that 3rd party apps can develop more vibrant/detailed/rich apps on Epix that might not be available down the road on non-AMOLED screens. While I’m sure there are some examples today (folks are welcome to drop them below in the comments) I’m not aware of any big-ticket ones. In terms of performance I measured both watches using the Connect IQ Benchmarking tool and the scores were very similar. The Fenix 7 Solar Sapphire: CPU 9.4 / 58.8 Pips and Epix Sapphire: CPU 9.4 / 62.5 Pips – both on Connect IQ 4.0.6 (software 7.20). This matches my real-world experience which shows that both units act virtually identical side by side in terms of changing pages display data map movements etc…

14) The Random Extra List: This is a list of extra things that didn’t make the main list above. I’ll also add things to this over time:

A) White on black text: For Epix you have white lettering on black text for sport profiles. Whereas for Fenix it’s black lettering on white text. Normally I dislike white on black – partially because it’s a pain in the butt to take photos of and partially because I usually find black on white easier to see. However in this case (as well as the Apple Watch Venu series Samsung Galaxy series and a few others) the white lettering is easy and crisp enough to see that I’ve got no complaints at all here.

B) The Epix can display more data fields per page: On the Fenix 7 (middle unit) you can display 6 data fields per page but the Epix can display 8 data fields per page.

C) You see I don’t yet have a C: But eventually I will.

Ok that’s all I’ve got for now!

Wrap-Up:

Phew!

Ok hopefully this answers some questions when trying to choose. Obviously there are a lot of options but I think probably the biggest factor you’ll want to simply consider is battery life scenarios and how you use your units.

For me I’ve got virtually no reason to do a 30hrs+ long GPS adventure. It’s just not my cup of tea. And in the unlikely event I did find myself in such a situation (like wanting to track a really long journey) I could use a charging puck with a battery pack to keep it topped up (you can charge while using). Further I don’t mind dealing with charging roughly once a week for my typical workout usage. Probably a bit more often when I do longer workouts during a week (spring/summer).

So for my use cases I’m in the Epix camp. I think the display is awesome and gives just so much better visibility and clarity than Fenix 7 does. However the downside for me is that I typically prefer a smaller/lighter watch such as something in the Forerunner 745 range (my normal go-to). While I quickly get used to wearing the larger watches it’s not my comfort food. Similarly many of you like larger watches like the 7X series ones and so there’s no option there either.

I think it’ll be really fascinating to see what Garmin does with the Fenix & Epix brands over the next 2-5 years. Certainly if we look to a Fenix 8 or Fenix 9 series with continued battery optimization there probably won’t be a MIPS display option anymore – it’ll be all AMOLED (or similar). My bet is that Enduro becomes that brand/platform for MIPS for the dwindling segment of the population that wants or needs that kind of screen. The question is with Fenix being the most valuable brand – where does the Epix brand go. Things I’ve pondered…

With that – I’ll let you get back to pondering your choices. Feel free to drop any questions below and I’ll try and help out – or countless others in the community can too! More opinions is always good here.

It's a running watch (but not a Garmin),"One might say I have a slight obsession with Henry Cavill and these people are not far from the truth. I admire how he not only looks like a real-life Superman but is also a down to earth guy who loves working out almost as much as assembling gaming PCs and video games. And as it turns out he also likes running watches and one brand in particular.

In a recent interview Bodybuilding.com asked MuscleTech's Chief Creative Director a series of questions such as what's his favourite exercise (although we already knew that Henry Cavill's favourite exercise are squats) and what advice would he give his younger self (""It's not meant to be easy"" Word!).

The question that surprised me the most was when Henry was asked about his favourite fitness tech. He could've named anything from the JaxJox DumbbellConnect to the Vitruvian V-form Trainer yet he said the fitness gadget he can't live without is a running watch. And not even one of the best Garmin watches.

No Henry Cavill's favourite fitness gadget is a different wearable or more precisely a Polar watch presumably the Polar Vantage V2.

Watch the clip:

As Henry explains ""I get a lot out of that [watch]. I could do my workouts without [my Polar watch] but it would be a lot more hassle. It can track how many calories I burned and it's super useful for my running.""

Although he doesn't specifically mention the Vantage V2 I assume that's the watch he uses because A) it's the flagship model and I'm sure he can afford it B) the Vantage V2 has several helpful training and recovery tools that can help optimise running and cardio training in general.

Of course it's possible that he uses the equally decent Polar Vantage M2 or even the Polar Ignite 2 but I feel like a Ventage V2 would suit Henry the most. Maybe he will change his preferred multisport watch to the new Garmin Fenix 7 now that it comes with a built-in flashlight.

By the way Henry if you feel like talking about running watches or training and workouts; I'm at your service.

The company or PR agency provides all or most review samples. They have no control over my content and I provide my honest opinion.

[Update] Please be warned I originally recommended several Etsy straps but it seems these won’t be compatible. The pins on the Epix are not removable so you have to use something with the Quickfit clip.

You will be pleased to know that the latest Garmin Fenix 7 and Epix Gen 2 use the same watch straps as the preview Garmin Fenix 6 Series.

The Epix is the same size as the 47mm Fenix 7 so both of these use the same straps.

The 47mm Fenix 7 and Epix Gen 2 use a 22m Quickfit band

The 51mm Fenix 7X uses a 26mm Quickfit band

The 42mm Fenix 7S uses a 20mm Quickfit band

Garmin Bands

Garmin has a large number of their own bands available for Fenix and Epix devices.

As you’d expect they are quite expensive but they will likely have the best overall quality. They have some premium material options too.

Garmin doesn’t make things easy when it comes to finding a compatible band. You’d think all 22mm Quickfit bands would work on any watch but this is not always the case.

The Marq Series has its own premium straps which no doubt people would love to put on their Fenix or Epix. But not all are fully compatible.

Via Reddit

In this Reddit thread a user confirms that the curved end strap fits the Fenix 6. However in this Reddit thread a user had to take a Dremel to the strap to get it to work. That strap was the red model number 010-12738-17 which is £75. I don’t really want to be grinding away parts of a £75 watch strap.

If you look at the Garmin website they do provide a compatible watch list which is the most reliable way of knowing if they are compatible.

Apart from your generic rubber bands there are some nice alternative materials they all cost a fortune though.

The Jacquard-weave Nylon Strap is £180 which is ludicrously expensive this is listed as being compatible with the MARQ strap and the Fenix 7 and Epix. Colour options include indigo heathered black black yellow/green pine green and red.

The leather bands are also compatible in either Italian Vacchetta or Genuine Horween Black for £180.

A titanium band will set you back £270 but stainless steel is £100 less at £170.

All the Fenix 7 and Epix compatible watch bands appear to be on this page

Etsy

I had previously recommended several Etsy straps but one commenter pointed out that the pins of the Epix are not removable so you are forced to use Quickstaps. This is a bit of a scummy move by Garmin in my opinion.

One solution is to buy a Quick-Fit Metal Watch Band Adapter which will allow you to use any standard watch strap.

Some nylon straps slide under the current pins which would therefore work.

This strap is well-reviewed looks good and is priced at £30.

Amazon

Amazon have a good selection of cheap straps especially if you just want a rubber strap. Overall they are not as attractive as the options on Etsy.

There are some alternative materials available including nylon and metal but some of the reviews are mixed.

IT leaders worked to shift workloads to the cloud to ensure business continuity for the remote workforce leading to skyrocketing adoption of cloud computing. This momentum is expected to pick up in 2022 and beyond.

For many businesses the pandemic accelerated their digital transformation plans by months or even years. Reliance on cloud infrastructure will only continue to grow as organizations adjust to the hybrid work model. Gartner projects that global spending on cloud services is expected to reach over $482 billion in 2022 up from $313 billion in 2020.

As we start the new year C2C an independent Google Cloud community has identified six cloud computing trends to watch in 2022.

More people are harnessing new technologies

The pandemic inspired a new generation of entrepreneurs. Whether out of necessity from mass layoffs a desire for a more flexible lifestyle or finding the inspiration to finally pursue a passion millions have started their own ventures.

As their businesses grow and digitize entrepreneurs across industries are embracing the cloud and adopting technologies like machine learning and data analytics to optimize business performance save time and cut expenses. There are countless benefits to small businesses and startups. For one the cloud makes data accessible from anywhere with an internet connection enabling the seamless collaboration necessary in a hybrid work environment. Without having to spend on expensive hardware and software entrepreneurs can invest in other areas as they scale their businesses.

We often see founders leveraging the power and ease of use of Google Cloud Platform AI and ML tools to rapidly prototype and build applications. They’ve used this technology to create unique and exciting solutions like tools that use ML to analyze English pronunciation or ML that predicts one’s mood from their breath.

Greater emphasis on security in the cloud

Last year businesses looked to the cloud to reshape their operations and become more agile. While cloud computing certainly offers the benefits of that flexibility and productivity it also puts organizations at risk of becoming more vulnerable to cyber threats and data breaches. For that reason security is going to become a larger part of the cloud conversation throughout 2022 and beyond.

This reality is going to influence a greater emphasis on building more security into the cloud. As the world continues to go digital organizations are being tasked with ensuring security within the cloud is properly integrated into evolving business models.

More organizations will seek out data solutions

Almost all enterprises operate in multi-cloud environments. As a result a lot of valuable data is spread across systems creating a need to make data accessible to more analytics tools. Cross-cloud analytics solutions are on the rise to help data analysts manage all their insights.

At C2C we’ve discussed the noticeable rise in the number of people and companies looking at data solutions specifically BigQuery Google Cloud’s fully managed server-less data warehouse. These companies are typically mapping out their data strategy but interestingly some companies that are trying to work with AI and ML realize they need a solution that makes their data consistent and easy to store.

Productivity tools will become even more sophisticated

When the world was forced into a remote work model overnight during the pandemic many companies were not prepared for the challenge of immediately shifting their processes to a virtual format. The ongoing challenge for many companies that have transitioned to a hybrid model has been determining how to best keep both remote and in-person team members engaged.

This opened doors for cloud-based collaboration tools like Google Workspace which are only going to become a bigger part of our day-to-day operations. These solutions have capabilities like document collaboration integrated chat features virtual whiteboards and more.

Much of that growth has already occurred: Nearly 80% of workers are using collaboration tools for work in 2021 up from just over half of workers in 2019 according to Gartner research. Not only are more companies going to adopt these cloud-based collaboration solutions but the solutions are going to be enhanced and evolve as the needs of the hybrid workforce change.

Cloud certifications are becoming more sought after by employers

As industries accelerate remote adoption of cloud technologies certifications and other IT credentials are becoming increasingly important and sought after by employers. And more IT professionals see the benefits of earning these certifications as well.

More than 90% of IT leaders say they’re looking to grow their cloud environments in the next several years yet more than 80% of those same leaders identified a lack of skills and knowledge within their employees as a barrier to achieving this growth. It turns out the next big challenge for companies will not be how to manage cloud technology but how to find enough qualified workers certified in it.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMia2h0dHBzOi8vbmV3c3Jvb20uY2lzY28uY29tL2Mvci9uZXdzcm9vbS9lbi91cy9hL3kyMDIyL20wMS93aWxsLTIwMjItYmUtdGhlLXllYXItdGhhdC1zYXNlLWNvbWVzLW9mLWFnZS5odG1s0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Will 2022 be the year that SASE comes of age?,"Imagine a cloud-native security offering that reduces complexity and provides secure access to any applications from any location effectively converging security with WAN infrastructure. That is what we believe Gartner did in 2019 calling it secure access service edge (SASE). This architectural approach forced IT to rethink how networks and security intersect as organizations change the way they connect their hybrid workforce to applications and data resources. There was just one problem: SASE at the time did not exist.

Two years later Gartner analysts Gaspar Valdivia and To Chee Eng wrote ""Convergence of WAN edge functionality specifically SD-WAN and eminently cloud-based security functions into a SASE framework is the most ‘vigorous’ trend coming out of 2020.""

Since then SASE has gained industry traction and is being viewed by customers as a vital approach to secure access to applications from any location and is especially relevant to today’s hybrid work environment. Still in its infancy SASE continues to evolve as customers look to leverage capabilities and existing offers.

Security vendors including Cisco have been working to enhance existing approaches to deliver more of the benefits of SASE. Foremost among these is the idea of a zero-trust network. In a SASE architecture anything that connects to the network is subjected to identity authentication access control and other standard threat detection procedures.

This idea could not come at a better time for the security community.

According to the European Union Agency for Cybersecurity’s Threat Landscape 2021 report “Cybersecurity attacks have continued to increase through the years 2020 and 2021 not only in terms of vectors and numbers but also in terms of their impact.”

One of the drivers for growing threat sophistication is “the transitioning of traditional infrastructures to online and cloud-based solutions advanced interconnectivity and the exploitation of new features of emerging technologies such as artificial intelligence” says the report.

These are the very trends that SASE is supposed to offer protection for. It is therefore not surprising that companies are rushing to invest in SASE architectures.

In July 2021 for example research by Cisco Investments found 98 percent of organizations “see clear and defined benefits of SASE” and zero-trust network access was a top spending priority for 42 percent of those questioned.

One challenge for these network chiefs is that SASE is still evolving. Transition to a complete SASE model will take time. Solutions with flexible deployment options are needed to meet organizations wherever they are in their SASE journeys. Gartner predicts that by 2025 at least 60 percent of enterprises will have strategies and timelines for SASE adoption.

That said many of the ingredients of the SASE recipe are already in place. And Cisco for instance offers all components of a SASE architecture including software-defined WANs cloud security zero-trust network access and observability.

Deploying these tools can already lead to measurable levels of threat reduction according to the latest Cisco Secure Security Outcomes Study. “Organizations that claim to have mature implementations of zero trust or SASE are about 35 percent more likely to report strong SecOps than those with nascent implementations” the research found.

Going into 2022 SASE will continue to be a customer priority as solutions mature. For those who deploy its various components whether separately or together the promise of direct and secure access to applications hosted anywhere is possible.

If you attend a conference you're sending a strong signal to other attendees that you're open to meeting people and networking in your industry. There’s no song or dance no having to “meet for a drink” and no need to come up with a reason to email. Instead you can simply cut to the chase and just talk to people. That saves so much time and energy. You can get a year’s worth of networking done with just a few conferences under your belt.

Here are several conferences for finance and business analytics students that I highly recommend.

After the first “technology trigger” hype rapidly drives the curve of “visibility” up to the “peak of inflated expectations”. Then early failures give rise to negative press plunging it into the “trough of disillusionment”. Slowly however new applications emerge and the curve rises along the “slope of enlightenment” before the mature technology settles on the “plateau of productivity”.

Not all technologies in the foothills of the first peak make it to that final plateau though. Their long-term fate is often sealed by strategic decisions made very early on.

Observers of quantum technologies may be excused for thinking they are now at the top of peak of inflated expectations. Hardly a day goes by without a technology giant an enthusiastic start-up or an ambitious academic researcher boasting some breakthrough that suggests mainstream quantum computing is just around the corner. Gartner the US information technology research and advisory company that devised the curve believes it is only early days however. In its 2021 report it deemed quantum machine learning to still be a technology trigger: a promising technology to watch and invest in. This means we face another decade at least of hype.

With the technology trigger of course comes the money. We are seeing that too and that’s a good thing. Quantum computing is a formidable challenge requiring dedication long-term vision and sustained investment. But because we are only at the start of the journey we must get this right if we are to secure the way forward.

I write this at a very happy moment for my field of research of silicon-based quantum computing. For the first time three independent research groups including my own have demonstrated the ability to perform universal quantum operations in silicon with better than 99 per cent fidelity which means less than one error every 100 operations.

This is a key threshold at which it becomes possible to detect and correct errors more quickly than they occur allowing the computer to reach the correct result. These results were published this week in three back-to-back papers in Nature. It’s extremely rare for three very similar papers to be published in Nature on the same day but it’s not coincidental and perhaps the most inspiring side of the story.

The three research groups – at UNSW Sydney Delft University of Technology in the Netherlands and Riken in Japan – have a long history of collaboration and open scientific exchange. This is a key reason why we have achieved this level of performance in our silicon quantum processors.

Lieven Vandersypen the leader of the Delft team spent a sabbatical at UNSW in 2016 and met several of our team members. One Giordano Scappucci now leads the materials development team in Delft. There he produced a special stack of silicon and silicon-germanium alloy which was key to the performance of their quantum processor. The material was shared with the group of Seigo Tarucha at Riken and used for their recent experiments.

The silicon material we used at UNSW was supplied to us by another Japanese colleague Kohei Itoh. Among my team one of the lead authors Mateusz Mądzik now works in Delft while the other Serwan Asaad is a former Delft graduate.

Alongside this Australia-Netherlands-Japan triangle was another key player – Sandia National Laboratories in US. There the team led by Robin Blume-Kohout developed a new method to certify the performance of our quantum processor. That method was also made openly accessible and was adopted by the Delft group as well.

There are important lessons to be drawn from this story with long-term repercussions.

First now that private investors are getting involved in quantum technologies we must be careful not to sacrifice the free circulation of ideas people and materials for the needs of commercial confidentiality. Money is no substitute for good ideas especially in a revolutionary field such as quantum technology. Ideas only thrive in openness. Indeed some of the most successful quantum companies are explicitly transnational and collaborative actively forming alliances with other companies in the global quantum ecosystem as well as engaging deeply with academia.

Second governments must continue to support basic research and take a long view of the return on investment.

I remember vividly a meeting where a US government delegate explained to me that ever since the Manhattan Project American government agencies have had a very clear picture of where their technological advantage comes from. They know that the iPhone was created in the US not only because of Steve Jobs’ entrepreneurship but because decades of government-funded curiosity-driven research laid the foundations for developing the innovative components of the device.

Unfortunately not all governments have access to such well-documented histories and prefer to prioritise short-term translational research. This hardly ever pays off in the long term.

Finally education and training are crucial to success. The workforce necessary to build the quantum technology ecosystem is in short supply. Skilled graduates and experienced quantum engineers can roam the globe for attractive jobs as many of our teammates have done.

The most successful quantum enterprises will be those based in countries that both train the local quantum workforce and attract the global one. Quantum Valley need not necessarily be in northern California. But anyone else with designs on it needs to act boldly and quickly – while fostering the creation and circulation of brilliant new ideas.

But unless you’re a Pixel 6 or 6 Pro owner and you’re really sold on one of the stand’s handful of extra features supported by your phone then you’d be better off saving your money and getting an inexpensive third-party charger.

The aptly named Pixel Stand (2nd gen) is Google’s second take on a fast wireless charger built to complement its Pixel phones. You don’t have to own a Pixel phone to use it since it works with Qi-compatible gadgets but you will need a 6 or a 6 Pro to get the fastest charging speeds. You’ll also need the January 2022 security update or later which if you’re a Pixel 6 owner you’ll want to download for a whole bunch of reasons anyway.

Like the original Pixel Stand it does some multi-tasking while charging your phone. While your Pixel phone is docked on the stand it can display images from your Google Photos albums to act as a kind of digital picture frame. During setup the first time you put your phone on the charger you can specify which albums you’d like it to pull images from and photos are displayed in batches of five to 10 at a time slideshow style.

Other features are geared toward bedside use. There’s an option to automatically turn on “do not disturb” when the phone is placed on the charger and you can have the display automatically turn off in a dark room. There’s also a “sunrise” alarm that gradually brightens your display in the 15 minutes before your alarm goes off. You can specify a window of time for this feature so it isn’t applied to other alarms throughout the day — just your wake-up call.

As for its main job — charging your phone — it does this effectively. I noticed some false starts here and there when I’d set the phone on the stand and it would start charging only to stop momentarily before picking it up again. This didn’t cause any problems; it just gave me a few moments of concern as I tried to figure out if it was mounted on the stand correctly.

The Pixel Stand 2 offers 23W charging with the Pixel 6 Pro and 21W for the Pixel 6 — quite speedy for wireless charging on a phone that isn’t made by OnePlus. It took a totally depleted Pixel 6 Pro battery from zero to 100 percent in almost exactly two hours which is impressive. My more typical day-to-day use case was topping off the battery on a Pixel 6 taking it from 70–80 percent back to 100 percent which took around 30 minutes using the fastest charging mode. The Stand offers a slightly slower 15W charging for other Qi-compatible phones and devices.

As for the extras I like the photo frame feature more than I thought I would. I’m not sure I want to commit to owning and curating images for a dedicated digital picture frame but I do happen to have dozens (okay hundreds) of photos of my four-month-old on Google Photos that I like looking through. Having them displayed at my desk on my phone is kind of a nice middle ground — I get to actually see and appreciate the many many photos I take without hassling with another device. I’m sure that my colleagues who review smart home tech could direct me to a number of smart displays that do this kind of thing already but I digress.

If I have one complaint about this feature it’s that it tends to pick favorites and show those over and over. This might be because it favors portrait orientation photos and I tend to shoot more landscape. In any case you can tap the screen to end the current slideshow and swipe the lock screen to shuffle the selection and start a new one.

Features like the option to automatically enable “do not disturb” when the phone is docked make the Stand a good bedside companion.

The Stand’s nightstand-oriented features work well too. The sunrise alarm is a pleasant way to wake up and the ability to detect a dark room and turn off the screen accordingly makes it a good bedside companion. But these features feel a little at odds with the Stand’s main draw: fast wireless charging. If I’m charging my phone overnight then I don’t need the absolute fastest speeds. I wouldn’t see the photo frame feature much either since my phone doesn’t spend much time on the bedside dock during the day.

I also encountered a couple of problems with Google Assistant while using the stand. After I tap the Assistant icon on the lock screen while docked the phone will register my voice commands but will unhelpfully ignore everything it just heard me say and display “How can I help?” text on the screen. Accessing the assistant by saying “Hey Google” on the lock screen works just fine though and that’s not a Stand feature — just something you can enable on any Pixel phone.

The second-gen Stand includes a built-in fan.

Then there’s the built-in fan; it’s fairly quiet but if the fan is running at full speed the assistant struggles to hear me at all. You can choose a quiet charging mode to avoid this but then you’re missing out on those super-fast charging speeds.

The Pixel Stand 2 isn’t inexpensive: at $79 it’s well more than the $30-ish standard Qi charging stands you can find on Amazon. If you own a Pixel 6 or 6 Pro really want fast wireless charging and think you’d particularly like any of the extras that the Stand (2nd gen) offers then you’ll probably find its 80 bucks well spent. But if you’re only mildly interested in the bedside or photo frame features and fast wireless charging isn’t essential save yourself some money and go for a standard Qi charger. You could even add a digital picture frame to your cart for the same cost too.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMicGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNjbXAuY29tL3RlY2gvYmlnLXRlY2gvYXJ0aWNsZS8zMTY0MDk1L2hvdy0yMy15ZWFyLW9sZC1ob25na29uZ2VyLWJyaW5naW5nLW5mdHMtcGh5c2ljYWwtZmFzaGlvbi13b2_SAXBodHRwczovL2FtcC5zY21wLmNvbS90ZWNoL2JpZy10ZWNoL2FydGljbGUvMzE2NDA5NS9ob3ctMjMteWVhci1vbGQtaG9uZ2tvbmdlci1icmluZ2luZy1uZnRzLXBoeXNpY2FsLWZhc2hpb24td29v?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Meet the 23-year-old Hongkonger trying to merge NFTs and physical fashion,"With his new virtual marketplace called Wear Lau plans to eventually allow NFT collectors dress their avatars using art from their digital collections in addition to having their own dedicated showroom for those collections.

“[The electronics store] influenced a lot of my ideas in terms of running creating and selling things” he said. “It was my first step into retail.”

Lau is now trying to use these experiences to launch a new immersive platform in his home city selling non-fungible tokens (NFTs)  the unique code stored on a blockchain that allows digital assets to be traded like physical goods.

Nick Lau a 23-year-old Hongkonger grew up finding himself on the periphery of his immediate social circles – at Harrow a traditional English boarding school he took photography classes and started a skatewear brand; at New York-based Parsons School of Design he co-owned a 300-square-feet electronics store.

“It’s a hybrid between the traditional NFT marketplace like OpenSea and individual projects” he said referring to the world’s largest NFT trading platform that was founded in 2017.

On Wear buyers can “wear” their digital collection of NFTs by using social media filters and are given access to Wear’s in-house virtual “tailor” which helps modify the NFT in 3D to fit a customer’s avatar. The platform also has a dedicated showroom where people can showcase their collections.

The first big test for Wear which launched on January 13 comes next month when its five-member team will issue 1000 inaugural NFTs called Wearkey. This will serve as a kind of platform membership that includes access to upgraded showrooms.

The platform taps into a growing intersection of gamers and fashion lovers around the world as fashion brands eagerly launch their own projects related to the metaverse  a concept of an immersive virtual world considered to be the next iteration of the internet. Current concepts often involve selling digital goods and land using NFTs.

Last May luxury fashion house Gucci hosted a virtual art installation on gaming platform Roblox. In August Louis Vuitton launched 30 NFTs in a mobile game to celebrate the brand’s second centenary. Adidas also bought virtual real estate last month in The Sandbox the metaverse project owned by Hong Kong-based Animoca Brands to stake a claim in the virtual world.

Hong Kong-based Wear plans to launch 5000 NFTs in March in collaboration with Hong Kong eyewear brand A. Society. Photo: Handout

These moves coincide with a rise in the number of NFT marketplaces around the world. This has given Lau’s target audience the Millennial and Gen Z “hypebeast crowd” many options for trading in digital markets. In addition to OpenSea there is the digital art platform SuperRare the multimedia platform Rarible and Bitski which works with streetwear brands to attract young consumers.

In a global NFT market that has already reached US$24 billion in sales there are more than 45 platforms competing against each other according to market tracker DappRadar. Many of these platforms are “offering similar functions and products” Lau said which is why Wear is trying to bring more physical elements to NFTs.

Its first physical product will be given out in March when it plans to launch 5000 NFTs in collaboration with Hong Kong eyewear brand A. Society and local street artist Lousy ahead of the Art Basel Hong Kong exhibition in March. Among those buyers 250 will receive physical glasses that look like their purchased digital artwork. The move is similar to one tested by virtual sneaker creator RTFKT  which started selling real shoes and was acquired by Nike in December.

To entice buying Wear is also incorporating elements of blind boxes a marketing tactic popularised in mainland China by toymaker Pop Mart . Buyers of these NFTs do not know what they are getting until after the purchase when it is minted on the blockchain.

Chinese buyers have still shown a strong appetite for local NFTs  but domestic platforms shun the term in favour of “digital collectibles” and ban buyers from reselling their purchases for profit.

“We’re definitely losing out a little bit in terms of the China market” said Lau. “But we are targeting the global market not just Asia.”

South of the mainland border NFT projects have been flourishing . This has also given rise to money-laundering scams and hacking  as Hong Kong regulators try to catch up with the increased market activity. The city is likely to regulate exchanges for virtual assets rather than institute a complete ban as in the mainland experts say.

“There has been a lot of market noise associated with crypto especially NFTs in recent times” said Timothy Siu a senior associate at Hong Kong-based law firm Titus who has been dealing with issues related to virtual assets for nearly five years. “Inevitably I anticipate regulations will be introduced to regulate the conduct and dealings of both issuers and intermediaries associated with virtual assets just like how you’re regulating traditional financial markets.”

While some virtual assets behave like securities they are not necessarily regarded as such under Hong Kong law. Under these conditions the city’s Securities and Futures Commission has restricted regulatory power over such assets including NFTs Siu said.

Still the market is difficult to regulate because virtual assets are still rapidly evolving while it takes a considerable amount of time for legislation and public consultation to catch up Siu added.

Lau is not yet concerned with these legal aspects. He said he is focused on launching a complete ecosystem where brands and creators can do more than just trade NFTs including things like hosting parties and art exhibitions in the metaverse.

Before achieving that vision Wear has a lot on its to-do list this year. It has plans to launch NFT auctions with Vogue and Lau’s alma mater Parsons School of Design and issue its own cryptocurrency among other projects. Lau said he expected the company to be profitable by the third quarter of this year.

If he does not meet that deadline though he has given himself at least a little more leeway.

“With NFT projects and NFT marketplaces if you don’t make it past the one- or two-year mark it’s quite hopeless” he said.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWmh0dHBzOi8vY29taWN2aW5lLmdhbWVzcG90LmNvbS9mb3J1bXMvZ2VuLWRpc2N1c3Npb24tMS9ibGVhY2hzLWhlbGwtYXJjLXBvdGVudGlhbC0yMjUxNDc4L9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Bleach's Hell Arc Potential - Gen.

The work that comes straight from the author is canon.

What's to say that a said standard is correct When did studio pierrot or anyone working on naruto say this if they didt then this whole standard is madeup nonsense which it is hence why boruto and the shinden novels are seen as canon despite not being wrote by the creator.

Original intent of the author makes nothing to you guys You just like what you like and form your canon standards around that hence the inconstancies with these standards and hence why all the things deemed as canon are things that you like and things not are non canon.

This idea of the purity of the source material is just bs as you for example count the manga adaptation of boruto over the original movie and will count the manga of one punch man over the original web comic. Geez it's almost like you guys like manga so you count that as that's your preferred material. I count the anime as i prefer it over the manga and see unlike you there's no inconsistency with it and i've never had to make up some ''objective'' standards to justify my preferences.

You guys are literally the borg I have responded to all these same points in another thread. Not only that but all you manga stans like the same thing and have the same unchanging positions like you hold that momoshiki would stomp kaguya. See the sad part of that being would be that you guys call yourself but your so based in conformity that you really encourage the exact opposite idea behind debate which is discourse around subject matter.

They are entirely separate stories not at all connected to the original story therefore they are very much new stories.

They are not new stories Dragon ball super and boruto are both based upon full length figure films It matters not if the events were retconned as that changes nothing about it not being new. Dragon ball super was not new until the champa vs beerus tournament saga everything before that was just adaptions of other work.

I do love the hypocrisy here too You say things like the anime cant be canon as it contradicts the manga as on the other side of your mouth You then say the anime can retcon events. I guess the anime only counts if it's liked ig. Why does dbs get a pass on contradictions and not dbz?? Here we go with the unstated bias that we wont admit again.

I think you are confused. Are the lord of the rings movie primary canon over the books?

Dont know much about lord of the rings so cant say I doubt it follows the events of the book as anime verbatim does through as western adaptation is very loose unlike with eastern.

I think it's a different area in the west anyway as with stories often embracing the idea of different universes such as with the mcu and dcau but if we look to the east such things are just not done. Naruto does not have different versions of his life like in every medium. Naruto has the same backstory and character unlike western entertainment where optimus prime can be a bruatal murderder in one universe but a nigh pacifist in another. That's just not something which occurs in the east and as there's no such thing as canon there.

you never answered my question Why should canon matter if thread creators can just choose what's discussed. be it the boruto or filler?

That's not an insult

No I thought being called uncreative and stupid for not liking the same book that you like was a compliment. How does one take being called uncreative as anything but a insult? Let's ignore the irony of you not thinking for yourself and blindly following the masses as if that's creative. But rules for thee and not for me apparently.

you have to use your imagination more for how a character looks or sounds

Books verbatim tell you how characters look and sound. It just a waste of space on the page. illustrations of the same image sum up what's being said without directly saying it and that's part of the reason why movies are better

Also you realize that books have covers right and that often gives an understanding of how the characters look and present themselves see below

Again this is just more you spouting uneducated nonsense to justify your clear biases and interests but do on. Not understanding books and pretending they teach to think how the characters look for yourself when covers routinely tell you how characters appear eg the series of unfortunate events and narnia

For example the expanse is one of my favorite series and the show is really good however the books are much better. They also came straight from the author and are primary canon over the show

You just like the book as it's seen as more vitreous on these stupid sites to like books over much less outdated mediums. You like it cause it's seen as canon and nothing more. I like the naruto anime over the manga cause the anime has better visual presentation also im just one to dislike to your stupid cult.

If however in a debate you are referencing something that only happens in the anime then it won't be valid UNLESS the OP says that manga or anime can be used in which case it doesn't matter.

I can and will use the anime You can whine over that honestly go ahead. I dont like you people anyways if my prior comments and this thread has not made that explicitly clear to you.

I dont care if you deem it as not valid or not Your standards are stupid anyways and even going by them. Kishimoto counts the anime as he included both juzo and raiga in the manga despite both debuting in the anime but you know what the coomunity's headcanon always prevails over fact so who cares right.

On January 23 Emmy award-winning actress Cynthia Watros hosted a “Meditation and Motivation” virtual event for an intimate group of fans. Digital Journal has the recap.

Watros is known for her portrayal of Nina Reeves on the hit ABC daytime drama “General Hospital.” She is also known for her acting work in the defunct drama series “Guiding Light” and “Lost.”

This Zoom event was produced by Coastal Entertainment and it featured Watros teaching meditation techniques and basic life skills to help people get through the rough patches of daily living.

She shared some of the secrets that she uses in her daily life and she offered ways for people to motivate themselves.

Watros spoke about mind body and spirit as well as her love of yoga and fitness. She also participated in a question and answer (Q&A) session with her dedicated fans.

MB ‘State of Mind’ podcast

In October of 2021 Watros was featured in Maurice Benard’s MB State of Mind” podcast on mental health which is hosted by three-time Emmy winner Maurice Benard. “I loved it” she exclaimed. “I don’t give a lot of interviews I am a pretty private person so going on his podcast I was a little nervous. It is so refreshing that we talk about not having a completely normal mind and that is beautiful and celebrated acknowledged and accepted. I love it because it makes us feel like we have more of a place in the world. It’s not easy to feel like you are broken or that you are an outcast.”

Watros continued “Maurice gives a platform for people to talk about things like this and to say ‘you are absolutely beautiful the way you are.’ I loved his ‘State of Mind’ podcast I love Maurice and I love working with him. I loved doing the Nixon Falls storyline with him on the show. As an actor he gives me so much support and love. When we act together it is playful and spontaneous.”

Her “MB State of Mind” episode with Maurice Benard may be seen below.

‘Misguided’

In addition Watros appeared in the digital series “Misguided” which was written directed and created by Paul Gosselin where she played the role of Anne.

“We are in the midst of a once-in-a-generation expansion” Electric Boat president Kevin Graney said at CBIA’s Jan. 21 Economic Summit + Outlook. “And frankly it may be the biggest in our history.”

Making history: Electric Boat president Kevin Graney talks with CBIA’s Chris DiPentima during the Jan. 21 Economic Summit + Outlook.

Graney walked through the Groton-based submarine manufacturer’s four major lines of businesses taking time to explain the company’s efforts to provide an inclusive work environment and address the workforce shortage.

The “bread and butter” of Electric Boat is the Virginia-class design and construction a model which has been built since 1977 and focuses on stealth firepower and endurance.

Graney said the USS Oregon and USS Montana were on the brink of being finished with another dozen submarines in production.

In addition the Columbia-class has become an increasingly valuable submarine for Electric Boat. This model is a ballistic missile submarine that will succeed the Ohio-class and be operational for the next 60 years.

Additional Business Lines

Beyond the manufacturing of new submarines Graney also highlighted the company’s maintenance and modernization operations.

The USS Hartford for example is undergoing a “smart start” that will transition into a “significant engineering overhaul” that will keep the ship in Groton for the next three to four years.

Electric Boat is a formidable force in the country’s naval capabilities.

The USS Nautilus—the world’s first nuclear-powered submarine which marked the anniversary of its 1954 launch the day of the conference—will undergo paint and refurbishment to continue modeling and educating people at the Submarine Force Museum in Groton.

The final major line of business is engineering and design work carried out by up to 5000 employees in New London. These employees are working on projects such as fleet support and concept and technology development.

All of these lines of business come together to make Electric Boat a formidable force in the country’s naval capabilities and sends a message to adversaries of “more capable submarines for our war fighters and our sailors” Graney said.

Prioritizing Safety

Despite Electric Boat’s addition of more than 2500 employees last year Graney said “safety will continue to be our number one priority.”

Even while hiring thousands of people the company reported a record-low number of OSHA reportable and lost work day rates.

“Our safety and performance is the best in our history.” Electric Boat’s Kevin Graney

“Our safety and performance is the best in our history” Graney said.

Graney said the company currently has an 86% employee COVID-19 vaccination rate without implementing a vaccine mandate.

Had there been a mandate he said a portion of the workforce would have resigned “that we couldn’t afford to lose.”

Hiring Challenges

Graney said Electric Boat’s biggest challenge moving forward is one that businesses across the state and the country have been facing: hiring.

A variety of reasons have contributed to the hiring difficulties including temporarily closed workforce pipelines retirements and resignations.

“Simply put it’s getting harder to hire and retain employees” Graney said.

“Simply put it’s getting harder to hire and retain employees.” Graney

CBIA’s annual Survey of Connecticut Businesses reported 80% of business leaders having difficulty finding and retaining workers and over one-third (35%) of businesses blame a lack of skilled job applicants as the main growth obstacle.

Graney said the manufacturer has programs “to help underemployed adults transition to Electric Boat.”

In addition the company has programs in schools from elementary to high school to help train the next generation of ship builders.

Outreach Workforce Development

“2033 is projected to be one of our peak years of hiring” Graney said “and we are in the run up to 2033 starting now.”

“Many of the people that we hire that year will just be graduating from high school and some of them that will end up joining our workforce eventually aren’t even born yet.

“2033 is projected to be one of our peak years of hiring and we are in the run up starting now.” Graney

“So getting out there and educating people about the opportunities here at Electric Boat is incredibly important to us.”

Graney also highlighted the company’s current hiring efforts. Of the 2500 people hired in 2021 half were Connecticut-based.

Electric Boat plans on hiring up to 400 employees this year just to work on the USS Hartford.

Diversity

The company is also committed to diversity with an 11% increase in its minority workforce and a 19% increase in Hispanic workers while women now make up 16% of senior leadership.

Graney summarized Electric Boat’s hiring philosophy as “introducing our careers to those who don’t yet know they want to be ship builders.”

“We’re introducing our careers to those who don’t yet know they want to be ship builders.” Graney

Part of that effort is the company’s Boat for Women program.

“It’s an opportunity to expose women who are thinking about a job at Electric Boat to the trades and to try and knock down some of the perceived barriers that have traditionally existed in our business” Graney said.

The company also has Boat for Veterans a similar program aimed at hiring veterans.

Supply Chain Impact

Electric Boat’s growth has a major impact on the state’s economy. Over the past five years Graney the manufacturer has awarded more than $1.1 billion in contracts to the 359 companies in its Connecticut supply chain.

“We’ve got an additional $130 million in fiscal 2021 to provide seed money in the industrial base to help develop our supply chain” Graney said.

“The money is making a difference and over 90% of the industrial base right now is prepared to meet our current and future demand.

Electric Boat has awarded more than $1.1 billion to Connecticut-based suppliers over the past five years.

“The remaining 10% is where we’re spending a lot of time and effort making sure that they are preparing and getting ready to support the work we have.

“That money is coming home to Connecticut and we will continue being good stewards to make sure the industrial base is keeping up with demand.”

Graney also emphasized Electric Boat’s strategic sourcing initiative designed to bring new companies into its supply chain.

‘New Dawn’

Graney closed his remarks on a positive note for both the company and the state.

“We’ve got a very robust future” he said. “We are heading off into a new dawn.

“And where else would you rather be than right here and right now in the great state of Connecticut.” Graney

“I wish everyone could see what I see on those boats: eye-watering technology sailors who are completely dedicated and are masters of submarine warfare and it’s EB people who are fiercely proud of what we build.

“And where else would you rather be than right here and right now in the great state of Connecticut building submarines and having a significant impact on our regional economy.”

The new aircraft will help protect Morocco’s interests in the 81000-square-nautical mile Exclusive Economic Zone. Given Morocco’s 2952 km coastline and strategic position overseeing the Strait of Gibraltar along with Spain and the United Kingdom.

Morocco intends to keep it’s arch-rival Algeria’s six Kilo-class submarine in check since it does not possess any submarine of it’s own.

Two airframes Italian Leonardo ATR 72 MPA and Airbus C-295 MPA are currently being considered by Morocco. Evaluation for both maritime patrol aircraft will be carried out in the next few months.

Besides the two European candidates currently being considered Boeing is pitching its P-8 Poseidon while Lockheed Martin is offering its SC-130J Sea Hercules to fill this role. Both American aircraft are believed to have been eliminated from the contest due to cost grounds.

Morocco already operates 14 Britten-Norman Defender acquired from the United Kingdom and four Beech King Air 350ER aircraft for maritime patrol duties.

The North African country is waiting for the delivery of a General Dynamics Gulfstream G550 transport and reconnaissance aircraft from the United States to augment its forces this could be later retrofitted for the MPA role similar to the Israeli version and equipped with technologies developed and manufactured by IAI’s radar and electronic warfare subsidiary Elta Systems.

Smith & Wesson chose to enter its M&P 9 model – with M&P standing for military and police – apropos for the testing. Smith & Wesson also teamed up with General Dynamics which gave it more cachet with the defense community. Smith & Wesson was cagey about why it got eliminated from the competition. As a publicly-traded company they revealed they lost the bid in a U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission filing but did not disclose why. But in another unofficial test the M&P9 shined with a surprising first-place finish.

About that Smith & Wesson M&P 9

The Smith & Wesson M&P 9 is a polymer-framed striker-fire pistol with ambidextrous controls. It has a Picatinny rail for accessories and it offers an optional manual thumb safety. The barrel and slide are stainless steel. Overall length is 7.6-inches and the weight is just under 8-ounces.

Smith & Wesson had some confident words to describe their entry:

“In the design of the M&P we considered the needs of military and law enforcement from every conceivable angle. No other polymer pistol offers this combination of versatility durability and safety.”

M&P 9 Loses

But the Smith & Wesson M&P 9 lost the competition – probably because it was not completely modular. After SIG Sauer won the bid for its M17/M18 models based on their P320 gun enthusiasts wanted to run their own trials to see which maker had the right stuff.

How About a Different Competition?

So Personal Defense World Magazine decided to run a contest to replicate the XM17 Modular Handgun System tests in 2019. They selected the Beretta APX CZ P-09 Glock 19X SIG Sauer P320-M17 and the Smith & Wesson M&P9 M2.0.

Here were the ground rules:

Reviewer Paul Scarlota and his partner “zeroed each pistol from an MTM K-Zone rest at 15 yards and we were pleased to see that all were capable of producing groups 2 inches or less in size.”

“We then field-stripped cleaned and lubricated each pistol—the only maintenance they received. If one malfunctioned we would attempt to correct the problem at the range. If we were unable to do so the pistol would be scored up to that point and then put aside while we finished testing the remaining handguns.”

The Informal Testers Looked At Numerous Traits

The guns were tested on the steel plate drill the paper/popper drill and the speed drill. The pistols were scored for reliability ergonomics trigger control recoil control sights off-hand accuracy and reloading ease. Minimum score was 1 and maximum score was 15 for each category.

Guess who won? It was the Smith & Wesson M&P 9 M2.0. The S&W got a score of 100 (the perfect score was 105). It blew away the Beretta APX which finished last with a disappointing score of 79. SIG came in second place at 88 followed by the Glock 19X in third and the CZ P-09 in fourth.

The M&P9 got “perfect” grades on ergonomics recoil control off-hand accuracy and reloading ease. It also scored well in reliability and trigger control.

So there you have it. Smith & Wesson passed an independent test with ease. To be sure this was by no means an “official” military trial with thousands of rounds fired. But it is illustrative to see how well Smith & Wesson performed on what appeared to be a level playing field. Maybe it was closer to bringing home the gold than previously thought.

Here’s What You Need to Remember: One of the key technical challenges when it comes to engineering a mobile yet lethal weapon is to build a cannon both powerful and lightweight enough to meet speed lethality and deployability requirements.

The US Army plans to build prototypes in the next several years of a new lightweight Mobile Protected Firepower armored vehicle expected to change land war by outmatching Russian equivalents and bringing a new dimension to advancing infantry as it maneuvers toward enemy attack.

Long-range precision fire coordinated air-ground assault mechanized force-on-force armored vehicle attacks and drone threats are all changing so quickly that maneuvering US Army infantry now needs improved firepower to advance on major adversaries in war Army leaders explain

“Mobile Protected Firepower helps you because you can get off road. Mobility can help with lethality and protection because you can hit the adversary before they can disrupt your ability to move” Rickey Smith Deputy Chief of Staff G-9 TRADOC told Warrior Maven in an interview earlier this year.

Smith did not elaborate on any precise weight but did stress that the effort intends to find the optimal blend of lethality mobility and survivability. Senior Army leaders however do say that the new MPF will be more survivable and superior than its Russian equivalent.

The Russian 2S25 Sprut-SD air transportable light tank according to Russian news reports weighs roughly 20 tons and fires a 125mm smoothbore gun. It is designed to attack tanks and support amphibious air or ground operations. The vehicle has been in service since 2005. US Army weapons developers have said their MPF will likely be heavier to ensure a higher level of protection for US soldiers.

In light of these kinds of near-peer adversaries with longer-range sensors more accurate precision fires and air support for mechanized ground assault the Army is acutely aware that its maneuvering infantry stands in need of armored mobile firepower.

Current Abrams tanks while armed with 120mm cannons and fortified by heavy armor are challenged to support infantry in some scenarios due to weight and mobility constraints.

Accordingly Smith explained that Infantry Brigade Combat Teams (IBCTs) expected to operate in a more expansive battlespace will require deployable fast-moving close-to-contact direct fire support. This fast-changing calculus based on knowledge of emerging threats and enemy weapons informs an Army need to close the threat gap by engineering the MPF vehicle.

While referred to by some as a “light tank” Army officials specify that plans for the new platform seek to engineer a mobile combat platform able to deploy quickly. The MPF represents an Army push toward more expeditionary warfare and rapid deployability. Therefore it is no surprise that two MPFs are being built to fit on an Air Force C-17 aircraft.

Rapid deployability is of particular significance in areas such as Europe where Russian forces for instance might be in closer proximity to US or NATO forces.

Tactically speaking given that IBCTs are likely to face drones armed with precision weapons armored vehicle columns advancing with long-range targeting technology and artillery infantry on-the-move needs to have firepower and sensors sufficient to outmatch an advanced enemy.

All of these factors are indicative of how concepts of Combined Arms Maneuver are evolving to account for how different land war is expected to be moving forward. This reality underscores the reason infantry needs tank-like firepower to cross bridges travel off-road and keep pace with advancing forces.

Designs specs and requirements for the emerging vehicle are now being evaluated by Army weapons developers currently analyzing industry submissions in response to a Request for Proposal released many months ago.

The service expects to award two Engineering Manufacturing and Development (EMD) deals by 2019 as part of an initial step to building prototypes from multiple vendors service officials said. Army statement said initial prototypes are expected within 14 months of a contract award.

While requirements and particular material solutions are expected to adjust as the programs move forward there are some initial sketches of the capabilities the Army seeks for the vehicle.

According to a report from Globalsecurity.org “the main gun has to be stabilized for on-the-move firing while the optics and fire control system should support operations at all weather conditions including night operations.”

BAE Systems and General Dynamics Land Systems are among the industry competitors seeking to build the new MPF. It is be no means surprising that given the ongoing competition industry competitors are reluctant to discuss details of their respective offerings.

For the Army the effort involves what could be described as a dual-pronged acquisition strategy in that it seeks to leverage currently available or fast emerging technology while engineered the vehicle with an architecture such that it can integrate new weapons and systems as they emerge over time.

An estimation of technologies likely to figure prominently in the MPF developmental process leads towards the use of lightweight armor composites active protection systems and a new generation of higher-resolution targeting sensors. Smith explained how this initiative is already gaining considerable traction.

This includes the rapid incorporation of greater computer automation and AI designed to enable one sensor to perform the functions of many sensors in real-time. For instance it’s by no means beyond the imagination to envision high-resolution forward-looking infrared (FLIR) sensors electromagnetic weapons and EO-IR cameras operating through a single sensor.

“The science is how do I fuse them together? How do I take multiple optical infrared and electromagnetic sensors and use them all at once in real-time ” Smith said.

“If you are out in the desert in an operational setting infrared alone may be constrained heat so you need all types of sensors together and machines can help us sift through information” added Smith.

In fact the Army’s Communications Electronics Research Development and Engineering Center (CERDEC) is already building prototype sensors - with this in mind. In particular this early work is part of a longer-range effort to inform the Army’s emerging Next-Generation Comat Vehicle (NGCV). The NGCV expected to become an entire fleet of armored vehicles is now being explored as something to emerge in the late 2020s or early 2030s.

One of the key technical challenges when it comes to engineering a mobile yet lethal weapon is to build a cannon both powerful and lightweight enough to meet speed lethality and deployability requirements.

U.S. Army’s Combat Vehicle Modernization Strategy specifically cites the need to bring large caliber cannon technology to lightweight vehicles. Among other things the strategy cites a lightweight 120mm gun called the XM360 – built for the now-cancelled Future Combat Systems Mounted Combat System. While the weapon is now being thought of as something for NGCV or a future tank variant its technology bears great relevance to the MPF effort – which seeks to maximize lightweight mobile firepower.

Special new technology was needed for the XM360 in order to allow a lighter-weight cannon and muzzle to accommodate the blast from a powerful 120mm tank round.

Elements of the XM360 include a combined thermal and environmental shroud blast deflector a composite-built overwrapped gun tube-modular gun-mount independent recoil brakes gas-charged recuperators and a multi-slug slide block breech with an electric actuator Army MCS developmental documents describe.

A retired CEO of Campbell Mithun once Minneapolis' largest advertising agency Dunlap befriended everyone from CEOs of huge corporations to his employees at every level.

""He could converse with anyone from a janitor to a billionaire"" said his wife JoAnne Pastel of Wayzata. ""You could put him in any setting and he was able to relate and people loved him.""

""When he was starting out at Campbell Mithun he had pictures and names of everybody in the company and would memorize what people looked like and learn maybe one thing about them just to get to know everybody"" said daughter Brenda Dunlap of Minnetrista.

He dressed casually — ""no socks a ripped sweater and like a trucker's hat on his head"" Brenda said. ""He was down to earth — even after he had all this success in business he was not pretentious.""

He ""cared deeply for every employee at Campbell Mithun"" said Steve Gordon of St. Louis Park who worked with Dunlap at the agency for more than 30 years. ""He'd be down in the mailroom every other day to talk to the guy who delivered the mail the guy who moved the furniture.""

Dunlap died of kidney disease on Jan. 8 in a hospital and surrounded by family. He was 83.

He grew up in Austin Minn. and attended Carleton College in Northfield Minn. where he majored in political science and worked at the post office. He married his first wife Lois-Mary Apple Dunlap in 1965. They later divorced and he married Pastel.

He graduated in 1960 and took a job as a marketing and sales executive at Procter & Gamble in Cincinnati. In 1968 he was recruited by the United States Postal Service to serve as an assistant postmaster general. He designed several iconic postage stamps including one featuring astronaut Neil Armstrong stepping onto the moon.

Amid some of the hype surrounding the metaverse I was struck by a Washington Post profile of Tim Sweeney CEO of Epic Games creator of Fortnite. The article included this synopsis of Tim’s vision for brands and the metaverse:

“The metaverse … would be an expansive digitized communal space where users can mingle freely with brands and one another in ways that permit self-expression and spark joy…

“It would not be the manicured ad-laden news feed presented by platforms like Facebook.”

As brand teams think about how to experiment with the metaverse there’s a risk of marketing myopia. From inside a marketing team it can be easy to imagine that consumers are just waiting to “mingle freely” with their brand. Marketers sometimes over-inflate just how much people think about brands or want to engage with them.

I saw this type of marketing myopia as a General Mills summer intern years ago. That summer the cereal division debuted an entire Theme Park focused on General Mills cereal brands inside the Mall of America. It was called Cereal Adventure and it featured a two-story Lucky Charms slide cereal-themed games educational offerings about how cereal is made and a chance to walk through a mock cereal factory. All cereal all the time. So confident in the appeal to “cereal fans” they even charged admission.

It turned out that visitors didn’t really care about cereal brands and the making of cereal as much as cereal marketers thought they would. The project was shelved a year or two later (although I still have a Wheaties box with my picture on it somewhere).

I see some of the mindset behind Cereal Adventure in how some marketing teams talk about their brands’ surefire appeal in the metaverse. This type of marketing myopia also appeared in the early days of brands on Facebook and every newer social media platform that came along.

Whether building a world or dropping a brand experience into an existing platform it’s important to keep in perspective the actual role of the brand in people’s lives. Ultimately brands have to meet people where they are.

Preservationists Fight to Save a Grain Elevator in Buffalo (Published 2022),"BUFFALO — At first glance the hulking brick building on the edge of Lake Erie looks like another decaying relic of Buffalo’s once-prosperous past an image made all the worse by an enormous gash in its exterior the victim of this city’s raking winter winds.

But to the trained and loving eye the building — the Great Northern grain elevator — is a beauty a testament to ingenious engineering and turn-of-the-century chutzpah whose utility and aesthetic profoundly influenced generations of architects.

“These were the kind of cathedrals of the modern age” said Gregory Delaney a clinical assistant professor at the University at Buffalo’s architecture school noting the elevator’s unique blend of function and technology. “It’s a building that is at the same scale as a great medieval cathedral with a similar kind of monumental power.”

So it is with no small amount of consternation for grain-elevator aficionados that the building’s current owner — Archer Daniels Midland Milling Co. part of the farm and food products giant — has been pushing to demolish the Great Northern setting off a furious fight between preservationists and the company. It has also placed Buffalo’s mayor Byron Brown in the unenviable position of either allowing the destruction of a local landmark or defying a valued local employer.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiQWh0dHBzOi8vbmoxMDE1LmNvbS9iaWctam9lLWhlbnJ5LXNoYXJlcy1oaXMtYmVzdC1qb2ItaGUtZXZlci1oYWQv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Big Joe Henry shares his best job he ever had,"National DJ Day was this week.

People in my previous industry thought I had lost my mind how could I give up that job that everyone wanted the great apartment and lifestyle. I threw it all away and never doubted myself for a minute. Playing the hits is the best job I've ever had. When you have a passion for music and entertaining and those worlds collide it is a great pleasure to have that as your job.

When I got back on the radio I knew I would start back at the bottom and work my way back up and let me tell you something working at the bottom of radio is tough. When you’re at the bottom the money sucks the hours are horrendous and it’s virtually a thankless job but all that’s okay because you get to play the hits. As you rise up from the bottom the money gets a little bit better the hours become a little steadier you have a little more confidence and you’re playing great music while working hard at honing your craft. Life is good.

LOOK: Food history from the year you were born From product innovations to major recalls Stacker researched what happened in food history every year since 1921 according to news and government sources.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiPGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmVhdHRoaXMuY29tL25ld3Mtd29yc3QtZm9vZC1yZWNhbGxzLW9mLWFsbC10aW1lL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,The 7 Worst Food Recalls of All Time — Eat This Not That,"Food safety issues occur more frequently than you might think especially in recent times with an increase of 125% in grocery recalls in recent years. And while the risks may be fairly benign (think: a gluten-free product that may have come into contact with wheat during manufacturing) some contaminants can have devastating—even deadly—consequences for consumers. The Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) estimates that foodborne illness from infectious pathogens or harmful chemicals causes 48 million people to get sick each year with 148000 hospitalizations and 3000 deaths on average.

The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) categorizes product recalls based on the potential severity of effects. The least serious is a Class III recall with minimal risk for adverse health consequences. Class II means that the effects of exposure or use can lead to temporary or reversible health consequences. Class I is the most severe marked when ""there is a reasonable probability that the use of or exposure to a violative product will cause serious adverse health consequences or death.""

The upside is that these incidents have called companies to higher scrutiny of their production processes has led to stricter rules and regulations such as granting the FDA the ability to authorize mandatory recalls in 2018 and fueled a larger effort to educate the public on how to practice safer food preparation.

But tragically there have been dozens of Class I product recalls in the past decades that caused hundreds of illnesses and some deaths to consumers. These are seven of the most catastrophic food recalls in grocery history.

Listeria Outbreak at Sara Lee

Around 15 million pounds of Sara Lee meat was recalled in 1998 for contamination with Listeria a bacteria that when ingested can cause infection in the bloodstream for pregnant women and immunocompromised groups. Distributed from one Bill Mar plant hot dogs and deli meats carrying the bacteria infected 101 people and caused six miscarriages and 15 deaths.

Further investigation revealed a high likelihood that the outbreak was preventable. According to the Chicago Tribune management at the Sara Lee plant was aware of the presence of Listeria in their meat since 1997 reporting that ""workers were instructed to keep laboratory test results in a special file 'that was to be withheld from the USDA.'"" The company pleaded guilty to the victims' class-action lawsuit in 2001 paying out $4.4 million according to The New York Times.

E. coli in Spinach

One of the most widespread foodborne illness crises was linked to both bagged and bulk spinach in 2006 when 199 people in 26 states came in contact with a deadly strain of E. coli resulting in 102 hospitalizations and three deaths with 31 people developing a form of kidney failure called hemolytic-uremic syndrome from the infection which can be fatal.

According to the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) this sparked action from the FDA to quickly triage the situation and recall all fresh spinach removing it from stores and restaurants. It also spurred farmers to follow stricter guidelines ensuring better practices to mitigate future outbreaks.

Salmonella at Peanut Corporation of America

In a whopping 46 states a Salmonella Typhimurium outbreak originating at the now-defunct peanut manufacturer Peanut Corporation of America sickened 714 people between 2008 and 2009 according to the CDC. Contaminated peanut butter peanut paste and more than 2800 other peanut products sold by companies using PCA ingredients were pulled from shelves and recalled by the FDA. Executives at the company had prior knowledge of the outbreak and ""chose to distribute the food regardless"" Food Processing reported.

Shortly after in 2011 the Food Safety Modernization Act was signed into law introducing regulations within the FDA aimed at preventing rather than simply responding to adverse food processing incidents – partially in response to this calamitous health violation.

Listeria Outbreak at Jensen Farms

In 2011 cantaloupes traced back to Jensen Farms caused one of the most deadly outbreaks of Listeria. Investigators called the outbreak ""preventable"" when they found that the company had discontinued using an antimicrobial wash that led to the cross-contamination according to CNN. 6254a4d1642c605c54bf1cab17d50f1e

In total Food Safety News reported 147 illnesses across 28 states 43 deaths and one infection-induced miscarriage. The Jensen Brothers reached a settlement with the victims in October 2013 and filed their farm for bankruptcy.

Mad Cow Disease in Westland-Hallmark Meat Company

Perhaps the most disturbing case in food production history is the Westland-Hallmark Meat Company scandal in 2008 when the largest beef recall was ordered for safety risks linked to animal abuse at the facility. The company was once the primary ground beef supplier to schools through the National School Lunch Program.

The New York Times reported that 143 million pounds of beef were part of a Class II recall due to concerns of mad cow disease from the meat company's ""downer cows"" livestock rendered unable to walk from sickness and cruel mistreatment. Mad cow disease can transmit to humans and induce variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease a fatal condition that involves brain tissue degeneration.

Westland-Hallmark Meat Company was charged $497 million in a federal lawsuit according to Food Safety News but the corporation went out of business after losses from the recall.

Hepatitis Linked to Townsend Farms

Pomegranate seeds exported from Turkey and used in Townsend Farms Organic Antioxidant Blend were found contaminated with Hepatitis A an infection that can spread through contact with those who contracted the illness and affects the liver in 2013. Food Safety News reported that 162 cases linked to the outbreak occurred in 10 states leading 71 people to be hospitalized.

Townsend Farms published their own press release to confirm the linkage between their product and the infections issuing a voluntary recall of the berry blend. The FDA found no contaminants within the farm's domestic operations.

You can prevent the risk of infection by getting vaccinated against hepatitis A and most who contract the illness recover.

E. coli in General Mills Flour

At a General Mills plant in Kansas City 45 million pounds of flour had to be recalled when consumers were sickened by E. Coli from various packages of Gold Medal Flour Gold Medal Wondra Flour and Signature Kitchens Flour according to Food Safety News.

The first recall took place on May 31 2016 but the company had to expand their recall twice on July 1 and July 25 when investigators found that multiple flour batches were linked to confirmed outbreak victims.

Across 24 states 63 people fell ill with 17 hospitalized and one developing hemolytic-uremic syndrome said the CDC. Fortunately no deaths were reported. Around this time General Mills warned consumers to avoid eating or contaminating other foods with raw flour.

Detroit's automakers have brought a surprisingly conservative financial strategy to making EVs the next vehicle of choice for American consumers. They're paying cash. General Motors and Ford are investing $65 billion between them – $35 billion at GM and $30 billion for Ford – and so far don't propose to borrow any of it. Instead the most radical change in auto products in a century is being paid for out of the companies' operating cash flow – seriously reducing the risk to the companies over time and for now boosting their stock prices. ""The short answer is that they are doing it because they can"" said Nishit Madlani automotive sector lead at bond rating agency Standard and Poor's. ""The popularity of trucks [since the pandemic began] and strong pricing is giving them confidence."" Detroit's aggressive investment and conservative financing has been years in the making. It has been aided by $4 billion borrowed by GM in May 2020 and by Ford drawing down a revolving credit line by $15 billion around the same time moves intended to cushion a feared sales implosion from Covid-19. As sales declined more modestly than feared in 2020 and then began to bounce back in 2021 cash flow remained strong taking the companies' stock prices higher and letting Ford repay high-interest debt. At the same time both companies held on to cash by suspending dividends and share repurchases. And the companies have cut billions in annual costs by slashing whole lines of unprofitable sedans withdrawing from unprofitable markets overseas and focusing tightly on trucks which remain the most profitable part of their business. Put all of this together and the two biggest native-born U.S. automakers have the cash to take on the industry's biggest technological transformation since its founding.

Record auto profits record car prices

""Auto manufacturers are expecting record profits once we get through supply chain issues and chip shortages which we expect to last most of this year"" CFRA Research analyst Garrett Nelson said. ""The existing business is good and the driver is car prices at a record high."" The Detroit 2's financing strategy stands in stark contrast to how Tesla  then a start-up financed its push into EVs over the last decade. The EV leader repeatedly raised money from the stock and bond markets to pay for its plans filing paperwork with federal regulators for $10 billion in stock sales as recently as 2020. Tesla's first EV factory in California was financed with a loan that was federally guaranteed in 2010 when the EV market was nascent before the company went public or had material revenue. GM and Ford are ready to spend even more. ""If anything it will go up from there"" a Ford spokesman said. The U.S. car market's bounce back to nearly 15 million units sold in 2021 provided the financial cushion Detroit needed to push forward aggressively according to Nelson. The collapse was not nearly as large as the one that accompanied the 2008 financial crisis when the U.S. passenger vehicle market fell to slightly more than 10 million cars and trucks. The brief shallow dip helped assure that the war chests of the two companies were big enough to meet the need for billions of dollars in new investment Madlani said. ""We prepared for the known and the unknown"" said the Ford spokesman. ""The unknown part was the pandemic. The known was that we needed to be a leader in electric vehicles.'' The sales rebound while still well below pre-pandemic pace has translated into $7.8 billion in free cash flow over the nine months that ended in September at Ford. At GM where automotive operations barely broke even on operating cash flow in the first nine months of 2020 liquidity was still strong enough to let the company spend more than $4 billion on capital expenditures. GM is due to report fourth-quarter results on Feb. 1 with Ford set to announce its results Feb. 3. Analysts expect Ford to report profits of 42 cents a share on $35.8 billion of revenue up 75% since the September quarter according to Thomson Reuters data. GM is forecasted to earn $1.11 a share down from $1.52 in the third quarter. GM raised its own forecast for the full year in December saying it will earn $14 billion in earnings before interest and taxes up from $11.5 billion to $13.5 billion it had previously predicted. Ford and GM profits have held up even though U.S. industry unit sales are off the 17 million-vehicle annual pace before Covid because the companies aggressively cut costs to prepare for the transition Nelson said. Ford got almost entirely out of the business of making sedans for example and GM laid off 4000 salaried workers in 2019. That's in addition to factory closings that included GM's storied Lordstown Ohio plant later sold to EV start-up Lordstown Motors . On top of that the companies are holding plenty of extra cash as a reserve if their cash flow misses forecasts. As long ago as 2019 analysts who spoke warily of all the money Ford needed to invest in its business respectfully noted that it also had $37 billion in cash and short-term securities. Ford now has $46.4 billion and generated more than $12 billion in operating cash in the first nine months of 2021.

Ford GM EV forecasts

Both companies have had plenty to say about financing strategy and EV planning at investor conferences in the last year. The common theme: Building Ford's EV strategy around existing model names like the Mustang and especially the F-150 pickup truck for which the company has garnered 200000 pre-orders is paying off in both customer acceptance and cost containment. ""Within the next 24 months based on the demand on these products [we] would be the number two EV automaker probably close to 600000 EVs a year globally [from Ford's current product lineup] and we don't plan to stop there"" Ford's North American chief operating officer Lisa Drake told a Goldman Sachs-sponsored investor conference in December. ""The complexity of the product in EV space is much less than at [internal combustion engines]. …And that's going to allow us to be more efficient with our capital and more efficient with the labor and the assembly plants."" At GM the EV strategy includes a wave of new vehicles using new and existing nameplates – most recently the company unveiled a $42000 electric version of its Chevrolet Silverado SUV – as well as its Cruise joint venture with Honda Microsoft and other investors to build an EV-centered autonomous-car business.

From stealing patents from independent inventors to building Pintos with explode-happy fuel tanks we've seen it all.

But of all the brazen tomfoolery the Fisher P-75 Eagle program may take the cake. Firstly what exactly does this mostly forgotten prototype interceptor of the Second World War have to do with the American auto industry? The answer requires a little bit of digging through the history books.The Fisher Body Company was an automotive coachbuilder native to Detroit Michigan. Beginning in the early 1910s the company forged a working relationship with General Motors making bodies for all of GM's divisions. Including Chevrolet Buick and Cadillac. Priorities changed with the United State's entry into the Second World War in December 1941. Along with all of its General Motors siblings Fisher had to find something productive towards the war effort to maintain their government contracts.GM factories manufactured tanks weapons and aircraft designed by other companies during this period but not Fisher. Fisher was delegated to something more novel a powerful interceptor that could be built quickly and cheaply.GM determined the best way to achieve this was to forge a design based upon components largely derived from other American planes. The wings were borrowed from the Curtis P-40 Warhawk the bottom section of the fuselage comes from a Vought F4-U Corsair and a tail based on the Douglas SBD Dauntless dive bomber. Quite an ""interesting"" choice of a rear-end if your goal is to build a maneuverable interceptor with ten .50-caliber Browning machine guns as main armament. That's putting it mildly.The overlying idea was that a design thrown together out of spare parts would be cheaper to build than an entire bespoke airframe. In all fairness this practice was nothing new in both the automotive and aeronautical industries. The only problem with such a design is you're going to need something truly special to power it.Fisher decided to use the Alison V-3420 a monstrous 24-cylinder leviathan also from a GM division. The engine was mated to a six-bladed contra-rotating propeller and with over 2500 horsepower on tap nothing in the water-cooled piston-engine category came remotely close to this figure. Even early turbojet engines struggled to make equivalent power numbers at least for a sustained period of time.So then what on Earth went wrong? Well it'd be a bit crass and possibly inaccurate to call it out and out fraud. But at the very least what transpired was Marshal Mathers in 8 Mile levels of shady. Ironic as both Eminem and this plane come from Detroit.Many may not know that by 1944 Fisher's Eagle was starting to bleed the U.S. military budget in a way that was starting to become irritating. Around this time the Army Air Corps politely asked for a section of their production to be dedicated to the Boeing B-29 Superfortress. According to legend the promise of a shiny new all-weather interceptor prototype was enough for the bureaucrats in the U.S. Military to stop paying attention sufficiently. But what is concretely known is not a single Superfortress was ever produced in the GM plant.What was less forgivable was the math on the center of mass being slightly off resulting in an airframe with what was described as having horrendous flight characteristics. The final nail in the coffin was the once hyped Allison engine turning out to be an unreliable maintenance-heavy pig of a powerplant. Only 14 P-75 Eagles ever left Fisher factories eight XP-75s and six P-75AsAll to the tune of a staggering $50 million invested by the Army Air Corps. In 2022 money that's an eye-watering $900000000. Ironically the designations ""P-75"" and ""Eagle"" were explicitly designated for a fighter the American Armed Forces anticipated would be groundbreaking. As it turned out the run-of-the-mill P-51D Mustang and P-47 Thunderbolt was better in just about every respect.Today the sole known survivor of the Fisher Eagle program sits on display in the experimental aircraft section of the National Museum of The United States Air Force in Dayton Ohio. Alongside a litany of other odd-ball aircraft built on the American taxpayer's dime. The Eagle name wouldn't be seen again until the F-15 project thirty years later. This time the Eagle name went to something far more worth while.Check back for more from our trip to the Natiomal Museum of the United States Air Force and so much more right here on autoevolution.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiqwFodHRwczovL3d3dy5sb2NrcG9ydGpvdXJuYWwuY29tL25ld3MvbG9jYWxfbmV3cy9sb2NrcG9ydC1nbS1wbGFudC1yZW5vdmF0aW9uLXRvLWFkZC1qb2JzLWFzLWV2LW1vdG9yLXByb2R1Y3Rpb24tYW5ub3VuY2VkL2FydGljbGVfMjZkNDQyNmEtNDg0NC01ZGQyLWI1MzMtNzk2OWU5YjEyYTFjLmh0bWzSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Lockport GM plant renovation to add jobs as EV motor production announced,"Lockport NY (14094)

The first product rolling of the line is the 2022 GMC Hummer EV Pickup. GM CEO Mary Barra rang the NYSE opening bell from the factory floor the morning of the plant’s opening and President Biden visited for a tour driving the new Hummer. GM stock value rose to $65 per share following the opening. GM later revealed that reservations for the GMC Hummer EV rose considerably in November following the media event.

During the previous GM Investor Day event GM announced several future plans regarding its business strategy and products. It expects to double its revenue by 2030 through new software platforms and connectivity as well as the integration of OnStar Insurance with the vehicle purchase process.

To help ramp up EV production GM has announced a new joint venture with POSCO Chemical to process materials for the automaker’s Ultium batteries. Construction of the Ultium Cells battery plant in Tennessee is currently on schedule. GM is also exploring the possibility of manufacturing EVs in Egypt while increasing its investment into the GM Lake Orion Plant from $160 million to a whopping $1.3 billion for expanded EV production.

Thanks to the incorporation of Ultium batteries and Ultium Drive powertrains in its electric and autonomous vehicle strategy investor firm Tudor Pickering raised its GM stock price target from $75 to $95.

Back in 2020 GM CEO Mary Barra shared the company’s plan to launch a total of 30 new electric vehicles globally by 2025 with a total investment of $7 billion. To put that in perspective 40 percent of GM’s offerings will be fully electric by the end of 2025 compared to just three percent in 2021. GM CEO Mary Barra has also stated that General Motors could catch up to Tesla in EV sales by 2025 while announcing plans to build 40000 new charging stations throughout North America. GM has also made a commitment to phase out fossil fuel vehicles by 2040.

GM previously announced an increase in EV and AV investment with a total of $35 billion earmarked between now and 2025. More recently GM laid out its plans to roll out new software such as the Future Roads data platform enhanced subscription services and the expansion of the OnStar Insurance service to all 50 states by 2022. GM’s Cruise autonomous vehicle brand is expected to rake in $50 billion over the coming years.

On the production front half of all GM North American and Chinese production facilities will be capable of producing electric vehicles by 2030. GM has also announced details for hotly anticipated future products like the Chevy Silverado EV including news that production will ramp up in early 2023.

GM Stock Value Macro Factors – Sales

General Motors has reported its fourth-quarter sales figures headlined by a 43-percent sales decrease in the U.S. down to 440745 units. Sales at all four GM U.S. brands decreased with GM saying that it focused on delivering as many high-demand capacity-constrained products as possible in the face of record-low inventory resulting from the microchip shortage.

GM stock value was up to a record $65.98 per share following the release of GM’s Q4 2021 sales report rising on the news of better-than-expected sales numbers and optimism regarding improvements in the global microchip shortage. Notably General Motors is no longer the number-one automaker in the U.S. in terms of sales ceding the position to Toyota after a 90-year streak.

GM also sold nearly 400000 units of the MINI EV hatchback in China last year making it the best-selling electric vehicle in the market.

General Motors previously reported its third-quarter sales figures headlined by a 33-percent decrease in sales in the U.S. down to 446997 units. Sales decreased at all four of GM’s U.S. brands. GM cites supply disruptions resulting from the ongoing global microchip shortage but added that supplies are “improving.”

GM Stock Value Macro Factors – Earnings

GM’s Q3 2021 earnings were headlined by $2.4 billion in income on $26.8 billion in revenue a 40-percent decline in income and 25-percent decline in revenue. Investors reacted with disappointment to the automaker’s 2021 profit forecast in the wake of the ongoing global microchip shortage and increasing commodity prices. Some good news on the manufacturing front though as GM has raised its profit outlook on the back of an improvement to the microchip shortage. GM is now running overtime at some U.S. plants as microchip supplies continue to show some improvement.

Previously GM’s Q2 2021 earnings results were headlined by $2.8 billion in income on $34.2 billion in revenue. The figures represent a 450-percent jump in income and 103-percent increase in revenue.

Earlier in 2021 GM reported its Q1 2021 earnings including $3 billion on $32.5 billion in revenue a 900-percent jump in income and 0.6 percent decrease in revenue compared to Q1 of 2020. GM stated that the earnings were driven by strong price and mix performance in North America as well as strong credit and residual value performance at GM Financial and industry recovery in China.

GM Stock Value Macro Factors – Products

GM stock value was on the rise recently with the introduction of several new GM EVs in conjunction with the 2022 Consumer Electronics Show highlighted by the 2024 Chevy Silverado EV. GM stock value rose to a record high of $67.21 per share following a keynote speech delivered by GM CEO Mary Barra. Following the event Barra indicated that reservations for the Silverado EV RST First Edition were filled in just 12 minutes. Further announcements at CES 2022 included the Chevy Equinox EV and Cadillac InnerSpace AV concept.

Previously General Motors unveiled several new concepts at the 2021 SEMA Show in Las Vegas including the Chevy Beast off-roading concept the all-electric Chevy Project X and the Silverado High Country Midnight concept.

Earlier in 2021 GM debuted the fully refreshed 2022 GMC Sierra 1500 which includes two new trim levels new styling the latest technology features and more. GM also recently unveiled the new Chevrolet Performance ZZ632 crate engine as well as the new 2023 Chevy Corvette Z06 sports car.

GM is now offering the BrightDrop EV600 all-electric light commercial vehicle. The new van is the fastest-developed vehicle in GM history. The EV600 will be joined by the smaller BrightDrop EV410. Merchant Fleet recently placed an order for 5400 units of the new EV410.

On the software front GM debuted its new Ultifi end-to-end software platform designed to provide the latest upgrades and features to future GM vehicles via over-the-air updates.

Even more critical is the debut of the refreshed 2022 Chevy Silverado 1500 which introduces a raft of changes and updates over the preceding 2021 model year and pre-refresh 2022 Chevy Silverado 1500 Limited such as an all-new interior updated technology and the new Silverado ZR2 off-roader.

GM stock values rose considerably in April driven primarily by confirmation of an upcoming all-electric iteration of the popular Chevy Silverado pickup truck. GM stock value hit a record high of $63.44 per share following the announcement surpassing the $64 mark the second week of June and setting a new record for the “new GM.”

Cadillac dealerships are now preparing for the arrival of the Lyriq and future all-electric Cadillac models with a slew of upgrades. The new Lyriq is expected to enter production at the end of March.

What’s more GM announced the new Ultra Cruise autonomous driving system which promises true “door-to-door hands-free driving” capabilities in 95 percent of all driving scenarios with plans to eventually make the system available on every paved road in the U.S. and Canada.

GM Stock Value Macro Factors – Events

The global microchip shortage continues affecting GM stock value by impacting production vehicle supply and pricing. A recent analysis predicts that the shortage may end up costing the global auto industry upwards of $210 billion in lost revenue almost twice what was originally forecast. General Motors president Mark Reuss has indicated that he expects the microchip supply to stabilize at a lower level than desired for full recovery. General Motors is also currently gearing up to make significant changes to its supply chain in the hopes of avoiding future shortages. That includes the development of new microcontrollers.

In the meantime GM has announced that it has shipped pickup truck models stockpiled per the automaker’s “build-shy” strategy. SAIC-GM-Wuling has announced that it is developing its own microchips which could help to soften the blow of future chip shortages. GM CFO Paul Jacobson also indicated that the chip supply is expected to even out sometime next year as suppliers catch up to demand. Experts are now predicting that the semiconductor crisis could last in 2023.

It was previously reported that GM is stockpiling unfinished vehicles waiting for new chips to arrive in a “build-shy” strategy intended to keep production rolling. Additionally GM is building select units of the 2021 Chevy Silverado 1500 and 2021 GMC Sierra 1500 without certain fuel-saving technologies as a result of the shortage including automatic engine stop-start. More recently however GM announced that production of the 3.0L I6 LM2 turbodiesel Duramax engine for GM’s full-size SUV lineup had resumed.

An emergency funding proposal earmarks $52 billion to support domestic chip production including funds to support construction of 10 new semiconductor chip plants. The bill previously passed the U.S. Senate.

GM has announced that it will retrofit models affected by the deletion of certain comfort features as a result of the chip shortage including heated seats and heated steering wheels only to retrofit those features at a later date.

Looking ahead strong demand for new cars is expected to continue in 2022 while new vehicle incentives are down to a five-year low amid low inventory.

GM Stock Value Micro Factors

The General previously announced that LG Electronics Inc. has agreed to over $1.9 billion of the $2 billion in costs associated with the replacement of the recalled Chevy Bolt EV and Chevy Bolt EUV battery packs. General Motors has also announced a new battery software update for the recalled Chevy Bolt EV and EUV. However a lawsuit against the automaker was recently filed regarding the recall. GM has announced that production downtime for the Chevy Bolt EV and EUV will be extended through February.

GM previously announced that it will replace the battery modules on roughly 50000 units of the 2017 though 2019 Chevy Bolt EV affected by a potential fire risk. The automaker later decided to extend the battery replacement on all model years of the Bolt EV in addition to the all-new Bolt EUV. Despite the fault laying with battery producer LG Energy Solution GM CEO Mary Barra announced that GM will continue its relationship with LG going forward.

Several other GM recalls have also been announced in recent months the most significant of which involves roof rail airbags that could rupture in more than 400000 units of the Chevy Silverado and GMC Sierra followed by a block heater cable short circuit issue in some 330000 units of the Silverado HD and Sierra HD.

In political news General Motors voiced support for the EPA’s proposed emissions rule changes. GM also indicated that it is on track to hit carbon neutrality for its U.S. operations by 2025 five years earlier than originally announced. The Biden administration has proposed a new EV incentive offering point-of-sale rebates on new electric vehicles while also outlining a plan to build-out the nationwide EV charging infrastructure. California can once again set its own emissions guidelines while the Biden administration is urging automakers to ensure that their vehicle lineups consist of at least 40 percent EVs by 2030. Biden also recently signed an executive order calling for an end to the purchase of fossil fuel fleet vehicles by 2035 while the finalization of stricter emissions requirements is expected to speed up electric vehicle adoption.

The greater auto industry including the UAW workers union and major manufacturers like General Motors have called on President Biden to roll out tax credits and incentives to drive EV sales. The latest is that the Biden Administration plans to roll out a $100 billion plan for new EV rebates.

GM stock value recently fell following the announcement that Dan Ammann was stepping down as CEO of the GM-backed autonomous vehicle startup Cruise. Ammann’s departure was the second high-profile executive shakeup in a week following the departure of GM innovation head Pam Fletcher.

Stock Performance Year-To-Date

GM stock value increased considerably over the course of 2021 only to later rescind some of those gains and fall below the $50-per-share mark. Now GM stock value is back on the rise hovering around the $55- to $60-per-share mark in December before breaking into record highs in January peaking at $67.21 following CES 2022.

General Motors 2022 Stock Value YTD Month Opening Value January 3rd $59.87

GM stock value dipped through the month of May but reached $64 per share the second week of June setting a new record for the “new GM.”

GM stock value began to slide around mid-June dipping below the $60-per-share mark in July. In September GM stock value remained around $50-per-share rising considerably in the first few weeks of October. Now GM stock value is back on the rise in November settling around $60 per share in December. As of January 2022 GM stock value has settled around the low $60-per-share mark.

Already approved in the hospital setting the agency expanded remdesivir's indication to include individuals ages 12 and up (who weigh 40 kg or more) with mild to moderate COVID-19 who are at high risk of progressing to severe COVID-19.

In addition the FDA revised the drug's emergency use authorization to include pediatric patients younger than age 12 who weigh at least 3.5 kg (but under 40 kg) at high risk of progressing to severe disease.

Patrizia Cavazzoni MD director of the FDA's Center for Drug Evaluation and Research said in a statement that the expanded indications would help ""respond to the surge of the Omicron variant.""

High-risk adult and pediatric patients can receive the treatment ""outside of a traditional inpatient hospital setting including at skilled nursing facilities home healthcare settings and outpatient facilities such as infusion centers"" Cavazzoni added.

NIH's COVID guidelines which were revised in late December recommend a 3-day course of remdesivir as a third option behind the oral antiviral nirmatrelvir-ritonavir (Paxlovid) and the IV monoclonal antibody sotrovimab. They cited data from the PINETREE study which demonstrated an 87% relative risk reduction in COVID-related hospitalizations with remdesivir.

FDA's expanded indication was based on this phase III trial as well. Among 562 non-hospitalized high-risk patients with mild to moderate COVID in the study 0.7% required hospitalization with remdesivir versus 5.3% with placebo (P=0.008). There were no deaths in either group the agency noted.

The FDA said that possible side effects include increased levels of liver enzymes which could be a sign of liver injury and ""allergic reactions which may include changes in blood pressure and heart rate low blood oxygen level fever shortness of breath wheezing"" rash nausea sweating or shivering and swelling around the eyes and under the skin.

Gilead Sciences noted in a statement that the safety profile for remdesivir was similar as that of placebo with the most common treatment-related adverse events (reported in 5% or more patients) being nausea and headache.

This 3-day course is for COVID outpatients only Gilead added as hospitalized patients not on mechanical ventilation or extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) should receive a 5-day course of the drug and critically ill patients should receive a 10-day course.

In terms of supply Gilead said they will ""enable outpatient ordering in a tiered approach that will start with hospital outpatient departments due to their experience and familiarity with the administration of Veklury; then outpatient ordering will be available to other qualified outpatient facilities.""

The money is supposed to fund both mitigation and adaptation in developing countries which reduce emissions and help residents cope with expected climate impacts. But even this gets murky—and not just because no single organization tracks the projects that are funded. The other problem is that countries define mitigation and adaptation differently. Yes money that goes toward the installation of solar panels or the erection of seawalls feels clear cut. But what about the building of new roads which have been labeled by some countries as “climate-relevant” or as was included in Japan’s tally in 2017 funding for “cleaner” coal plants in Bangladesh? This is why Oxfam estimates that true climate-related finance has been significantly overreported.

The balance between adaptation and mitigation is also fraught. Adaptation is notoriously harder to fund particularly from private sources—likely because those projects tend to mostly benefit local residents and don’t generate significant profits. In 2019 for example just 25 percent of climate finance went toward adaptation.

Whether these projects are ultimately successful at achieving their goals is another data problem. Not only is success project-specific—ranging from say emissions reductions to the prevention of climate gentrification—but also data on outcomes remains challenging to collect and often lags years behind.

Did last year’s COP26 in Glasgow help address any of the current obstacles?

The $100 billion broken promise certainly loomed large and some countries took the opportunity to up their commitments. For example ahead of Glasgow President Joe Biden proposed $11.4 billion in annual U.S. climate funding by 2024 but that requires congressional approval which remains far from a sure thing. It’s also still only a portion of what is actually owed: The United States has emitted a quarter of all historical emissions according to estimates from the World Resources Institute and should pay as much as 47 percent of that $100 billion per year.

At COP26 developing countries also demanded additional money for “loss and damage”—the costs accrued from climate impacts beyond what could be adapted to—but no specific funding promise was made. (There were some inroads thankfully on increasing the share of adaptation finance.) Countries also attempted to remedy some of the data dilemmas with new transparency and tracking requirements but again failed to nail down uniform definitions on what counts as climate finance. At best wealthy nations suggested that the $100 billion target would likely be met by 2023 and that funding should increase from there.

How much do developing nations truly need for climate adaptation?

The $100 billion per year was always a starting point that would increase over time. And that’s good because the U.N.’s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) estimates that developing nations will need as much as $300 billion per year just for adaptation by decade’s end. The IPCC’s estimates for the world economy to transition to clean energy at the pace required to keep warming within the 1.5 degree Celsius threshold put the cost at up to $3.8 trillion annually by 2050. And that’s still trillions less than a worst-case climate scenario.

So why does the $100 billion remain so important?

NRDC’s Guy calls the $100 billion a pragmatic political and ethical imperative. The whole world needs to transition away from fossil fuels—and fast if we’re to keep warming below 1.5 degrees Celsius. But developing countries don’t always have the resources to do so or doing so may require them to trade off short-term economic gains that could be made through keeping older polluting infrastructure in play. The money is a pragmatic necessity to reduce emissions quickly enough and protect people in the process.

Politically not meeting the $100 billion goal represents a significant breach of global trust when climate action requires steadfast international cooperation.

Most importantly rich nations have an ethical responsibility to fix the crisis they caused. “There is a clear and compelling moral case to help countries most at risk such as small islands and countries that have contributed virtually nothing to the problem in terms of emissions” Guy says. Investing $100 billion per year represents the bare minimum toward righting such a catastrophic wrong.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVmh0dHBzOi8vbW9uZXl3ZWVrLmNvbS9lY29ub215L3Blb3BsZS82MDQzNjkvcHJvZmlsZS1vZi1ndWlsbGF1bWUtcG91c2F6LW9mLWNoZWNrb3V0Y29t0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Guillaume Pousaz of Checkout.com: the surfer dude catching the fintech wave,"Few children dream of becoming payments processors. Guillaume Pousaz certainly did not says The Sunday Times. Growing up in Switzerland he thought he might become an investment banker but in 2005 dropped out of university in Lausanne to pursue his love of surfing in California taking a job with the processing firm International Payment Consultants when he ran out of cash. “I didn’t choose payments – payments chose me.”

Having spent the past decade surfing the gold rush of the fintech revolution Pousaz is now worth an estimated $19bn and his start-up Checkout.com – valued at $40bn in a funding round last week – is now the third most valuable private tech company in the world having almost tripled in value from 2021. It’s a shot in the arm for London where the company is based and for the UK’s thriving fintech industry says The Times. But it’s another blow for the financial establishment. Checkout which handles back-end payment processing for clients including Netflix Sony Pizza Hut and the crypto exchange Coinbase cruised past NatWest Britain’s fourth-biggest bank in value.

An adventurous mindset

Almost as remarkable says The Daily Telegraph is that unlike many highly valued start-ups Checkout is actually profitable and apparently refreshingly immune to hype. “You want to stay normal you want to stay humble” says Pousaz 40 who makes a point of flying economy on family holidays. That clearly has the power to persuade. For the first seven years of its life Checkout “flew under the radar” says CNBC: the company grew without venture capital. When Pousaz finally came to tap external finance in 2019 raising $230m from Insight Partners and DST Global the deal was agreed over handshakes.

How did a young surfer come to gauge and then grab a leading position in finance’s hottest market? Pouzas credits his “very curious and adventurous” mindset at the time which was sharpened by California’s “creative technology-first culture” says CNBC. Having learnt the ropes of the business at International Payments he saw the potential of the ecommerce market which “even in those early days… was growing at 20% year over year” and concluded that digital commerce and payments “would be the key to unlocking the next phase of global economic growth”. Legacy providers such as his employer didn’t seem to get the plot.

More techfin than fintech

Two years after going it alone in 2009 Pousaz spent $350000 acquiring a small Mauritius-based company with a licence to clear transactions through the Mastercard and Visa networks says The Daily Telegraph. He chose to move it to London because of “the Financial Conduct Authority’s embrace of financial technology” – joining a growing brotherhood of “adolescent fintechs” including Revolut and Wise who he says habitually used each others’ services “instead of the bank that you’re fighting on a day-to-day basis”. Pousaz attributes Checkout’s success to its focus on technology: “We are more techfin than fintech”. But the company’s big break came when it signed a transformational global customer Netflix in 2018.

An indefatigable globetrotter Pousaz who currently lives in Dubai (but has plans to relocate his family to London) reckons he spent 750 hours a year on planes before the pandemic and regularly works a punishing 80-hour week. That’s unlikely to change as he contemplates a big push into the US – funded by the $1bn raised last week – and an eventual float says The Daily Telegraph. Pousaz likes to relax by playing the board-game Risk with his children. Although all that “territory-conquering” must surely feel a bit like a busman’s holiday.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiSGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNiYy5jYS9uZXdzL3dvcmxkL3VrcmFpbmUtcnVzc2lhLXRlbnNpb25zLXNhdHVyZGF5LTEuNjMyNDIxNtIBIGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNiYy5jYS9hbXAvMS42MzI0MjE2?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,U.S. supports Estonia Latvia and Lithuania sending 'defensive equipment' to Ukraine,"The Baltic nations of Estonia Latvia and Lithuania plan to send U.S.-made anti-tank and anti-aircraft missiles to Ukraine in a move that the United States fully endorsed Saturday amid Kyiv's escalating tensions with Russia.

The defence ministers of the three Baltic states said in a joint statement published late Friday that they ""stand united in our commitment to Ukraine's sovereignty and territorial integrity in face of continued Russian aggression.""

In another development the British government accused Russia of seeking to replace Ukraine's government with a pro-Moscow administration and said former Ukrainian lawmaker Yevheniy Murayev is being considered as a potential candidate.

Murayev is head of the small pro-Russian party Nashi which currently has no seats in Ukraine's parliament.

Britain's Foreign Office named several other Ukrainian politicians it said had links with Russian intelligence services.

It's unclear what means Britain believes Russia might use to install a friendly government in Kyiv. The U.K. government made the claim based on an intelligence assessment without providing evidence to back it up.

U.S. salutes Estonia Latvia and Lithuania

U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said in a tweet that Washington saluted the three NATO nations and former Soviet republics ""for their longstanding support to Ukraine.""

""I expedited and authorized and we fully endorse transfers of defensive equipment @NATO Allies Estonia Latvia Lithuania are providing to Ukraine to strengthen its ability to defend itself against Russia's unprovoked and irresponsible aggression"" Blinken said in another tweet.

Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov earlier this week described the West supplying arms to Ukraine as extremely dangerous and said the shipments ""do nothing to reduce tensions.""

Also Saturday the U.S. Embassy in Kyiv said the first shipment of a $200-million US security support package for Ukraine had arrived in the Ukrainian capital. Some of that shipment included ""ammunition for the front line defenders of Ukraine"" according to a tweet from the embassy.

Moscow has amassed tens of thousands of troops near the Russia-Ukraine border leading to fears of an invasion.

The West has rejected Moscow's main demands — promises from NATO that Ukraine will never be added as a member that no alliance weapons will be deployed near Russian borders and that it will pull back its forces from central and eastern Europe.

A meeting Friday between Blinken and Russian Foreign Affairs Minister Sergey Lavrov ended with no breakthrough.

Amid the uncertain security situation the U.S. State Department has been considering a range of options to ensure the safety and security of the U.S. Embassy in Kyiv and its employees by moving to reduce its diplomatic presence there.

Anti-tank weapons anti-aircraft missiles en route

The defence ministers of the Baltic states said in their statement that Estonia would provide Ukraine with Javelin anti-tank weapons while Latvia and Lithuania were sending Stinger anti-aircraft missiles and other related equipment to bolster Kyiv's defensive military capabilities.

It wasn't immediately clear when the weapons and equipment would be sent to Ukraine.

""Today Ukraine is at the forefront of separating Europe from the military conflict with Russia. Let's face it — the war in Ukraine is ongoing and it is important to support Ukraine in every way we can so that they can resist the aggressor"" Estonian Minister of Defence Kalle Laanet said.

Estonia is also seeking Germany's approval to send Soviet-made howitzers — which once belonged to East Germany — to Ukraine. Estonia acquired the howitzers from non-NATO member Finland which in turn had bought them from Germany's military surplus supply in the 1990s.

The German government said Friday that it was considering Estonia's request to pass the howitzers on to Ukraine but gave no timeline for a decision. Berlin said it planned to co-ordinate the issue with Finland which has received a similar approval request from Estonia.

Berlin routinely demands a say when German-sold weapons are transferred to third countries. But some recent media reports suggested German Chancellor Olaf Scholz's cabinet could block Estonia's transfer of weapons to Kyiv highlighting divisions in the West's response to the Ukraine crisis.

Ukrainian Foreign Affairs Minister Dmytro Kuleba alleged Saturday that Germany was not showing adequate support for Ukraine.

Kuleba said in a Twitter post that the weapons transfer issue and remarks by German Foreign Affairs Minister Annalena Baerbock expressing skepticism about cutting off Russia from the SWIFT global payments system ""do not correspond to the level of our relations and the current security situation.""

Also Saturday the Ukrainian Foreign Ministry summoned the German ambassador to object to recently circulated video in which the head of the German navy said that Ukraine would not regain the Crimean Peninsula which Russia annexed in 2014.

U.S. citizens warned not to visit Ukraine

The U.S. State Department is currently warning U.S. citizens not to visit Ukraine due to the coronavirus pandemic and potential Russian aggression.

Speculation that an announcement about the U.S. diplomatic presence in Ukraine may be imminent has increased since the Embassy in Kyiv announced it would hold a virtual town hall meeting about the security situation with U.S. citizens in Ukraine on Tuesday.

Discussions on the matter have been underway for some time but Blinken went over the contingency plans with the embassy's security team when he visited Kyiv on Wednesday officials said.

The officials stressed that no decisions had yet been made and that an outright evacuation is not being considered. One possible scenario would be to order the families of American personnel to leave the country while allowing non-essential staffers to depart voluntarily at government expense they said.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiP2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZ0LmNvbS9jb250ZW50L2Y1ZGI4MTY0LTZkODItNDk1ZS1hMGEwLWYxMmFlOTZkYmQ1NdIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,VW fired senior employee after they raised cyber security concerns,Today's FT newspaper for easy reading on any device.

In just a few years Smith has worked his way up the ranks of MLB catchers. Already one of the best offensive catchers in baseball Smith is working hard to become the best all-around catcher in the game.

Smith is well on track to summit Backstop Mountain. Smith explained his baseball mindset on a December episode of UNFINISHED with Anderson Miller.

“I’m super confident in myself and I try to surround myself with the right people who are positive around me no matter if I go 0-for-4 that day or 4-for-4. They’re always the same. That’s kind of how I go about it is try not to go too high or get too low.”

Over the last three seasons Smith ranks first in OPS (.892) third in WAR (7.5) and first in wRC+ (135) among catchers with at least 800 PAs.

Smith finished dead last in Baseball Savant's Runs Extra Strikes metric in 2020 but improved in that category in 2021. He ranked 16th among 39 qualifying catchers.

Smith is a household name amongst Dodgers fans but he's also a known commodity amongst impartial seam heads. In his 2022 pre-season positional rankings ESPN's Buster Olney lavished him with acclaim. The mild-mannered Olney felt Smith's upside was worthy of a bit of a rare bit of profanity.

""His early-career slash line of .262/.365/.527 is damn impressive among those at his position. Barring injury he's likely to be No. 1 on this list in a couple of years.""

However Smith doesn't read his press clippings.

“The good the bad you don’t let outside noise get you stuck on either one. Just keep going at it.”

Smith has flown under-the-radar on a Dodgers roster brimming with talent. With names like Betts Kershaw Buehler and Bellinger it's understandable.

Smith's on-field play has announced his arrival as an elite catcher in the MLB.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiaGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWdsb2JlYW5kbWFpbC5jb20vbGlmZS90cmF2ZWwvYXJ0aWNsZS1pdGFseS1oZWxwZWQtbWUtbWFrZS1wZWFjZS13aXRoLW15LXdlaWdodC1hbmQtc2hhcGUv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Italy helped me make peace with my weight and shape,"Open this photo in gallery: People sunbath and swim on a beach in the Italian Pelagie Island of Lampedusa on July 31 2020.ALBERTO PIZZOLI/Getty Images

In April 2019 I moved to Italy for a year or so I thought. As a consultant I had the flexibility to work remotely (before that became the pandemic status quo) and personally I needed a change.

It’s hard to articulate how omnipresent negative thoughts about yourself can be. By the time I left for Italy negative thoughts about my weight my appearance and what other people thought about my weight and appearance ran like a news ticker in my brain. On repeat. Sometimes negative self-talk and self-consciousness was bumped up to the lead story delivered by an eviscerating anchor (me) but even when it wasn’t those thoughts were always in the periphery.

Italy had captured my imagination since adolescence – it was a country I didn’t want to visit just for a week or two. At a time when I was close to my heaviest weight I secured a one-year visa and left Canada. In the land of pizza pasta and tiny high-fashion sample sizes I somehow learned to tune out the negative self-talk. My body image drastically shifted too.

My first six months in Italy were nomadic. I crossed the country in my rental car with Chutney my mini Aussie shepherd who came over with me from Toronto. I explored and worked remotely for my marketing clients from home bases in Bologna Tuscany Sicily Puglia and then Rome. I learned the corresponding pasta shapes and flavours for each of those locations (respectively: tortellini in brodo ragu spaghetti con bottarga orecchiette and carbonara). I can point you toward my favourite gelateria in each town and during that 40 C summer. They were visited many many times.

I ate well. I always ordered multiple courses at restaurants but I lost weight that summer as I began to adjust to the rhythms of Italian life. Unlike city life in Toronto – taking public transit and Uber for even short distances – I began to walk everywhere. But the weight loss wasn’t as meaningful as the experiences I was having and in a country bordered by so much water I forged an important new relationship that would radically change the one I had with my body: a relationship with the sea.

In June 2019 I went swimming in Italy for the first time in a coastal area of Tuscany called Grosseto. I was covered up and well accessorized over my one-piece swimsuit. A beribboned visor a lacy tunic and bright lipstick were my typical attempts to distract myself from my insecurities and divert others from my body. I approached the beach like a vacationer planning a Saturday day out and lazing on a rented lounger between dips.

No one gave me a second look. In Italy no one stares at the (theoretical societally defined) “good” bodies and no one is looking at the “bad” ones. Everyone is just swimming.

So that summer I cast off my ideas about fussy accessories and went searching for every rocky spot along Puglia’s Adriatic shore and the sandy ones on the Ionian side. Soon I was pulling up to swimming spots wearing nothing but a swimsuit. I would park by the side of the road spread a thin towel over whatever rocky or sandy situation I found and took a daily dip for an hour or two before going back to work. My entire schedule wardrobe and outlook had changed. The sea wasn’t there for a special day out. It became a daily pleasure.

Despite a pandemic weight fluctuation (hint: I gained) by the following June my tentativeness had all but evaporated. I learned the sea was a way of life in Italy it’s a pinnacle of summer in a culture that revolves around community and pleasure. Why would I deprive myself of the relief from the heat (I had no air conditioning) and enjoyment of the water?

I knew I wanted to share this freedom from the stress and worry about body size with other women in the place where I learned it. Negative conditioning about your body shouldn’t be an impediment to enjoying the sea your vacation or Italy.

Last year I started a business – Stellavision Travel – which creates small group trips for women that offer a taste of the freedom I experienced. We share behind-the-scenes spots that are hard to reach independently and help travellers experience an authentic Italy with plenty of experiential perks (such as the professional photographer that accompanies every tour). We welcomed guests from all over North America.

In the summer of 2022 our first body-neutral size-inclusive tour is running – since your shape shouldn’t be a barrier to enjoying your vacation. In Italy all bodies are beach bodies and we want to provide travellers a reason to celebrate themselves. We are creating an itinerary that explores different sensory experiences to share alongside travel companions that can relate or are on a similar journey toward body positivity or body neutrality. There will be cheese-tasting in the woods outside Altamura with experts whose passion and expertise change the experience of eating and tasting hyperlocal products. We’ll be jumping off a private boat and swimming into limestone caves. And so much more is planned.

Moving to Italy helped me get over hang-ups about my body but it’s a process. I experience backslides and living in Italy doesn’t always help either. There’s no question that shopping for plus-size clothing here is far behind the inclusive improvements made in Canada in the past few years. The Italian habit of directness can cross a line we learned to respect decades ago when it comes to mentioning someone else’s appearance. But for the first time in my life amidst Italy’s culture of food and the sea I have learned to prioritize an experience over negative self-thought – and just go swimming.

Today we continue our movie roundtable series with four movies known for being true-to-life: “A League of Their Own” “42” “The Rookie” and “Eight Men Out.” Our panelists -- Mark Bowman Ian Browne Christina DeNicola Alyson Footer Steve Gilbert and Bill Ladson -- conducted a spirited debate diving into the nuances of each film. A note on the selection process: All movies debated were placed into brackets which brought forth a little bit of a conundrum given the high volume of terrific baseball movies that could easily fall into more than one category. “Best Ensemble Cast” was probably the most wide-ranging; after all it’s fair to say 80 percent of all baseball movies had A-plus A-list casts. But we placed movies in only one bracket each which is how “A League of Their Own” ended up in Based on a True Story and not Best Ensemble. Clearly this classic fits almost every category -- because it is a nearly flawless film. Previous movie roundtables:

• Best ensemble

• Best Hollywood ending

• Let the kids play! Best baseball movies featuring children

Alyson Footer editor/moderator: Baseball movies draw a wide range of opinions. Some people for example love “Major League” some don’t. Most love “Bull Durham” but not everyone. But it seems like everyone loves “A League of Their Own.” Fair comment? Ian Browne Red Sox beat reporter: Oh my gosh. “A League of Their Own"" is such a good movie. I watched it yesterday maybe for the first time since I saw it in the theater in 1992. I honestly forgot how good it was. Geena Davis is just spectacular in this. I love her sibling bond/rivalry with her sister. Christina DeNicola Marlins beat reporter: There may be no crying in baseball but there's one thing for certain: You've got to be a robot if you're not teary-eyed by the end of it. Footer: I fully boo-hoo every time and I've seen it 30 times. Steve Gilbert D-backs beat reporter: I think ""A League of Their Own"" is one of the most if not the most underrated baseball movies. Browne: Agree. I was thinking that as I re-watched. There are no flaws in that movie. Some baseball movies seem bound to go over the top with schmaltz. This really seemed so genuine. Bill Ladson MLB.com reporter: Prior to 1992 my all-time baseball movie was Pride of the Yankees because Gary Cooper did a great job playing Lou Gehrig. But then I saw ""A League of their Own"" -- Penny Marshall did one heck of a job directing the film. I thought Geena Davis was an actual baseball player. My favorite scene was Davis and Lori Petty colliding at the plate. I thought I was watching a real game. The song “This Used to be My Playground"" by Madonna brought tears to my eyes because the lyrics reminded me so much of the time I played baseball in the Astoria Projects in Queens New York. DeNicola: That song for the closing credits and with the actual ballplayers on the field?! Gilbert: The best-ever line in a baseball movie comes from ""A League of Their Own"" and it's not the “no crying” one. I think the scene when Dottie is leaving and she says to Jimmy Dugan that it just got to be too hard and he comes back with ""It's supposed to be hard. If it were easy everyone would do it. The hard is what makes it great."" -- That spoke to me as someone who has been around the game for a long time. Browne: Unlike most baseball movies the ending leaves you really conflicted. Because you’ve become attached to Geena’s character Dottie and her sister Kit who is played wonderfully by Lori Petty you don’t want either team to lose the World Series. The play at the plate where Kit rams into Dottie and the ball squirts free is a perfect ending. Deep down you wonder if maybe Dottie purposely let it get away.

Footer: She definitely did. DeNicola: There’s still debate about whether she dropped it on purpose! When you can keep the people talking this many decades later that's impressive. Browne: Yeah that's why I think it was so well done. There's ambiguity. Like maybe she subconsciously dropped it! Ladson: I think she didn't drop the ball on purpose. Also I loved the part when Lori Petty threw the rock after she was traded. Mark Bowman Braves beat reporter: ""A League of Their Own"" is one of those movies you stop to watch every time you find it while channel surfing. The comedy Jon Lovitz Tom Hanks Rosie O'Donnell and Madonna provide is tremendous. The movie provides a good feel what the women experienced while playing in this league. So it successfully blends comedy and history. Browne: Amazing to think that in 1992 Tom Hanks was well-established as mainly a great comedy actor. We go back and watch the movie now realizing he became one of the best actors of our lifetime playing so many huge roles from “Forrest Gump” to “Philadelphia” to “Cast Away” to “Saving Private Ryan” and on and on. He was fantastic as Jimmy Dugan basically falling asleep at the games after taking over the Rockford Peaches in the early scenes and then falling in love with the team to the point that he bypasses a Triple-A job at the end of the movie so he can keep managing these women. The arc of Jimmy’s character -- from a lost booze-bag to someone who gets his life back together -- is really well done. And no line has ever stood up more than ""There's no crying in baseball!"" Jimmy would not have been happy with what he saw in the 2003 Red Sox Game 7 ALCS clubhouse when giant men like David Ortiz were slumped over a couch sobbing.

Bowman: I just don't know why Kit didn't intentionally walk her sister with first base open in the ninth inning of Game 7. Guess she was just setting up the chance to score the dramatic winning run in the bottom half. Footer: Some of the real-life women who played in the AAGBPL have done a lot of interviews about the movie over the years and I love that they all say it's pretty true to life. The only thing they’ve quibbled with was the way the chaperones were portrayed. Shirley Burkovich said the chaperones were among the most important people in the players' lives; a lot of them were barely out of their teen years and living away from home for the first time. Chaperones were hugely important not nuisances. That’s pretty much the only thing the real players took exception with. DeNicola: So much of the film still resonates to this day. There's a line -- and I'm paraphrasing -- that Rosie O'Donnell's character says about how she was always a ""weird girl strange girl"" just because she could play. It doesn't happen as much now thankfully but if you're a girl playing sports you're seen different. Happened to me. Footer: The end scene when they all pour into the Hall of Fame to see the exhibit for the first time was so well done. Gilbert: It brought it all together at the end. Seeing Stillwell who lost his mom ... pretty touching. Ladson: One of the best endings I ever saw. Browne: This honestly might be the least-flawed of all baseball movies. DeNicola: So well done! I had a chance to meet a few of the ballplayers at the 2015 All-Star Game. Still one of my favorite moments. I got chills. Footer: Three members of the AAGPBL -- now in their 80s and 90s -- attend MLB's Trailblazer Series (a baseball tournament for girls ages 9-11) every year. They sit in the stands and literally watch these games from morning until the end of the day. Maybelle Blair (92 years old at the last tourney) brings her glove with her -- signed by Joe Torre -- and asks the kids to play catch. A few have taken her up on it. She still has a strong arm and pinpoint aim. Let’s move on to “The Rookie.” I re-watched it recently and while I was “meh” on the storyline as a whole I did find myself getting a little emotional when Jim Morris got news of the callup to the big leagues and when he got word in the ‘pen to start warming up. During my years covering the Astros beat there was nothing I loved more than covering guys when they got their first call to the big leagues. It never ever gets old. I felt like the way they portrayed it in “The Rookie” was pretty close to how this stuff happens.

DeNicola: It was a great reminder the Rays have been finding pitchers out of nowhere for years! Browne: Yes “The Rookie” is not a great movie. But it's one of those that leaves you entertained as you sit in your seat. It is kind of like a ""comfort food"" type of movie. Gilbert: It stayed pretty close to the actual story as well. Ladson: I thought this was going to be a boring film but I was impressed with the way Dennis Quaid played Jim Morris. Quaid’s perseverance was convincing -- going from a chemistry teacher/high school baseball coach to having a cup of coffee with the Devil Rays. The confrontations that Morris had with his father were sad because the father moved the family too many times when Morris was a kid.

Browne: Dennis Quaid to use a bad baseball cliché knocks it out of the park as Jim Morris. Forget about the movie for just a second. What a great human-interest story if probably turned up a few notches by Hollywood. Looking back I’m surprised more wasn’t made of the actual story when it happened in 1999. Must have been because MLB.com wasn’t around yet! Gilbert: It felt more like a family-relationship movie than a hardcore baseball movie if that makes sense. DeNicola: Exactly! The father/son dynamic in particular. Quaid not wanting to become his father and yet still wanting his approval. I've lived in Miami my whole life so seeing the impact one person's accomplishments can have on a small town is truly remarkable and moving.

Browne: Baseball movies so often seem to come down to fathers and sons right? No different here. Jim had a very icy relationship with his dad who moved the family around a lot and had little interest in Jim’s love for baseball. But Jim eventually realizes he was also being stubborn with his dad and took some accountability for the relationship not being what it should have been. Jim didn’t know his dad was at his debut until he saw him out of the corner of his eye while he was talking with reporters. That is pretty touching when he gives his dad the ball. His dad said poignantly after missing so many games in Jim’s youth “I wasn’t going to miss this one.” And it was Brian Cox the amazing lead character of Succession! Ladson: I loved that part of the movie. Footer: A nice father-son portrayal and I believe we're 6-for-6 in roundtable movies in the category of unrealistic media portrayals. Browne: Yes but spoiler alert that streak might end before this discussion is over! Maybe it is over the top but I liked the scene when Jim got out of his car at one of those speed trap spots on the road and fired the ball and thought it said ’76’. Then for dramatic effect when he turned his back the bulbs on the original ‘7’ fill out and become a 9. DeNicola: I would love to know if that actually works. Bowman: “The Rookie” was a story that might have seemed too good to be true for Disney before it actually happened. Love the story. But the movie itself just felt average. It's certainly not one I look forward to finding when looking for something to watch. Footer: Next up: “42.” I saw it twice in the theater in one week but while I’d like to say it was because I was so moved by the movie (which I was) it was more because Chris Meloni played Leo Durocher and I needed to see that more than once. But “42” was really well-done and the subject matter was a tough one given the language and abuse that Jackie Robinson had to endure while he broke the color barrier. From everything we’ve read on this piece of our history the movie seemed to jibe with reality. Gilbert: Considering Rachel Robinson thought it accurately represented what went on I think it's safe to say you're right about it being realistic. DeNicola: Revisiting “42” for the first time since Chadwick Boseman's death was very emotional. He was such a great actor and from all reports an even better person. Browne: I loved the movie. I actually got to go to a private screening with the Red Sox in 2013 at a theater in Fort Myers. I remember Jackie Bradley Jr. being blown away and really impacted by the movie. Ladson: I saw the Jackie Robinson story which starred Jackie Robinson and Chadwick Boseman was better playing Robinson in “42.” This is the movie where Boseman made a name for himself and what a job he did. I loved the way he showed his emotions while facing racism especially when he was facing Ben Chapman of the Phillies. Boseman broke his bat and nearly had a nervous breakdown. I also loved Harrison Ford as Branch Rickey. I thought I was going to love the Pee Wee Reese character the person people said helped Robinson the most in real life but I ended up loving the Eddie Stanky character more. I liked the confrontation between Stanky and Chapman. Stanky was always defending Robinson and challenged Chapman to a fight for all the racist language Chapman used against Robinson.

Browne: Two words: Harrison Ford. He is a dominant force as Branch Rickey throughout the entire movie. Nearly every line catches your attention. “I want someone who has the courage not to fight back!” That’s powerful stuff. I just loved him in this movie. Never could have pictured him in such a role when I saw ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"" when I was like 10. Bowman: I do want to believe Branch Rickey was exactly how he was portrayed by Ford. Browne: The Durocher character was so outstanding that I'm bummed he was suspended for the 1947 season. I would have loved to see him manage the whole season. Durocher would have destroyed Ben Chapman and that would have been amazing. Gilbert: The scenes with the Phillies manager are really hard to watch but it really slaps you in the face with what Robinson had to face. You think you have an understanding of it but you see those scenes and you're reminded of just how horrific it truly was. Footer: Former lefty reliever C.J. Nitkowski played the pitcher during the horrible scene with Chapman and C.J. said later he was just counting the minutes until that day of shooting was over. It was terrible for everyone. DeNicola: Got to show some love to André Holland as well who was superb in Moonlight and did a nice job as Wendell Smith. Bowman: “42” is one of the best sports films you will ever find. One of the best compliments I can give is that I didn't want to see it end. I wanted to continue to follow a story I know pretty well. But that's because Boseman Ford and so many others gave you reason to believe you truly were a part of that great journey.

Browne: I agree that Boseman was amazing as Jackie Robinson. So much so that it hit me like a truck when I heard about his death. I think he did a great job of not romanticizing the character. Even though others thought he was a hero Boseman’s performance shows what an internal struggle this all was for Jackie. Footer: Another tear-jerking moment for me was the very end when they showed all the photos of real-life Jackie and Rachel Robinson. Gilbert: When you see Jackie with the grey hair. It hits you the toll this took on him physically. Browne: I noted in a previous roundtable how the media is never portrayed accurately or well in baseball movies. This might be an exception. I loved Wendell Smith -- played by André Holland -- in this movie. “I’m going to be your Boswell"" he tells Jackie early in the movie. All the scenes with him are great. He tells Jackie he needs to “slow things down” with the media just like he does when he is playing. Ladson: I wished the movie went past 1947. I wanted more. I wished they showed Jackie Robinson's entire baseball career. Browne: I thought the sportswriter character -- the sportswriter Holland was cast to play -- comes off as very believable for that era. Ladson: But he had to do his work in the stands. I hated it. Gilbert: His character was great. I think it showed that racism wasn't just a baseball issue but how it impacted others as well. I mean Wendell couldn't sit in the press box. It's so hard to understand how that's even possible. A good reminder that Jackie paved the way not just for baseball players of color but from all walks of life. Bowman: Yeah I thought Holland was great. Wendell Smith played a significant role in this journey. He influenced the thoughts of countless individuals from the time Jackie signed with Brooklyn. DeNicola: And he warned Jackie about the types of questions he would get as soon as he stepped on the field for Spring Training that first day! Browne: It was just such a nice thing that at least one baseball movie decided not to make a sportswriter look like a bumbling idiot! In fact quite the opposite. Footer: “42” is a movie that needs to be shown in every classroom of every school in America. DeNicola: Absolutely. Heck to everyone in America. Bowman: I loved the scene when they were in Cincinnati and Pee Wee Reese stands with Jackie before the game starts. Loved hearing him say something like ""Maybe we can all wear 42 tomorrow so that they won't be able to tell us apart.""

Footer: And look at what we do now every April 15 ... Browne: Prophetic! Ladson: A lot of historians say that pat on the back was fake. I hear a lot more about Gil Hodges' role with Jackie Robinson. DeNicola: I suppose with any ""based on a true story"" we have to accept some creative licenses will be made for the sake of cinema. Browne: I would have liked one highlight from the 1947 World Series. That's my only baseball critique. They played the Yankees right? That's pretty huge. Footer: Let's move on to “Eight Men Out.” Guilty pleasure for me (see what I did there). I love the cast. John Cusack is one of the great actors of our time. Gilbert: I fell in love with the Buck Weaver character. When Buck plays with the kids on the street and his scene with Kid Gleason before Game 1 and talking about playing the game for free. I felt for Buck at the end. Browne: By far one of the most serious baseball movies I’ve ever seen. Not a lot of frills or comedy. Just one big fat scandal. A little bit of the beauty of the movie is what we still don’t know to this day. How involved was Joe Jackson in the scandal? Is he mostly as innocent as the movie makes him seem? Eddie Cicotte was very happy to be on the take but even he had mixed feelings when he won Game 7 to keep his team alive in the series demanding to his manager that he wanted to pitch that game. DeNicola: This was probably my least favorite of these films but mainly because it didn't deal with an underdog. What was it about the late 1980s and baseball films?

Browne: I agree that it wasn't a wildly entertaining movie to watch. But to me that doesn't detract from it being an important movie. Ladson: It’s always interesting to see how baseball was played back in the early 20th century. While I feel bad for Buck Weaver and Shoeless Joe Jackson the movie made me feel sad for Charles Comiskey the owner. He was expecting to win the 1919 World Series and was furious that he didn’t get the big prize. It’s sad the White Sox decided to fix the series because they didn't like the way they were getting paid by the owner. John Cusack was outstanding as Weaver and he convinced me that he was innocent and never should have been suspended. Gilbert: At least they got Shoeless Joe hitting from the left side (properly) unlike Field of Dreams. I agree Bill. I felt worse for Buck than I did for Shoeless Joe. Browne: John Cusack does a great job as Buck Weaver. He certainly acts as if he had nothing to do with the fix and it is believable by how he played in the series yet he was ultimately banned from baseball. The movie just gives you a lot to think about. I think Buck just had a much stronger personality than Joe. At least if you believe their portrayals in the movie. Joe seemed like kind of a weak character. He just loved to hit and was great at baseball. Maybe not a lot going on between the ears though? Ladson: Weaver wasn't able to prove his innocence. Browne: How about the scene with Lefty “0 and 3 in the World Series” Williams when the gambler asks him if he likes his wife?

If the leaked draft of a Supreme Court opinion overturning Roe v. Wade became final the United States would join a very small group of countries that have rolled back abortion rights in recent years.

Just three other countries have done so since 1994: Poland El Salvador and Nicaragua according to the Center for Reproductive Rights which fights abortion restrictions in American courts and tracks international laws. In that period 59 countries have expanded abortion rights.

So what are they waiting for? People there keep telling me they need asset prices of merger partners to “normalize” aka fall enough so Goldman remains in control of the combined company.

Well we’re starting to see some “normal.”

A look at the asset prices of potential partners — PNC Bank US Bancorp State Street BNY Mellon some mid-sized asset managers and even potentially brokerage firm Charles Schwab & Co. — are starting to come back to earth as the Fed begins raising interest rates.

Another factor that might force CEO David Solomon’s hand are the obvious holes in Goldman’s business model. Goldman has a long and storied rep killing it in M&A and trading.

Tough competition

But it’s tough having only two horses in the race competing against banking behemoths like JPMorgan. Sure Goldman wasn’t the only bank to experience a hiccup because of trading volatility and higher expenses (the vaunted JPM did as well). But JPM has a big balance sheet far larger than the size of Goldman’s and JPM CEO Jamie Dimon can paper over surprises such as rapid and unexpected increases in compensation costs which bedeviled Solomon in the fourth quarter of 2021 and possibly into 2022.

That’s why Goldman’s earnings miss last week has the Wall Street rumor mill spinning again.

Solomon also knows that if you’re Goldman the merger has got to be the right one or else the CEO will go down in infamy as having evaporated one of the world’s greatest corporate brands.

3 JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon is definitely not in the market for mergers or acquisitions. REUTERS/Carlo Allegri/File

And this is where it gets tricky. As for potential partners Schwab — the world’s most prestigious discount broker — would be an obvious choice. Schwab’s business involves registered investment advisers selling high-end financial products to rich people which complements Goldman’s own very high-end wealth-management business.

But Schwab’s price in Goldmanese hasn’t been normalized enough. The San Francisco-based Schwab has a market value of $168 billion compared to Goldman’s $115 billion. Charles Schwab’s ego — and yes the company’s 84-year-old founder namesake and chairman is still around — won’t let him sell out a bunch of traders in New York if he doesn’t have to.

Both PNC and US Bancorp have lower market caps than Goldman and they would be attractive particularly in a high-interest-rate environment the Fed has signaled; banks make a lot of money when rates rise.

But like Schwab neither has to do a deal. The monetary-policy environment favors their business model over Goldman’s.

Asset managers that might be available — think T. Rowe Price — would get Solly around $1.5 trillion in assets and entry into the lucrative mutual-fund business.

Ask yourself though: Why ­haven’t there been more marriages between fund companies and Wall Street? Answer: Combining those cultures is a little like trying to get Hillary Clinton to play nice with Donald Trump.

With all these variables to weigh the conventional wisdom among bankers is that Goldman isn’t rushing to do anything. Solomon is doing a great job; he’s beat earnings expectations seven times before the recent fourth-quarter 2021 miss. Some analysts say his stock looks cheap compared to competitors like Morgan Stanley but Goldman has the edge in market prowess.

That’s one way to look at it; another way is the reason why Morgan Stanley beat fourth-quarter expectations: It has a huge wealth-management business that stabilized and papered over a trading slowdown.

Again Solomon and his people are smart. They know they have to do a deal and the right one at the right time.

Sensible ‘Fink think’

Larry Fink’s annual letter to CEOs is always must-read material this year even more so because he added a fair amount of common sense to the relentless push by the Biden administration and corporate America to adopt green-energy policies.

Fink the CEO of BlackRock is no stranger to this effort. He’s used his clout as chief of the world’s largest money-management firm ($9 trillion in assets) to prod companies to adopt policies that he believes will transition the country and the world to what’s known as “net zero” carbon admissions.

With that came criticism from conservatives and this column since BlackRock alumni fill the Biden White House. Yes green energy sounds good in practice and Teslas are very popular in Beverly Hills but working-class Americans can’t afford electric cars. Higher oil and gas prices are tax increases on Middle America.

Fink didn’t back off his embrace of green energy. But in the letter he also pointed out how this movement is being hijacked by environmental zealots.

He advocated for a transition that takes into account that “any plan that focuses solely on limiting supply and fails to address demand for hydrocarbons will drive up energy prices for those who can least afford it resulting in greater polarization around climate change and eroding progress.”

Let’s hope his friends in the Biden administration are listening.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiP2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZ0LmNvbS9jb250ZW50LzIyNjE1NWEwLWRlMTgtNDA4OS05M2QwLTMxYTQxZGEzOTYwOdIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Pay problems: what Goldman Sachs and Ireland's AIB have in common,Today's FT newspaper for easy reading on any device.

Sami Abunasra the owner of the Puritan property on New Britain Avenue plans to demolish the sprawling showroom and warehouse and build 131 apartments with storefronts facing New Britain Avenue.

The mixed-income development could be the first under a new transit-oriented development zone expected to be created soon for the milelong New Park corridor stretching from the Hartford city line to New Britain Avenue.

The transit-oriented initiative is aimed at allowing denser projects than normally permitted elsewhere in town to take advantage of two busway stations on the corridor.

The family-owned Puritan Furniture showroom and warehouse closed in 2020 after nearly 90 years in business.

The Puritan property is a few minutes walk from New Park Avenue and the Elmwood CTfastrak station. The second busway stop at Flatbush Avenue could be the site of a future rail station.

“We want this to be as vibrant — maybe not as good as Blue Back — but we are designing the project this way is to get more people to come in create the amenities and the facilities that everyone wants to be around” Abunasra said referring to the successful mixed-use development Blue Back Square in West Hartford Center.

“We’re hoping to be the catalyst to spur the development in this area and get developers interested in doing more work here in West Hartford” Abunasra said.

West Hartford and a growing number of towns and cities in Connecticut — Windsor Windsor Locks Meriden and Enfield to name a few — are pushing into transit-oriented development.

The developers seek to build more walkable neighborhoods with strong residential bases retail and entertainment options. They also aim at reducing dependence on motor vehicles whose emissions contribute experts say to climate change.

Transit-oriented development on New Park Avenue could eventually connect to a planned arts and innovation district nearby in Hartford’s Parkville which has a similar vision of “live work and play.”

There is a push to redevelop vacant blighted buildings along Hartford’s Bartholomew Avenue into the center of an arts and innovation corridor in the Parkville neighborhood. The area is just across the town line from West Hartford’s New Park Avenue corridor.

Abunasra has been in detailed discussions with town officials in West Hartford about a redevelopment at Puritan for two years even before he bought the property in the fall of 2020 for $1.1 million.

West Hartford has already secured a nearly $1 million state brownfields grant to clean up contamination on the property.

It is possible the project could break ground in June with the first rentals ready by early 2024 Abunasra said.

Kristen Gorski West Hartford’s economic development coordinator said the development would fill a crucial gap in Elmwood left by the closing of Puritan a beloved institution in town for nearly 90 years.

“What’s especially exciting about this is the fact that it’s a significant amount of investment in Elmwood” Gorski said. “It’s 400 feet from the fastrak station. It maintains the ground floor as commercial and retail space. With other developments sometimes that goes away and it’s just housing. With this you are emphasizing what is already there and adding apartments to it.”

Eclectic

For nearly a decade West Hartford has targeted change along New Park Avenue once there was the addition of the two busway stations.

The area was long the domain of factories and in the 1990s there was the addition of Home Depot and other big box retailers.

The vision for the corridor is eclectic continuing to foster the growth of existing businesses such as the firearm maker Colt’s and a strong base of home remodeling and design businesses.

Housing has been scarce though but two projects have slowly added apartments along the busway route.

The apartments at 546 New Park Ave. in West Hartford are now under construction near Talcott Avenue.

In 2018 the development arm of the West Hartford Housing Authority completed the construction of 54 mixed-income rentals at 616 New Park Avenue and demand it says has been strong with the building now fully-leased except for one apartment.

The authority will finish building later this year a second apartment project nearby at 540 New Park Ave. adding another 54 units.

“The increase in energy and investment along the New Park-New Britain Avenue corridor over the last five years has helped transform and revitalize the area” George Howell the authority’s chief executive said.

A rendering of the new 52-unit mixed-income apartment building now being built at 540 New Park Ave. in West Hartford. Leasing is expected to begin later this year.

The revitalization is still in its early stages. The town plans to narrow New Park from four to three lanes to better link pedestrians and bicyclists between the two busway stations and to businesses and housing according to West Hartford Town Planner Todd Dumais.

The stretch is starting to attract attention from more restaurants including New Park Brewing and GastroPark a food truck park.

Demand

Abunasra an electrical engineer with an MBA from Columbia University spent years at large employers. But Abunasra said he left corporate America behind because he really wanted to be an entrepreneur with an eye toward real estate development.

Abunasra landed in the furniture business first as a franchise owner of three Ashley HomeStore franchises in Manchester Newington and one he established in the Puritan space. The West Hartford outlet store will remain until he breaks ground on what will be his first development project.

Plans are still evolving and he’s still lining up financing but Abunasra envisions a four-story building with a rooftop deck. The 160000-square-foot building will be in the shape of an “H” to create interior outdoor spaces with underground parking.

He expects the furniture store will later return to the storefront space in the new building plus a restaurant and other shops.

He doesn’t have a rendering of the building yet but said it will be in a similar style to an apartment building recently proposed by developer Avner Krohn near West Harford Center. The building

The developer of a $34 million redevelopment of the former Puritan Furniture showroom and warehouse in West Hartford doesn’t yet have rendering of the new apartment complex but he says it will resemble the apartment building shown in the rendering here that is planned for Farmington Avenue near West Hartford Center. The rendering was designed by Phase Zero Design.

Abunasra said he is exploring how to incorporate work spaces into the mostly one- and two-bedroom units — recognizing the pandemic-related shift to remote working — so tenants “don’t have to work in their bedrooms.”

He projects that monthly rents for market-rate units will likely range from $1450 to $2250. The “affordable” apartments which account for 15% of the project will be “several hundred dollars” less he said.

And even as apartment building booms in Hartford and surrounding suburban towns Abunasra said he is confident that there will be demand for the new apartments.

“It’s going to be two years” Abunasra said. “That’s enough time to attract more people while you are building and now you have demand.”

-North Wilson Avenue continues from the intersection of North Wilson Avenue and Union Street north to Clover Road.

– Addresses for the City of Hartford have been applied to city parcels along this extension of N. Wilson Avenue.

-County Hwy R begins at Clover Road and continues north along the old Hwy 83 route.

Washington County Highway Commissioner Scott Schmidt said the City of Hartford wanted Highway 83 within the City limits because it was concerned about traffic on Main Street and the intersection of Highway 60. “The City wanted it in order to limit truck traffic downtown and then the Town of Hartford wanted Highway 83 to make sure no reliever route would go through that stretch” he said.

Washington County according to Schmidt took the remainder of Highway 83 at CTR K and STH 175.

There have been about a half dozen highway jurisdictional transfers over the last few years adding up to about 15 miles worth of changes including:

Washington County had a jurisdictional transfer involving Goldendale Road also known as CTH Y to the Village of Germantown

In 2020 the State of Wisconsin picked up a section of Pioneer Road by Mayfield Road

In 2018 the County turned over a little more than a mile of roadway by CTH M and CTH Y to the Village of Newburg. Click HERE to read about the upcoming improvement project for Main Street.

Schmidt said the County Highway Department and all the local municipalities get General Transportation Aid from the State of Wisconsin to help with road maintenance. “With these transfers you need two willing partners or the deal doesn’t happen” Schmidt said.

Credit(s): ACD distributions The authentics line gets very little attention and that's kind of the point. They are meant to simply be exist and be available at stores that don't often carry Transformers. Be it Dollar General in the US or Canadian Tire in Canada or a myriad of other shops in South America and Asia. They are just affordable Transformers toys of classic characters and now we have a first look at two more Wheeljack and Arcee. Wheeljack takes a major cue from his Earthrise toy while Arcee has a rather neat transformation giving it a lot more alt mode integration in robot mode the most we've ever seen for a toy basing itself on the G1 character model. These images are from ACD distribution . There will be no further reveal than this from Hasbro and you will find them this year in any store that stocked the previous releases. Arcee is 4.5 inches tall while Wheeljack is 7 inches tall.

WOW a decent-to-good Arcee that's actually affordable and plentiful enough to show up at any store from the 5-Below in every other large stripmall to the last dollar store you stumble across in the middle of nowhere. The kind of thing so many of us have dreamed about since '86.



Now I can add her to my 3rd cousins' TF box in Illinois this summer instead of the rereleased Cyberverse Arcee (starting to think it's impolite to horde that toy since the new open-window packaging has cursed her with disappearing-head-syndrome; saw it first hand in a Target last week - tragic) Posted by Bumblevivisector on January 23rd 2022 @ 3:19pm CST

Just have the back kibble raise up a bit and split (and paint the interior at least) lengthen those forearms and you have a really solid design that still looks like G1 Arcee.

I've left this little line alone for the most part because of a)- Lack of availability and b)- just bad.



But Wheeljack and Arcee are pretty cool looking. Not sure if I want them for the collection but wouldn't mind playing with them that's for sure. Posted by Burn on January 23rd 2022 @ 7:08pm CST

Arcee is probably the closest we'll get to a Core figure and at half the price to boot and probably better than an actual one would turn out. Really looking forward to finding her!

I've got the Shockwave Ratchet and Barricade figures. Shockwave is pretty good; if the aesthetic wasn't so obviously Cyberverse-inspired he could fit in all sorts of collections. That Ratchet looks a tad better if you fiddle with the shoulders a little. Barricade is essentially perfect for the size and price.



I'm definitely looking for that Arcee and would certainly buy an upscaled version in a more mainstream line; perhaps the only improvement that would be needed would be fixing the forearm proportions.



And I'll probably buy that Wheeljack even though I don't really need a Voyager-sized 'Jack. What I need is a proper Cyberverse Deluxe Wheeljack.

I get this feeling like they designed Prime and Bumblebee first and then realized they could do a lot more at this price point articulation wise. If I'm not mistaken they're the only ones that don't have elbows which is odd considering their popularity.

Ratchet is a figure that would be incredible at a larger size with a few more moving parts but is still pretty neat for a $5 figure. His leg transformation is nothing short of genius for how effective it is and should really be replicated in a future figure. Basically the whole top of the rear van pops off and folds around and inside the bottom of the van hiding it completely and filling in all the lower leg gaps. He doesn't have knees or proper feet but that could easily be fit into a larger figure. Chuck did a review that shows them well. There is definitely a ""shell"" around the legs but again at a higher price point they'd be able to do more with them.







Likewise Barricade has basically the same leg transformation as Kingdom Tracks but it's much better done despite being simplified. That is a great figure right there all the art details are present and he's a fun figure to mess around with just needs a lot more paint to really do the mold justice (and fill in his windshield ""eyes"").

Seriously I like that Megatron more than Core Megatron he borrows a lot from Legends class Megatron. It's nice to see a Megatron that knows how to integrate its treads and not have a ridiculously restrictive backpack. I wish his torso was a little bulkier but he makes for a nice futuristic tank.

Shame that Arcee doesn't have actual knees thinks to the weird ball joint system they used where you have to spin the legs twice which I have to admit I've never seen done before. Still curious how she'll look with Core figures.

Yeah I've been hearing quite a few say this actually works as a G1 arcee since the transformation style fits late G1. So in the end the simplicity and lack of articulation works to its merrit from that perspective.

chuckdawg1999 wrote: Authentics Arcee is a mixed bag. On the one hand it's a neat figure that transforms without being a shell former and it has some good articulation. On the other hand due to the nature of Authentics there are some tolerance issues with the legs and arms coming together while the articulation could be a bit more functional. In general the plastic doesn't feel as good as it could be. If you're looking for a simple Arcee then the Authentics version might be worth the look.

Interestingly enough while Primal will be a big part of the ROTB toyline and there are ROTB Titan Changers coming this particular toy is not from that line. So we will get more of these soon but looking more like their movie counterparts.































Maybe some of you have see them in stores but Hasbro has a line of Transformers toys aimed at people who want an affordable larger Transformer. This is the Titan Changer line under the Authentics umbrella and so far we have had G1 mainstays like Prime Megatron Bumblebee ect. But now we have our first Beast Wars character too Optimus Primal. We have an image of the robot mode from The Entertainer website but not the alt mode. While obviously aimed at families on a budget I'd advise against knocking on these as they do the job fine for kids interested in larger figures and are easy to transform back and forth. I speak from experience as a dad of a four year old who plays with these toys. And it's cool to see Primal get that status of reliable sellers within the TF brand appealing to younger kids (and most importantly their parents buying the toy). We have also put images of the others in the line to show how the proportions are shared across the line.Interestingly enough while Primal will be a big part of the ROTB toyline and there are ROTB Titan Changers coming this particular toy is not from that line.

Source: Transformers vs. G.I. Joe Vol. 1 #13 ""The War Never Ends"" (2016) IDW. Cover art by Tom Sicoli.

After seventeen years and a spiral into injecting the popular franchises with woke identity politics comic book publisher IDW has announced that they will officially lose the publishing licenses to Hasbro’s iconic Transformer and G.I. Joe franchises at the end of 2022.

RELATED: Former G.I. Joe Writer Aubrey Sitterson Pens Piece Arguing Western Super Heroes Are “Rooted in Authoritarian Impulses and Nigh-Fascist Logic”

IDW revealed their upcoming license losses in an exclusive statement given to The Hollywood Reporter wherein they informed the trade news outlet “At the end of 2022 IDW will bid a fond farewell to the publication of G.I. Joe and Transformers comic books and graphic novels.”

“We’re exceedingly proud of our stewardship of these titles — 17 years with the Robots in Disguise and 14 years with A Real American Hero — and thank the legion of fans for their unwavering support month in and month out” the publisher added. “We’re also eternally grateful to every one of the talented creators who helped bring these characters to four-color life through our comics.”

IDW will round-out their time as Hasbro’s primary comic book publisher with a series of celebratory send-off events including two Transformers crossovers the 300th issue of G.I. Joe: A Real American Hero and “several special projects” for G.I. Joe’s 40th anniversary.

Though they are losing what are arguably Hasbro’s two most important lines IDW will still retain the rights to publish comics based on the toy manufacturer’s popular My Little Pony and Dungeons & Dragons franchises.

Curiously no word has been given as to the future of the publisher’s other Hasbro licenses including M.A.S.K. Action Man and Rom the Space Knight.

RELATED: G.I. Joe Writer Learns Painful Lesson After Disgusting 9/11 Tweet

IDW’s loss of Transformers and G.I. Joe follows an editorial turn in recent years towards injecting contemporary identity politics into these franchises replete with a variety of race swaps and sexuality changes.

Examples include disgraced G.I. Joe vol. 5 writer Aubrey Sitterson’s changing of classic character Salvo into a stocky Samoan woman – complete with her very own braided lobotomy cut – out of fear that the character’s original depiction as a white man with a t-shirt that read “THE RIGHT OF MIGHT” was “a little too alt-right.”

They also retconned Autobots Ratchet and Drift into same-sex lovers (Conjunx Endura being the Cybertronian equivalent of ‘husband/wife’).

They also transformed the classic female Transformer Arcee who quickly became a fan-favorite following her debut in 1986’s The Transformers: The Movie into the Cybertronian equivalent of a male-to-female transgender individual.

As for the comic book future of Transformers and G.I. Joe THR previously reported that Skybound the imprint founded by The Walking Dead creator Robert Kirkman had entered talks with Hasbro to acquire the franchise’s licenses.

However as of writing there has been no confirmation that such a deal has been successfully negotiated.

RELATED: Disney Reportedly Pulls All-Ages Marvel And Star Wars Licenses From IDW

IDW’s loss of Transformers and G.I. Joe makes the second such massive license loss for the publisher in recent months.

In September 2021 Disney and Lucasfilm withdrew the publisher’s licenses for their Marvel and Star Wars all-ages lines.

Though no reason was ever publicly given for this withdrawal it is assumed to have been done in order to allow Disney to publish their comic book lines in-house under Marvel.

While the filmmaker has revealed Hasbro owns the live-action rights to the character before he took to a Twitter thread Saturday to reveal he's tried using the cosmic character on at least three separate occasions—one time for each of the films in the Guardians of the Galaxy franchise.

""Marvel is not allowed to use Bug in films"" the Marvel director said. ""I have tried to use him in all three movies and was not able. I hope this settles your argument.""

Marvel is not allowed to use Bug in films. I have tried to use him in all three movies and was not able. I hope this settles your argument. — James Gunn (@JamesGunn) January 22 2022

Despite Bug appearing in the Guardians of the Galaxy comic run that largely inspired the Marvel Studios' franchise the character technically belongs to Hasbro's Micronauts property. At one point Paramount also had a Micronauts film on its release slate but it's since been removed.

There's also an animated Micronauts series in the works which may or may not receive a release by the end of this year. The synopsis for that can be found.

""When fate brings an unlikely team of alien space explorers to earth in pursuit of the evil Baron Karza they make a shocking discovery – on our world they are the size of action figures!"" explains a Hasbro marketing kit. ""The Micronauts are small heroes in a big world but the stakes are higher than ever as their miniaturized size presents dangerous obstacles at every turn. Fortunately they forge an alliance with teenager Cameron Ruck who will join them in their pursuit of justice. Although the Micronauts are small in stature their bravery and adventurous spirits remain larger than life.""

As for the Guardians franchise goes Vol. 3 is actively filming and has added at least one other new character to the film. While Bug won't be appearing Will Poulter has been cast as Adam Warlock in the threequel.

The first two Guardians of the Galaxy movies are now streaming on Disney+ while Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 is due to hit theaters May 5 2023. I Am Groot and the Guardians of the Galaxy Holiday Special have yet to receive release dates.

New Hampshire Bulletin

New Hampshire has plans to spend approximately $17 million in federal pandemic aid to significantly expand capacity for inpatient mental health treatment for adults and children in the state.

The larger investment would provide Portsmouth Regional Hospital and its parent company HCA Healthcare nearly $15 million to help create a new $45 million consolidated behavioral health hospital for adults and youth in Epping.

An additional $2.2 million would bring a behavioral health “strike team” to Hampstead Hospital to allow it to expand on its 16 inpatient beds for children and adolescents. It is currently the only inpatient facility for that population.

There are approximately 200 inpatient beds for adults in the state nearly 160 of them at the state hospital and 16 beds for children.

With both investments the department hopes to reduce the number of people waiting in emergency rooms and elsewhere for an inpatient hospitalization a number that has reached more than 30 for children and 50 for adults. On Thursday there were three children and 18 adults waiting in emergency rooms for a bed and two adults waiting at correctional facilities according to the state’s count.

The Joint Legislative Fiscal Committee is scheduled to take up both approval requests from Health and Human Services on Friday. The Executive Council must also agree.

Under its plan for Portsmouth Regional Hospital the department would provide $15 million for “capital defrayment” costs during construction of the building which is expected to be ready in fall of 2023.

The new hospital would provide 68 inpatient beds for adults nearly 42% more than HCA Healthcare currently has and 16 beds for geriatric patients an increase of about 60% according to the department’s request.

The plan also calls for the hospital to expand its behavioral health treatment to children ages 12 and older with 12 inpatient beds and add a new partial hospitalization outpatient program with 15 beds.

All beds would be for voluntary and involuntary admissions.

Messages to HCA Healthcare seeking more information about the project and how it will fund its portion of the cost were not returned.

Throughout the pandemic Hampstead Hospital has had enough staff to open fewer than 40 of its 111 inpatient beds. An average of just 16 of those beds has been available to children and adolescents too few the department said especially as the pandemic has increased mental health care needs for that age group.

Between 2019 and 2021 the number of children seeking inpatient care increased by 75 percent and they waited longer for admission according to the department. The department did not say how many additional children it anticipates serving with the strike team which will include nurses social workers and mental health counselors.

These beds would be in addition to the 10 now available at the Brattleboro Retreat in Vermont under a December contract with the state. But those beds will be open to New Hampshire children only when the facility is not full.

Susan Stearns executive director of NAMI NH said the organization backs the department’s proposed investments in Portsmouth Regional Hospital and Hampstead Hospital.

“I think there is no question that we have a need for investment right now” she said. As the department did in its request Stearns said boarding children and adults in emergency rooms is not only harmful to them but a further burden on hospitals struggling to keep up with the pandemic.

But Stearns cautioned against seeing additional inpatient beds as the only or even most important investment needed. There needs to be a continuum of care she said that provides mental health treatment before someone is in crisis and supportive housing once people are ready for discharge but still need support.

Health and Human Services spokesman Jake Leon said these investments are part of the state’s effort to do so and fulfill the vision of the state’s 10-year mental health plan.

“Two years into the pandemic the state continues to experience a demand for inpatient psychiatric care that exceeds current capacity for children and adults” Leon said in an email.

“Both of the items submitted for the (fiscal) committee’s consideration are expected to alleviate the time individuals spend waiting for services in hospital emergency departments by providing much-needed staffing at Hampstead Hospital and a build-out of inpatient services including in specialty areas that are not commonly provided in state.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmVudHJlcHJlbmV1ci5jb20vYnVzaW5lc3MtbmV3cy8zLWdyZWF0LWhlYWx0aGNhcmUtc3RvY2tzLXRvLWJ1eS1ub3cvNDE0NTc50gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,3 Great Healthcare Stocks to Buy Now,"This story originally appeared on MarketBeat

Healthcare Stocks Are Appealing in Any Market Environment

It's fair to say that the healthcare sector is one of the most intriguing areas of the market for investors to explore. After all a global pandemic has reminded the world of just how important quality medical care is. Healthcare spending in the U.S. accounted for over 19.7% of the country's GDP in 2020 and that number is expected to get even larger over the next decade. Naturally there will be plenty of companies that are able to take advantage of this growth which is why the sector is worth a look for new investment opportunities even during a period of elevated market volatility.

Investors might be in store for some very appealing buying opportunities in 2022 if January is any indication of how the year might unfold in markets and focusing on a sector like healthcare makes a lot of sense given how the industry will always see heavy spending regardless of economic conditions. That's why we've put together the following list of 3 great healthcare stocks to buy now. Let's take a closer look at these fantastic companies below.



McKesson Corp (NYSE: MCK)

If you're looking for one of the strongest stocks in the market look no further than McKesson Corp. The stock is roughly flat year-to-date while major indices are getting pummeled which tells investors that it's showing a lot of relative strength. McKesson is the largest distributor of pharmaceuticals in the U.S. and also distributes medical-surgical supplies an intriguing business model that is poised to deliver double-digit adjusted EPS growth going forward. The company should see its pharmaceutical sales increase in 2022 thanks to higher prescription volumes as visits to primary care doctors get back to normal after the pandemic.

McKesson's management raised its forward guidance for FY22 last quarter and also delivered total revenues of $66.6 billion in Q2 up 9% year-over-year which are both signs of a healthy business. The bottom line here is that McKesson is a dominant force in the pharmaceutical industry with plenty of upside for long-term shareholders to consider and the fact that the stock price is barely being impacted by the current market weakness speaks volumes about the quality of this company.



HCA Healthcare Inc (NYSE: HCA)

HCA Healthcare is an underrated healthcare company that has come out of the pandemic a more efficient business which is why it should be on your shopping list at this time. As one of the largest hospital companies in the United States HCA has the leading market share in some of the largest areas in the country including Texas and Florida. The company has focused on improving its cost structure over the last few years which is a move that should pay off over the long term in the form of improved margins. There's also a good chance HCA will benefit from a rebound in elective procedures going forward which is another strong reason to consider adding shares.

The company delivered its fourth straight quarterly earnings beat back in October which saw HCA deliver EPS of $4.57 up from $1.92 in 2020 on revenue of $15.3 billion up 15% year-over-year. The company will announce its Q4 results on January 27th and could be gearing up for another strong report so keep an eye on the market's reaction to those numbers towards the end of the month. With the stock heading closer to testing the 200-day moving average investors might want to consider the recent weakness in this leading health care services provider as an intriguing opportunity to scoop up shares.

Merck & Co (NYSE: MRK)

If you're interested in exposure to a leading biopharmaceutical company that pays a very appealing dividend Merck & Co is a solid option to consider. The company's major drugs include treatments in oncology and diabetes and Merck also produces vaccines and animal health medications rounding out a diverse portfolio of products. The company's COVID-19 antiviral pill Molnupiravir has been granted emergency use authorization for the treatment of mild-to-moderate coronavirus disease and it will be interesting to see if it becomes a big winner for the company.

Merck has also announced an agreement to acquire Acceleron which is a biotech firm that develops therapies for serious and rare diseases. This move improves Merck's pipeline of new drugs and its cardiovascular disease treatment portfolio and should certainly be viewed as a positive from long-term investors. It's also worth noting that the company has been delivering strong earnings recently including Q3 adjusted EPS of $1.75 up 28% year-over-year. Finally the fact that Merck stock offers investors a 3.42% dividend yield makes it a top pick in the sector.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lndhc2hpbmd0b25wb3N0LmNvbS9oZWFsdGgvMjAyMi8wMS8yMy9ob3NwaXRhbC13b3JrZXJzLWNvdmlkLWlzb2xhdGlvbi1jZGMv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Stressed hospitals are asking workers with covid to return — even if they may be infectious,"Candice Cordero still had a fever and a cough late last month when she says her hospital told her it was time to come back to work.

Her request was denied and she was suspended.

Labor and delivery nurse Julia Kidd has managed to avoid the pandemic burnout driving other nurses out of the profession at a time of crisis-level staffing shortages.

But the pandemic is exacting a different toll: University Medical Center this month suspended Kidd after rejecting her request for a religious exemption from the hospital’s mandate that all employees be vaccinated against COVID-19.

Kidd who has worked at UMC for 18 years and now faces possible termination from her job practices paganism an alternative nature-based religion. She also follows the Wiccan Rede an ethical code that states “If it harm none do what you will.”

“How does this harm anyone if I don’t get this vaccine? It doesn’t” Kidd 55 said last week explaining how her beliefs impacted her decision to forgo the doses. “If I can wear my mask and prevent transmission great. If I can wash my hands and prevent transmission cool. If I need to wear PPE to the nth degree OK.”

“How does having a vaccine or not affect my ability to be a nurse my ability to be a good employee at this facility?” she asked adding that she is willing to be tested daily.

Court upholds health-care mandates

More disputes like Kidd’s are likely to follow the U.S. Supreme Court’s decision on Jan. 13 allowing a federal vaccination mandate for health care workers at facilities receiving Medicare and Medicaid funding. The deadline for compliance in Nevada and many other states is Feb. 28.

The decision could worsen the existing staffing shortages at hospitals in the Las Vegas Valley and across the country where many employees are calling in sick at the same time hospitalizations are rising from a surge driven by the omicron variant of the new coronavirus.

“Our health care workers are burnt out. They’re exhausted” said Jen Sarafina a Las Vegas labor and employment attorney. “And this is yet another thing that is being expected of them on top of this. There is a real concern of what the staffing is going to look like.”

The situation could become critical if the omicron surge is still peaking when the federal mandate deadline arrives and triggers terminations.

“I can see that as kind of a perfect storm worst-case scenario if that were to happen” said Sarafina a partner in the law firm of Kamer Zucker Abbott.

‘Handful’ suspended terminated

UMC announced its own vaccination mandate in September. Today 97 percent of the staff are vaccinated said hospital representative Scott Kerbs. Fewer than 200 have requested either a medical or a religious exemption. This represents about 5 percent of UMC’s 4000 employees he said.

Kerbs would not say how many requests had been denied.

“Many employees who had their requests denied ultimately received the vaccine” he wrote in an email. “Only a handful of team members have been suspended or terminated for failing to comply with our mandatory vaccination policy.”

UMC was the only Las Vegas Valley hospital to provide any figures related to exemption requests and related disciplinary actions. A representative of St. Rose Dominican hospitals which also implemented a vaccination requirement as well as those of HCA Healthcare and the Valley Health System said they were following the federal mandate but failed to provide any figures.

Kerbs said that UMC reviewed each exemption request using a “comprehensive and equitable process supported by federal guidance.”

Kidd who was suspended pending investigation on Jan. 4 said that she has yet to be told why her request was denied. She hopes to present her side of the issue during a future hearing.

The nurse said she is not opposed to vaccinations in general but has qualms about the COVID-19 vaccines because they are so new.

“Who are you to tell me what I can do with my body?” Kidd said. “I don’t care if you’re my employer. You can tell me what I can and cannot do in terms of behavior but not what I put in my body.”

Trevor Hatfield Kidd’s attorney said goals to reduce pandemic risk through vaccination are good ones as long as care is taken not to infringe on employees’ rights.

However it appears that some employers are using strong-arm tactics he said by denying all requests for religious exemption. He said he did not have enough information to know if this was true in Kidd’s case. She has requested an investigation by the Nevada Equal Rights Commission.

‘Sincerely held religious belief’

Federal guidance on whether to grant an exemption hinges on whether the employee has a “sincerely held religious belief” that prohibits vaccination.

The U.S. Equal Rights Commission states that if an employer “has an objective basis for questioning either the religious nature or the sincerity of a particular belief the employer would be justified in making a limited factual inquiry and seeking additional supporting information.”

Not qualifying as religious beliefs are objections “based on social political or personal preferences or on nonreligious concerns about the possible effects of the vaccine” according to the commission.

One argument for a religious exemption has been that fetal cells from abortions were used in the development or testing of COVID-19 vaccines. The argument has become pervasive enough that the Los Angeles County Department of Health saw fit to produce a fact sheet addressing it.

“The fetal cell lines being used to produce some of the potential COVID-19 vaccines are from two sources” from an aborted or miscarried fetus in 1973 and one in 1985 the health department states.

“While fetal cell lines may be used to develop or manufacture COVID-19 vaccines the vaccines themselves do not contain any aborted fetal cells” the department says. Other fetal cells have been used to create vaccines for hepatitis A rubella and rabies.

Objecting on these grounds may be complicated by vaccination endorsements by major religions with hard-line anti-abortion positions.

The Secretariat of Pro-Life Activities a committee within the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops has stated that “one may receive any of the clinically recommended vaccines in good conscience with the assurance that reception of such vaccines does not involve immoral cooperation in abortion.”

The bishops conference also has stated that “being vaccinated safely against COVID-19 should be considered an act of love of our neighbor and part of our moral responsibility for the common good.”

At least one health group has pushed back against objections citing the fetal cells as grounds for a religious exemption. The Conway Regional Health Center in Arkansas asked employees citing this objection to attest to not taking any of at least 28 common medications – including pain-relievers aspirin ibuprofen and acetaminophen – that it said used fetal cells in their development or testing.

No exemption for prior infection

To protect both patients and staff hospitals routinely require their employees to have been vaccinated against highly transmissible infectious diseases.

UMC requires employees to be vaccinated or have natural lasting immunity verified by antibody testing for measles and chickenpox Kerbs said. Nearly all its employees receive the annual flu vaccine eachyear. Those who decline a flu shot have been required to wear masks throughout the flu season though masks currently are required for everyone entering the hospital to help prevent the spread of COVID-19.

At least for the time being employees who were previously infected with COVID-19 are not exempted from the federal vaccination mandate. But it’s conceivable this could change in light of studies such as the one published this past week by the Centers for Disease Control of Prevention indicating that protection from natural infection is superior to protection from vaccination.

If the mandate rules do change allowing prior infection to be accepted in lieu of vaccination Kidd the UMC nurse might not be forced out of her chosen line of work.

She is currently recovering from what she described as a mild case of COVID-19.

“Our fans never let us down. They were right on cue when that goal goes in and what a celebration” said Bryan Helmer Hershey Bears General Manager.

Thousands of bears rained down from the sold out crowd at the Giant Center during the Hershey Bear’s 20th annual Teddy Bear Toss.

Just six minutes into the game Axel Jonsson-Fjallby scored the team’s first goal and ignited the firestorm of plush. After missing out on this tradition last year the electricity in the arena was palpable.

“It gives me goosebumps. Every time we score that goal and the bears start raining and to have a full crowd here tonight and the atmosphere it's amazing” Helmer said.



Tonight’s goal was to set another world record trying to eclipse the 2019 mark of 45650.

All of the stuffed animals will be delivered to over 25 different charities including the Children’s Miracle Network and Children Youth and Families.

HERSHEY PA — On December 1 2019 Capitals Stanley Cup champion defenseman Christian Djoos scored a milestone marker while playing for the AHL’s Hershey Bears. Firing the puck into the back of the Hartford Wolf Pack’s net Djoos began what is considered one of the most fun events in hockey. Bears fans threw a world-record 45650 plush toys onto the ice — all of which would benefit charities across the region — forcing the game to stop and go to intermission early.

The ’19 Toss was a feel-good night for Hershey and the crescendo for an event in its 19th iteration earning an E60 feature. But then everything changed. The coronavirus pandemic moved into the United States months later sending the sports world into chaos.

In 2021 the Bears held a “drive-thru” toss and collected over 30000 stuffed animals to keep the event going. But 783 days later the Hershey Bears were able to host its Teddy Bear Toss game safely again. Things were a little different than before. Fans and media wore masks but the large outpouring of support from the local community remained the same.

Axel Jonsson-Fjallby scored the goal 6:13 into the first period unleashing a frenzy of stuffed animals being hurled towards the ice.

Bears fans broke their own world record from 2019 by heaving 52341 stuffed animals onto the ice. The math is staggering. With a sold-out crowd of 10514 4.98 bears were thrown onto the ice per person.

Jonsson-Fjallby later finished his memorable night with a hat trick. The Swedish forward prospect was sent back to the Hershey Bears the day before after playing his ninth NHL game for the Capitals.

The Hershey Bears will be donating the stuffed animals to more than 25 local organizations. Including this year’s event the Bears have collected an estimated 322199 plush toys since 2001. Since that time Hershey’s all-time record on Teddy Bear Toss is 14-2-0-2 in addition to two ties. Hershey has won six straight Teddy Bear Toss games scoring four or more goals in each of those contests.

Jonsson-Fjallby joins four other Hershey players on the roster who have scored a Teddy Bear Toss goal in the past. According to Bears PR Matt Moulson scored the Ontario Reign’s Teddy Bear Toss goal only 1:06 into the game on Dec. 15 2018. Forward Kale Kessy scored a Teddy Bear Toss goal with ECHL Bakersfield on Dec. 4 2013. Fellow forward Colby McAuley scored a Teddy Bear Toss goal in his junior days with the Prince George Cougars on Dec. 19 2015 while Mason Morelli notched a Teddy Bear Toss goal just 15 seconds into the game for the Minot Minotauros in 2012.

HERSHEY Pa. — A yearly tradition at the Hershey Bears has reportedly set a new world record.

Every year the team holds its annual ""Teddy Bear toss"" game where after the Bears score their first goal of the game all of the attendees toss teddy bears onto the ice.

Those bears are then collected and donated to local charities.

It didn't take long for the Bears to light the lamp on Saturday night scoring with 13:47 left in the first period.

Of course it was time for the teddy bears to fill the ice and the turnout was something you have to see:

Of course some Hershey Bears players had to get in on the action as well:

Hershey the American Hockey League affiliate of the NHL’s Washington Capitals hosted its annual “Teddy Bear Toss” game on Saturday night.

The well-equipped fans entered the Giant Center with full garbage bags containing the plush animals and eagerly waited. The highly anticipated promotion is when fans throw and donate stuffed animals onto the ice following Hershey’s first goal.

Bears forward Axel Jonsson-Fjällby opened the scoring — and the flood gates — in the first period. Thousands of stuffed animals sailed over the glass and blanketed the ice to commemorate the spectacle.

“Sweet cuddly mayhem” Bears broadcast announcer Zack Fisch said. “It’s Teddy Bear Toss time!”

The team announced 52341 studded animals were collected setting a new world record. Hershey smashed its own previous record of 45650 toys which was set in 2019. The “Teddy Bear Toss” games were not held in 2020 and 2021 due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

There wasn’t a limit placed on the number of stuffed animals fans could bring to the game. Each animal collected is donated across 25 organizations and charities in the Hershey community.

Hershey players enjoyed the over 30-minute game delay to celebrate in the mountains of animals on the ice. Forward Shane Gersich dove headfirst into the pile and disappeared into the mass collection.

The “Teddy Bear Toss” was a prelude to Hershey’s celebrations.

HLT,Hilton Worldwide,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMic2h0dHBzOi8vZnJlcXVlbnRtaWxlci5jb20vaGlsdG9uLWRpc2hvbm9ycy1tb3JlLXRoYW4tNzUtb2YtaGlsdG9uLXByb3BlcnRpZXMtd29ybGR3aWRlLWRvbnQtaGF2ZS10by1vZmZlci11cGdyYWRlcy_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Hilton DisHonors: More Than 75% Of Hilton Properties Worldwide Don't Have To Offer Upgrades,"Did you know that the Hilton Honors terms and conditions state that more than three-quarters of their properties worldwide don’t offer complimentary room upgrades for those with status?

I didn’t realize Hilton had this policy until yesterday when Lan commented on this post to advise that. Here’s what they shared:

I’m a longtime Hilton Diamond. My wife and I like all the Hilton brands but typically stay most frequently at mid-tier chains including Hampton Inn & Suites Hilton Garden Inn Homewood Suites and Embassy Suites. In the official Hilton website those are among the Hilton brands that as corporate policy apparently no longer offer upgrades if space is available even for elite members. This is a fairly recent and very significant DOWNGRADE to the entire Hilton Honors program. We did recently stay at a Hampton Inn & Suites asked for an upgrade and were told by the front desk person on duty we would have to pay for any upgrade at regular rates. He said that the change to “no upgrades for elite Honors members” was corporate-wide and not this particular property’s policy. Because my wife wanted an ocean-view room we did pay about $40 extra for the room location a regular room not a suite. When I received the standard Hilton survey following the stay I responded in part by criticizing the policy and said I thought this showed Hilton in some cases no longer valued its Diamond members. A few days later I received a “Hilton case incident opened” email message and today I received $40 credit on my Amex. I’m unclear whether because individual property operators control their own inventory that some Hampton Embassy and Garden Inn operators still offer Diamond and Gold members a space-available upgrade or if that is now rarely if ever done. What has been your experience?

That sounded strange but sure enough – Hilton’s terms and conditions include the following statement:

The following brands do not offer complimentary upgrades: Embassy Suites Hilton Garden Inn Hampton by Hilton Tru by Hilton Homewood Suites by Hilton Home2 Suites by Hilton Hilton Grand Vacations and Motto by Hilton.

It turns out that this isn’t a particularly new change. When checking the Wayback Machine that sentence has been in their terms and conditions since at least December 14 2020 (there aren’t any earlier records to be able to check).

This seems like an absurd policy to have. If Family Feud was to ask 100 people what benefit they most associate with hotel elite status I’d assume that the number one answer would be ‘room upgrades’. Stating that guests with elite status won’t get a room upgrade at many of your properties is a ridiculously customer-unfriendly proposition.

It’s not like the terms have some kind of caveat either like ‘Room upgrades are subject to availability and/or property discretion’. It simply states that those Hilton brands don’t offer complimentary upgrades.

It seems like Hilton Corporate has been actively advising properties not to offer room upgrades which makes matters even worse. I sent Greg Nick and Tim an email to see if any of them had encountered this policy before and this is what Tim shared:

We had this happen once last year at the Hampton Inn Outer Banks/Corolla. There were suites available and when I asked for one at check-in there was quite a bit of hemming and hawing and the supervisor came over to tell me that they “received a letter a few weeks ago” saying that there were no more complimentary upgrades at Hampton Inns. Said it was at the direction of corporate. She then said that they still had discretion to upgrade but only in specific situations and then caught herself after I asked her what those situations were. I assumed it was just a local property trying to get out of elite upgrades. When I followed up with Twitter team they said that they didn’t know anything about it.

How Many Hilton Properties Don’t Offer Upgrades?

Based on the ineligible brands my initial assumption was that this would affect about 2/3 of properties. Curious as to exactly how many I did a little research to identify how many properties Hilton has worldwide along with how many properties are affected by this policy to not upgrade Hilton Honors members who have elite status with them.

It turns out that it’s even worse than 2/3. In fact it’s even worse than 3/4.

The figures below won’t be entirely accurate seeing as new properties are being added all the time while some existing hotels will have converted to other brands or moved to other chains. Still the numbers will be broadly accurate and so give a good idea as to how many locations are affected:

Embassy Suites – 257

Hilton Garden Inn – 862

Hampton – 2544

Tru – 178

Homewood Suites – 505

Home2 Suites – 384

Hilton Grand Vacations – 55

Motto – 3

That’s a total of 4788 properties worldwide. Hilton has 6215 properties overall which means that 77% of Hilton properties worldwide don’t offer complimentary room upgrades for members with elite status.

I’m sure there’ll be people who scoff at this wondering why you’d be worried about room upgrades at a Hampton. However the base room at many of these brands is a studio but they have one bedroom suites you can be upgraded to. Even Embassy Suites properties where each suite has two rooms have what would otherwise be upgradeable premium room types that include free drinks and snacks which are supposed to get replenished every day.

What’s particularly galling to me is that that lone sentence in the terms and conditions seems to be the only place where they disclose that more than 3/4 of their properties won’t give you an upgrade. For example on the member benefits page it lists one of the Gold status benefits as follows (my bolding):

Space-available room upgrades. If we have a better room available it’s yours – up to Executive Floor room types.

There’s something similar listed for members with Diamond status (again my bolding):

Space-available room upgrades. If we have a better room available it’s yours – up to a 1-bedroom suite.

‘If we have a better room available it’s yours’ – unless you stay at one of our almost 5000 properties where it’s not.

Hilton sadly seems to be going the route of IHG by making their loyalty program less rewarding for y’know loyalty. Rather than offering free breakfast for Gold and Diamond members for stays in the US you now receive a food and beverage credit which is oftentimes insufficient to cover the cost of breakfast at the brands for which it’s valid.

That breakfast policy offers a downgraded experience for many members at Hilton’s premium brands while this lack of room upgrades represents a downgraded experience for members at pretty much all of the rest of their brands. I’ll still be collecting their points as they’re so relatively easy to rack up but it certainly lessens my interest in sending any paid stays their way. Why show Hilton any loyalty when they refuse to offer something so basic as a room upgrade to someone with Gold or Diamond status at more than 3/4 of their properties worldwide?

Designed by Gene Kaufman Architect and developed by Sam Chang of McSam Hotel Group the 418-foot-tall 320000-square-foot structure will yield 1046 hotel rooms across a Hampton Inn a Home 2 Suites and a Motto Hotel Hilton’s newest brand of micro-hotels. McSam Hotel Group purchased the Midtown Manhattan site from Rockefeller Group in early 2019 at a cost of $140 million and received a $250 million loan before construction broke ground in 2020. Omnibuild is in charge of erecting the tower which is located by the corner of West 48th Street and Seventh Avenue.

Since our last update in September work has largely concluded on the brick and glass façade of the main northern elevation and gray paneling has been installed over the blank concrete faces on the eastern and western sides of the tower.

Omnibuild constructed the tower at a dramatic pace notably without the use of a construction crane. The primary areas awaiting completion are the mechanical bulkheads on top of the edifice which are currently surrounded by metal scaffolding and black netting the top of the back southern wall which will likely hold a rooftop space and the ground floor and podium which have yet to be enclosed.

The Hilton property will contain two ground-floor lobbies; ten elevators with six for the Hampton Inn two for the Home 2 Suites and four for the Motto Hotel; a five-part storefront on the first level; and amenities including a restaurant and cafe a lounge a rooftop bar and two gyms.

It was last reported that 150 West 48th Street is slated for completion by fall 2022.

Allana Akhtar/Insider

I stayed in Hilton's wellness-focused rooms called Five Feet to Fitness.

The rooms included 200+ guided workout tutorials and ample exercise equipment.

Hilton's room is ideal for fitness fanatics and business travelers.

Hilton has an answer for fitness fanatics who can't take a rest day even on vacation.

For the last five years some Hilton locations have included Five Feet to Fitness an ""in-room wellness concept"" that offers 11 different fitness machines and exercise tools steps from a guest's bed.

The rooms which are available in Hilton locations in Atlanta San Francisco Shanghai and more are equipped with an exercise bike medicine balls light-weight dumbbells bands TRX ropes yoga blocks and other supplies.

The setup includes a giant TV filled with tutorials on how to use all the equipment and guided workouts for yoga high intensity interval training cycling boxing and meditation.

Hotels like Hilton are cashing in on the $639 billion wellness tourism trend. Allana Akhtar/Insider

It's Hilton's answer to the travel industry introducing new features to cash in on the $639 billion ""wellness tourism"" trend or wealthy travelers' interest in retreats focused on self-care health and spirituality.

In 2019 the Four Seasons launched Sensei Lanai a relaxation resort offering wellness consultations and sensory walking meditation. Marriott will offer wellness-focused suites complete with deep soaking tubs bath salts and wood decor in its renovated Newport Beach location

I stayed at Hilton's Five Feet to Fitness room in the DoubleTree at Newark New Jersey to see how ""well"" they made me feel. Here's what it was like.

Constant motivation to move

Upon walking in I was immediately impressed by the selection of different tools. The hotel gyms I've stayed at typically don't have TRX bands and guided training like Five Feet to Fitness rooms do.

With weights that ranged between 5 and 18 pounds the setup felt geared more toward light strength training and might not appeal to guests who are used to heavier weights and more intense reps.

All Five Feet to Fitness rooms come with exercise bikes. Allana Akhtar/Insider

Though the setup could be stressful for people who don't want to workout on vacation I view physical exercise as a mental health treatment. After struggling with depression and anxiety for years consistently working out has brought me relief that I struggle to break from during long trips.

Business travelers could further benefit from having exercise equipment so close to them. Frequent business travelers were more likely to report poor self-rated health no physical activity and trouble sleeping according to Harvard Business Review. Five Feet to Fitness rooms can provide a place to workout late at night when hotel gyms might close.

Hilton said the Five Feet to Fitness rooms are ideal for ""road warriors exercise enthusiasts and wellness aspirants who want to maintain their fitness regime even while on the road.""







Five Feet to Fitness rooms include more than 200 exercise tutorials and classes. Allana Akhtar/Insider

I decided to workout in two different ways: a guided cycling class with the exercise bike and a high-intensity interval circuit using the other equipment in the room.

The exercise bike was easily adjustable but I struggled to move the heavy equipment around to face the TV.

The bike itself was high-quality but I found the tutorial a bit distracting due to the playlist on the right-hand side of the screen. The tutorial programmed 15-second breaks between videos within a playlist instead of just having one 30-minute long video with non-stop biking. I ended up ditching the video and just cycling on my own for a half-hour.

Allana Akhtar/Insider

I got distracted by the giant comfy bed

Though my plan was to immediately switch to another workout I found myself yearning for the giant bed five feet away from me as I toiled on the exercise bike.

I decided to lie down immediately after cycling and I stayed in bed for an hour — maybe a bit longer than I should have.

I was seduced by the giant bed near the exercise bike. Allana Akhtar/Insider

Even though I wanted to call it a day the exercise equipment right next to me made it difficult for me to make excuses not to workout.

I pulled out a medicine ball some dumbbells weighted sand bags a bosu ball and the TRX band and went into my HIIT circuit.

Allana Akhtar/Insider

Though yoga mats are supposed to be in Five Feet to Fitness locations the Newark room did not have a yoga mat. I found that my socks kept slipping on the hardwood floor and I didn't have that much carpet space.

My favorite part about Hilton's set up was the privacy I got. I usually work out in gyms where I can't loudly sigh ""I don't want to do this anymore"" or ""I hate this"" in the middle of my sets. But in the privacy of a hotel room I got to count loudly and complain as I pleased.

Allana Akhtar/Insider

I wish the room had more wellness offerings aside from just fitness

In the morning I did a guided meditation tutorial. This was actually a full video not just a playlist so I found it easy to follow.

I normally don't meditate but the tutorial was an excellent way to clear my mind before starting my day.

But aside from the meditation class and foam roller the Five Feet to Fitness rooms primarily included fitness equipment. The rooms were supposed to come with Biofreeze muscle soreness relief wipes but the Newark location did not have any.

I would love if the rooms offered a massage chair adjustable beds natural light lamps or any other wellness products.

That being said I thoroughly enjoyed the Five Feet to Fitness room. I think the rooms are a perfect option for people like me who struggle with not working out during vacation and business travelers who can't easily exercise in hotels."

White of Woonsocket Dies at 67,"Bronze Star Army Ranger & Firefighter Eric J. White of Woonsocket Dies at 67

A “Down East” guy living in the Ocean State a firefighter with the hands of a teddy bear a man who could lift one thousand pounds and a gentle soul who lived for others all these and more can only scratch the surface to describe Eric White.

Eric J. White 67 of Woonsocket died Sunday January 16 2022. He was the loving husband of Lenore M. Rheaume. Eric and Lenore have been together for the past 30 years.

Born on July 27 1954 and raised in Brunswick Maine Eric was a son of the late Warren and Eunice (Perry) White. He was a great-grandson of Commodore Perry from the early days of American history.

Eric was a graduate of Brunswick Maine High School class of 1973 where he was a star football player as a forward receiver.

Eric received an Associate’s Degree from Southern Maine Vocational Technical Institute of South Portland in Applied Sciences and Fire Safety. He also received an Associate’s Degree in Travel and Tourism from Portland Maine. He was a first responder emergency medical technician and certified in CPR.

After high school Eric served his country as a United States Army Ranger and was awarded the Bronze Star. Eric was proud of his service but he tended to be reserved about his exploits.

Eric’s career as a firefighter was with the Brunswick Naval Air Station Fire Dept. He was later posted to Greece at the American military bases there as a firefighter in the late 1990s and early 2000s. Ever the humble hero Eric was credited with saving many lives during his career.

In the 1980s he was a catalog model for L.L. Bean of Maine Sears Roebuck and J.C. Penny.

The sport of bodybuilding was a large part of Eric’s life and he was a lifelong dedicated bodybuilding enthusiast. Eric was an award-winning bodybuilder. He received the “Mr. Maine” and “Mr. Northeast” bodybuilding regional and national awards along with numerous other awards. Eric held the world record for the deadlift at 911 lbs. Eric was also a boxer in his younger days and studied and practiced Tae Kwan Do.

Eric has made his home in Woonsocket since 2003. He worked locally at Home Depot in Smithfield and later at Wal-Mart stores in North Smithfield. In his younger years in Maine Eric ran a business appropriately called “It’s a Grave Experience” functioning as a gravedigger and caretaker for a number of cemeteries in his native Brunswick area. Eric also ran a Hallmark store with Lenore in Skowhegan Maine.

As an adult Eric was received into the Catholic Church. He was a longtime volunteer for Precious Blood Parish and in recent years he was active with the transformation of Precious Blood Rectory to its future uses. Although he did not speak much French Eric was a supportive presence at meetings and functions for the Club Richelieu and Club Aram Pothier.

Eric will be remembered for his cheerful and easy-going outlook on life. He never met a stranger. The old-time folksy wisdom of “Down East Maine” was not lost on Eric. He knew just what to say when to say it and when to let well enough alone. Eric gave of himself unselfishly whatever the circumstances were. He would drop whatever he was doing and lend a hand to anyone in need. Eric truly helped make the world a better place and those who were fortunate to know him will be forever blessed by his friendship.

In addition to his beloved wife Lenore Eric is survived by his brothers Philip and Richard White and his sister Gail Bernier and her husband George and his nephew Anthony all of Maine. He was the brother of the late James White. Eric is also survived by Lenore’s family whom he considered his own. His mother-in-law Trudy Lamoureux of Woonsocket and sister-in-law Yvette Lazdowski and her husband Edward niece Emily and nephews Edward and Evan Lazdowski of New Hampshire. He was the son-in-law of the late Pete Rheaume and Dr. Gerald Lamoureux MD.

His funeral will be Thursday January 27 2022 at 9:00 am from the Menard-Lacouture Funeral Home 127 Carrington Ave. Woonsocket followed by a Mass of Christian Burial at 10:00 am in Precious Blood Church Carrington Ave. Woonsocket.

Despite a slight dip in net income the company maintains a strong balance sheet with increased EBITDAre.

On May 3 2024 Host Hotels & Resorts Inc (NASDAQ:HST) a premier owner of luxury and upper-upscale hotels reported its first-quarter financial results through the 10-Q filing. The company's portfolio predominantly located in the United States consists of 77 properties with a strong presence under the Marriott and Starwood brands.

Decoding Host Hotels & Resorts Inc (HST): A Strategic SWOT Insight

Strengths

Brand Power and Portfolio Quality: Host Hotels & Resorts Inc's strength lies in its high-quality portfolio of luxury and upper-upscale hotels primarily operating under the prestigious Marriott and Starwood brands. This association with renowned brands enhances the company's market presence and customer loyalty. The strategic focus on urban and resort properties in key markets positions Host to capitalize on high-demand segments driving revenue per available room (RevPAR) and maintaining a competitive edge.

Financial Robustness: The company's financial health is underscored by its strong balance sheet and revenue growth. The 6.5% increase in total revenues and the expansion of the operating profit margin reflect efficient cost management and an ability to drive top-line growth. The 13.5% increase in EBITDAre further demonstrates Host's operational efficiency and its capacity to generate cash flow which is crucial for reinvestment and shareholder returns.

Strategic Asset Management: Host's recent divestitures and acquisitions indicate a proactive asset management strategy. By selling off non-core assets and investing in strategic properties such as the 215-room 1 Hotel Nashville and 506-room Embassy Suites by Hilton Nashville Downtown Host is refining its portfolio to focus on high-potential markets and properties that align with its growth objectives.

Weaknesses

Net Income Decline: Despite revenue growth Host Hotels & Resorts Inc experienced a 6.5% decrease in net income in the first quarter of 2024 compared to the same period in 2023. This decline may raise concerns among investors regarding the company's ability to translate revenue increases into net profit consistently. It is essential for Host to analyze the underlying causes such as potential increases in operating expenses or one-time charges and address them to ensure sustained profitability.

Dependence on Brand Partners: The company's significant reliance on Marriott and Starwood brands while a strength also poses a risk. Changes in the relationship with these brand partners or shifts in their strategic direction could impact Host's operations and market positioning. Diversifying its brand portfolio could mitigate this dependence and spread operational risk.

Impact of Strategic Shifts: The recent sale of international joint venture interests and other U.S. properties may lead to short-term disruptions and a potential loss of revenue from those assets. Host must manage these transitions effectively to ensure that the long-term benefits of these strategic moves outweigh the immediate impacts.

Opportunities

Market Recovery and Demand Growth: As the economy recovers from the pandemic and travel demand rebounds Host Hotels & Resorts Inc is well-positioned to benefit from increased occupancy and average daily rates. The company's focus on luxury and upper-upscale hotels which are expected to see a faster recovery presents an opportunity to capture a larger market share and drive revenue growth.

Strategic Acquisitions: Host's recent acquisitions demonstrate its ability to identify and capitalize on strategic growth opportunities. The company's strong balance sheet and access to capital allow it to pursue further acquisitions enhancing its portfolio and geographic diversity and positioning it for long-term growth.

Operational Excellence: Host's operational efficiency as evidenced by its improved EBITDAre provides an opportunity to further optimize costs and enhance profitability. Continued focus on operational excellence can lead to sustained improvements in margins and cash flow generation.

Threats

Economic Uncertainty: The potential for an economic recession coupled with high inflation and rising interest rates poses a threat to the hospitality industry. Host Hotels & Resorts Inc must navigate these macroeconomic challenges which could impact travel demand and the company's financial performance.

Geopolitical Risks: Geopolitical tensions and international conflicts can affect global travel patterns and have a direct impact on Host's operations. The company must remain vigilant and adaptable to mitigate the effects of such external risks on its business.

Competition and Market Saturation: The luxury and upper-upscale hotel segments are highly competitive with new entrants and existing players vying for market share. Host must continue to innovate and differentiate its offerings to maintain its competitive position in a potentially saturated market.

In conclusion Host Hotels & Resorts Inc (NASDAQ:HST) presents a strong financial and strategic profile with robust revenue growth a high-quality portfolio and a proactive approach to asset management. However the company must address the decline in net income manage its brand partner dependencies and

James F. Risoleo President and Chief Executive Officer said “Host delivered comparable hotel Total RevPAR growth of 0.5% over the first quarter of 2023 which is impressive given the challenging comparison of the prior year. Banquet revenues led our performance driven by improvements in group business and continued strong demand in food and beverage. In addition we delivered net income of $272 million a decline of 6.5% compared to the first quarter of 2023 and Adjusted EBITDAre of $483 million an 8.8% improvement over the first quarter of 2023. At the same time comparable hotel RevPAR declined 1.2% as a result of tough comparisons the impact of Maui and unseasonable weather in many markets that impacted short term leisure demand.”

Risoleo continued “Subsequent to quarter end we acquired the 1 Hotel Nashville and Embassy Suites by Hilton Nashville Downtown underscoring the strength of our balance sheet and our strategic approach to capital allocation. This two-hotel complex further improves the quality of our portfolio and establishes a meaningful presence for Host in a top performing market. As a result of the acquisition additional business interruption insurance gains and improving out-of-room spend we kept our net income guidance flat to our previous forecast while increasing the mid-point of our Adjusted EBITDAre guidance by 2%. We tightened our full year Total RevPAR growth guidance range to 2.7% to 4.6% and our RevPAR growth guidance range to 2.0% to 4.0% based on our performance in the first quarter the evolving nature of demand in Maui and our expectations for growth in the second half of the year. Given our fortress balance sheet and successful capital allocation execution we believe Host is well positioned to continue delivering EBITDA growth.”

_______________________________

(1) NAREIT Funds From Operations (“FFO”) per diluted share Adjusted FFO per diluted share EBITDAre Adjusted EBITDAre and comparable hotel revenues are non-GAAP (U.S. generally accepted accounting principles) financial measures within the meaning of the rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”). See the Notes to Financial Information on why the Company believes these supplemental measures are useful reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP measure and the limitations on the use of these supplemental measures. Additionally comparable hotel results and statistics include adjustments for dispositions acquisitions and non-comparable hotels. See Hotel Operating Data for RevPAR results of the portfolio based on the Company's ownership period without these adjustments.

HIGHLIGHTS:

Comparable hotel Total RevPAR was $369.58 representing an increase of 0.5% compared to first quarter of 2023 as strong contributions from group business led to an increase in food and beverage revenues with banquet and catering revenues per group room night in excess of the prior peak reached in first quarter of 2023.

Comparable hotel RevPAR was $215.37 for the first quarter of 2024 representing a decrease of 1.2% compared to first quarter of 2023 driven by the impacts of the Maui wildfires unseasonable weather conditions in several markets and unanticipated delays in renovation. In addition there were difficult comparisons to first quarter of 2023 which had experienced elevated levels of leisure demand leading to significant RevPAR growth.

GAAP net income was $272 million for first quarter of 2024 reflecting a 6.5% decrease compared to first quarter of 2023 primarily due to a decline in gain on asset sales partially offset by gains on insurance settlements recognized in the first quarter. GAAP operating profit margin was 19.8% an improvement of 180 basis points compared to the first quarter of 2023 due to the insurance gains.

Comparable hotel EBITDA was $435 million for first quarter of 2024 a 2.9% decrease compared to first quarter of 2023 leading to a comparable hotel EBITDA margin decline of 140 basis points to 31.2%. The decline for the quarter was driven by increased wages and higher insurance expenses in comparison to first quarter 2023.

Adjusted EBITDAre was $483 million for first quarter of 2024 exceeding 2023 by 8.8% driven by strong operating performance at The Ritz-Carlton Naples which was closed in the first half of 2023 due to Hurricane Ian and including the benefit of the business interruption gain.

To date the Company has received insurance proceeds of $263 million out of the expected potential insurance recovery of approximately $310 million for covered costs related to damage and disruption caused by Hurricane Ian. The Company received $31 million in the first quarter and $10 million of these proceeds were recognized as a gain on business interruption.

Subsequent Acquisition

On April 15 2024 the Company acquired the fee simple interest in the 215-room 1 Hotel Nashville and 506-room Embassy Suites by Hilton Nashville Downtown for a total purchase price of $530 million. The LEED Silver® hotels comprise a two-hotel complex located in Nashville's famed Lower Broadway entertainment district across the street from Music City Convention Center and near other key points of interest and feature seven food and beverage outlets a spa two fitness centers a yoga studio and 33000 square feet of shared meeting space.



Maui Update

Impacts from the August 2023 wildfires in Maui Hawaii continued into 2024. In the first quarter the Company's Maui hotels and golf courses impacted RevPAR by 170 basis points. Operating profit margin and comparable hotel EBITDA margin were impacted by approximately 50 basis points and 30 basis points respectively for the first quarter. The first quarter impact is understated as the Company would have expected Maui to contribute 140 basis points to portfolio RevPAR growth in the first quarter given the renovation disruption at Fairmont Kea Lani in 2023. As a result the total estimated impact of the wildfires on first quarter RevPAR is 310 basis points.

2024 OUTLOOK

The 2024 guidance range continues to contemplate steady demand in travel and low supply growth. In addition the range incorporates continued improvement in group business a gradual recovery in business transient demand softer short term leisure transient demand and the evolution of demand on Maui as the island recovers from the recent wildfires. Growth in the first half of 2024 is expected to be flat to low single-digits while the second half of the year is expected to have stronger year-over-year improvements due to better group booking pace less renovation disruption compared to the second half of 2023 and diminishing impacts from the wildfire event in Maui which occurred in early August of 2023.

Operating profit margin in 2024 is expected to increase slightly compared to 2023 while comparable hotel EBITDA margins are expected to decline compared to 2023 due to the impacts from the Maui wildfires and continued growth in wages real estate taxes and insurance. At the midpoint of guidance the impact from the Maui wildfires is expected to be an approximate decline of 130 basis points in RevPAR 90 basis points in Total RevPAR and 20 basis points in margins. At the midpoint in comparison to 2019 operating profit margin is expected to increase 110 basis points and comparable hotel EBITDA margins are expected to increase 10 basis points as portfolio-wide cost reductions continue to curb inflation and benefiting from business interruption gains.

The guidance range for net income and Adjusted EBITDAre includes an additional $28 million of gains from business interruption proceeds compared to prior forecast comprised of $8 million related to Hurricane Ian and based on an estimated range of $18 million to $22 million related to the Maui wildfires which is expected to be received during the remainder of 2024. The guidance also includes an estimated $17 million and $29 million of net income and Adjusted EBITDAre respectively which is expected from the recent acquisition of the 1 Hotel Nashville and Embassy Suites by Hilton Nashville Downtown. Due to the timing of the acquisition the results for these two hotels will be included in the comparable hotel guidance starting in the second quarter. Additionally following the collapse of a portion of Highway 1 in California in March 2024 Alila Ventana Big Sur temporarily closed on March 30 2024 and will be removed from the forecast comparable hotel set for full year 2024.

The Company anticipates its 2024 operating results as compared to 2023 will be in the following range:

Current Full Year 2024 Guidance Current Full Year 2024 Guidance Change vs. 2023 Previous Full Year 2024 Guidance Change vs. 2023 Change in Full Year 2024 Guidance to the Mid-Point Comparable hotel Total RevPAR $352 to $359 2.7% to 4.6% 2.9% to 5.8% (60) bps Comparable hotel RevPAR $214 to $218 2.0% to 4.0% 2.5% to 5.5% (100) bps Total revenues under GAAP (in millions) $5650 to $5753 6.4% to 8.3% 5.2% to 8.1% 80 bps Operating profit margin under GAAP 15.4% to 16.1% (20) bps to 50 bps (40) bps to 70 bps (10) bps Comparable hotel EBITDA margin 29.3% to 29.8% (80) bps to (30) bps (120) bps to (40) bps 30 bps

Based upon the above parameters the Company estimates its 2024 guidance as follows:

Current Full Year 2024 Guidance Previous Full Year 2024 Guidance Change in Full Year 2024 Guidance to the Mid-Point Net income (in millions) $719 to $775 $708 to $794 $(4) Adjusted EBITDAre (in millions) $1640 to $1700 $1590 to $1680 $35 Diluted earnings per common share $1.00 to $1.08 $.99 to $1.11 $(0.01) NAREIT and Adjusted FFO per diluted share $1.97 to $2.05 $1.92 to $2.04 $0.03

(1) The Forecasts are based on the below assumptions:

Comparable hotel RevPAR will increase 2.0% to 4.0% compared to 2023 for the low and high end of the forecast range. Comparable hotel metrics do not yet include the results of 1 Hotel Nashville and Embassy Suites by Hilton Nashville Downtown which were acquired in April 2024. We expect to include the comparable hotel results for these two hotels beginning in the second quarter.

Comparable hotel EBITDA margins will decrease 80 basis points to 30 basis points compared to 2023 for the low and high ends of the forecasted comparable hotel RevPAR range respectively.

We expect to spend approximately $500 million to $605 million on capital expenditures.

Includes $17 million of net income and $29 million of EBITDA from the 1 Hotel Nashville and Embassy Suites by Hilton Nashville Downtown acquired in April 2024. Assumes no additional acquisitions and no dispositions during the year.

Assumes a total of $38 million of gains from business interruption proceeds expected to be received in 2024 related to Hurricane Ian and related to the Maui wildfire disruption. No further business interruption gains are expected. Also includes $32 million of insurance proceeds from Hurricane Ian received through May 1 2024 that result in a gain on property insurance settlement. No further property insurance gains have been included related to Hurricane Ian. We have collected $263 million out of a potential $310 million insurance recovery related to Hurricane Ian under our policy and we continue to work with our insurers to recover the remaining amount although there can be no assurances that we will be able to achieve this result.

For a discussion of items that may affect forecast results see the Notes to Financial Information.

Notes to Financial Information

FORECASTS

Our forecast of net income earnings per diluted share NAREIT and Adjusted FFO per diluted share EBITDA EBITDAre Adjusted EBITDAre and comparable hotel results are forward-looking statements and are not guarantees of future performance and involve known and unknown risks uncertainties and other factors which may cause actual results and performance to differ materially from those expressed or implied by these forecasts. Although we believe the expectations reflected in the forecasts are based upon reasonable assumptions we can give no assurance that the expectations will be attained or that the results will not be materially different. Risks that may affect these assumptions and forecasts include the following: potential changes in overall economic outlook make it inherently difficult to forecast the level of RevPAR; the amount and timing of debt payments may change significantly based on market conditions which will directly affect the level of interest expense and net income; the amount and timing of transactions involving shares of our common stock may change based on market conditions; and other risks and uncertainties associated with our business described herein and in our annual report on Form 10-K quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and current reports on Form 8-K filed with the SEC.

COMPARABLE HOTEL OPERATING STATISTICS AND RESULTS

To facilitate a year-to-year comparison of our operations we present certain operating statistics (i.e. Total RevPAR RevPAR average daily rate and average occupancy) and operating results (revenues expenses hotel EBITDA and associated margins) for the periods included in our reports on a comparable hotel basis in order to enable our investors to better evaluate our operating performance. We define our comparable hotels as those that: (i) are owned or leased by us as of the reporting date and are not classified as held-for-sale; and (ii) have not sustained substantial property damage or business interruption or undergone large-scale capital projects in each case requiring closures lasting one month or longer (as further defined below) during the reporting periods being compared.

We make adjustments to include recent acquisitions to include results for periods prior to our ownership. For these hotels since the year-over-year comparison includes periods prior to our ownership the changes will not necessarily correspond to changes in our actual results. Additionally operating results of hotels that we sell are excluded from the comparable hotel set once the transaction has closed or the hotel is classified as held-for-sale.

The hotel business is capital-intensive and renovations are a regular part of the business. Generally hotels under renovation remain comparable hotels. A large-scale capital project would cause a hotel to be excluded from our comparable hotel set if it requires the entire property to be closed to hotel guests for one month or longer.

Similarly hotels are excluded from our comparable hotel set from the date that they sustain substantial property damage or business interruption if it requires the property to be closed to hotel guests for one month or longer. In each case these hotels are returned to the comparable hotel set when the operations of the hotel have been included in our consolidated results for one full calendar year after the hotel has reopened. Often related to events that cause property damage and the closure of a hotel we will collect business interruption insurance proceeds for the near-term loss of business. These proceeds are included in gain on insurance settlements on our condensed consolidated statements of operations. Business interruption insurance gains related to a hotel that was excluded from our comparable hotel set also will be excluded from the comparable hotel results.

Of the 77 hotels that we owned as of March 31 2024 76 have been classified as comparable hotels. The operating results of the following properties that we owned as of March 31 2024 are excluded from comparable hotel results for these periods:

The Ritz-Carlton Naples (business disruption due to Hurricane Ian beginning in September 2022 reopened in July 2023); and

Sales and marketing expenses related to the development and sale of condominium units on a development parcel adjacent to Four Seasons Resort Orlando at Walt Disney World® Resort.

Additionally following the collapse of a portion of Highway 1 in California Alila Ventana Big Sur closed on March 30 2024 and has yet to reopen to guests. As a result the property will be removed from the comparable hotel set starting in the second quarter.

FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION

Operating results denominated in foreign currencies are translated using the prevailing exchange rates on the date of the transaction or monthly based on the weighted average exchange rate for the period. Therefore hotel statistics and results for non-U.S. properties include the effect of currency fluctuations consistent with our financial statement presentation.

NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES

Included in this press release are certain “non-GAAP financial measures” which are measures of our historical or future financial performance that are not calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP within the meaning of applicable SEC rules. They are as follows: (i) FFO and FFO per diluted share (both NAREIT and Adjusted) (ii) EBITDA (iii) EBITDAre and Adjusted EBITDAre and (iv) Comparable Hotel Operating Statistics and Results. The following discussion defines these measures and presents why we believe they are useful supplemental measures of our performance.

NAREIT FFO AND NAREIT FFO PER DILUTED SHARE

We present NAREIT FFO and NAREIT FFO per diluted share as non-GAAP measures of our performance in addition to our earnings per share (calculated in accordance with GAAP). We calculate NAREIT FFO per diluted share as our NAREIT FFO (defined as set forth below) for a given operating period as adjusted for the effect of dilutive securities divided by the number of fully diluted shares outstanding during such period in accordance with NAREIT guidelines. As noted in NAREIT’s Funds From Operations White Paper – 2018 Restatement NAREIT defines FFO as net income (calculated in accordance with GAAP) excluding depreciation and amortization related to certain real estate assets gains and losses from the sale of certain real estate assets gains and losses from change in control impairment expense of certain real estate assets and investments and adjustments for consolidated partially owned entities and unconsolidated affiliates. Adjustments for consolidated partially owned entities and unconsolidated affiliates are calculated to reflect our pro rata share of the FFO of those entities on the same basis.

We believe that NAREIT FFO per diluted share is a useful supplemental measure of our operating performance and that the presentation of NAREIT FFO per diluted share when combined with the primary GAAP presentation of diluted earnings per share provides beneficial information to investors. By excluding the effect of real estate depreciation amortization impairment expense and gains and losses from sales of depreciable real estate all of which are based on historical cost accounting and which may be of lesser significance in evaluating current performance we believe that such measures can facilitate comparisons of operating performance between periods and with other REITs even though NAREIT FFO per diluted share does not represent an amount that accrues directly to holders of our common stock. Historical cost accounting for real estate assets implicitly assumes that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time. As noted by NAREIT in its Funds From Operations White Paper – 2018 Restatement the primary purpose for including FFO as a supplemental measure of operating performance of a REIT is to address the artificial nature of historical cost depreciation and amortization of real estate and real estate-related assets mandated by GAAP. For these reasons NAREIT adopted the FFO metric in order to promote a uniform industry-wide measure of REIT operating performance.

Adjusted FFO per Diluted Share

We also present Adjusted FFO per diluted share when evaluating our performance because management believes that the exclusion of certain additional items described below provides useful supplemental information to investors regarding our ongoing operating performance. Management historically has made the adjustments detailed below in evaluating our performance in our annual budget process and for our compensation programs. We believe that the presentation of Adjusted FFO per diluted share when combined with both the primary GAAP presentation of diluted earnings per share and FFO per diluted share as defined by NAREIT provides useful supplemental information that is beneficial to an investor’s understanding of our operating performance. We adjust NAREIT FFO per diluted share for the following items which may occur in any period and refer to this measure as Adjusted FFO per diluted share:

Gains and Losses on the Extinguishment of Debt – We exclude the effect of finance charges and premiums associated with the extinguishment of debt including the acceleration of the write-off of deferred financing costs from the original issuance of the debt being redeemed or retired and incremental interest expense incurred during the refinancing period. We also exclude the gains on debt repurchases and the original issuance costs associated with the retirement of preferred stock. We believe that these items are not reflective of our ongoing finance costs.

Acquisition Costs – Under GAAP costs associated with completed property acquisitions that are considered business combinations are expensed in the year incurred. We exclude the effect of these costs because we believe they are not reflective of the ongoing performance of the Company.

Litigation Gains and Losses – We exclude the effect of gains or losses associated with litigation recorded under GAAP that we consider to be outside the ordinary course of business. We believe that including these items is not consistent with our ongoing operating performance.

Severance Expense –In certain circumstances we will add back hotel-level severance expenses when we do not believe that such expenses are reflective of the ongoing operation of our properties. Situations that would result in a severance add-back include but are not limited to (i) costs incurred as part of a broad-based reconfiguration of the operating model with the specific hotel operator for a portfolio of hotels and (ii) costs incurred at a specific hotel due to a broad-based and significant reconfiguration of a hotel and/or its workforce. We do not add back corporate-level severance costs or severance costs at an individual hotel that we consider to be incurred in the normal course of business.

In unusual circumstances we also may adjust NAREIT FFO for gains or losses that management believes are not representative of the Company’s current operating performance. For example in 2017 as a result of the reduction of the U.S. federal corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21% by the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act we remeasured our domestic deferred tax assets as of December 31 2017 and recorded a one-time adjustment to reduce our deferred tax assets and to increase the provision for income taxes by approximately $11 million. We do not consider this adjustment to be reflective of our ongoing operating performance and therefore we excluded this item from Adjusted FFO.

EBITDA

Earnings before Interest Expense Income Taxes Depreciation and Amortization (“EBITDA”) is a commonly used measure of performance in many industries. Management believes EBITDA provides useful information to investors regarding our results of operations because it helps us and our investors evaluate the ongoing operating performance of our properties after removing the impact of the Company’s capital structure (primarily interest expense) and its asset base (primarily depreciation and amortization). Management also believes the use of EBITDA facilitates comparisons between us and other lodging REITs hotel owners that are not REITs and other capital-intensive companies. Management uses EBITDA to evaluate property-level results and as one measure in determining the value of acquisitions and dispositions and like FFO and Adjusted FFO per diluted share it is widely used by management in the annual budget process and for our compensation programs.

EBITDAre and Adjusted EBITDAre

We present EBITDAre in accordance with NAREIT guidelines as defined in its September 2017 white paper “Earnings Before Interest Taxes Depreciation and Amortization for Real Estate” to provide an additional performance measure to facilitate the evaluation and comparison of the Company’s results with other REITs. NAREIT defines EBITDAre as net income (calculated in accordance with GAAP) excluding interest expense income tax depreciation and amortization gains or losses on disposition of depreciated property (including gains or losses on change of control) impairment expense for depreciated property and of investments in unconsolidated affiliates caused by a decrease in value of depreciated property in the affiliate and adjustments to reflect the entity’s pro rata share of EBITDAre of unconsolidated affiliates.

We make additional adjustments to EBITDAre when evaluating our performance because we believe that the exclusion of certain additional items described below provides useful supplemental information to investors regarding our ongoing operating performance. We believe that the presentation of Adjusted EBITDAre when combined with the primary GAAP presentation of net income is beneficial to an investor’s understanding of our operating performance. Adjusted EBITDAre also is similar to the measure used to calculate certain credit ratios for our credit facility and senior notes. We adjust EBITDAre for the following items which may occur in any period and refer to this measure as Adjusted EBITDAre:

Property Insurance Gains – We exclude the effect of property insurance gains reflected in our condensed consolidated statements of operations because we believe that including them in Adjusted EBITDAre is not consistent with reflecting the ongoing performance of our assets. In addition property insurance gains could be less important to investors given that the depreciated asset book value written off in connection with the calculation of the property insurance gain often does not reflect the market value of real estate assets.

Acquisition Costs – Under GAAP costs associated with completed property acquisitions that are considered business combinations are expensed in the year incurred. We exclude the effect of these costs because we believe they are not reflective of the ongoing performance of the Company.

Litigation Gains and Losses – We exclude the effect of gains or losses associated with litigation recorded under GAAP that we consider to be outside the ordinary course of business. We believe that including these items is not consistent with our ongoing operating performance.

Severance Expense – In certain circumstances we will add back hotel-level severance expenses when we do not believe that such expenses are reflective of the ongoing operation of our properties. Situations that would result in a severance add-back include but are not limited to (i) costs incurred as part of a broad-based reconfiguration of the operating model with the specific hotel operator for a portfolio of hotels and (ii) costs incurred at a specific hotel due to a broad-based and significant reconfiguration of a hotel and/or its workforce. We do not add back corporate-level severance costs or severance costs at an individual hotel that we consider to be incurred in the normal course of business.

In unusual circumstances we also may adjust EBITDAre for gains or losses that management believes are not representative of the Company’s current operating performance. The last adjustment of this nature was a 2013 exclusion of a gain from an eminent domain claim.

Limitations on the Use of NAREIT FFO per Diluted Share Adjusted FFO per Diluted Share EBITDA EBITDAre and Adjusted EBITDAre

We calculate EBITDAre and NAREIT FFO per diluted share in accordance with standards established by NAREIT which may not be comparable to measures calculated by other companies that do not use the NAREIT definition of EBITDAre and FFO or do not calculate FFO per diluted share in accordance with NAREIT guidance. In addition although EBITDAre and FFO per diluted share are useful measures when comparing our results to other REITs they may not be helpful to investors when comparing us to non-REITs. We also calculate Adjusted FFO per diluted share and Adjusted EBITDAre which measures are not in accordance with NAREIT guidance and may not be comparable to measures calculated by other REITs or by other companies. This information should not be considered as an alternative to net income operating profit cash from operations or any other operating performance measure calculated in accordance with GAAP. Cash expenditures for various long-term assets (such as renewal and replacement capital expenditures) interest expense (for EBITDA EBITDAre and Adjusted EBITDAre purposes only) severance expense related to significant property-level reconfiguration and other items have been and will be made and are not reflected in the EBITDA EBITDAre Adjusted EBITDAre NAREIT FFO per diluted share and Adjusted FFO per diluted share presentations. Management compensates for these limitations by separately considering the impact of these excluded items to the extent they are material to operating decisions or assessments of our operating performance. Our consolidated statements of operations and consolidated statements of cash flows in the Company’s annual report on Form 10-K and quarterly reports on Form 10-Q include interest expense capital expenditures and other excluded items all of which should be considered when evaluating our performance as well as the usefulness of our non-GAAP financial measures. Additionally NAREIT FFO per diluted share Adjusted FFO per diluted share EBITDA EBITDAre and Adjusted EBITDAre should not be considered as measures of our liquidity or indicative of funds available to fund our cash needs including our ability to make cash distributions. In addition NAREIT FFO per diluted share and Adjusted FFO per diluted share do not measure and should not be used as measures of amounts that accrue directly to stockholders’ benefit.

Similarly EBITDAre Adjusted EBITDAre NAREIT FFO and Adjusted FFO per diluted share include adjustments for the pro rata share of our equity investments and NAREIT FFO and Adjusted FFO per diluted share include adjustments for the pro rata share of non-controlling partners in consolidated partnerships. Our equity investments consist of interests ranging from 11% to 67% in eight domestic and international partnerships that own a total of 35 properties and a vacation ownership development. Due to the voting rights of the outside owners we do not control and therefore do not consolidate these entities. The non-controlling partners in consolidated partnerships primarily consist of the approximate 1% interest in Host LP held by unaffiliated limited partners and a 15% interest held by an unaffiliated limited partner in a partnership owning one hotel for which we do control the entity and therefore consolidate its operations. These pro rata results for NAREIT FFO and Adjusted FFO per diluted share EBITDAre and Adjusted EBITDAre were calculated as set forth in the definitions above. Readers should be cautioned that the pro rata results presented in these measures for consolidated partnerships (for NAREIT FFO and Adjusted FFO per diluted share) and equity investments may not accurately depict the legal and economic implications of our investments in these entities.

Comparable Hotel Property Level Operating Results

We present certain operating results for our hotels such as hotel revenues expenses food and beverage profit and EBITDA (and the related margins) on a comparable hotel or ""same store"" basis as supplemental information for our investors. Our comparable hotel results present operating results for our hotels without giving effect to dispositions or properties that experienced closures due to renovations or property damage as discussed in “Comparable Hotel Operating Statistics and Results” above. We present comparable hotel EBITDA to help us and our investors evaluate the ongoing operating performance of our comparable hotels after removing the impact of the Company’s capital structure (primarily interest expense) and its asset base (primarily depreciation and amortization expense). Corporate-level costs and expenses also are removed to arrive at property-level results. We believe these property-level results provide investors with supplemental information about the ongoing operating performance of our comparable hotels. Comparable hotel results are presented both by location and for the Company’s properties in the aggregate. We eliminate from our comparable hotel level operating results severance costs related to broad-based and significant property-level reconfiguration that is not considered to be within the normal course of business as we believe this elimination provides useful supplemental information that is beneficial to an investor’s understanding of our ongoing operating performance. We also eliminate depreciation and amortization expense because even though depreciation and amortization expense are property-level expenses these non-cash expenses which are based on historical cost accounting for real estate assets implicitly assume that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time. As noted earlier because real estate values historically have risen or fallen with market conditions many real estate industry investors have considered presentation of historical cost accounting for operating results to be insufficient.

Because of the elimination of corporate-level costs and expenses gains or losses on disposition certain severance expenses and depreciation and amortization expense the comparable hotel operating results we present do not represent our total revenues expenses operating profit or net income and should not be used to evaluate our performance as a whole. Management compensates for these limitations by separately considering the impact of these excluded items to the extent they are material to operating decisions or assessments of our operating performance. Our condensed consolidated statements of operations include such amounts all of which should be considered by investors when evaluating our performance.

We present these hotel operating results on a comparable hotel basis because we believe that doing so provides investors and management with useful information for evaluating the period-to-period performance of our hotels and facilitates comparisons with other hotel REITs and hotel owners. In particular these measures assist management and investors in distinguishing whether increases or decreases in revenues and/or expenses are due to growth or decline of operations at comparable hotels (which represent the vast majority of our portfolio) or from other factors. While management believes that presentation of comparable hotel results is a supplemental measure that provides useful information in evaluating our ongoing performance this measure is not used to allocate resources or to assess the operating performance of each of our hotels as these decisions are based on data for individual hotels and are not based on comparable hotel results in the aggregate. For these reasons we believe comparable hotel operating results when combined with the presentation of GAAP operating profit revenues and expenses provide useful information to investors and management.

“We are excited to add the 1 Hotel Nashville and Embassy Suites by Hilton Nashville Downtown to our portfolio and establish a presence in one of the country’s most exciting cities"" Host Hotels & Resorts President and CEO James Risoleo said in a statement. ""The newly built property has a prime location in Nashville a top-performing market which had an impressive RevPAR CAGR of 7.7 percent from 2000 to 2023 even while absorbing new supply. A major leisure destination and the #2 ranked convention destination in the United States Nashville also has a recently expanded airport and a new stadium that is expected to attract more entertainment and sporting events. With meaningful in-place cash flow multiple demand generators and no expected near-term capital expenditure requirements we expect the Property will generate outsized growth as it stabilizes enhancing the quality of our portfolio and driving additional value creation for our stockholders.”

The newly built LEED Silver property opened in 2022 and is located two blocks from numerous live music and entertainment venues in Nashville’s famed Lower Broadway entertainment district. The Property stands directly across from the Music City Convention Center adjacent to the Bridgestone arena home of the NHL Nashville Predators and within a 10-minute drive of Nissan Stadium the Country Music Hall of Fame Museum Vanderbilt University Tennessee State University and Centennial Park. The MCCC has continued to set record attendance numbers by attracting larger events and it has promising definite bookings in future years. The new Nissan Stadium home of the NFL Tennessee Titans is also expected to generate increased demand as the stadium’s dome will allow for year-round activation beginning with the 2027 season. In addition the Nashville International Airport is the fastest growing airport in the United States with current passenger traffic 33 percent above 2019. The recent $1.5 billion airport expansion added six international gates and eight satellite gates and another $1.5 billion expansion is already underway with completion expected in 2028.

The Property has a combined 721 oversized rooms that average approximately 500 square feet with a 75 percent suite mix. It offers seven separate food and beverage outlets including Harriet’s Rooftop which provides guests with exclusive views of Music City’s skyline in an elevated nightlife setting. Among other amenities the property has a Bamford Wellness spa with six treatment rooms two fitness centers a yoga studio and 33000 square feet of shared meeting space including a 9400 square foot ballroom and 9300 square feet of pre-function space.

Supply growth is expected to continue in Nashville with most projects in the planning stages and in the select service chain scale. Host believes the Property is differentiated from the future supply as a result of its central location and diversified product offerings that provide distinct value propositions to customers. The company expects the Property to stabilize between approximately 10-12x EBITDA3 in the 2026-2028 time frame.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNvc3Rhci5jb20vYXJ0aWNsZS8xNjYxMzU0OC9ob3N0LWhvdGVscy1yZWFkeS10by1idXktd2lsbGluZy10by1raWNrLWRlYWxzLWxvb3Nl0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Host Hotels Ready To Buy Willing To 'Kick Deals Loose',"Executives at the largest hospitality-focused public real estate investment trust are itching to spend money this year.

Bethesda Maryland-based Host Hotels & Resorts ended 2023 with $2.9 billion of available liquidity an amount that President and CEO Jim Risoleo said gives the REIT an advantage in negotiating acquisitions once attractive hotels and resorts hit the market.

""Frankly there just aren't a lot of properties that are currently listed for sale certainly not assets that would interest Host but that's really not slowing us down at all"" Risoleo said. ""We are talking to our competitors in the industry our friends in the industry and others to try to kick deals loose that are Host-type assets.

""We are leaning on our relationships. We're leaning on our reputation on our ability to close deals all-cash and that really gives us a very meaningful competitive advantage. And we believe this is the year to to get the balance sheet to work.""

Ideally the U.S. Federal Reserve will soon announce the first of several interest rate cuts Risoleo said and that will bring sellers out of hibernation.

""It's going to also spark competition for those assets"" that will come to market he said. ""Our point of view is we have the balance sheet; we can do it all. We want to get out there and we want to get ahead of the pack. And I hope over the course of the next several months that we're going to be able to tell you that we've been a net acquirer early in 2024.""

Asked about the wave of commercial mortgage-backed securities maturing this year and next and whether that will drive hotel sales Risoleo said the wall of distress hasn't materialized.

""This year there's about $26 billion of full-service loans that will be maturing and I know that earlier in the pandemic there was a lot of talk of distress"" Risoleo said. ""Frankly we haven't seen it materialize certainly not on assets or markets that would interest us. But we'll continue to track it.

""There may be pressure as we get later into the year because one of the things that other hotel owners are going to have to deal with sooner or later is reinvesting in their portfolio.""

Host is interested in acquiring large hotels and resorts with diverse demand drivers in the group business transient and leisure segments. Risoleo added ""bigger is better for us"" and that acquiring hotels in urban markets might be on the table again.

What's Next for Maui

Host's resorts on Maui — the Hyatt Regency Maui Resort and Spa the Andaz Maui at Wailea Resort and the Fairmont Kea Lani — continue to skew the performance of the REIT's portfolio as leisure demand decreased following the wildfires in August. Yet Host's Maui properties have benefited from a steady source of group demand.

Sourav Ghosh Host's executive vice president and chief financial officer said 2023 was ""the year of group and convention hotel recovery"" adding that group room revenue increased 21% year over year and the volume of group room nights sold recovered to 95% of 2019 levels.

""It is worth noting that our group results were positively skewed by disaster and recovery bookings in Maui"" he said. ""Group room revenue exceeded 2022 by 13% in the fourth quarter driven by an increase in both rate and room nights and we estimate roughly half of that growth can be attributed to recovery and relief groups on Maui.""

Efforts to rebuild Lahaina are ongoing and Risoleo said the west side of Maui will take more time to recover.

""In the interim we have been working with relief agencies in particular the Red Cross. We have contracted with the Red Cross for 350 rooms at the Hyatt Regency Maui through the end of May and we're hopeful that that will be extended while the recovery moves forward"" Risoleo said.

Host is also awaiting a resolution to Hawaii Gov. Josh Green's threat to ban short-term rentals if they aren't opened up as housing for displaced residents. In December Green said the state needed approximately 3000 short-term rental units set aside for Maui residents.

""March 1 is a pivotal date in our mind"" Risoleo said. ""The governor of the state of Hawaii has stated that if the owners of short-term rentals on Maui don't come to terms with allowing their units to be utilized by the displaced residents then he is considering a ban on short-term rentals. ... On the island of Maui in total there's about 30000 short-term rentals. It's quite significant and we're tracking it very closely.""

Risoleo added he hopes leisure travelers will return sooner to Host's two resorts in the Wailea area: the Andaz Maui at Wailea Resort and the Fairmont Kea Lani. Host concluded 2023 by wrapping up a renovation of the Fairmont Kea Lani's lobby and guestrooms in December.

""We're confident that over time as the consumer begins to understand the differentiation between Wailea which is a completely different submarket than the west side and Ka'anapali that will lead the cadence of business pickup"" he said.

Full-Year Outlook and Earnings Highlights

In its 2024 outlook Host Hotels & Resorts forecasts hotel revenue per available room to grow between 2.5% and 5.5% over 2023.

Adi Badri situated in Haryana near the Himachal Pradesh border is believed to be the river’s origin point.

Haryana Chief Secretary Sanjeev Kaushal and Himachal Pradesh Chief Secretary Ram Subhag Singh signed the MoU on behalf of the respective state governments for the construction of the Adi Badri Dam. Haryana Chief Minister Manohar Lal Khattar and his Himachal counter part Jai Ram Thakur were also present.

“The Saraswati river will be rejuvenated with the construction of Adi Badri dam. The religious beliefs will also be revived with the rejuvenation of the Saraswati river. Along with this the area will also develop as a pilgrimage site” Khattar said

The Haryana CM said the objective of the project is to revive the Saraswati river as well as increase ground water level. With the commissioning of the dam the flood situation arising out of excessive rainfall during rainy days will also be dealt with. The lake being built near it will also promote tourism he added.

“I had travelled in 1986-87 in connection with the research on the revival of the Saraswati river. This journey started from Adi Badri in Yamunanagar and reached till Kutch. With the construction of Adi Badri dam water will flow continuously in the Saraswati river throughout the year” he noted.

Kurukshetra University and Haryana Saraswati Heritage Development Board are conducting the research on the mythical river.

Khattar said the Adi Badri dam will be built on 31.66 hectares of land in Himachal Pradesh and an amount of Rs 215.33 crore will be spent for the same.

“It will store 224.58 hectare metres of water every year of which Himachal Pradesh will get 61.88 hectare metres of water and Haryana the remaining which will flow into the Saraswati river” he said.

The width of the dam will be 101.06 metres and height 20.5 metres.

Notably the dam at Adi Badri will also get water from the Somb river that falls in the Yamuna near Adi Badri in Yamunanagar.

Meanwhile Thakur said the Adi Badri dam will meet the requirement of irrigation and drinking water for both states. Due to the flow of water in the Saraswati river this area will also be developed from the point of view of religious tourism he added.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi had also expressed his desire for the revival of the Saraswati river the chief minister said. Proper compensation will be given to 21 families whose land will be used for the construction of the dam he added.

Thakur said in the coming days foundation stone of the dam will be laid after completing all formalities related to the project.

Governments of both the states are also preparing the roadmap for many other projects together. This will develop tourism in both the regions he added.

Khattar also said that the area from Kalka to Kalesar is important from tourism’s point of view.

Many religious and tourist places come in this area including Adi Badri Lohagarh Kapal Mochan Mata Mantra Devi he said.

He said several projects will be worked out in collaboration with Himachal Pradesh including construction of a dam at Hathnikund barrage.

In this dam water flowing from mountains to the Hathnikund barrage will be stored so that the crops can also be saved from flood-like situations. Survey work for this dam will start soon he said.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMieGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmF1dG9ldm9sdXRpb24uY29tL25ld3MvY29tcGFjdC14Zm9pbC1ib2FyZC1jbGFpbXMtaXQtY2FuLXJlYWNoLXNwZWVkcy1jb21wYXJhYmxlLXRvLTUwMC1ocC1ib2F0cy0xNzk0NzguaHRtbNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Compact XFoil Board Claims It Can Reach Speeds Comparable to 500 HP Boats,"HP

Designed in Silicon Valley California by PLX Devices XFoil promises to offer the perfect solution: a watercraft that can serve as all of the above while also making you feel like you’re in a high-performance speed boat. Everything is wrapped in a compact lightweight and durable package that’s small enough to fit in your mid-size sedan.The XFoil electric board can be used on any water from rivers to lakes and oceans. It measures 66.5” (169 cm) in length which makes it shorter than child-sized surfboards. But unlike those this board can hold up to 250 lb (113 kg). With a carbon fiber construction the XFoil boasts of being five times stronger and lighter than steel. As for its metal components they are made from aircraft-grade corrosion-resistant aluminum. It has handles for easy transportation and its battery compartment is of course waterproof.This versatile waterboard can be configured in several ways although not everything is included in the available Standard and Sport packages. You have to opt for add-ons and pay extra if you want to enjoy the full experience. For instance there are a foil trainer and a full foil SUP available to purchase as accessories you can check them out on the company’s website As for the included components in both the Standard and Sport offers you’ve got the XFoil board itself the 6000W (8) brushless motor a wireless remote controller and a standard-range removable battery that claims to offer up to 75 minutes of runtime (a 25 miles/40 km range). The battery comes with a standard 300W charger.But there’s also the option to get a long-range battery that will boost your sessions to up to 120 minutes on a charge (40 miles/64 km range). This battery comes with a fast 600W charger.Depending on your riding preferences you can attach the electric motor to different mast assemblies allowing you to achieve both surf and foil configurations.

The Sport package also throws in the 600W charger and surf fins.A great thing about the XFoil is that it doesn’t require any advanced skills to be used as it is designed in a way that allows for progressive learning being great for both beginners and experts. When used in its surf configuration the board allows you to ride it on your belly sitting down squatting or standing up. In its foil configuration you can also use the board standing or if you’re feeling more experienced you can actually lift the XFoil and feel like you’re flying above the water.As for the wireless remote controller with Bluetooth technology it has an OLED display it’s waterproof and it feels really comfortable in your hand. It comes with data telemetry cruise control and an anti-runaway feature that stops the motor of the board in case you drop the controller in the water.A dedicated mobile app further enhances your control over the XFoil allowing you to tune the board according to your riding style and choose between different modes such as Trainer Cruise or Pro.Right now the XFoil board is available on Indiegogo with the Standard package being priced at $3800 and the Sport package at $4700.

Downtown’s third-tallest skyscraper addresses challenges

The pandemic remote working tenant downsizing and a flight to quality are challenges facing New York City-based DRA Advisors. In downtown Cleveland they are fighting those challenges with a 37-year-old skyscraper 200 Public Square.

To sharpen that weapon DRA is about to start pumping millions of dollars into the 46-story tower to update the property with new and improved tenant amenities technology and brighter more inviting public spaces. DRA acquired the 1.27-million-square-foot tower eight-story glass atrium and 757-space parking garage in 2018 from Harbor Group International for $187 million. The complex opened in 1985 as the headquarters of Standard Oil of Ohio (Sohio) before it was taken over by BP America and moved its offices to Chicago in 1998.

Joining forces with DRA is architect Vocon of Cleveland construction manager The Albert M. Higley Company of Cleveland lighting consultant Ambia Lighting Design of Cincinnati plus mechanical electrical and plumbing consultant Karpinski Engineering of Cleveland. Together they will take on the task of turning this red and mahogany granite behemoth from the era of new-wave music leg warmers and Swatch watches into a 21st-century magnet for office tenants.

Their first effort will primarily be to update the building’s third level and a small part of the first level featuring a brighter lobby new café space enhanced conference center and improved fitness center according to plans submitted last week to the city’s Building & Housing Department.

Location of proposed improvements to Level 3 at 200 Public Square according to plans submitted to the city’s Building & Housing Department (Vocon).

First-floor improvements are limited to renovated bathrooms and a modernized garage lobby featuring a reflective ceiling and lighting. The goal is to brighten what has been a dim interior space that isn’t near any windows. This lobby is below the Level 3 escalator lobby. The total area to be improved on the first and third levels measures 35420 square feet and amount to $2.95 million worth of improvements.

A source close to DRA who wasn’t authorized to speak publicly said the building’s owner is just getting started with more improvements due to be announced in the next 30-60 days.

“(DRA) is in fact considering a wealth of building improvements in various areas which is quite typical of any sophisticated investor for a building like 200 Public Square” the source said.

Planned for the building’s third level is a brighter plaza overlooking the atrium thanks to a new reflective ceiling and lighting. There will also be a refreshed café near the escalator lobby cardio room and fitness lobby on the north side improved locker rooms in the northwest corner four renovated conference rooms including one with retractable seating on risers along the south side plus new technology and better heating-ventilating-air conditioning plans show.

Rendering of the renovated café and amenity space on the third level of 200 Public Square. The improvements include reflective lighting panels in the ceilings. These will be provided in multiple locations on the third level to brighten up an otherwise dim interior (Vocon).

The building has offices for many well-known companies. Huntington Bank has primary naming rights to the building. It is also the headquarters for steelmaking-mining giant Cleveland-Cliffs Inc. and law firm Benesch Friedlander Coplan & Aronoff LLP. Cliffs is making improvements to its office space but Benesch may still be looking for a new higher-end space to call its own. Brian Hurtuk managing director of Colliers Cleveland who handles leasing at 200 Public Square did not respond to an e-mail seeking more information about the improvements.

But 200 Public Square which was considered a solid Class A building may have slipped a bit in its ranking in the absence of recent facility upgrades. It has taken hits to its occupancy since October 2020 when real estate brokerage and market researcher JLL said the building was 83 percent leased at an average asking rent of $29.50 per square foot.

Last fall investment banking giant Morgan Stanley gave back nearly half of its space at 200 Public Square. The skyscraper averages 24440 square feet per floor in the main part of the tower. Morgan Stanley recently occupied the entire 26th floor; it gave back 11776 square feet to the landlord. That followed accounting powerhouse Pricewaterhouse Coopers LLP (PwC) giving back 8040 square feet of space on the 18th floor while retaining 9334 square feet.

Meanwhile financial security firm AML Rightsource decided to relocate its headquarters from the 31st floor at 200 Public Square to 43415 square feet on the second and third floors at the 20-story AECOM Centre 1300 E. 9th St. There it is spending nearly $2.5 million on interior alterations for its new offices according to plans filed with the city.

Two of downtown’s tallest buildings are pictured here — 200 Public Square and reflected in its atrium is Terminal Tower which stands on the west side of Public Square. This view is from September 2021 (Google).

In the same 2020 JLL report referenced earlier AECOM Centre was 45 percent vacant. But after Rugby Realty of Secaucus NJ acquired the former Penton Building in 2018 for $36.9 million the landlord invested $14 million to bring the property back up to Class A standards. The building began attracting office tenants again including Perspectus Architecture law firm Weston Hurd plus the United Church of Christ and its Cornerstone Church Building & Loan Fund.

The building also has drawn in retail/restaurant tenants like Colossal Cupcakes Anna in the Raw Let’s Talk Let’s Eat and the Winking Lizard Tavern including its outdoor patio that just received favorable reviews from the City Planning Commission on Friday. Now occupancy is pushing back up to near 80 percent according to Terry Coyne vice chairman of real estate firm Newmark’s Cleveland office who handles leasing at AECOM Centre.

“We are easily the most successful building leasing during COVID” he said. “The future of office space can be seen in this building. Amenities matter. An active involve landlord matters. When you put those two together you can still do well even in the worst of times.”

Tenants are making such moves even in the midst of the pandemic due to what’s called in real estate a “flight to quality.” In short tenants are seeking higher-quality spaces even if it means paying higher rents. Downtown Cleveland arguably has only two so-called “Trophy Class” buildings — Key Tower and the Ernst & Young Building. Key is Cleveland’s tallest office tower at 947 feet and E&Y is its newest opening in 2012. Both command top-of-the-market rents and are at least 90 percent full JLL says.

Huntington Bank has primary naming rights of 200 Public Square with Cleveland-Cliffs having secondary naming rights. Seven other tenants also have naming privileges at Cleveland’s third-tallest tower (Google).

“Flight to quality is a trend that has been much discussed over the last decade” JLL said in its Fourth Quarter 2021 Cleveland office market report. “However the statistics have never been as striking as they were in 2021. Of the 735681square feet of negative absorption recorded in 2021 96.8 percent of the occupancy losses were recorded in Class B assets. Class A vacancy stands at a modest 15.3 percent while Class B vacancy has increased to 26 percent.”

The report noted that downtown Class B office vacancy would be much higher if it wasn’t for more than 1 million square feet in Class B office space being converted to residential hotel or retail spaces. That includes 420000 of Erieview Tower‘s 740000 square feet of office space being converted to other uses. The 496000-square-foot 45 Erieview office building will become apartments co-working spaces and restaurant space. Innovation Landing 1835-1845 Prospect Ave. will see its 64000 square feet of office space become apartments. And the 51443-square-foot Baker Building 1940 E. 6th St. will become the Fidelity Hotel.

“A similar trend is playing out with asking rents” the JLL report added. “Class A asking rents have held steady through the pandemic while several Class B landlords have recently reduced rents by $1.00 per square feet or more in an effort to become more competitive.”

Occupancy of office spaces in Greater Cleveland fell by 735681 square feet in 2021 making it the second-worst drop in the last 20 years exceeded only by the 776412-square-foot decline in 2009 following the global financial crisis. Office vacancy in Cleveland now stands at 21.8 percent an increase of 1.7 percent since the onset of the pandemic the JLL report showed.

“As a result negotiating leverage has shifted in favor of tenants in part because of escalating vacancy but also due to the long-term uncertainty around office demand brought on by shifting work patterns mainly work from home and hybrid work policies” JLL said.

HII,Huntington Ingalls Industries,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiO2h0dHBzOi8vZ2NhcHRhaW4uY29tL2dlLXNoaXB5YXJkLXVucGFpZC1zdXBlci1jYXJyaWVyLWJpbGwv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,GE Haggles With Shipyard Over Unpaid US Navy Supercarrier Bill,"By Tony Capaccio (Bloomberg) Four years after the U.S. Navy’s costliest warship was hobbled by a flaw in its propulsion system prime contractor Huntington Ingalls Industries and subcontractor General Electric are still haggling over who will pay for fixing the defect.

The $13 billion USS Gerald R. Ford was forced to return to port during post-delivery sea trials in early 2018 after the failure of a main thrust bearing a key propulsion system component that’s made by GE.

Huntington Ingalls has repaired the faulty gear and the Navy advanced funds for the work. The “actual root cause” of the defective part was “machining errors” by GE workers according to Navy documents. The bearing one of four that transfers thrust from the ship’s four propeller shafts overheated but “after securing the equipment to prevent damage the ship safely returned to port” the Navy said in a March 2018 memo to Congress.

The Ford returned to sea for additional trials after the damage was contained. Now the Navy wants to deploy it by midyear on its first operational patrol after years of problems and delays formally bringing its carrier force to 11.

Vice Admiral Thomas Moore then head of the Naval Sea Systems Command told reporters in 2019 that the Navy was paying for the repairs until GE and Huntington “figure out who has the liability for it. At some point you’ve got to pay them to get the work done.” The Navy has declined to say how much it paid Huntington although in 2018 it asked Congress to shift $30 million from other accounts to start work.

The companies are still hashing things out.

“We are continuing to work on a final agreement with GE to resolve this claim” Danny Hernandez a spokesman for Newport News Virginia-based Huntington Ingalls said in a statement. Sean Smith a spokesman for Boston-based GE said “we continue working with the U.S. Navy and Huntington Ingalls to resolve this issue.” GE hasn’t commented publicly on the Navy’s contention that its workers were at fault.

Captain Clay Doss a Navy spokesman said the service “does not comment on ongoing negotiations.”

The Ford’s propulsion system flaws are separate from reliability issues that plagued its advanced system to launch and recover aircraft and the elevators needed to move munitions from below decks.

Last November IBM (IBM 1.75%) completed its spin-off of Kyndryl (KD 1.70%) the managed infrastructure services segment of its Global Technology Services segment. Each IBM shareholder received one new share of Kyndryl for every five shares of IBM they held.

IBM still retained 20% of Kyndryl's outstanding shares following the spin-off but it plans to sell that entire stake this year. Presumably the separation would enable IBM to dump its slowest-growth legacy business to focus on expanding its higher-growth hybrid cloud and AI businesses.

Kyndryl's stock opened at $31.50 on Nov. 3 but it now trades at about $17 per share. During that same period IBM's stock advanced about 4%. That divergence wasn't surprising since IBM framed the spin-off as a way to jettison its weakest businesses to invest in more promising markets.

But are investors overestimating IBM's turnaround potential while ignoring Kyndryl's ability to expand without being tethered to Big Blue? Let's take a fresh look at both companies to decide.

IBM's turnaround plan

Arvind Krishna IBM's former cloud chief succeeded Ginni Rometty as IBM's CEO in 2020. Krishna focused on expanding Red Hat (which IBM acquired for $34 billion in 2019) as the foundation of its hybrid cloud and AI business then orchestrated Kyndryl's spin-off to accelerate that transformation.

In previous decades IBM helped large companies manage their on-site data centers. But that market was turned upside down by public cloud infrastructure platforms -- like Amazon's (AMZN 1.34%) Amazon Web Services (AWS) and Microsoft's (MSFT 1.69%) Azure -- which let companies remotely access data storage and computing services.

IBM's failure to keep pace with Amazon and Microsoft as well as the sluggish growth of its legacy IT services software and hardware segments caused its revenue growth to stagnate over the past decade. However Krishna believes that IBM can still grow by providing more hybrid cloud services which process the data that flows between the private and public clouds.

By leveraging Red Hat's open source software it plans to provide AI-powered hybrid cloud services that are cross-compatible with AWS Azure and other public cloud platforms. IBM believes that flexible transformation will enable it to grow its annual revenue by the mid-single digits and its annual free cash flow (FCF) by the high single-digits from 2022 to 2024.

However IBM might also eventually cut its dividend which currently boasts a high forward yield of 4.9% to free up more cash for that expansion. If that happens IBM will lose its status as a Dividend Aristocrat of the S&P 500.

Kyndryl's vision of a future without IBM

Kyndryl serves over 4000 customers including half of the Fortune 500 and operates in 63 countries with a workforce of about 90000.

On its own Kyndryl's growth rates look dismal. Its revenue fell 7% in 2019 declined 5% in 2020 as the pandemic disrupted large enterprises and dropped another 2% year over year in the first nine months of 2021. It was also unprofitable throughout all three periods -- but it generated a slim profit on a pro forma basis after excluding the spin-off costs.

Most of IBM's investors likely looked at those numbers remembered why Big Blue was so eager to divest the struggling business and immediately sold their new shares of Kyndryl. Yet Kyndryl believes the spin-off will actually more than double its total addressable market (TAM) from $240 billion to $510 billion by 2024 since it will no longer be tethered to IBM and be allowed to pursue new deals with Big Blue's direct competitors.

Kyndryl is still the largest player in the managed infrastructure and implementation services space and it generates roughly twice as much revenue as its top competitor DXC Technology (DXC 2.87%). Without IBM holding it back Kyndryl could leverage that market-leading position to aggressively expand and start growing its revenue again.

Kyndryl is led by Martin Schroeter who previously spent more than a decade at IBM. Some investors might find Schroeter's experience reassuring but Kyndryl might need to hire an outsider with fresh ideas to turn around its massive business. Kyndryl also doesn't pay a dividend yet since its operations only generated a low single-digit percentage of IBM's FCF in previous years.

The valuations and verdict

Analysts expect IBM's revenue to decline 15% in 2022 as it laps its divestment of Kyndryl. But in 2023 they expect its revenue to rise 4% as its streamlined business gradually grows again. However they expect Kyndryl's revenue to continue to decline in both 2022 and 2023 as the company attempts to stabilize its business and gain new customers.

IBM's stock trades at 16 times its earnings and two times its sales for fiscal 2022. Those low valuations could limit its downside potential as it gradually transforms its business. Kyndryl can't be valued by its earnings yet but the stock looks dirt cheap at 0.2 times its 2022 sales.

I believe IBM's profitability dividends and clearer plans for the future make it a better buy than Kyndryl right now. If Kyndryl can actually secure more customers by breaking free of IBM's legacy ecosystem it might be deeply undervalued right now. However investors shouldn't touch the stock until they actually see some green shoots in its upcoming earnings reports.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMicWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJvc3Rvbmdsb2JlLmNvbS8yMDIyLzAxLzIyL21ldHJvL29sZGVyLXdvcmtlcnMtcHJlc3MtYWdlLWRpc2NyaW1pbmF0aW9uLWNsYWltcy1jaGFsbGVuZ2UtaWJtLWxheW9mZnMv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Older workers press age discrimination claims in challenge to IBM layoffs,"Dozens of former Massachusetts employees many of them Lotus veterans are among more than 1000 laid-off workers nationally who have charged IBM with forcing out older staffers over the past decade as part of a strategy to build a younger workforce. All of the employees were in their 40s 50s and 60s when they lost their jobs. IBM has been fighting the charges for over two years saying they have no merit.

More recently when they’d moved into their peak earnings-and-savings years — just as IBM was scrambling to remake itself for what it called “a new era of technology” — they were summarily fired.

They were a youthful brigade at Lotus Software in the 1990s when the Cambridge firm was revolutionizing office work with its cutting-edge e-mail platform. When their company was swallowed by IBM they helped the high-tech giant push into big data and digital health.

Taken together the allegations — filed both in federal court and with hundreds of private arbitrators — amount to one of the largest age discrimination cases in US history. At a time of heightened attention to racial and gender issues the ex-IBMers are spotlighting what they say is another pervasive though often hidden bias in corporate America.

“They basically throw you away after a long career” said Kathleen Stuart of Milton who worked for Lotus and IBM for 25 years. She was let go in 2019 when she was 61 and said she’d just received an excellent review for her work as a compliance manager. “I did so much at IBM. I went above and beyond. And the way it ended was so wrong.”

Stoneham resident Philip Monson 61 logged 29 years at IBM and Lotus. He worked as an application developer on the Lotus Notes product and later in sales and business development for IBM. “Every job I ever had at IBM people came and patted me on the shoulder” he said. He once won an in-house award for fixing a glitch in a base-camp communications system during a company trek to Mount Everest.

Then in 2019 when Monson was 59 he was asked to join a phone call with a manager in New York who told him his job was being eliminated because a product he had worked on was being phased out.

“She started reading from a script” he said. “I had known for a long time that IBM was doing that to people of a certain age. But I thought that with my background and awards and record of great performance I was fine. I was shocked when it happened.”

Monson and Stuart are plaintiffs in a pair of lawsuits filed against IBM by nearly 200 former employees seeking class-action status in US District Court in New York. The outcome could have broad implications for workers and employers elsewhere because IBM has long been seen as a bellwether in American business.

“People are definitely watching these cases for what it means for age discrimination and generally for older workers” said Catherine Ruckelshaus general counsel at the National Employment Law Project in New York a group that advocates for workers’ rights.

Ruckelshaus said it’s become tougher to track age bias suits in the aftermath of a Supreme Court decision in 2018 in the Epic Systems v. Lewis case that allows companies to use arbitration clauses in contracts to prevent workers from joining together in employment lawsuits. Since then she said employers have been able to effectively channel many age discrimination complaints to private arbitration hearings where the proceedings and outcomes are invisible to the public.

That shift in legal practice is at work in a big way in the IBM case. The challenges to the firm’s rolling series of job cuts are fragmented because as a condition of receiving severance the company required employees to sign pacts that included promises not to join in collective legal action. Only those who refused are being represented in the federal suits. More than 800 others who signed the agreements are contesting their dismissals in individual arbitration cases nationwide.

The cases have been moving forward slowly. Boston lawyer Shannon Liss-Riordan who represents more than 1000 former IBMers asked for federal court permission to notify all older US workers idled by the company in recent years that they were eligible to join the case. The request was denied last March by US District Judge Valerie Caproni who ruled that she hadn’t seen evidence of “a common plan or policy behind IBM’s separation decisions.”

Liss-Riordan said such evidence exists in documents she’s fighting to have unsealed. Another federal court judge Lewis Liman ruled in her favor on that issue earlier this month writing that the public’s right of access to the documents “trumps a blanket assertion of . . . confidentiality.” IBM has appealed that ruling.

The documents Liss-Riordan’s seeking to make public which she obtained through discovery in individual arbitration cases but is not permitted to disclose without court permission show IBM leaders illegally shed older workers to create a younger workforce that would mirror its West Coast rivals she said.

“I’ve never in my career seen such incriminating smoking-gun evidence showing discrimination by a company” she said. (Liss-Riordan who ran for the US Senate in 2020 before dropping out of the race is now viewed as a potential candidate for Massachusetts attorney general.)

Some IBM documents already in the public realm called on managers to focus on “healthy attrition targets” in 2016 and “early professional hires” in 2020 while moving aggressively to “correct [the] seniority mix” among employees in some business areas. The federal Age Discrimination in Employment Act passed in 1967 prohibits employers from treating workers age 40 and over differently from younger staffers in hiring promotion and discharge.

In an affidavit filed in the federal case Cathy Rodgers who was 62 when she was fired in 2017 as vice president of global engagement said she often interacted with high-ranking IBM officials in human resources and other departments who were closely studying the ways of “newer younger and hipper competitors” like Google Facebook and Amazon.

“These studies concluded that IBM had a reputation as an old-school work environment and that IBM needed to attract new talent in an effort to ‘put the cool’ back in IBM” Rodgers’s affidavit said. That meant bringing in what IBM leaders termed “early professional hires” it said identifying the phrase as a code for workers under 40.

IBM’s former chief executive Ginny Rometty publicly unveiled a plan in 2016 to hire 25000 employees in the next four years — including “new collar” workers high school grads who could be taught digital skills — even as the company was eliminating other jobs. The company didn’t specify how many jobs it would add or cut at specific sites or business units but the federal lawsuit alleges it has laid off at least 20000 since 2012 most of them older workers.

In a statement company spokesman Christopher Mumma declined to provide the number of workers IBM has hired or terminated over the past decade or their average ages. But he flatly denied that the company was targeting older workers’ jobs as part of a broader strategy.

The company’s statement said that “IBM workforce decisions are based on having the right skills at the right levels in the right jobs and never on the age of any individual or group of employees.”

Mumma wouldn’t disclose the size of IBM’s workforce in Massachusetts. The company paid $3.5 billion for Lotus in 1995 and has long run a research lab in Cambridge’s Kendall Square where it also later launched its health data business IBM Watson Health. It also has operated a software development center in Littleton.

IBM is appealing Liman’s ruling to unseal documents for wider use in arbitration cases because it would set a “concerning precedent” Mumma said. Workers who sign pacts barring them from engaging in collective action “should not be permitted to avoid those agreements simply by breaching them when doing so becomes convenient” he said.

Rolf Nelson 63 of Boxborough one of the employees challenging his dismissal through arbitration worked for IBM for 17 years after it acquired his former company Rational Software. Most recently he was based in Littleton as an IBM senior product manager until he was let go in 2020 after training three new hires in their 20s who kept their jobs.

“It was out of the blue” Nelson said. “They didn’t give me a good reason. . . . [But] it was very clear that they were going to let the most experienced people go who were the highest paid people.”

Nelson who’s applied for other technology jobs but hasn’t gotten past the first interview is currently working the night shift on the checkout line at a Trader Joe’s. He wants to continue working for at least another seven years in part to help his 13-year-old son pay for college.

IBM a powerful but no longer dominant force in technology has reinvented itself multiple times since its founding in 1911. And it doesn’t deny that it’s been pushing forward with yet another makeover in the new era of cloud computing and artificial intelligence.

In a televised 2017 interview with CNBC then-CEO Rometty sat in a director’s chair at an IBM design center in New York. She stressed the need to embrace “new-collar skills of the future” as a dozen informally dressed young workers typed on computers in an open office format behind her. “You’re surrounded by folks and kids like this at many IBM centers around the world” she said. “Fifty percent of IBM are millennials here.”

More than two years after she was laid off Kathleen Stuart now 64 continues applying for jobs from her home in Milton where she also baby-sits her grandchildren. She sends out about three resumes a week she said “and have not heard anything. It’s very discouraging.”

Stuart who grew up in Boston’s Jamaica Plain neighborhood and studied business at the University of New Hampshire was an IBM information manager and business analyst. “At IBM you don’t coast” she said. When she was laid off by a new manager she’d never met Stuart said she asked why her name was on the layoff list.

The manager she said replied “‘I don’t really want to discuss that.’

“I said ‘Well let me tell you about the person you’re laying off. . . . I’ve just got an excellent review I’m the senior person on this team. If you read my review you’d see all the process changes I’ve implemented.’

“And she said ‘I didn’t read your review.’ ”

AHMM’s original proposals for the office complex completed in 1983 were floated in early 2020 and envisaged the creation of an extra 20000sq m of space through the addition of two new storeys.

But the scheme for Wolfe Commercial Properties Southbank – owned by the United Arab Emirates-based Easa Saleh Al Gurg Group – was drawn up before the building was given a grade II listing later that year in part for its “architectural concordance” with the neighbouring National Theatre also designed by IBM architect Denys Lasdun.

AHMM’s revised proposals approved last summer cut the amount of new space down to 11000 sq m which Wolfe said will “sensitively restore and upgrade the building”.

Stanhope is development manager on the project and is understood to be still deciding whether to let the job as a design and build contract or a construction management deal.

But Building understands it has been speaking to Mace Sir Robert McAlpine and Lendlease about the deal which has a price tag of £120m down from the £150m-plus cost first envisaged for the original larger scheme. The others running the rule over the job are Multiplex Skanska and Laing O’Rourke.

Stanhope is next month expected to pick three or four firms to work up bids with a winner due in the spring.

Three firms Keltbray Careys and Morrisroe are chasing the £20m enabling works package which will kick off the redevelopment when IBM moves its remaining staff out of the building in the summer.

Consultants working on the scheme include QS Exigere Heyne Tillett Steel as structural engineer and Watkins Payne as M&E engineer.

IBM is swapping the Brutalist landmark for new offices at the nearby Shell Centre with a return to its long-standing home believed to be still up in the air.

The building which is the firm’s European headquarters and which sits between ITV’s London home and the National Theatre was once owned by Alan Sugar whose real estate arm Amsprop sold it to Saudi investors nearly nine years ago in a deal understood to be worth around £120m.",,,,,,

Hours later President Biden Ohio governor Mike DeWine US Secretary of Commerce Gina Raimondo Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger and other executives and local officials suggested the up-to-$100 billion development could be a panacea for a wide variety of issues too — including global competitiveness national security the chip shortage the high price of cars racial and gender gaps in STEM employment even inflation itself.

It could become Ohio’s version of California’s Silicon Valley several suggested. The phrase “Silicon Heartland” was uttered at least eight times across two livestreams.

There’s no question that the investment is a big deal for Intel which has been clawing its way back from the brink of potential irrelevance by fundamentally changing its entire outlook on the industry: doubling down on manufacturing building chips for competitors and relying on some competitors to help build chips of its own. It’s the first time Intel’s breaking ground on a new manufacturing site in 40 years. (Intel’s Arizona New Mexico and Oregon expansions joined existing facilities.)

And of course it could be a huge deal for Ohio too.

But inflation? Car prices? $100 billion in investment? Let’s back up a second.

What is Intel actually promising in Ohio?

To Intel’s credit its own statements on the subject have been fairly clear: it’s a $20 billion initial investment in two fabs (short for fabrication plants; they typically produce silicon wafers) with construction beginning in late 2022 and the facility expected to open in late 2025.

“If there’s a concrete truck in the state of Ohio that’s not working for me next year I want to know about it” joked Gelsinger on the call.

$100 billion is a stretch goal

The rest of Intel’s promises are fuzzier — like the idea that the Ohio site might wind up housing eight fabs instead of just two. “At full buildout the total investment in the site could grow to as much as $100 billion over the next decade making it one of the largest semiconductor manufacturing sites in the world” reads Intel’s press release. But that isn’t a firm commitment — it’s more of a stretch goal if Intel gets federal subsidies.

“We have a goal of investing as much as $100B over the next decade but without federal government support that goal will be difficult to reach in that time frame” Intel spokesperson William Moss confirmed to The Verge. The initial $20 billion investment doesn’t depend on federal subsidies though.

Intel is also giving itself a decade to spend $100 million on education — “to help develop and attract a pipeline of skilled talent from within the region” — while promising approximately 3000 Intel jobs 7000 construction jobs and that 140 existing Ohio companies will do business with Intel as suppliers. Intel suggests the average annual salary at its facilities will be $135000.

How could any of that solve today’s chip shortage car prices and inflation?

It can’t.

While the chip shortage is a gigantic supply chain issue that is absolutely affecting the auto industry leading chipmakers agree it’s slated to ease in the second half of 2022 and this plant won’t be operating until 2025 at the earliest. “Given this fab goes online in 2025 it won’t have any impact on the current chip crisis” says Moor Insights & Strategy analyst Pat Moorhead.

Also Intel doesn’t produce chips for cars at least not yet. Intel had nothing to do with the shortage of car chips. (Intel did buy autonomous driving chip company Mobileye in 2017 but its chips are produced by TSMC.)

None of that stopped US Secretary of Commerce Gina Raimondo and Ohio Governor Mike DeWine from repeatedly bringing up cars and tying them to inflation though. “Car prices are driving a third of inflation because we don’t have enough chips” said Raimondo adding that each electric vehicle requires 2000 chips. “So that’s why today’s announcement from Intel is so exciting.”

What will the Ohio plant actually make?

Intel hasn’t offered details yet but Gelsinger said in the presentation that it will produce advanced chips at process nodes “2nm and below.”

“What we have said is that the Ohio factories are designed for the ‘Angstrom era’ with support for Intel’s most advanced process technologies including Intel 18A” an Intel spokesperson tells The Verge.

Would it actually be the “largest silicon manufacturing location on the planet”?

It might be but probably not for long. In August 2020 Samsung announced that it had begun producing memory chips on the largest production line in the world — Pyeongtaek Line 2 roughly the size of 16 soccer fields.

But Intel manufacturing and supply chain boss Keyvan Esfarjani said its Ohio facility might be 30 football fields in size with clean rooms as large as four football fields each.

However Samsung’s Pyeongtaek Line 2 is just one of the facilities in the area and Japan’s Nikkei reports that a new third Samsung fab will have clean rooms that fit 25 soccer fields compared to Intel’s four. Plus soccer fields are larger than football fields.

If the actual promise is $20 billion for two fabs and Intel already spent $20 billion for two new fabs in Arizona and it won’t ease the shortage why is this such a big deal?

It’s a big deal! It’s just not a bigger deal. As of today the deal is the exact same size.

But the Biden administration and Ohio really want to be seen doing something important for the economy — and Biden can use it to pressure the House of Representatives to pass a key piece of legislation.

Tell me more.

Remember how Intel’s hoping for a federal subsidy to help build out the Ohio fabs? There’s one waiting in the wings — Last April Biden called for federal funding to ease the semiconductor shortage and the Senate answered in June passing a bill that would provide $52 billion for domestic semiconductor manufacturing in the United States.

But it never passed the House of Representatives. Even though the so-called “CHIPS Act” has bipartisan support it’s been stalled in the House ever since so the money isn’t available. So Biden held up Intel and Ohio as an example of what’s possible if we invest in domestic chipmaking while raising the specter of national security and global competitiveness concerns if we fail to pass the bill.

“We were ranked number one in the world in R&D. But guess what? We now rank number nine” said Biden pointing how much US chip manufacturing has receded. “Today 75 percent of production takes place in East Asia. 90 percent of the most advanced chips are made in Taiwan.”

“This project will be bigger and faster with the CHIPS Act” Intel CEO Gelsinger stated on the Biden call.

Is there something to the national security concern?

Perhaps.

The public has never heard evidence of Chinese chips being used to spy on the United States outside of one widely criticized Bloomberg report but that hasn’t stopped the United States from repeatedly cracking down on Chinese telecommunications vendors in particular due to unspecified national security concerns and Biden has actually expanded Trump-era bans on American investment in companies with ties to the Chinese military.

There are other forms of national security concerns too: “If China attacked Taiwan or if North Korea attacked South Korea the US would not have access to leading edge semiconductors which is an issue” says Moorhead. “This deal is mostly about diversifying where leading edge manufacturing is done to protect US interests.”

What about economic competitiveness?

Every little bit helps I imagine but even if the House approved $52 billion in funding for domestic semiconductor manufacturing and Intel spent the full $100 billion in Ohio — again over a decade — they’ll still be completely dwarfed by chip giants TSMC and Samsung.

The Nikkei report points out that Samsung invests $25 billion each year on chipmaking and TSMC has earmarked a record $44 billion on manufacturing capacity in 2022 alone after spending $30 billion in 2021. At that rate it seems unlikely Intel would catch up.

As far as global competitiveness there’s hope that when Intel chooses to build new fabs in the United States others will follow suit — and that does appear to be happening with Samsung promising to build a $17 billion advanced chipmaking plant in Taylor Texas and both TSMC and its suppliers reportedly mulling additional investments in Arizona.

“We hope to be able to make an announcement about major new EU investment plans within the next several months” Intel tells The Verge.

Will Ohio become a new Silicon Valley?

I would argue that Silicon Valley is unique because it’s about a lot more than semiconductor manufacturing — it’s the mass accumulation of talent and investment and investors themselves complete with all the problems (like crazy housing prices!) they cause.

During his presentation Intel’s CEO seemed to have a slightly looser definition:

“When we moved to Oregon we established the Silicon Forest. When we went to Arizona we helped to establish the Silicon Desert. We went to Ireland we helped to create the Silicon Isle. We went to Israel and we helped to establish the Silicon Oasis” he said.

(Here are more “Silicon” place names if you want.)

That aside Time reports that New Albany Ohio is far more developed than outsiders might know is one of the wealthiest places in Ohio and that Intel isn’t the first big tech company to break ground. Google Amazon and Meta all have data centers there — all of them part of the sprawling New Albany International Business Park.

It appears that Intel liked the idea of being associated with wealthy New Albany by the way. Technically the land underneath Intel’s new facilities was part of Jersey Township until New Albany annexed that exact parcel this year just ahead of the deal.

What did Ohio promise Intel in exchange for this investment?

Intel declined to get into specifics (except to say that tax credits exemptions and infrastructure improvements are part of the package) but Ohio Lieutenant Governor Jon Husted seems to have anticipated the question. “For every six cents of capital investment Ohio will make Intel will make a dollar” he said unprompted during the presentation.

Some quick napkin math: does that mean Ohio is contributing $1.2 billion on top of Intel’s $20 billion? Intel wouldn’t say. But according to Time the local government will be spending at least a billion: “The state agreed to invest $1 billion in infrastructure improvements including widening State Route 161 to support the factory and the nearby community.”

To win Intel’s interest Ohio also had to change its laws to offer job creation tax credits for 30 years instead of 15 years to big developments like Intel’s. “Until that passed we weren’t in the game” Husted told The Columbus Dispatch.

Why does this remind me of a Verge story about empty buildings?

More than 40 years ago Intel broke ground on a new factory in a small agricultural town just outside of Phoenix Ariz.

What began life as an empty patch of desert farmland has since become a manufacturing powerhouse with an annual economic impact of nearly $10 billion.

Today Intel employs more than 12000 people in Arizona and drives a vibrant community of supporting services and suppliers with a magnitude on the order of a small city.

We also have seen significant impact at our other U.S. sites in Oregon and New Mexico. Now we are bringing these benefits to Ohio.

Intel has committed $20 billion to fund the construction of two new leading-edge chip factories in Licking County.

With the potential to grow to more than $100 billion over the next decade this investment is an essential part of our strategy to restore U.S. leadership in semiconductor manufacturing – an area where the nation has fallen behind to foreign competitors.

More:Intel hopes to save the chip industry one competitor at a time

The U.S. needs to grow its chipmaking capability and capacity and Intel is excited to partner with the state of Ohio to create a new epicenter of economic growth. The chips made in Licking County will not only help diversify the region’s economy but they will also make U.S. supply chains and the overall economy more resilient.

Chips made here will power everything from personal computers to jet engines. Intel’s Ohio site is expected to become a full-fledged “mega factory” a major contributor to Intel’s leading-edge manufacturing network.

In the short term Intel’s Ohio investment is expected to create 3000 Intel jobs 7000 construction jobs and tens of thousands more local long-term jobs. In addition Intel is already working with Ohio leaders and top technology companies to encourage them to build supporting capabilities right here in Ohio with investments of their own.

Several members of our supply chain have already committed to establishing a presence in Ohio because of this investment and we anticipate many more commitments in the coming weeks. Chips made in Ohio will boost a healthy ecosystem of innovation and create the kind of virtuous cycle that the U.S. needs to win back its place as the global leader in semiconductor manufacturing.

As we searched for a site that could support the next phase of Intel’s growth we had insightful conversations with leaders from states across the country. But we ultimately decided that the Licking County location offered the best combination of attributes to meet our needs.

The region has a proud heritage as an industrial and manufacturing powerhouse it sits near the fast-growing Columbus metropolitan area it has a robust existing infrastructure with the capacity for future growth and a strong talent pipeline sustained by world-class educational institutions in the area.

The site is also within a day's drive to every major Midwest city making it possible to create an ecosystem across the entire region. We are “all in” on Ohio. We could not be more impressed by the partnership that has developed with local and state leaders and we feel confident that this will be a mutually beneficial long-term relationship.

Construction of our factories will begin at the end of 2022 but we plan to have an immediate impact in the community.

We look forward to building strong relationships with our new neighbors by bringing jobs forging close partnerships with the educational institutions so vital to establishing a rich local talent pipeline and continuing to be good stewards of the environment – a commitment we have demonstrated over decades at other sites in the U.S. and around the globe.

Intel is proud to be the only American chipmaker making investments of this size and scale to grow our country’s chipmaking capacity. We are committed to investing even more in years to come but we continue to need close partnership with the federal government to meet the urgent need for more U.S. based chipmaking.

Congress has shown strong bipartisan support for our industry in enacting the critical CHIPS for America Act and it now must move forward to fully fund this important legislation. With that support Intel is prepared to invest faster and up to $100 billion in our new Ohio operations over the next decade to establish additional factories.

Our journey to establish the U.S. as a leader in semiconductor is far from over but I am confident that with strong partnership a common vision and continued support we can help create a new era of manufacturing here at home in the U.S. We look forward to becoming part of the community.

It’s a seismic shift that's in the process of rolling out since Apple still sells Intel-based Macs. If you're looking to upgrade your computer you have an important choice to make: Should you pick up a Mac with the new processors or stick with Intel for now?

Updated January 2022: We've updated this guide with details from our reviews and experience after more than a year of living through the transition.

Why Apple’s Custom Processors Matter

Longtime Apple fans will recall that Apple made a similar transition from its PowerPC processors to Intel chips back in 2005. Among the benefits at the time using the same processor architecture that comparable PCs used meant it was easier for developers to bring popular Windows apps to the Mac (or at least emulate the ones that didn’t get direct ports) ushering in a thriving era of compatibility and development for Mac users.

Today Macs are much more common and it’s not difficult to convince big developers to make apps for Apple’s platforms (some will even fight in court for the privilege). But Apple’s other devices including the iPhone iPad and Apple Watch use Apple’s own custom processors. As such they live in their own separate world. Developers making apps for both Macs and iPhones would have to do extra work to make their apps available on both platforms. With the switch to Apple’s own processors it will be possible to write an app once and run it on most Apple devices with minimal modification.

And that's to say nothing of the speed and battery life enhancements. Before the Apple M1 processor came out there was some uncertainty about whether Apple could deliver better speeds than the Intel processors it was leaving behind but in all our reviews since—including the Macbook Air iPad Pro and the Macbook Pro—we've been blown away by the M1 platform's processors—especially with the recent M1 Pro and M1 Max.

Many major apps were updated to work on the new processors pretty quickly and most of those that weren't can still be used via Rosetta Stone 2 though there's occasionally a performance hit. Overall Apple has largely (so far) delivered on the promise of better performance while making the process of developing for all Apple products simpler.

The only hiccup we've seen is the fact that MacBooks using the M1 processor can only output to a single external display—this wasn't the case on Intel-powered Macs. If you've got a dual-monitor setup right now that's not going to work for you. That said the pricier 14- and 16-inch MacBooks with the M1 Pro and M1 Max chips resolved this and can support up to four external screens.

Will My Intel Mac Be Obsolete Soon?

If you need to buy a Mac right now and the only ones that suit your needs are Intel-based you might reasonably wonder if it’s going to be out of date soon. That isn’t likely to be the case. (At least no more than every computer is out of date the minute you buy it.) Apple says it will support Intel Macs for years and there are still reportedly some Intel-based Macs that haven’t been released yet.

If you purchase AppleCare+ with your Mac then you’re promised at least three years of service support from the time you buy it which means that even if you buy one of the Intel-based Macs that Apple currently offers you won’t be stranded without support for a while. However that only applies to accidental repair damage and priority tech support. You can keep using your Mac long after that often with minimal issues. Furthermore Apple provides service and parts for Macs for up to five years after they’ve stopped being sold. In other words even if you bought a new Intel-based Mac today it would likely still receive OS updates qualify for service and have spare parts available in 2027.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiamh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm9yZWdvbmxpdmUuY29tL3NpbGljb24tZm9yZXN0LzIwMjIvMDEvaW50ZWxzLW1lZ2EtZmFiLWluLW9oaW8tcmluZ3MtYWxhcm0tYmVsbHMtaW4tb3JlZ29uLmh0bWzSAXlodHRwczovL3d3dy5vcmVnb25saXZlLmNvbS9zaWxpY29uLWZvcmVzdC8yMDIyLzAxL2ludGVscy1tZWdhLWZhYi1pbi1vaGlvLXJpbmdzLWFsYXJtLWJlbGxzLWluLW9yZWdvbi5odG1sP291dHB1dFR5cGU9YW1w?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Intel’s ‘mega fab’ in Ohio rings alarm bells in Oregon,"Intel announced plans Thursday to build as many as eight factories on a single site in Ohio a “mega fab” that CEO Pat Gelsinger said may someday be “the largest silicon manufacturing location on the planet.”

Currency-hedged exchange traded funds remain resolutely out of favour in the US — despite posting outsized returns in the past year.

The largest currency-hedged ETFs in the US all comfortably outperformed their unhedged equivalents last year helped by the strength of the dollar which rose 6.7 per cent against a basket of six other developed world currencies as measured by the DXY index.

Yet the collective assets of US-listed currency-hedged ETFs — which neutralise the movement in foreign currencies against the dollar while still providing exposure to overseas assets — ended last year at just $16.9bn according to Bloomberg data.

This tally is down by almost three-quarters from the year-end high of $61.3bn in 2015 despite the wider US ETF industry having more than tripled in size since then according to figures from ETFGI.

The popularity of currency-hedged ETFs exploded in the US in 2014 and 2015 as the DXY index rallied by 23 per cent a significant rise for a developed world currency in two years eroding returns for unhedged US investors.

The greenback’s gains were particularly sharp against the Japanese yen which plummeted after the government of then Prime Minister Shinzo Abe pursued an aggressive policy of quantitative easing.

“Currency-hedging took off after Abe got elected in Japan. Abe was like the [latter-day US Federal Reserve] on steroids” said Eric Balchunas senior ETF analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence with WisdomTree’s Japan Hedged Equity Fund (DXJ) a leading beneficiary.

“Then currency-hedging started in Europe. They were outperforming by 20-30 [percentage] points” he added.

“WisdomTree shot up the league tables. Every asset manager that had an international equity ETF launched a currency-hedged alternative to give investors a choice” said Todd Rosenbluth head of ETF and mutual fund research at CFRA Research.

“They were positioned as a core international equity replacement to reduce the risk of currency fluctuations let alone the potential to benefit from currency fluctuations.”

The decline in the format was almost as swift however as a slide in the dollar index from a high of 103.3 in December 2016 to 89.4 in early January 2021 eroded returns and meant dollar-based investors were better off using unhedged vehicles to access European and Japanese stocks.

Last year though the greenback rallied again with the DXY index gaining 6.7 per cent allowing hedged ETFs to shine once again.

The iShares Currency Hedged MSCI EAFE ETF (HEFA) for example at $3.4bn the largest currency-hedged fund returned 19.4 per cent comfortably ahead of the 11.2 per cent gain of iShares’ MSCI EAFE ETF (EFA) its unhedged sister product.

Three hedged eurozone equity products Xtrackers’ MSCI Europe Hedged Equity ETF (DBEU) WisdomTree’s Europe Hedged Equity Fund (HEDJ) and iShares’ Currency Hedged MSCI Eurozone (HEZU) all returned between 23 and 24 per cent while their unhedged peers the iShares MSCI Eurozone ETF (EZU) and Vanguard European Stock Index Fund ETF (VGK) made 13.6 per cent and 16.4 per cent respectively.

Yet despite these successes the 26.9 per cent uptick in the sector’s assets last year lagged behind the rate of asset growth witnessed by US-listed ETFs at large and were suggestive of very limited inflows.

“About 70-80 per cent of the money left. Then [currency-hedging] started working again and nobody cared” said Balchunas.

“There are probably some investors that will use them but not the mass market. They are not into currency-hedging any more. [The ETFs] still have more assets than they did before Abe [in 2012] but [it’s a case of] rags to riches to barely above rags” he added.

Rosenbluth believed investors had been “burned” by the poor showing of currency-hedged funds in recent years.

“They are less likely to come back for a second bite of the apple. They touched something that was too hot they got burned and now they are hesitant to do it again.”

Moreover Rosenbluth said many of the currency-hedged funds that launched at the height of the boom have since disappeared due to lack of demand.

Even WisdomTree the manager that propelled the original boom has largely moved on Rosenbluth argued.

“[WisdomTree] was such a big proponent of currency-hedging. It was where they put their marketing dollars” he said but the New York-based issuer has since diversified into areas such as thematic ETFs cryptocurrencies and leveraged and inverse products.

“I don’t think the education of investors as to the benefits of currency-hedging is as prevalent” Rosenbluth added.

Can the strategy yet make a comeback?

Andrew Jamieson global head of ETF product at Citi said if there was a “compelling argument to buy [say] a currency-hedged Japanese index product people would” but compared to the mid-2010s ETF investors were now “spoilt for choice”.

“We have battery tech clean energy online gambling meme stocks crypto ETFs you name it. That is what is capturing the imagination [of retail investors]. That is the reason [currency-hedged] products are not the titans they used to be.”

Balchunas said that once investment strategies slipped out of favour it could be hard to regain widespread acceptance.

“Once something stops working and people move out of it and then it starts working again can you get investors back? What we found with currency-hedging is not in that case.”

Rosenbluth also saw little chance of a large-scale comeback. US retail investors “are often home biased and like to take the simple route and likely don’t have the confidence to forecast currency movements” he said.

“They are too comfortable with the devil they know rather than learning more about the devil they don’t know.”

For a comeback to happen “we would need to see a prolonged period of outperformance” he said.

The bull’s brass bollocks have been worn to a golden sheen over the years from being um appreciated so many times.

“Hold them golden balls like a champ!” @brianfonseca wrote on Instagram alongside a photo of a ladyfriend rubbing her caboose up against the bull’s face. “You may kiss them too!”

Investors tell Coupang to get real about bottom line

Profit possible after 2024

Coupang has long waved away its red ink as ""intentional"" investments in the future.Now the company is scrambling to get into the block as its stock plummets and investors get impatient.The 12-year old e-commerce company is known for divergent revenue and profit directions. It reported revenue of $4.64 billion in last year's third quarter up 48 percent on year and a net loss of $324 million up 87percent. Coupang has never reported a profit.Kim Bom CEO of the Delaware-incorporated Coupang Inc. says the company’s investment in overnight and restaurant deliveries contributed to the loss. Some 92 percent of its 2021 second quarter operating loss before interest taxes depreciation and amortization (Ebitda)came from direct investments in those two services including 10 fulfillment centers being built.Investment has been a viable excuse in the past and a classic line from a start-up. But Coupang's stock is nosediving and investors clearly want to see some profit.Shares closed at $19.99 on Jan. 20 down 68.5 percent from its debut price of $63.5 on the New York Stock Exchange last March 11.Amazon the original e-commerce startup took seven years to see its first quarterly profit in 2001.For Coupang the profit horizon seems to be sometime in 2024.“In 2022 there will be less spent on pandemic-related issues and a rise in consumer prices will improve profitability slightly” said Park Sang-jun an analyst at Kiwoom Securities. “To actually generate profits in the mid-term increasing sales from commissions and reducing promotions for Rocket Fresh and Coupang Eats is important.” Rocket Fresh is a grocery delivery service that began in October 2018 and Coupang Eats is restaurant deliveries which began in May 2019.Park is expecting black ink in 2024 when Coupang Eats and Rocket Fresh start cutting into rival services' businesses.

New members will have to pay4990 won ($4.20) a month although existing members will be grandfathered to the original monthly fee 2.900 won per month.Rocket Wow members don't have to pay delivery fees for Rocket Delivery or Rocket Fresh. They also receive discounts on Coupang products and access to videos on the company's over-the-top (OTT) streaming service Coupang Play.“In the third quarter conference call last year Coupang said that its short-run costs rise when its Rocket Wow members order more” said Oh Lina an analyst at eBest Investment & Securities. ""It mentioned it has plans to decrease costs per delivery.""Coupang is refraining from clearly stating reasons behind the increase in the cost of becoming a Rocket Wow member but analysts suspect a concern for the bottom line.The increase doesn't affect existing customers and even new customers will notice that it's cheap compared to other subscription services even if they're in different industries.Netflix charges 13500 won a month Tving 10900 won and Watcha 12900 won. Naver's Plus Membership costs 4900 won a month.Coupang Eats another big money pit for the company is jacking up commissions and delivery fees charged to restaurants.Since the start of the delivery service in 2019 restaurant owners had to pay a flat 1000-won commission per order to Coupang. On top of that they paid a 5000 won delivery fee which they could pass along partly or entirely to customers.Starting Feb. 3 Seoul-based restaurants will be able to choose commission rates of 7.5 9.8 15 or 27 percent. Choosing a higher commissions will subject them to lower delivery fees and vice versa. The delivery fee will range from 1764 won to 5400 won depending on commission level and delivery distance.""It isn’t an extreme rise"" said a Coupang spokesperson. It's lower than the company's original plan in 2019 to charge restaurants a 15 percent commission and a 6000-won delivery fee split between the restaurant and customers.“We will probably have to pay higher fees” said Mr. Kim a 53-year-old pork cutlet restaurant owner in Yongsan District central Seoul ""but as a business owner I can’t afford to lose customers who might order through Coupang Eats.”Advertising revenues is another easy way to ramp up profits which doesn't require additional investment by Coupang.Sellers on Coupang can spend more to make their products show up at the top of a search. A similar advertisement system was introduced on Coupang Eats last November.Revenues from Coupang Media Group its advertising business nearly tripled on-year in the third quarter last year.""It requires a lot of fixed costs to be able to collect [commissions and advertising revenue]"" said analyst Park of Kiwoom securities. ""But when a company grows and revenue surpasses a certain point companies can generate high profits because those businesses generate money without much additional production costs.""Although the company is being pressured to improve its bottom line it’s not ending big investments.In 2021 Coupang invested 100 billion won to create exclusive shows on Coupang Play and will spend more for programs such as ""Anna"" which will air this year.The Coupang Play streaming service is included in Rocket Wow membership and the company sees it as a way to lock-in customers in the long run.""The success of OTT service Coupang Play is expected to increase the number of Coupang's active users which fell in the third quarter and help bring up Coupang's market share in the e-commerce industry to 19.8 percent in 2022"" said Kim Myoung-joo of Korea Investment & Securities.In the third quarter Coupang had 16.8 million active users falling 1.2 percent on quarter.Logistics centers will alwaysbe a key investment for Coupang as more hubs allow it to cover more areas deliver things faster and acquire more customers.Delaware’s Coupang Inc. borrowed $139 million last October saying it will use the money to build more fulfillment centers in Korea.An investment deal of 100 billion won was signed in September 2020 to build a logistics center in Gimcheon North Gyeongsang and Coupang announced Jan. 19 it will spend an additional 50 billion won on the project.BY LEE TAE-HEE [lee.taehee2@joongang.co.kr]",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiR2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRyYXZlbGF3YWl0cy5jb20vMjcyNTA5NS90aXBzLWZvci1maXJzdC12aXNpdC10by1ib3JhLWJvcmEv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,8 Tips For Your First Visit To Bora Bora,"Surrounded by the most beautiful aquamarine water I’ve ever seen Bora Bora is every bit as amazing as those magazine ads and tourism office videos make it out to be. I recently spent 5 nights at this romantic South Pacific destination as part of a 12-day vacation in French Polynesia. My husband and I deemed it our best vacation ever.

We fell in love with Bora Bora for its jaw-dropping beauty its water activities above and below the surface its super friendly residents and of course its romantic and luxurious overwater bungalows — we certainly felt like newlyweds again at this popular honeymoon spot.

That said Bora Bora isn’t easy to get to and it’s a rather expensive locale. If you’re planning your first trip to Bora Bora here are a few things you should know before you arrive on this remarkable and unique island destination.

1. Bora Bora Is Actually Made Up Of Multiple Islands

Bora Bora formed by volcanic eruption millions of years ago is composed of a main island that’s only about 12 square miles. It’s surrounded by a gorgeous turquoise lagoon and a ring of motus or islets. Some tourist accommodations are found on the main island whose principal town is Vaitepe while others including the most upscale resorts featuring multiple overwater bungalows are on the more remote islets.

2. You Must Fly To Tahiti First

All international travelers who arrive by air must land at Tahiti’s Faa’a International Airport (PPT) first. Depending on your flight arrival time you might transfer immediately to a domestic flight to Bora Bora. Or you could stay for the night (or longer) on the island of Tahiti.

If you’re planning just a quick overnight on Tahiti consider one of these properties close to the airport: the budget Tahiti Airport Motel (bare bones and basic) or the more upscale InterContinental Tahiti Resort & Spa (a gorgeous property with multiple pools overwater bungalow options and a great oceanfront location for watching the sunset).

3. The Bora Bora Airport Is On A Motu

Upon landing at the Bora Bora Airport (BOB) you’ll cast your eyes on the crystal-clear water that the island is known for. Then once you’re done gaping and make your way into the airport (you’ll deplane on an open-air tarmac) you’ll look for your resort’s representative among the many lined up at water-taxi stands.

That’s because the airport is on one of the long skinny motus and the vast majority of accommodations on Bora Bora are only reachable by boat. The fanciest resorts charge an arm and a leg for a water taxi. For example the InterContinental Le Moana Bora Bora Resort charges $70 per person for water-based transportation from the airport to the hotel.

There are ways however to pay a fraction of that price if your hotel like the InterContinental Le Moana Bora Bora is located on Bora Bora’s main island. Instead of booking the resort’s water taxi we took the free Air Tahiti Bora Bora Navette to the main island’s town of Vaitape and then hailed a waiting taxi to take us on a 12-minute ride to the resort. That only cost us $24 total instead of $140!

4. The Local Currency Is The Pacific Franc

I quote transportation costs in dollars above but the local currency is the Pacific franc. I’ve also seen it called the Central Pacific Franc or French Pacific Franc. It’s abbreviated CFP but its international abbreviation is XFP so you may see it referenced a number of ways.

Before our trip we ordered a couple hundred dollars worth of CFPs from our hometown bank so we’d have some available to us immediately once we landed in French Polynesia. But you can also withdraw local money from an ATM (I saw them regularly at grocery stores) or at the Tahiti airport on arrival. Your hotel’s front desk may not offer the best rate to exchange money so I’d only do that in a pinch.

Credit cards are accepted regularly at restaurants grocery stores local tour companies and of course hotels. You may find that souvenir stores and grocery shops accept U.S. dollars but the exchange rate offered probably won’t be great. I’d try to use a credit card as often as possible (make sure yours doesn’t charge foreign transaction fees) and the local CFP currency for cash transactions like taxi rides.

5. Eating And Drinking On Bora Bora Is Expensive But There Are Ways To Cut Costs

It’s not unusual to see $15 cocktails $20 appetizers and $40 entrees on hotel restaurant menus on Bora Bora. To save money consider these tips:

Pack Your Own Snacks

We loaded our luggage with protein bars oatmeal packets and beef jerky to help tide us over between meals especially on days when we’d just eat a huge hotel buffet breakfast then not sit down for food again until happy hour. The instant coffee I brought helped me save at the hotels that didn’t offer free coffee in our hotel rooms.

Swing By A Local Grocery Store

This is easiest to do if you’re staying on Bora Bora’s main island; if your hotel is on a remote motu you may need to take a taxi to the local store if there’s even one nearby. We were able to walk from the Intercontinental Le Moana Bora Bora to a local store for good French wine super cheap baguettes and reasonably priced cheese and cold cuts for an easy and fun picnic meal to enjoy on the deck of our overwater bungalow.

Take Advantage Of Hotel 2-For-1 Happy Hours

All the resorts we stayed at in French Polynesia (a total of four on three islands) offered buy-one-get-one-free drink specials in the hour or 2 before sunset.

Eat At Local Restaurants

This may not afford you great savings as some of the well-known Bora Bora restaurants like Bloody Mary’s may cost you as much as a hotel meal plus you’ll need to pay for a taxi to get there and back. But if you can walk to an eatery near your resort consider giving it a whirl to save a few bucks and support a local business.

6. Make Sure You Pack All Of Your Needed Toiletries

Just as food and drink are expensive on Bora Bora (except for those fabulous 62-cent loafs of baguette-style bread!) other consumer items are too.

My husband and I made a rookie mistake of not bringing enough sunscreen with us. Toward the end of our trip we had to supplement with a bottle purchased from a local market — which wasn’t much cheaper than what was offered at the hotel gift shop.

We paid $24 for a 6.8-ounce bottle of sunblock. Ouch! That said a painful sunburn would have hurt even more — better safe than sorry.

7. Bora Bora Has A Wet And Dry Season

According to the Islands of Tahiti tourism website Bora Bora has a wet season and a dry season. The most popular time for visitors is from May to October the islands’ dry season. You can expect mostly sunny and mild weather during this time.

The wet season runs from November to April. Fewer tourists visit during this time as it’s not unusual to encounter rain — including heavy downpours — regularly. Temperatures are hotter and humid during this time as well.

My husband and I visited in the first 2 weeks of November and we lucked out during this transition time between the dry and wet seasons. For the bulk of our trip to French Polynesia we enjoyed incredibly sunny days with bright skies and warm temperatures — about 80 degrees Fahrenheit. We only experienced one afternoon and a full day of steady pouring rain that impacted our outdoor activities.

8. English Is Widely Spoken But Consider Learning A Few Tahitian Words

All front-facing hotel employees we encountered spoke fluent English. We were also able to converse easily with the local folks we came in contact with at airports ferry terminals grocery stores and local restaurants.

That said we regularly heard a couple of Tahitian phrases that became cemented in our vocabulary within just a few days of arrival in French Polynesia.

First Ia Orana (yo-rah-nah) meaning “hello” and every single employee we passed while walking on hotel grounds would greet us this way in a sing-song voice. Grocery store and cafe employees would do the same as we entered their establishments. With a smile we happily repeated “Ia Orana” back to anyone we encountered.

We also mastered Maururu (mah-roo-roo) which means “thank you.” French Polynesians are exceedingly polite and we were happy to follow suit thanking everyone for everything as we made our way through our day on Bora Bora — from restaurant servers to shop clerks to the fellow who lent us kayaks at hotel activity palapas.

The friendly residents of Bora Bora and the other French Polynesia islands we visited contributed greatly to our enjoyment of our vacation in this beautiful place. Using a bit of their native language was the least we could do to acknowledge their hospitality that made us feel so welcomed to their slice of paradise.

“Shell announced the Board’s decision to change its name to Shell plc on December 20 2021. This change has now taken effect” Shell said in a filing.

The London and Amsterdam stock exchanges will reflect the name change on Jan. 25 while the New York Stock Exchange will follow on Jan. 31.

The change will not affect share ownership and the A shares and B shares will remain unchanged for the time being Shell said.

The shares are planned to be assimilated into a single line of ordinary shares on Jan. 29.

Shell announced in November it would scrap its dual share structure and move its head office to London from The Hague pushed away by Dutch taxes and facing climate pressure in court as the energy giant shifts from oil and gas.

The firm has been in a long-running tussle with the Dutch authorities over the country’s 15% dividend withholding tax on some of its shares making them less attractive for international investors. Shell introduced the two-class share structure in 2005 after a previous corporate overhaul.

Shell held its first board meeting in London on Dec. 31.

What's Next for International Flavors?

Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near-term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions. Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried-and-tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions.

Ahead of this earnings release the estimate revisions trend for International Flavors: mixed.

The deal which was led by Invesco Asia Fund IV represents the first successful privatisation of a Japanese-listed REIT ever with funds managed by Gaw having partnered with Invesco to finance the transaction which was first reported by PERE.

“We feel strongly that Japan will be one of the winners coming out of COVID” said Calvin Chou head of Invesco Real Estate Asia. “With less than 5 percent office vacancy citywide despite the pandemic and a culture that values teamwork Tokyo has the best supply demand dynamics of any major office market globally.”

The trust managed by a unit of Invesco comprises 18 fully stabilised Grade A and B office assets in Japan including 12 in Tokyo three in Yokohama and one each in Nagoya Fukuoka and Osaka.

Hostile Takeover Thwarted

With Invesco Office J-REIT having seen its unit price drop by more than half in March 2020 as the pandemic threatened global office markets and with the share price still down by around 25 percent of its pre-COVID peak at the beginning of April 2021 the management of the listed trust and its 3.2 million square feet (296648 square metres) of office space received notice on the 2nd of that month that the REIT was the target of a takeover attempt by US-based Starwood Capital Group.

Invesco saw that offer as undervalued and quickly moved to counter.

“Call us old-fashioned but we still believe in offices particularly the office markets in Tokyo and other major Japanese cities” Invesco’s Chou said. “While COVID is impacting near-term demand we forecast a strong Return to Office (RTO) upon market stabilisation.”

The Texas-based firm which closed on a total of $1.25 billion in commitments for its Invesco Asia Fund IV value-add strategy last year managed $3.8 billion in assets in Japan as of March 2021 and considers itself local to the market where it has invested in 153 buildings since 1999.

Starwood’s initial offer of JPY 20000 per unit represented a roughly 13 percent premium to the REIT’s unit price at the time and a 7 percent premium to its book value but was still far below its February 2020 peak of JPY 24470 per unit.

Chou pointed to Japanese hubs having the lowest vacancy rates among global gateway cities strong cash-on-cash yields and a high level of market liquidity as underpinning the firm’s belief in the long-term value of the listed vehicle.

With Invesco owning just around 3 percent of the trust and with the remaining units under relatively fragmented ownership primarily composed of Japanese index funds with few sizable institutional holders Starwood stood a real chance of achieving the 66 percent tender acceptance rate needed to move forward with the privatisation.

On 15 April 2021 Invesco released a statement announcing reservations concerning Starwood’s offer before coming out with a statement opposing the deal on 6 May on the grounds that it did not allow unitholders sufficient time to consider the offer and that it provided limited options for minority unitholders that did not agree to the buyout offer. On that same day the REIT manager said it was enlisting its parent firm to mount its own counterbid for the REIT’s units.

Future Prospects

Despite Starwood ultimately raising its offer to JPY 22500 per unit and lowering the acceptance threshold to 55 percent that bid ultimately failed to win approval after Invesco which had upped its own stake in the REIT to 7 percent in May ultimately bested that offer with that initiative winning acceptance from investors at JPY 22750 per unit on 28 July.

Invesco Office J-REIT was delisted from the Tokyo exchange in November with final closing on the privatisation taking place this month with Invesco which had enlarged its Invesco Asia Fund IV fund partially in response to the takeover opportunity now having committed 70 percent of the capital from that vehicle.

Following the privatisation Invesco and Gaw are expected to privatise some of the assets while also looking for opportunities to improve returns through value-add measures that will boost rents.

With the remaining capital from the value-add fund Invesco is focused on further opportunities in Japan as well as pursuing logistics development in Korea particularly in the Greater Seoul area.

“Overall we favour Japan and Korea as our top target investment markets in the region” Invesco’s Chou said. “We believe that the eventual lifting of COVID restrictions will aid growth in these markets and precipitate a strong recovery to pre-COVID levels.”

Saluting a Landmark

Kenneth Gaw president and managing principal of the family run investment firm hailed the completion of what he dubbed a “landmark transaction” alongside Invesco.

“We are extremely pleased to work with partners who have deep knowledge and operating experience in the Japan market and we look forward to collaborating on this investment” he said.

Gaw Capital which had $32.6 billion in assets under management as of the third quarter of 2021 entered Japan in 2014 through its investment in Hyatt Regency Osaka which it sold in 2016 for $153 million in the second-largest hotel deal in the city that year.

Other properties in Japan under Gaw’s portfolio include the Aoyama Building in Tokyo the H Beauty & Youth Flagship Store in Tokyo the Renaissance Okinawa Resort and Coco Garden Resort in Okinawa the Minatomirai Center Building in Yokohama the Toyobo Building in Osaka and the Matsushita IMP Building in Osaka.

The fund manager also has a residential portfolio comprising assets in Tokyo Osaka Kyoto Sapporo Nagoya and Yokohama.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMia2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWhpbmR1YnVzaW5lc3NsaW5lLmNvbS9idXNpbmVzcy1sYXdzL3Jpc2luZy1zaGFyZWhvbGRlci1hY3RpdmlzbS1pbi1pbmRpYS9hcnRpY2xlNjQ5MTAyNTEuZWNl0gFwaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cudGhlaGluZHVidXNpbmVzc2xpbmUuY29tL2J1c2luZXNzLWxhd3MvcmlzaW5nLXNoYXJlaG9sZGVyLWFjdGl2aXNtLWluLWluZGlhL2FydGljbGU2NDkxMDI1MS5lY2UvYW1wLw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Rising shareholder activism in India,"There is a sudden spurt in shareholder activism in the country due to a plethora of reasons such as economic slowdown due to the pandemic better-informed investors more institutional investors changes in the company law regime under which corporate decisions are subject to greater scrutiny. Shareholder activism is good because it improves corporate governance. But what if even if for better governance the shareholders make demands which run against the law? Such a situation appears to have arisen between Zee Entertainment Enterprises Ltd (Zee) and its institutional investors which includes Invesco Developing Markets Fund (Invesco) and OFI Global China Fund LLC (OFI).

The Zee-Invesco saga

The dispute began when Invesco and OFI investor-shareholders in Zee with a 17.88 per cent stake issued a requisition notice on September 11 2021 to Zee to call an extraordinary general meeting (EGM). (An EGM can be requisitioned by a shareholder holding atleast a 10 per cent stake).

The requisition notice amongst other things sought the removal of Punit Goenka the current MD and CEO of Zee as a director. Further the requisition notice contained six resolutions seeking the appointment of six named individuals as ‘independent directors’. As per the law Zee would have had a 21-day window from the date of issuance of requisition notice until October 3 2021 to call the EGM. However on September 29 2021 Invesco filed a petition before the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) seeking an order to call and hold the EGM of Zee on or before October 28 2021.

While the matter before NCLT was pending following an order of the National Company Law Appellate Tribunal (NCLAT) Zee’s board held a meeting on October 1 2021 from which Goenka recused himself. Based on the legal opinions received Zee’s board concluded that the requisition notice was invalid. Accordingly Zee expressed its inability to convene the EGM. The board also decided that Zee should approach the Bombay High Court to question the validity of the requisition notice. On October 1 2021 Zee conveyed to Invesco its decision to not call an EGM. Zee’s reasons for not calling the EGM amongst other things included contravention of provisions carried under the Companies Act SEBI Listing Regulations Zee’s articles of association SEBI Takeover Regulations and the Competition Act.

Further as decided Zee filed a suit against Invesco and OFI on the same day. Before the High Court Zee sought a declaration that the requisition notice was illegal and incapable of implementation. Before the High Court the question was whether a court (and not the board) can be asked to assess the validity of resolutions proposed at the requisitioned EGM even before the EGM is called and held. The High Court observed that Section 100 of the Companies Act was at the heart of the controversy.

Section 100 of the Companies Act provides that for a company with a share capital shareholders holding at least 10 per cent equity can requisition a meeting. The said provision does not constrain the purpose of the requisition and only requires the numerical threshold of 10 per cent to be met. The High Court opined that there was equally nothing in Section 100 of the Companies Act which said that a resolution proposed by shareholders could never be called into question before the requisitioned meeting is held.

Upon hearing submissions of Zee the High Court concluded that the resolutions proposed at the requisitioned EGM were plainly illegal. The High Court observed that no shareholder could be permitted to drive its company into a state of non-compliance with the law. Accordingly the High Court granted an injunction in terms of the prayers of Zee restraining Invesco and OFI from taking any step in furtherance of requisition notice. Aggrieved by the decision Invesco filed an appeal before the High Court’s division bench which is pending adjudication. Invesco and OFI based their case on multiple grounds including (i) the lack of jurisdiction of the single judge to grant an injunction (ii) the ‘10 per cent holding’ being the numerical threshold prescribed under the Companies Act and (iii) the right of shareholders to call for an EGM. Against this backdrop it remains to be seen how the Zee-Sony merger proposal pans out. The Zee-Invesco dispute has started a debate as to whether shareholder activism needs to be promoted and whether it has a beneficial impact on corporate governance. Sceptics of shareholder activism argue that institutional investors lately have been voraciously interfering even on regular day-to-day matters of companies.

A desirable phenomenon

Shareholder activism as a phenomenon is desirable and must be promoted. Companies on their part need to clearly communicate their goals and objectives to institutional investors. Furthermore a company’s management should convey the rationale of its decisions and link them to the company’s objectives. As for injunctions orders restraining the holding of a requisitioned meeting should not be passed as a routine exercise. The courts must be circumspect while passing any injunctions to ensure that shareholders are allowed to set the affairs of the company right.

The general judicial approach should be to not interfere with the internal governance of a corporation. However if the resolution proposed to be passed is itself wholly illegal then the courts may interfere and leave the board under no obligation to call the meeting.

Dolo 650 became the most prescribed medicine during the COVID-19 pandemic. The drug cornered sales of Rs 567 crore since March 2020 selling more than 350 crore pills and 7.5 crore strips of medicine.

The sales peaked during the second wave as it sold Rs 49 crore worth of tablets in April 2021 the highest monthly sales ever made as per the data from healthcare research firm IQVIA. People on the internet have gone as far as calling it India’s national tablet and favourite snack.

In 2019 the sales of all brands under the paracetamol category were nearly Rs 530 crore touching Rs 924 crore by 2021. With a turnover of Rs 307 crore (in 2021) Dolo is India’s second most sold anti-fever and analgesic tablet Crocin is the sixth-largest with sales of Rs 23.6 crore.

As per the data from healthcare research firm IQVIA India sold nearly 7.5 crore strips of Dolo — a paracetamol tablet manufactured by Bengaluru-based Micro Labs Ltd — before the Covid outbreak in 2019.

Dolo which is currently the most prescribed fever medicine for Covid-19 patients registered a turnover of Rs 307 crore in 2021 according to the data.

In comparison GSK Pharmaceuticals’ Calpol had a turnover of Rs 310 crore while Crocin logged double-digit sales at Rs 23.6 crore last year. Somehow the Dolo-650 brand has become synonymous with fever amid the pandemic.

According to Charu Goel Sachdeva HOD and Consultant-Internal Medicine Manipal Dwarka Hospital in New Delhi Dolo-650 is basically a paracetamol drug.

“Because of its safety profile and its efficacy Dolo-650 is preferable. From experience we have seen that people respond well to this and fever starts subsiding fast. It is not only an antipyretic medicine but also has an anti-inflammatory effect as well and you don’t have to worry about nephrotoxicity or having any kind of major interaction like with many other drugs” Sachdeva told IANS.

Founded by G.C. Surana in 1973 in Chennai Micro Labs Ltd manufactures Dolo with 650 milligram (mg) of paracetamol while most other brands sell their paracetamol brand with 500 mg salt — giving a general perception that Dolo-650 is more effective.

Micro Labs with 9200 employees has an annual turnover of Rs 2700 crore including exports that contribute Rs 920 crore.

Data from IQVIA a human data science and advanced analytics firm in healthcare also shows that Dolo and Calpol are the key brands driving the paracetamol segment.



Since last week #Dolo650 has been trending on social media in a meme-fest. There are nearly 37 brands of paracetamol being sold in various regions in the country.

According to Ravi Shekhar Jha Additional Director and Head Pulmonology Fortis Escorts Hospital Faridabad the safety profile of Dolo is good and it is not very costly either.

“The symptom that is most bothersome for Covid patients is fever. Fever leads to an increase in heart rate and body pain. The safety profile of Dolo is good and it is a cheap medicine too. Most of the patients do not even need more than 1 Dolo tablet” Jha told IANS.

Aviral Bhatnagar an investor at Venture Highway which is an early-stage seed fund said in a tweet on Thursday: “Dolo-650 is a sleeper hit: 3.5B pills sold in pandemic ~600 Cr of sales with one drug used for treating virtually everything brand name equal to paracetamol manufacturer Micro Labs doing 2700 Cr of revenue Founding Surana family worth $2Bn+.”

But what has made Dolo 650 a cult favourite?

Founded by G.C. Surana in 1973 Micro Labs Ltd. manufactures Dolo with 650 milligrams (mg) of paracetamol while most other brands sell their paracetamol brand with 500 mg salt which is claimed as more effective.

Crocin or Dolo or Calpol - these are different brand names given by pharma companies that sell the same salt under their copyright. Dolo's popularity compared to other paracetamol tablets is unexplained since all paracetamols are alike. Experts say Dolo's growth compared to other brands could be attributed to its more straightforward name.

Another reason is Dolo's offering of the 650 milligrams (MG) category and the perception that it's more effective on fever. MicroLabs's strategy of using the medical term preferred by doctors for fever called Fever of Unknown Origin or FUO in brand promotion also played a key role in increasing its trustworthiness. Moreover in 2010 Dolo 650 was awarded as the best-managed brand of the year and recognised as India's most admired brand.

Micro Labs with 9200 employees has an annual turnover of Rs 2700 crore including exports that contribute Rs 920 crore.

Paracetamol a generic salt which is a common painkiller used to treat aches and reduce high body temperature has been on the market since the 1960s. Paracetamol tablets are the most consumed medicines for cold and fever which witnessed a massive surge in sales during COVID-19.

This company which is in the Zacks Electronics - Miscellaneous Services industry shows potential for another earnings beat.

This payment processsing company has an established record of topping earnings estimates especially when looking at the previous two reports. The company boasts an average surprise for the past two quarters of 7.38%.

For the last reported quarter Jack Henry came out with earnings of $1.22 per share versus the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.14 per share representing a surprise of 7.02%. For the previous quarter the company was expected to post earnings of $1.29 per share and it actually produced earnings of $1.39 per share delivering a surprise of 7.75%.

Price and EPS Surprise

For Jack Henry estimates have been trending higher thanks in part to this earnings surprise history. And when you look at the stock's positive Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) it's a great indicator of a future earnings beat especially when combined with its solid Zacks Rank.

Our research shows that stocks with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time. In other words if you have 10 stocks with this combination the number of stocks that beat the consensus estimate could be as high as seven.

The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is related to change. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.

Jack Henry has an Earnings ESP of +1.01% at the moment suggesting that analysts have grown bullish on its near-term earnings potential. When you combine this positive Earnings ESP with the stock's Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) it shows that another beat is possibly around the corner. The company's next earnings report is expected to be released on May 7 2024.

With the Earnings ESP metric it's important to note that a negative value reduces its predictive power; however a negative Earnings ESP does not indicate an earnings miss.

Many companies end up beating the consensus EPS estimate but that may not be the sole basis for their stocks moving higher. On the other hand some stocks may hold their ground even if they end up missing the consensus estimate.

Because of this it's really important to check a company's Earnings ESP ahead of its quarterly release to increase the odds of success. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.

Every feeder will have at least one most likely several and every wood patch will have a small flock. The chickadee is easily recognizable by its small size and its facial pattern a large patch of white below its black crown and above its black bib. The chickadee’s call is unique as well a chirped rendition of its name.

Nevertheless the chickadee is a bird of mystery. Here are the two big questions about these little birds:

How do they survive the cold?

And where do they go in the summer?

The answer to the first question is that chickadees are superbly well adapted to survive cold weather. An online posting by the Montana Natural History Center gives a three-part answer. Chickadees are well insulated they’re active and they have good memories.

READ MORE ABOUT BIRDWATCHING:





Each of these is remarkable by itself.

Insulation first. Chickadees have a layer of feathers half an inch thick. These trap warm air against their small bodies. What’s more chickadees can regulate their body temperature maintaining it at 100 degrees during the day and reducing it at night. This semi-torpid state conserves energy.

Everyone who’s watched chickadees knows that they keep busy. They haul away seeds several at a time and they hide them one at a time each in a separate place. And they remember where they are.

This is the most astonishing thing about chickadees. They can change the size of their brains shedding some brain cells late in the season and replacing them with what we might call memory cells enough of these to store the location of each of the several thousand seeds they store away.

This practice is called “scatter hoarding” and it’s not unique to chickadees. Blue jays do it too. They make a morning’s work of hauling unsalted peanuts from a pan on our deck.

Chickadees haul away a lot of sunflower seeds up to 1000 a day. At that rate their total haul might reach more than 100000 seeds in a normal winter. Each of these is deposited in some crevice somewhere nearby ready to be recovered.

These little birds are voracious eaters eating almost constantly so the hoard is critical to their survival.

Despite these adaptations mortality is high among chickadees. .

All of this means that chickadees are not shy of the cold. They occur over a wide swath across the middle of North America reaching interior Alaska and curving southeastward to Newfoundland. The southern limit of their range is a similar arch from southern Oregon to New Jersey with a little extension through the Appalachian Mountains that reaches extreme northern Georgia.

This encompasses some of the coldest places on the continent including the Red River Valley.

Chickadees are actually year-round residents here. They simply get shier and more secretive in nesting season. Although they are not daily visitors to my feeders in summer at least one chickadee will show up from time to time. This suggests they are nesting nearby perhaps in a hole in one of the trees in the shelterbelts that surround the place that Suezette and I share west of Gilby about 30 miles northwest of Grand Forks.

Chickadees are monogamous and pair bonds are formed throughout the year the monograph on the species in the American Ornithological Society’s series “The Birds of North America” informs me.

They maintain a large territory averaging 5.3 hectares or about 13 acres. Winter flocks are hierarchical.

Yet chickadees are social birds occurring in flocks up to 14 or more and often with other species including nuthatches and downy woodpeckers. They appear to have a symbiotic relationship with the woodpeckers which respond to chickadee defense calls and may provide cracks in which chickadees stash seeds.

While chickadees are regular at our feeder array – numbering as many as six on some days – they are far from the most numerous of the birds that visit. That place belongs unquestionably to the redpolls which now number at least 100. To be honest that’s a guess. Redpolls are flighty. Sometimes they seem to cover the back yard in lively groups. I’ve managed to estimate the number of birds in these flocks but individual birds move continuously it seems to me from one group to another.

So counting them is impossible.

Trust me on this though. This is a stand-out year for redpolls. They’ll hang around until early spring about the time the snow finally disappears and head to the very northern limits of the continent.

Here is what you need to know about the Wildcats' bouncy forward with impressive bloodlines.

Jacob Toppin is New York Knicks first-rounder Obi Toppin's younger brother

Several breakout games for Toppin this season have helped him begin to carve out his own reputation on the court but he is still known most as former Dayton National Player of the Year Obi Toppin's younger brother.

The younger Toppin remains a work in progress as a basketball prospect but Obi has predicted Jacob will one day join him in the NBA.

""It means a lot because that’s my brother and I look up to him"" Jacob said last season after transferring from Rhode Island to Kentucky. ""I’m just trying to work every day getting better in the gym and hopefully one day that dream can come true.""

Jacob Toppin:What makes Kentucky forward an elite dunker? UK's 'dunkologist' breaks it down

Jacob's father Obadiah Toppin was a standout streetball player in New York City.

""I used to watch him play all the time when I was younger whether it was in streetball games or whether it was in the city playing at parks"" Jacob said. ""He is – he was – a great player. He was very energetic like me and my brother and he was very athletic.""

Jacob Toppin proved he is an elite dunker at Auburn

Before he even played in a game for Kentucky Toppin's reputation as an elite dunker was spread by his teammates.

""His dunks are ridiculous"" former Wildcat Terrence Clarke said before the 2020-21 season. ""I’ve personally seen him take two steps through the legs reverse on different levels. … If we were to have a dunk contest it would be pretty amazing but Jacob his bounce is ridiculous so I’d probably give it to him.""

Toppin has shown off that dunking ability several times in the game but perhaps no more impressively than the first half of the Jan. 22 game at Auburn when he slammed home a 360-degree dunk off a steal in the first half.

Oscar Tshiebwe:Why the 'Big Friendly Giant' is as important to Kentucky off court as on it

Jacob Toppin is Kentucky basketball's energy source

While Toppin's offensive skillset still needs refining his energy levels have never been a question when he takes the court for the Wildcats.

In fact it was learning to harness that energy in a positive way that led to some of his better performances this season. Both Toppin and UK coach John Calipari have pointed to the junior's maturation as being key to his development.

""I’m an energy guy on and off the court"" Toppin said. ""…So sometimes I can get goofy a little bit. I’m like not locked in anymore.""

Toppin's maturation was on full display in a loss at LSU when he contributed 14 points and eight rebounds.

“I’ve always been a person who likes to goof around"" Toppin said. ""But obviously I need to change it. And Coach Cal he’s helping me change it.'

The star has 'mountains of public goodwill' to offset negativity ...,"Dwayne “the Rock” Johnson’s nice guy reputation has been taking some hits — but the “mountains of public goodwill” he’s built over the years should outshine the drama an expert tells Yahoo Entertainment.

A recent report from the Wrap saw more than a dozen people who worked with Johnson on the upcoming holiday action-comedy film Red One criticize his “chronic lateness and lack of professionalism on set.”

Insiders claimed the Black Adam actor — who co-stars alongside Chris Evans and J.K. Simmons — “was late an average of seven to eight hours per day and missed several entire days of production” resulting in the movie running at least $50 million over budget. They pointed fingers at the film’s “inexperienced” lead producer Hiram Garcia who is Johnson’s ex-brother-in-law and ex-personal assistant for letting things spiral. An insider called the situation “a f***ing disaster” and claimed “Dwayne truly doesn’t give a f***.”

Sources claimed Johnson’s lateness is a pattern saying he had a “huge fight” with an “infuriated” Ryan Reynolds after showing up five hours late to the set of their movie Red Notice in 2020. There’s also a wild story about him urinating in water bottles (something he previously copped to doing).

A spokesperson for Amazon MGM the film studio behind Red One denied the claims in the report calling Johnson and his production company Seven Bucks “incredible partners.” Johnson insiders told the outlet he “averaged no more than one hour late” and “the budget did not deviate much from the agreed-upon figure.” Johnson’s rep did not respond to Yahoo’s request for comment.

Despite the scathing report a crisis and PR expert doesn’t expect this to cause lasting damage to Johnson’s reputation.

“There is a better chance of Martians landing on the lawn of the Biden White House than this ever permanently hurting the Rock” Eric Schiffer of Reputation Management Consultants tells Yahoo.

What’s going on with Johnson?

In addition to being one of the most bankable actors in Hollywood Johnson is one of the most likable celebrities — and a large part of that is due to his strong work ethic. Johnson brands himself as a hard worker — his Instagram with 397 million followers shows a dizzying schedule of gym time movie shoots meetings adorable girl dad moments and philanthropy.

Johnson’s production company Seven Bucks is a nod to his bank account balance when he was cut from a pro football team at age 22. It made the then broke star pivot to a career in wrestling rising through the ranks at the World Wrestling Federation (later called World Wrestling Entertainment or WWE) before crossing over to Hollywood and starring in the Fast and the Furious and Jumanji franchises. In 2016 Forbes listed Johnson as the highest-paid actor and currently estimates his net worth at $270 million between his movies production company wrestling endorsements and brands. A key part of his success is being able to connect with the masses but not forgetting his roots which is why many want to see him run for president.

It seems that over the last year-plus however there have been some negative headlines. The biggest prior to now was in September when he and Oprah Winfrey faced backlash after asking people to donate to their Maui wildfire fund — instead of giving more of their own money. He acknowledged the criticism and he and Winfrey quietly donated more than they had pledged.

The drama has been simmering elsewhere: His bankability took a small hit with 2022’s Black Adam which didn’t perform as well as anticipated and he faced criticism over how he handled it. The Wrap story also seemed to confirm that Johnson attempted to have his production company take over the DC films universe in 2022. It didn’t happen and Johnson going around others for the secret meeting didn’t sit well. Variety reported on that in 2023 with an insider saying Johnson’s “demands” — including having his brand of tequila served at a premiere of PG-13-rated Black Adam — “increased and the returns just weren’t there.”

This year Johnson made a big return to WWE and was appointed to the board of its parent company TKO but he was booed by fans for being almost two hours late to an April event. Recently he’s been hamming it up to play the villain in the pro wrestling storyline. The same week the View audience jeered the mention of his name for saying he won’t be endorsing a presidential candidate in the 2024 election. (He endorsed Joe Biden in 2020 but said he learned that sharing his political opinions only causes division.)

The Wrap story has brought back into conversation Johnson’s infamous feud with his Fast and the Furious franchise co-star Vin Diesel. If Johnson really does show up eight hours late to set — or not at all — that could certainly fuel tension (though reports at the time also cited Diesel’s lateness). The article also surfaces drama with Reynolds noting that the co-stars “didn’t speak for years” after their fall 2020 blowup but have since patched things up.

There’s been counterprogramming to the Wrap story. An unconfirmed report from Puck suggests that “unflattering” press about Johnson may stem from a former publicist. People magazine ran a story about Johnson’s “flourishing career” and how he’s found “success in many areas” with an unnamed source saying “People love him.” And the Rock’s own Instagram feed has been filled with sweet fan encounters and charitable endeavors.

Years of building a good reputation will ‘offset these recent damaging allegations’

It’s true — people do love Johnson who has spent years cultivating a good reputation and it should help see him through this negative patch of press.

“The best strategy for the Rock is to tackle the bad press in a setting where he can poke fun at himself and the facts of his situation” says Schiffer. “The Rock is beloved globally and has built mountains of public goodwill that can offset these recent damaging allegations.”

How does a star like Johnson who will voice the Maui character in the Moana sequel out later this year break the cycle of bad press? By “addressing the negative items with empathy and truth owning your part in it and then showing what you learned” says Schiffer.

He adds “The Rock did that well with the outcry in Hawaii and will likely do the same with the hits on being late on the set of his film.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNpbmN5anVuZ2xlLmNvbS8yMDI0LzUvNi8yNDE1MDQyNS9jaGFkLWpvaG5zb24tb2Nob2NpbmNvLXRlZS1oaWdnaW5zLWNvbnRyYWN0LWJlbmdhbHPSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Chad Johnson believes Tee Higgins and the Bengals will work out contract situation,"Joe Burrow and others are back in the building for the beginning of the offseason program for the Cincinnati Bengals.

It has been an interesting offseason for the Bengals... There were solid free-agency pickups and a good draft class but two trade requests since the end of last season.

One of those trade requests came from Tee Higgins after the Bengals placed the franchise tag on him.

There has been little to no progress since the trade request according to reports but Zac Taylor has made it clear he looks forward to seeing Higgins for the 2024 season.

Cincinnati Bengals legend Chad Ochocinco hit on the topic recently and says he has been in contact with Higgins “a few times.”

“I think we’re going to work it out. We’ll figure it out” Ochocinco said when asked about the contract issues between the two sides according to TMZ Sports.

Higgins is set to make over $20 million this season with the franchise tag but it is clear he wants long-term security as well.

Ochocinco ended his conversation with TMZ saying “It’s business — it’s the nature of the business. He’s going to be all right though.”

We will see what the long-term future holds for Higgins and the Bengals but as of right now I expect to see him suited up in week one and ready to roll."

Did Stanley Johnson – Boris Johnson’s father – write a book about depopulating the world using the Marburg virus and forced vaccination?

Take a look at the viral claim and find out what the facts really are!

Claim : Stanley Johnson’s Marburg Virus Book Is About Vaccine Depopulation!

Stanley Johnson – the father of UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson – is the latest villain according to messages circulating on Telegram WhatsApp Twitter and Facebook.

Apparently Stanley Johnson wrote a book about depopulating the world using the Marburg virus and forced vaccination!

Boris Johnson’s dad Stanley wrote a novel in 1982 called ‘The Virus’ about the government releasing a deadly Virus into the population as cover for population control using a forced vaccine. I am serious. Clown show.

Boris Johnson’s father Stanley Johnson thinks it is ridiculous that UK’s population is at 70 million and he says that it should be reduced to 10 to 15 million. Watch the short video here: his population control theory to reduce UK inhabitants to ‘10 or 15 million’. This British PM’s father Boris Johnson who wrote a novel about governments using a virus and forced vaccination as a form of depopulation and population control. One book he wrote is called “The Marburg Virus”. Stanley wrote several books about the overpopulation of England and the world and demanded that the world population be reduced. Does the apple fall far from the tree..? Imagine jabbing a population with something that a government has stated that they do not know what its impact on fertility is? 🧐

Truth : Stanley Johnson’s Marburg Virus Book Is NOT About Vaccine Depopulation!

This is yet another example of anti-vaccination FAKE NEWS and here are the reasons why…

Fact #1 : Stanley Johnson’s Novel Was Called The Marburg Virus

Stanley Johnson published his novel The Marburg Virus in 1982.

It was renamed as The Virus when it was republished by Witness Impulse in 2020 to capitalise on the COVID-19 pandemic.

As you may surmise the Marburg virus is a different virus from SARS-CoV-2 the COVID-19 virus. Republishing the novel with the old name may not help with sales.

Fact #2 : Plot Did Not Involve Government Releasing A Deadly Virus

The plot of Stanley Johnson’s novel did not involve any government releasing a deadly virus into the population as a cover for population control.

It was about a fictional epidemiologist Lowell Kaplan who is trying to track down the source of a deadly outbreak of the Marburg virus that started in New York.

It only tells of the US and USSR (yes it was published when the USSR still existed!) racing to control the main vector of the virus – African green monkeys.

Fact #3 : Plot Did Not Involve Population Control

The book does not mention population control even once. Neither did it suggest that a vaccine was used to kill people to reduce population size.

In fact its plot involved the creation of a vaccine which one character said was given out to 200 million Americans to save their lives.

That’s the complete opposite of population control. Like in real life the vaccine in the book saved lives.

Fact #4 : Marburg Virus Is Completely Different From SARS-CoV-2

The Marburg virus was not a new virus even when Stanley Johnson wrote about it in 1982 – it was discovered in 1967 in Marburg Germany.

It is also a completely different virus from SARS-CoV-2 in many ways :

it’s from a different virus family – Filoviridae not Coronaviridae

it’s very deadly with a mortality rate of 24% to 88%

it spreads through direct contact with blood and/or bodily fluids

it does not transmit as easily and has low pandemic risk

Fact #5 : UK Does Not Have Forced COVID-19 Vaccination

The suggestion that Boris Johnson’s father influenced him to reduce population through forced vaccination is nonsensical because the United Kingdom does NOT have forced COVID-19 vaccination.

No one in the UK is forced to get vaccinated against COVID-19. That’s why there are still about 6.25 million unvaccinated people in the UK – 9.3% of its population.

Fact #6 : UK Has Very High Vaccination Rates

There is frankly no need for a COVID-19 vaccine mandate in the United Kingdom because they have fully-vaccinated over 83% of their population.

More importantly the UK population isn’t dropping due to COVID-19 vaccination. People are NOT dying from the COVID-19 vaccines as suggested by the fake message.

Fact #7 : Stanley Johnson Was Against Migrants

Stanley Johnson believes that the UK’s population should be reduced to reduce its impact on the environment.

But he never once mentioned using vaccines as a method for population control. Instead he spoke out against migrants and a lack of family planning in poor countries.

The issue of migration is of course of fundamental importance in the overall demographic picture. UK’s key population statistics are increasingly influenced by migration. During Labour’s 13 years net inward migration totalled a staggering 3.6 million. There has also there been a significant introduction of women born overseas who are of child-bearing age and inclined in any case to favour large families. The place to solve the migrant and refugee crisis is in the countries where the potential migrants and refugees originate. The harsh truth is that in vast areas of the globe birth-rates remain much too high and per capita incomes ridiculously low.

Fact #8 : No One Controls Population Through Vaccines

COVID-19 vaccines have not only been proven safe they have also been proven to prevent severe disease and deaths.

In short COVID-19 vaccines save lives. That is the OPPOSITE of population control.

If any devious organisation or person wants to reduce population then they would try to scare people into not protecting themselves against COVID-19 using vaccines. Exactly what anti-vaccination activists are doing.

So what are they waiting for? People there keep telling me they need asset prices of merger partners to “normalize” aka fall enough so Goldman remains in control of the combined company.

Well we’re starting to see some “normal.”

A look at the asset prices of potential partners — PNC Bank US Bancorp State Street BNY Mellon some mid-sized asset managers and even potentially brokerage firm Charles Schwab & Co. — are starting to come back to earth as the Fed begins raising interest rates.

Another factor that might force CEO David Solomon’s hand are the obvious holes in Goldman’s business model. Goldman has a long and storied rep killing it in M&A and trading.

Tough competition

But it’s tough having only two horses in the race competing against banking behemoths like JPMorgan. Sure Goldman wasn’t the only bank to experience a hiccup because of trading volatility and higher expenses (the vaunted JPM did as well). But JPM has a big balance sheet far larger than the size of Goldman’s and JPM CEO Jamie Dimon can paper over surprises such as rapid and unexpected increases in compensation costs which bedeviled Solomon in the fourth quarter of 2021 and possibly into 2022.

That’s why Goldman’s earnings miss last week has the Wall Street rumor mill spinning again.

Solomon also knows that if you’re Goldman the merger has got to be the right one or else the CEO will go down in infamy as having evaporated one of the world’s greatest corporate brands.

And this is where it gets tricky. As for potential partners Schwab — the world’s most prestigious discount broker — would be an obvious choice. Schwab’s business involves registered investment advisers selling high-end financial products to rich people which complements Goldman’s own very high-end wealth-management business.

But Schwab’s price in Goldmanese hasn’t been normalized enough. The San Francisco-based Schwab has a market value of $168 billion compared to Goldman’s $115 billion. Charles Schwab’s ego — and yes the company’s 84-year-old founder namesake and chairman is still around — won’t let him sell out a bunch of traders in New York if he doesn’t have to.

Both PNC and US Bancorp have lower market caps than Goldman and they would be attractive particularly in a high-interest-rate environment the Fed has signaled; banks make a lot of money when rates rise.

But like Schwab neither has to do a deal. The monetary-policy environment favors their business model over Goldman’s.

Asset managers that might be available — think T. Rowe Price — would get Solly around $1.5 trillion in assets and entry into the lucrative mutual-fund business.

Ask yourself though: Why ­haven’t there been more marriages between fund companies and Wall Street? Answer: Combining those cultures is a little like trying to get Hillary Clinton to play nice with Donald Trump.

With all these variables to weigh the conventional wisdom among bankers is that Goldman isn’t rushing to do anything. Solomon is doing a great job; he’s beat earnings expectations seven times before the recent fourth-quarter 2021 miss. Some analysts say his stock looks cheap compared to competitors like Morgan Stanley but Goldman has the edge in market prowess.

That’s one way to look at it; another way is the reason why Morgan Stanley beat fourth-quarter expectations: It has a huge wealth-management business that stabilized and papered over a trading slowdown.

Again Solomon and his people are smart. They know they have to do a deal and the right one at the right time.

Sensible ‘Fink think’

Larry Fink’s annual letter to CEOs is always must-read material this year even more so because he added a fair amount of common sense to the relentless push by the Biden administration and corporate America to adopt green-energy policies.

Fink the CEO of BlackRock is no stranger to this effort. He’s used his clout as chief of the world’s largest money-management firm ($9 trillion in assets) to prod companies to adopt policies that he believes will transition the country and the world to what’s known as “net zero” carbon admissions.

With that came criticism from conservatives and this column since BlackRock alumni fill the Biden White House. Yes green energy sounds good in practice and Teslas are very popular in Beverly Hills but working-class Americans can’t afford electric cars. Higher oil and gas prices are tax increases on Middle America.

Fink didn’t back off his embrace of green energy. But in the letter he also pointed out how this movement is being hijacked by environmental zealots.

He advocated for a transition that takes into account that “any plan that focuses solely on limiting supply and fails to address demand for hydrocarbons will drive up energy prices for those who can least afford it resulting in greater polarization around climate change and eroding progress.”

Let’s hope his friends in the Biden administration are listening.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmF4aW9zLmNvbS8yMDIyLzAxLzIxL21heW9ycy1zZWUtY3J5cHRvY3VycmVuY3ktYXMtYS13YXktdG8tYWRkcmVzcy1pbmNvbWUtaW5lcXVhbGl0edIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Mayors see cryptocurrency as a way to address income inequality,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.axios.com/2022/01/21/mayors-see-cryptocurrency-as-a-way-to-address-income-inequality on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmF4aW9zLmNvbS8yMDIyLzAxLzIxL21heW9ycy1zZWUtY3J5cHRvY3VycmVuY3ktYXMtYS13YXktdG8tYWRkcmVzcy1pbmNvbWUtaW5lcXVhbGl0edIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMijAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5mb3JiZXMuY29tL3NpdGVzL2VsaXphYmV0aG1hY2JyaWRlLzIwMjIvMDEvMjIvY29sbGFib3JhdGl2ZS1ieS1uYXR1cmUtYW5kLW5lY2Vzc2l0eS1uZXctYnVpbGRlcnMtd2luLWJ5LWZvY3VzaW5nLW9uLXNvZnQtc2tpbGxzL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,The Next Generation Of Business Leaders Is Redefining Grit.

It was reported as the third most expensive residential deal in U.S. history.

Now it’s the fourth.

Bloomberg News and other financial media reported Thursday that Tsai through his private investment vehicle Blue Pool Capital had paid $188 million for the penthouse in the same building ... 13 floors above the apartment he purchased last year...

Blue Pool paid $188 million for the 220 Central Park South property according to New York registry documents. The firm took out a $71.5 million 30-year mortgage through JPMorgan Chase & Co. for the property on the 73rd floor the filings show. The purchase included a maid’s room on a lower level.

No one is saying what Tsai is planning to do with the penthouse or for that matter the two floors in the 60s. Is all that high-priced real estate an investment? The previous owner doubled his investment in three years. One thing it does seem to indicate is that Tsai is fully committed to New York. One does not spend a third of a billion dollars on two apartments without a real commitment.

Tsai and his wife Clara Wu Tsai maintain residences in Hong Kong and LaJolla a toney neighborhood of San Diego. It appears that the couple will become New York residents for the first time since they left the city 25 years ago to help found Alibaba.

UPDATE: A spokesperson for Tsai says reports including in Bloomberg story that Blue Pool Capital also invests for Jack Ma the founder of Alibaba and a controversial figure in China are inaccurate. Blue Pool invests for Tsai.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTGh0dHBzOi8vZmluYW5jZS55YWhvby5jb20vbmV3cy92aWRlby1zaG93cy1zdGFmZi1waW5uaW5nLXRlZW4tMjAyOTQ4MzcwLmh0bWzSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Video Shows Staff Pinning Teen Down for 30 Mins in Cell Before He Died,"Footage released late Friday by authorities in Sedgwick County Kansas shows employees of a county juvenile center holding a 17-year-old boy on the floor of a cell for more than half an hour just two days before his death.

The Sept. 26 death of the teenager Cedric Lofton attracted national attention after an autopsy report ruled it a homicide. The county DA has declined to press charges against the juvenile center employees but Lofton’s family members have demanded they be held accountable.

“Cedric’s death was caused by the hands of the very authorities that were obligated to protect him and make sure he was safe” the family said previously in a statement through civil rights attorneys Andrew M. Stroth and Steven Hart. “These senseless killings by authorities must stop! Cedric and his family deserved better.”

According to the local sheriff’s office Lofton was booked into the Sedgwick County Juvenile Intake and Assessment Center on Sept. 26 after his father called to ask for a mental health assessment. (The father later told investigators his son had become “paranoid” and was convinced that students in his class were trying to kill him.) The sheriff’s office says Lofton refused voluntary treatment and resisted arrest and was taken to the juvenile center on suspicion of assaulting a police officer.

The video which spans more than an hour and a half reveals some of what happened in the time after officers dropped Lofton off at the facility. It shows the teenager walking around the lobby and talking to two center employees—it is unclear what the three men say; the video has no sound—who eventually grab him and attempt to restrain him. When he resists they force him into a nearby cell where they are joined by two more employees. The four proceed to restrain him on the floor for more than 30 minutes before placing him in handcuffs. A few minutes later according to the DA’s office they realized he did not have a heartbeat.

EMS workers rushed into the room and briefly restarted Lofton’s pulse before rushing him to the hospital where he would die two days later of cardiopulmonary arrest.

An autopsy report released last month deemed Lofton’s death a homicide caused by a physical struggle while in a restrained position. Sedgwick County District Attorney Marc Bennett reiterated as much in a press conference this week saying that “the long-lasting struggle while he was in [a] face-down position impeded his breathing which caused the supply of oxygen to his heart to be compromised until the point that his heart stopped.”

But Bennett declined to press charges against anyone involved claiming the juvenile center workers were acting in self-defense and therefore immune from prosecution. He added that none of the employees said Lofton indicated he was struggling to breathe.

“Is it reckless in a general sense?” Bennett said of the employees’ behavior. “Perhaps. But is it reckless under Kansas law? It is not.”

The NAACP had previously called on the county to file charges saying that Lofton's death ‘“whether negligent or intentional” was “unconscionable and inhumane.”

“The perpetrator(s) of his injustice must be fully prosecuted” the national civil rights group said. “As a community city state and country we cannot continue with the violent intersection of law enforcement and the Black community.”

In a statement through their attorneys Lofton’s family called the decision “yet another instance of an unarmed Black teenager killed by law enforcement with impunity.”

“Similar to the George Floyd case Cedric’s death was caused by authorities obligated to protect him” they said. “In this case they restrained Cedric in the prone position and took his breath away.”

From M&Ms’ mascots becoming more inclusive to a bologna face mask there was lots of wild food news this week.

We’ve done the dutiful task of rounding it all up if you need a change of pace from the doom and gloom of all that other “news.” Here’s what happened:

Bologna mask

It quickly sold out. Kraft Heinz

Oscar Mayer debuted a bologna-inspired face mask that quickly sold out. The new product isn’t actually a slab of meat. Rather Kraft Heinz (KHC) partnered with Seoul Mamas a Korean skin care company to create a “hydrating and restoring hydrogel” mask that promotes skin elasticity improves hydration and moisture retention.

The $5 skin care product was created as a “playful spin on the often serious ‘New Year New You’ trope with its meaty take on the self-care space” Kraft Heinz said in a press release. It will be restocked on Amazon in the coming days.

M&Ms’ makeover

Their new look. M&Ms

M&Ms’ anthropomorphized chocolate characters are getting a makeover the candy maker announced this week. Their most noticeable change: new shoes.

Bear with us here: Green has swapped her go-go boots for sneakers. Brown is sporting lower more sensible heels. Red and Yellow’s shoes now have laces. Orange’s shoe laces are no longer untied. (Much safer now.) And Blue’s shoes while little changed resemble what Anton Vincent president of Mars Wrigley North America described as “a bad version of Uggs.”

Mars Wrigley which owns M&Ms is trying to make the characters — particularly the female ones — more “current” and “representative of our consumer” the company said.

The M&M logo last tweaked in 2019 is also getting an adjustment. Instead of resting on its side it’s set up straight. The new orientation is designed to emphasize the ampersand.

New cans

The new packaging. Coca-Cola

Coca-Cola (CCEP) is unveiling a new look for its flavored Coke products later this month. It’s part of the company’s renewed focus on its Coke brand as it dumps low-selling niche products and tries to drum up excitement for its core beverages.

In the United States new versions of Cherry Coke cans and bottles now come in magenta with the white Coca-Cola logo emblazoned on the regular version and a black Coca-Cola logo on the Zero Sugar version. The new Vanilla Coke cans and bottles are cream-colored and the Cherry Vanilla flavor’s new packaging is a mix of the two hues (heavy on the magenta).

The idea is to “modernize and simplify the look … [and] help consumers find the flavor they’re looking for on the shelf” said Natalia Suarez senior brand manager of Coke Choice Portfolio the company’s North America operating unit.

White Castle changes plans

Yummy. Courtesy White Castle

Love at White Castle is getting canceled because of Omicron. The burger chain’s restaurants in select markets have long held a special dining-in experience on February 14 for lovesick couples who want to remember their special day with $1 burgers and french fries.

But as the highly contagious variant surge continues White Castle announced that it won’t be doing the event at all this year. Rather it’s marking the date with a to-go celebration in a very pink “Love Cube” meal box for two. It includes eight cheese sliders two small soft drinks and a choice of two shareable sides for about $15. And what says love better than that?

I’ve never been a fan of the term DJ but I have always been a big fan of the job. I’ve had my turn at other jobs and each of them were truly outstanding. I loved what I did.

Most included travel throughout the US and eventually throughout the world. I was fortunate enough to go to the nicest restaurants in the world travel first class and by limo go to all the major sporting events all on the company’s dime.

Townsquare Media Townsquare Media loading...

I got to meet celebrities and professional athletes and some of the greatest people but nothing compares to the job of being on the radio. I gave up all that pomp and circumstance of my past career and took a major pay cut to get back into radio it’s what I love to do.

People in my previous industry thought I had lost my mind how could I give up that job that everyone wanted the great apartment and lifestyle. I threw it all away and never doubted myself for a minute. Playing the hits is the best job I've ever had. When you have a passion for music and entertaining and those worlds collide it is a great pleasure to have that as your job. I have never taken for granted the job that I have and it takes hard work and a little bit of talent to be good at being on the radio.

When I got back on the radio I knew I would start back at the bottom and work my way back up and let me tell you something working at the bottom of radio is tough. When you’re at the bottom the money sucks the hours are horrendous and it’s virtually a thankless job but all that’s okay because you get to play the hits. As you rise up from the bottom the money gets a little bit better the hours become a little steadier you have a little more confidence and you’re playing great music while working hard at honing your craft. Life is good.

I got back into radio here in New Jersey in the '90s working at Oldies 107.1 in Long Branch. I filled in during the holidays did what I was told and in a short time I was on from 3–7 p.m. Mon-Fri. and eventually became the Program Director. I had a blast.

We had great promotions a great staff and most importantly our ratings were very good. We hosted many Oldies concerts and I got to meet and become friends with many of the groups that I hosted. The station was sold in 1996 and December of 1996 I was the last man on the air to turn the switch over to the new owners.

The next month I was at New Jersey 101.5 playing the hits on the weekends because they were talk during the week.

This month marks my 25th year here at New Jersey 101.5 and I still have the best job in the world. To every one of my Program Directors I thank you. Thank you for allowing me to do what I love best being a DJ.

If you are unsure if the item you purchased has been recalled

There have been a few recalls by Kroger this month including a that also affected Trader Joe's.

Further questions can be answered at 1-800-KROGERS Monday through Friday. The line is open from 8:00 a.m. to 12:00 a.m. EST and Saturday and Sunday 8:00 a.m. to 9:30 p.m. EST.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiRmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRhaWx5ZG90LmNvbS9pcmwva3JvZ2VyLXByaWNlLXRhZy1jaGFuZ2UtZGVjZXB0aW9uLXRpa3Rvay_SAUpodHRwczovL3d3dy5kYWlseWRvdC5jb20vaXJsL2tyb2dlci1wcmljZS10YWctY2hhbmdlLWRlY2VwdGlvbi10aWt0b2svP2FtcA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,‘This should be illegal’: Kroger worker replaces price tag to make item look like it’s on sale in viral TikTok,"On Jan. 17 an alleged Kroger worker posted a TikTok where he replaced a price tag on an item with a “sale” tag. Except the new price was the same as the original drawing concerns over the legality of the act.

User @kekm_ starts the video with the overlay text reading “this should be illegal.” The TikToker then peels off a $2.49 price tag of Velveeta cheese on a shelf just to replace it with a new one that claims the original price was $2.99. In the tag the new “sale” price is still $2.49 showing the item isn’t actually discounted.

Almost 1 million people have now viewed the TikTok with a barrage of viewers flooding the comments debating on whether this is truly illicit or not.

Many commenters stated that this was nothing new but is in fact a tactic many retail store departments have been using for ages.

“Tell me you’ve never worked retail without telling me you’ve never worked retail” one wrote.

“This is literally what they do everywhere during Black Friday” another commented.

However some were quick to refer to other large retail stores that were served class-action lawsuits for similar sale tactics. “It is illegal. A store cannot raise the price of goods for the purpose of having a “sale” at normal price. Can be hard to catch and prove intent tho” one comment read. A few cited well-known department store Kohl’s as losing a “huge lawsuit over it.”

According to a 2016 NBC News article Kohl’s was not the only one to get sued for “fake” sale pricing. Retail giants like JCPenney Sears and Macy’s were also hit with lawsuits.

“Customers have the right to be told the truth about the prices they’re paying—and to know if a bargain is really a bargain” said Los Angeles City Attorney Mike Feuer in a statement according to NBC. The article adds that “under California law stores can’t advertise a former price unless it was the going price as of three months ago or if the date of the original price is clearly shown in the ad.” Kohl’s previously settled a similar lawsuit for $6.15 million.

It is still unclear whether the Kroger price change shown in @kekm_’s TikTok is enough to warrant the extent of a lawsuit but the general consensus seems to be people don’t like being duped.

“[The tactic] works too” a TikToker commented. “It just goes to show you people care more about the perception of a “deal” than really thinking about if a product is worth the price.”

The Daily Dot reached out to @kekm_ and Kroger for comment.

SUPERMARKET SWEEP Five best own brand copycat products including Kirkland and Kroger revealed – and they could save you $100s

NOW that the holidays are over and inflation is on the rise many people are looking for ways to make the dollar go further.

And taking a look at your grocery bill is a great way to start saving money.

6 Ditching name brand products for own brand can save you a lot of dollars

When you are looking at your grocery bill you should pay attention to what brands you are buying.

If you have been shopping brand-named products at the grocery store now would be a great time to switch over to off-brand products.

Off-brand products are generally cheaper because they spend less on development marketing and advertising than national brands.

In fact Ramsey Solutions has compared three popular meals and the ingredient prices and found that you can save $20 a week.

Below we've shared a few of our favorite off-brand products that will not only help you save money but they are of better quality too.

We picked them out with the help of reviews as well as our own opinions but keep in mind prices could vary depending on where you live.

Nutella vs Kirkland Hazelnut Spread

6 Reviewers say Kirkland's hazelnut spread 'tastes amazing'

Nutella is the best-selling hazelnut chocolate spread on the market and its name is recognized across much of the world.

However it is also quite expensive.

Walmart charges $5.98 for one 33.5-ounce jar of Nutella and Amazon asks $19.49 for a two-pack of 33.5-ounce Nutella.

But Kirkland's hazelnut spread is just as good and costs less.

It is priced at $7.99 for a package of two 35.2-ounce jars. Therefore you can get 70.4 ounces of hazelnut spread for about the same cost as one Nutella jar.

An Amazon reviewer said: ""This stuff tastes AMAZING!! Dare I say 'better' than Nutella?!!

""The hazelnut flavor is much stronger (IMHO) than any similar product’s flavor including the name brand’s.""

Another reviewer said ""It makes our family happy with that special chocolate/hazelnut treat.""

Peter Pan Peanut Butter vs Kroger Peanut Butter

6 Kroger peanut butter tastes the same and costs less

A single 16.3 oz jar of Peter Pan's creamy butter sells at $2.69.

However a single 16 oz jar of Kroger's creamy peanut butter sells at $1.50.

You would be saving $1.19 on every purchase by switching to Kroger's peanut butter.

Kellogg’s Froot Loops vs. Target’s Market Pantry Far Out Fruities

6 Far Out Fruities is a fun and delicious cereal without artificial colors

Kellogg’s Froot Loops are more vibrant almost jewel-toned and give off a strong fruity scent.

Whereas Far Out Fruities’ coloring and scent are slightly more subdued.

Though when it came to flavor Market Pantry’s is significantly better in our opinion.

With a lighter fruit flavor Far Out Fruities beat Froot Loops’ intense sugary taste.

Opting for the generic version of this cereal could save you about $1.30 per box.

Tylenol vs CVS Pain Relief Tablets

6 Store brands must go through the same FDA approval process as brand names

A person will pay typically $6.59 for 24 500mg tablets of Tylenol.

However there is no difference between brand-name over-the-counter drugs and store-brand over-the-counter drugs.

Store brands must go through the same FDA approval process as brand names and they must meet the same safety and effectiveness standards.

Therefore the only difference between the products is the name on the box.

Thus it'd be better to buy would be 24 500mg tablets of CVS pain relief tablets at $5.79.

All vs Arm and Hammer

6 Save money on your laundry detergent

For a 36 fl oz container of All free and clear laundry detergent you will typically have to pay $5.29. This equates to $0.15 per fl oz.

However you can pay $0.20 more and purchase a 75 fl oz of Arm and Hammer laundry detergent. This equates to $0.07 per fl oz.

Arm and Hammer laundry detergent is not only cheaper but it also works just as well.

When Arm and Hammer is on sale the detergent usually goes for about $3.50.

Kumiko also known as The Budget Mom revealed on her blog a few years ago: ""Sometimes national brands manufacture products for store brands. So you are getting the same exact quality as the major brands.

""There are some Walmart stores and it depends on what region the stores are in that sell Great Value salty snacks like potato and tortilla chips that are made by Frito Lay.

""So instead of paying $3 or $4 a bag you will pay closer to a buck a bag.""

The Sun also explains how you can turn $1 worth of food stamps into $25 worth of goods and how to apply for emergency $95 food stamps payments.

The No. 1 overall prospect in the class of 2023 is more than just a quarterback. Arch Manning can also make plays on the basketball court.

Manning’s recent games have featured a couple of national championship-winning coaches in the crowd. Alabama’s Nick Saban and Georgia’s Kirby Smart were spotted in the stands continuing their hot pursuit of the five-star quarterback.

Texas Georiga Alabama Ole Miss and Clemson all received visits from Manning in the fall but other schools such as Oklahoma and LSU are trying to get involved. It was reported Manning met with coaches from Texas and many other programs last week.

Whoever lands Manning will get a massive boost to their 2023 recruiting class. Many elite talents have shown interest in playing with Manning at the collegiate level.

The timetrame remains unclear when Manning will make a decision regarding his future. Texas is squarely in the mix.

WASHINGTON/SAN FRANCISCO: Intel Corp said on Friday it would invest up to $100 billion to build potentially the world's largest chip-making complex in Ohio looking to boost capacity as a global shortage of semiconductors affects everything from smartphones to cars.The move is part of Chief Executive Officer Pat Gelsinger's strategy to restore Intel's dominance in chip making and reduce America's reliance on Asian manufacturing hubs which have a tight hold on the market.An initial $20 billion investment - the largest in Ohio's history - on a 1000-acre site in New Albany will create 3000 jobs Gelsinger said. That could grow to $100 billion with eight total fabrication plants and would be the largest investment on record in Ohio he told Reuters.Dubbed the silicon heartland it could become ""the largest semiconductor manufacturing location on the planet"" he said.While chipmakers are scrambling to boost output Intel's plans for new factories will not alleviate the current supply crunch because such complexes take years to build.Gelsinger reiterated on Friday he expected the chip shortages to persist into 2023.To dramatically increase chip production in the United States the Biden administration aims to persuade Congress to approve $52 billion in subsidy funding.U.S. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said on Friday the House of Representatives would soon introduce a bill on competitiveness to help bolster semiconductor investment and supply chains. That would include the $52 billion funding https://www.reuters.com/world/us/pelosi-says-us-house-will-soon-introduce-competitiveness-bill-2022-01-21.U.S. President Joe Biden touted Intel's investment on Friday at a White House event with Gelsinger and again made the case for congressional action.""China is doing everything it can to take over the global market so they can try to out compete the rest of us"" Biden said.U.S. Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo said at the event the current semiconductor supply chain is ""far too dependent on conditions and countries halfway around the world.""Gelsinger said without government funding ""we're still going to start the Ohio site.

""Ask yourself what portion of your life is not becoming more digital.""""Yes the industry is growing and maybe the metaverse solves world hunger for the semiconductor industry.

Figures released this week by the Pennsylvania Gaming Control Board show the south Bethlehem casino raking in approximately $450 million last year nearly $265 million in slot machines and another $185.1 million in table games.

Wind Creek’s totals in both categories rank it second out of Pennsylvania’s 15 in-person casinos for 2021 trailing only Bucks County’s Parx Casino.

Both segment figures represented more than 75% increases in revenue from 2020 when the pandemic shuttered gaming spots statewide.

Wind Creek reopened in June 2020 about two months after the state-ordered shutdown due to COVID-19 and it was also closed for three weeks during Christmas 2020 into early January last year because of a surge in coronavirus cases.

However the casino recorded a loss of $455736 in sports wagering. Wind Creek which received state approval in June 2020 to conduct sports betting made about $57000 that year. Sports wagering which is in its fourth year statewide continued to grow totaling 2021 revenue of $340 million the state said.

Sports wagering is handled by third-party operator Betfred Sports and a Betfred spokesperson said last month that it does not comment on individual state results. She also noted Pennsylvania has allowed multiple sports wagering licenses which has widened the competition in that market.

“The Sports Book at Wind Creek is one of the key amenities we make available to our casino guests” said Ken Rohman Wind Creek Hospitality’s chief marketing officer. “We feel it important that those visiting Wind Creek and any Lehigh Valley resident who wants to place a sports wager can do so at our casino rather than go elsewhere to place those bets.”

Rohman also said slots and table games will continue to be “where we focus our efforts.”

Formerly known as Sands Casino Resort Bethlehem Wind Creek Hospitality acquired the casino in 2019 from Las Vegas Sands Corp. for $1.3 billion. An affiliate of Alabama’s Poarch Band of Creek Indians Wind Creek which has 1439 employees is expanding the casino with a new hotel planned to open later this year.

Pre-pandemic the casino had roughly 2400 workers.

Statewide totals

Statewide casinos hit the jackpot. Revenue rebound continued after pandemic-related shutdowns sapped casinos in 2020. The more than $4.7 billion came from 16 operating casinos including three new mini-casinos in 2021 as well as fantasy sports operators and truck stops according to state data.

That beat the $3.9 billion recorded in fiscal year 2021 as well as the previous calendar year high of $3.4 billion two years ago.

Revenue in casinos from slot machines continued to slide dipping below $2.3 billion in 2021. But revenue from table games hit a new calendar-year high of $925 million. Online gambling in just its third year doubled its revenue from 2020 to pass $1.1 billion.

The casinos generated an estimated $1.93 billion in tax revenue for the state last year another record. That’s $838.2 million more than Pennsylvania received in 2020.

On Level 1 of the Sands Expo on Las Vegas’s Strip the booth for Pacific Tool & Gauge was a hive of activity. An employee guided a group of visitors through the process of boring a rifle chamber with the company’s automated reaming machine while others chatted about sales discounts and product-delivery details.

Across the aisle the lone representative of an Asian optics company sat on a folding chair in a 10×10-foot booth that was bare except for a pile of glossy product catalogs stacked on the floor. He noodled on his phone and never looked up. Next door was an empty booth for Rotchi a Chinese firearms-cleaning company that wasn’t able to make it to Las Vegas for this year’s SHOT (Shooting Hunting & Outdoor Trade) Show. Instead of staff or product the booth contained a cardboard cutout of Donald Trump flashing his trademark double thumbs-up.

Attendance by the Numbers

The week-long show ended yesterday in Las Vegas. Intended as the triumphant return of the largest gathering of shooting and hunting companies in the world after last year’s SHOT Show was canceled due to COVID-19 restrictions on public gatherings this year’s running could be described in any number of ways: a surprising success a tepid disappointment or proof of the resiliency of the event that has served as the crucible of the outdoors industry since 1979.

All those perspectives would be correct and most of the estimated 40000 attendees pointed to evidence in support of their conflicting conclusions.

Some saw in empty booths the failure of the show’s organizers to allay concerns about the pandemic. Others saw an opportunity to take market share from competitors who stayed away. And others saw the show as a bold and welcome return to normalcy.

The faces of show-goers this year mostly covered up with the masks required by the state of Nevada could also be read any number of ways. Some were anxious in their first foray into large public gatherings since lockdowns started two years ago. Others were excited to meet friends and return to travel and business dinners and cited the show’s relevance as not only a business booster but as a reason to get together—often face to unmasked face—after a year of social isolation.

Attendance was down this year confirmed Chris Dolnack senior vice president and chief customer officer for the National Shooting Sports Foundation which owns and operates SHOT Show. He says final registration was 43374 individuals representing 114 countries. That’s about 22 percent below 2020 attendance. Final attendance statistics are not yet available and it’s important to note that many who registered did not actually attend. The Sands Expo center which is often elbow-to-elbow crowded during SHOT Show was noticeably less busy than in past years.

A number of the most visible brands in the industry pulled out of the show in the weeks and even days before it opened on Tuesday. Sig Sauer one of the largest collections of shooting and hunting brands in the business withdrew their booth the largest in terms of square footage at the show. Same with Nosler Ruger and Vortex along with dozens of others. On the show floor the absence of those flagship brands was noticeable in the more open floors and lighter traffic this year. But plenty of attendees noted that they didn’t miss the crushing crowds and long waits at restaurants and bars.

Dolnack describes SHOT as “the gathering of the tribes” and says that by most metrics this year’s show was a success. “Even being down 22 percent in terms of attendance we had the most paid exhibitors and the most square footage” of not only previous SHOT Shows but also of any trade show in Las Vegas. This year’s show boasted 800000 square feet of exhibit space largely because of expansion into Caesar’s Forum next door to Sands.

“We finally were able to expand into that space that we’ve been chasing for 10 years” says Dolnack. “We’re actually pulling off a live show in a pandemic which I would call a rousing success. But some people want to make the show all about the 100 folks who aren’t here rather than the 2400 exhibitors that are here.”

Participation Headwinds

There have been plenty of reasons to stay away and as the show approached they seemed to grow in number and magnitude. First was the legitimate fear of getting sick. The omicron variant of COVID-19 was peaking just as attendees started arriving in Vegas. Some were just ending quarantines after contracting COVID-19 at one of the season’s first trade shows the Archery Trade Association show in Louisville the first week of the month and the Dallas Safari Club show immediately afterward.

“We had one company pull out because they had two employees die after contracting COVID-19” says Dolnack. “The fear is real.”

The state’s mask mandate kept others away from Vegas though Dolnack says perspectives on masking are as polarized as any issue in America. Based on pre-show surveys “we knew that somewhere around 35 percent of attendees said they wouldn’t come if masks were required” says Dolnack. “Conversely we found that 31 percent of attendees wouldn’t come if masks were not required. So what do you do?”

For some vendors and attendees the cost of attendance—not only renting booth space from the NSSF and building and shipping their booths but also costs to travel to and remain in Vegas for a week—was a deterrent.

Others say SHOT is just a distraction from keeping the throttle down in the hottest gun and sporting goods economy that any have experienced. They don’t need SHOT to drum up business; they have all they customers they can serve and are struggling to get inventory because of supply-chain bottlenecks.

“A monkey can sell guns right now” says Scott Grange who recently retired from 40 years of managing marketing and media relations for Browning and Winchester both of which did attend the show. “Now anybody who has been in this business as long as I have knows that won’t always be the case but right now companies are working as hard as they can just to meet demand.”

But the outdoor industry is changing and some of the decline in participation at SHOT can be attributed to some brands’ belief that the show doesn’t represent them as much as it once did. Many companies that specialize in traditional hunting—as opposed to those that focus on tactical or paramilitary gear—no longer exhibit at SHOT. They’ve found that “civilian warriors” not only don’t buy their gear but also represent an entirely different relationship with guns and the outdoors.

Doing Business Face to Face

If there are myriad reasons to reconsider SHOT there are just as many that makes the show the foundation of the industry and many said just being in Vegas was rejuvenating.

“I don’t honestly mind the slightly slower pace” says James Lawson vice president of Idea Ranch an agency that represents a number of brands exhibiting at SHOT. “After more than a year of doing business over Zoom calls there was a palpable hunger for human connection. I saw it and felt it but I also think it came through in meetings this week. They were much more conversations and [they] felt much less transactional than in the past.”

Dolnack says one of the most widely cited value propositions of SHOT is the networking. During last year’s lock-downs the NSSF experimented with delivering the show virtually using video feeds and collaboration software to connect exhibitors with attendees. Based on feedback surveys fewer than half of respondents said they’d repeat the experience even though the virtual show was free.

“People ask why SHOT Show matters” says Dolnack. “They say we can do everything we need to virtually. But when you’re here you’re talking to people you’re learning from other people’s experience you’re engaging. We have a very tactile audience. People want to try the zippers and feel the stitching in a pack. They want to handle a gun to see the fit and balance for themselves. Hold an optic and determine eye relief for themselves. … Look this is like the old trappers rendezvous. You have all the trappers coming in from all directions on the compass and all the hucksters and hangers-on and all the trade that happens around it. You can’t deliver that on Zoom.”

The other reason to have the SHOT Show is because the NSSF—which is the firearms industry’s most powerful and stable organization as the NRA struggles with corruption and litigation—needs it to survive. Dolnack says that SHOT Show revenue is “a huge part” of the NSSF’s budget (he declined to give specific percentages but noted that the NSSF had to lay off 20 percent of its employees following last year’s cancellation) and that it funds much of the work that keeps the shooting and outdoor industry in business.

The centerpiece of any SHOT Show is the State of the Industry dinner in which NSSF members typically dressed in evening-wear hear about the work they’ve funded in the past year. That dinner hasn’t been held the last three years largely because main-line entertainers are reluctant to perform for the firearms industry says Dolnack.

“Out of the big five talent agencies only one would agree to work with us and some artists and their management didn’t want to work with us because we’re in the firearms industry.”

Despite that the NSSF’s elevator pitch remains the same and has even sharpened during this boom time. The NSSF estimates 18.5 million gun sales last year in the U.S. which is the all-time second highest sales year behind 2020’s 21 million sales. Plus the industry is working to serve more than 11 million Americans who bought their first gun in the past two years.

“We help keep you in business and we help you grow your business” says Dolnack. “That’s been easy since the pandemic and [2020] election but people forget that it’s not just about fear and uneasiness with the future. It’s also because we worked to get the gun industry declared essential during the pandemic. It’s because we’ve worked hard on banking reform so that lenders can’t discriminate against gun companies. We’ve been fighting for shooters and hunters at the state level. And it’s because we’ve been diligent about attracting new customers with our [hunting and shooting] recruitment programs. That’s all funded by revenue from the SHOT Show.”

Every firearms and ammunition industry insider we spoke to predicts an imminent slowdown for gun and ammo purchasing. Many expect to see sales plateau but not necessarily drop off in the second half of this year.

“Retailers are still selling every box of ammo we can get them” says one ammunition company executive. “But it’s taking them a little longer. Maybe before they’d sell a pallet of ammo in hours now it’s taking them days. You don’t see lines outside the gun stores anymore.”

For shooters and hunters this is likely a good thing. It could mean that by the end of the year they’ll be able to find their favorite ammunition on store shelves again maybe even at lower prices. But it could spell trouble for less stable brands. During the panic buying boom any load or firearm sold quickly regardless of its quality or how well it was marketed. That makes for incredible revenue gains but it’s an unhealthy long-term position for an industry that’s serving a market which will soon be flooded with product.

“When you start to see rebate deals you know people are trying to clear inventory and you know it’s over the bubble has burst” says one advertising agency executive.

And when the bubble does burst companies that failed to innovate or recruit loyal customers will struggle. During hard business times the industry needs a strong NSSF many insiders say.

“We don’t need to be at SHOT this year we’re back ordered for months” one firearms company marketing director told us at the show. “But we’re here to support the NSSF.”

The View from Level 1

Back in the basement of Sands Expo Level 1 where the Pacific Tool & Gauge was doing brisk business the ceiling seems lower than it is and the dim light makes even pimped-out riflestocks look flat.

This is the cheapest square footage at SHOT and it’s where many brands and manufacturers get their start. A 10×10 booth costs about $4000 and if the space doesn’t have the flashy graphics and corporate feel of the flagship brands upstairs Level 1 feels somehow more alive. It’s a cross between a Middle Eastern arms bazaar and a farmers market. First-time exhibitors chat up their product with infectious enthusiasm. You’re likely to see dogs in vendors’ booths. The mix of companies highlights the rich variety of the industry: finely tooled leather holsters share booth walls with Asian companies that make the diodes that power laser rangefinders and pistol sights. Across the aisle might be a financial advisor who specializes in firearms collectors and next to them a new type of exploding clay target.

Level 1 is where according to SHOT Show lore and company history Bill Jordan introduced his new camouflage brand Realtree in the late ‘80s. He was so delinquent on his booth payment that he ducked show staff looking to collect. But later in the show Jordan signed a huge deal with Walmart and paid the final installment of his booth rent with a personal check achieving escape velocity to join the big brands upstairs in subsequent years. Realtree did not have its usual presence at the show this year.

In one busy aisle Josselyn Obregon called out to every passer-by like a midway barker at a state fair.

“Wanna see the best product at SHOT?” hailed Obregon who is the “manageress” of SPD Magazines of Kerrville Texas. Then she demonstrated for visitors the line of aftermarket pistol carbine and AR magazines made by the company. They feature a crank on the toe of the magazines. Turn it one way and the follower spring relaxes allowing shooters to simply drop in ammunition without fighting the spring tension. Release the crank and the follower snaps taut allowing for normal feeding. It’s a simple product but it solves a problem that most shooters have encountered at one time or another: the laceration or chafing of your thumb as you load magazines with heavy spring tension.

Will SPD Magazines be back next year? Definitely says Obregon. Maybe in a larger booth. And she should get the chance. The SHOT Show is contracted in Las Vegas through 2028. And as attendees filed out of the venues yesterday they were greeted by signs reminding them to book next year’s hotel rooms now “in order to ensure availability.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiV2h0dHBzOi8vbnlwb3N0LmNvbS8yMDIyLzAxLzIzL2hlcmVzLXdob3MtZG9uYXRlZC10by1nb3YtaG9jaHVscy0yMS05LW1pbGxpb24td2FyLWNoZXN0L9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Here's who's donated to Gov. Hochul's $21.9 million war chest,"ALBANY – Gov. Kathy Hochul raked in big campaign bucks over the last six months — to the tune of $21.9 million — from a well of donors who also used to give generously to disgraced ex-Gov. Andrew Cuomo.

Hochul amassed her hefty war chest between Aug. 13 and Jan. 14 according to records posted online by the state Board of Elections.

Her list of donors includes the usual cast of real-state and business bigwigs many of whom have donated to Cuomo in the past.

Steve Ross of Related Companies – who also owns the Miami Dolphins — gave Hochul the maximum contribution amount of $69700.

Ross has given Cuomo $90000 total since 2002 – $25000 of that in June 2021 – according to a 2019 analysis of the ex-gov’s billionaire donors published by the non profit research group Public Accountability Initiative and Hedge Clippers.

Also on the hook for the maximum donation are Larry Silverstein the real estate developer who rebuilt the World Trade Center complex and ex-Google executive Eric Schmidt who was tapped by Cuomo to help “reimagine” New York’s telehealth and broadband access during the pandemic.

Silverstein contributed $19700 to Cuomo in 2021 according to BOE filings and his wife Klara Silverstein pitched in another $5300. Eric Schmidt donated $69700.00 to Cuomo in 2020.

Steve Roth and Arnold Gumowitz the two real estate moguls who famously feuded over Cuomo’s “Penn15” plan to build 10 skyscrapers around Penn Station each donated $69700 records show.

The PAI/Hedge Clippers report found that Roth of Vornado Realty Trust has contributed $384000 total to Cuomo since 2002.

Also in Hochul’s $69700 club: Billionaire hedge fund manager James Simons and his wife Marilyn Simons; Long Island Developers William Haugland and his son William Haugland Jr. of Haugland Group LLC former Cuomo donors who have scored MTA contracts in the past; and Alexandra Cohen the wife of Mets owner Steven Cohen.

Cohen himself contributed $67100 as well as one non-monetary in-kind donation of $1935.79 the filings show.

Meanwhile when it came to the sports world New York Yankees owner Hal Steinbrenner gave Hochul $25000 and the New York Yankees Partnership contributed $25000.

New York Giants co-owner Jonathan Tisch donated $50000 and other members of the Tisch family have given hundreds of thousands of dollars to Hochul.

Even the MSG PAC pitched in $5000.

The NY Hotel Trades Council Committee – the first major union to back Hochul’s campaign for a full term – was also eager to donate. It gave beyond the max limit and had to be refunded $4000.

The NYS Hospitality and Tourism Association contributed $10000.

Hochul previously announced a $450 million recovery package to help revive the hard-hit tourism industry.

Some groups could also see big wins for their industry in Hochul’s 2022-2023 state budget released on Tuesday.

New York is projected to take in $1.25 billion in new revenue from legal marijuana sales over the next six years. Legal sales could begin as early as fiscal year 2023 according to budget documents with $363 million in projected revenues come fiscal year 2028.

Those who could benefit in these areas include the cannabis group Ascend — which is in a legal battle to acquire a medical marijuana license in New York. Ascend gave Hochul $15000.

Film producer Jana Edelbaum chipped in three donations totaling $28400. Her husband Michael Abbott is the co-founder and chairman of the cannabis firm Columbia Care which is licensed to provide medicinal marijuana to New York patients.

Edelbaum held a fundraiser for pro-pot donors at the couple’s Manhattan apartment on Oct. 12.

Hochul’s budget plan also permits the state Gaming Facility Location Board to issue a Request for Applications to open three new commercial casinos downstate in addition to the four already operating upstate.

The gov raked in contributions from Genting the company that runs Resorts World Casino NYC which contributed $47100 through its GAI PAC. She also got boosts from upstate casino owner and Meadowlands Racetrack owner Jeff Gural who donated $35000 total; Las Vegas Sands Corp which gave $5000; and gaming entities Hard Rock Cafe International (USA) Inc. Hard Rock Cafe Licensing Operating and Seminole Hard Rock Entertainment which each gave $5000 during this cycle.

Representatives from charter schools – whose students would get a funding bump as part of Hochul’s plan – also donated. John Paulson a hedge fund owner who funds Success Academy gave $50000; ex-Success Academy Chairman Dan Loeb donated $30000 and pro-charter business man Roger Hertog contributed $25000.

Meanwhile Cuomo — who is rumored to be mulling a comeback run — has $16.4 million in his campaign account Andrew Cuomo for New York Inc.

Although the ex-pol did rake in some donations legal bills cut into his $18.2 million war chest posted to his account as of the last filing in July.

He made four payments totaling $899167.27 to his personal attorney Rita Glavin’s law firm Glavin PLLC between August and November.

Another $800000 was sent out to Manhattan white shoe law firm Sullivan & Cromwell which also represented him in relation to state Attorney General Letitia James’ sexual harassment investigation.

Only three weeks ago Berhalter said this:

“James has done a great job for us and played in some really big games. I think about his performances in the Gold Cup and the World Cup qualifiers and I think it is going to be a great opportunity for him to continue to grow at Rangers.”

So why he has now left the midfielder out of crucial world cup qualifiers we’re not sure. And no before anyone asks he’s not doing Rangers a favour – a national coach’s focus is his team not a club so this is tactical.

So we’re left wondering why this international player that the USA boss rates so highly is suddenly not good enough for his squad.

In reluctant defence of him Sands has only actually played a single world cup qualifier up till now and otherwise was on the bench for three or not called up at all.

So we’d admit he’s far from a USA first choice.

But the way his coach extoled his virtues we’d have assumed he had a bigger role for him in mind with the NT going forward.

Apparently not."

Carly 33 on Friday January 28 has achieved international stardom through a combination of talent faith serendipity and sheer hard graft. “I always loved singing” she tells me. “I sang from three years old; you couldn’t shut me up. When I was eight I went to Stagecoach in Southwell and after a few weeks the teacher Liz Hetherington an opera singer took mum into a corner and told her my voice was special. “She said my voice was bigger than my body. Liz took me under her wing. She was always there for me like a second mum and now she’s my musical director.” Liz gave Carly singing lessons from the age of nine but there were teething problems. “I had a classical voice that was obvious from the start but I’d been inspired by musicals Doris Day and Judy Garland and it took her forever to stamp out the American accent I’d copied from them.” Paul and Tina Hopkinson a former Thomas Cook travel agent sacrificed much to give their talented daughter the breaks she needed. Now retired they live with her on her farm in Wiltshire. Paul who’d built a haulage company chauffeurs her to concerts Tina “looks after the logistics”. Young Carly won scholarships to study music and the performing arts. At 16 she boarded at Tring Park School for the Performing Arts in Hertfordshire. “I did my A-level studies in the morning then performing arts until 10pm so it gave me my work ethic. I came home every weekend doing dance acting and musical theatre classes.” At 18 she started a four-year course at Manchester’s Royal Northern College Of Music working in M&S to pay for her accommodation.

Paoli was her mother’s maiden name. “Mum looks like a southern Italian but she doesn’t speak Italian and she certainly doesn’t cook like an Italian!” Carly laughs. “She grew up in Bolsover but her dad was Italian. He came over to work on the MI fell in love with my grandmother and never left. “He was a lovely singer and his brother had a voice similar to Maria Lanza. He was known as ‘the singing chef’ because he sang arias while he was cooking. “We spent our summers in Puglia in the heel of the boot of Italy. We bought an apartment there near my aunts and cousins. One played the accordion and we’d sing together. Uncle Luigi was a folk singer who wrote his own songs about Puglia that were quite cheeky. He played accordion and eventually had his own TV show in the south of Italy. They’re an interesting bunch the Paolis their parties were always good! “From 16 onwards I’d go to Puglia every summer and perform in the piazzas and churches and celebrate their culture and classical music.”

After graduating 23-year-old Carly worked as a singing teacher supplementing her wages by performing at corporate events. Luxury Swiss watch company Bedat & Co were so impressed they hired her as their brand ambassador. Then multiple Grammy Award-winning producer David Foster asked her to perform at his charity gala in Calgary Canada. “I was thrust onto the stage with Aerosmith’s Steven Tyler and Jennifer Hudson” Carly recalls. “I was 24 and my heart was in my mouth. I said a prayer and never looked back.” For bi-lingual Paoli however all roads led to Rome. She was 26 when she sang a duet from Mozart’s Cosi fan tutte with Pavarotti’s favourite female soprano Cynthia Lawrence at a star-studded UNICEF fundraiser in the ruins of the Caracalla baths near the Colosseum. Carreras Bocelli and flautist Andrea Griminelli were also on the breath-taking bill. Carly’s modern version of Ave Maria with poignant new lyrics by Romano Musumarra and Grant Black wowed the Vatican so much they asked her to perform at the Pope’s Jubilee concert at the Roman forum – an open-air museum transformed into an auditorium for the night. Pope Francis chose it as the theme song for his 2016 Jubilee Year Of Mercy.

Christianity is one cornerstone of Carly’s career. “My mum was in the Salvation Army so I was brought up with faith. It’s important to me. I like to think my voice is a gift from God and you do your bit to make the world a better place.” She is about to embark on a cathedral tour with “lovely” Aled Jones. “I’m looking forward to live audiences again” she says. “We have beautiful songs lined up and what settings to perform in!” Jones guested on her 2021 album Carly Paoli & Friends along with Calleja Elaine Paige Paul Carrack Ramin Karimloo and US Christian gospel singer David Phelps. Her recent career highlights include performing at Windsor Park at Northern Ireland’s 2022 world cup qualifier against Italy and last year’s Queen celebration It’s A Kind Of Magic in Floriana Malta with the BBC concert orchestra. Carly sang Barcelona and Tony Vincent reprised his We Will Rock You role as Freddie Mercury. “I was so excited” she says. “I’d admired Tony since I was 13. I saw that show 17 times! I’d be at the stage door for autographs so to be singing with him was a special thrill but I was determined to be cool. “Then when I met him my mum told him ‘Oh our Carly she used to love you. She was like your stalker’. Mum! I didn’t get to stay cool for long…”

Carly still has family in Mansfield ‑ her builder brother Dean with her niece and nephew and paternal grandmother Betty. Her late maternal grandmother who had a market stall bought Carly a dress when she was 14 “a beautiful olive green and gold wedding dress I wore it on stage at Terme di Caracalla in Rome in 2018 and I still wear it now. It still fits!” Marriage isn’t on her agenda though. “There’s no man in my life” she says. “I’m too busy I’m all focused on my career.” Paoli describes herself as “an old soul” with an enduring love of opera and the golden age of Hollywood musicals. Apple TV’s Schmigadoon! and Ted Lasso are current viewing favourites. She relaxes by walking dancing and working out at the gym. “We live in the countryside not far from Stonehenge so there are lovely places all around.” She has no intention of “doing a Clarkson” though ‑ “we rent out our field to real farmers” she says.

Country music legend Dolly Parton celebrated her 76th birthday this week. The ‘Jolene’ singer shared a picture of herself all dolled up to her 4.7 million Instagram followers. Despite selling more than 100 million records worldwide composing some 3000 songs and winning countless awards Dolly is showing no signs of slowing down.

Her new album ‘Run Rose Run’ will be released on March 4 and her debut novel of the same name comes out three days later. While her career has taken her places she could never have imagined one thing has remained the same throughout — her beloved husband Carl Dean. The pair first met outside their local laundrette in 1964 when Dolly was 18 and Carl was 21. Within two years they were married. Carl has largely remained out of the spotlight since then running his own asphalt business while her stardom skyrocketed.

She added: “He would shoot me too. At the end of the day we love each other madly.” Dolly’s career would have been a very different story without two of her biggest hits. She revealed in a 2018 interview that she wrote ‘Jolene’ and ‘I Will Always Love You’ on the same day. Yet without the flirty personalities both she and her husband have Jolene might never have come to fruition.

On January 20 1988 The Beatles were finally inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. At that point the band had split up 18 years prior in 1970 following the release of their 12th and final album Let It Be. Eight years earlier On December 8 1980 John Lennon was tragically murdered in New York City outside his home leaving the Fab Four permanently down one member. The band's induction into the Hall of Fame was long overdue - but there was a problem. Paul McCartney refused to attend the event which was hosted by Rolling Stones singer Mick Jagger.

Jagger touched upon the band's humble beginnings while also thanking them for writing their first smash hit I Wanna Be Your Man. He then said: ""We had a lot of rivalry in those early years and a little bit of friction but we always ended up friends. I like to think we still are ’cause they were some of the greatest times of our lives and I’m really proud to be the one that leads them into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame."" Two of the remaining members of the Fab Four then arrived on stage as well as some family. Ringo Starr and George Harrison were joined by Lennon's widow Yoko Ono and his two sons Julian Lennon and Sean Ono Lennon. And Harrison was quit to make a comment about Macca's absence. He said: ""I don’t have to say much because I’m the Quiet Beatle. It’s unfortunate Paul’s not here because he’s the one who had the speech in his pocket."" But he wasn't there to take pot-shots at his former bandmate.

McCartney once claimed: ""I said: 'Let me see what I can do.' And I talked to Bruce Springsteen and I talked to Dave Grohl and they both said [Starr] should be in. And I said I'd do the induction.

The music mogul managed to catapult the King of Rock and Roll's career to its next level after taking over as his boss in 1955 but he was very strict about certain things. In a 1987 interview he defended his decisions while adding that the star ""would not let"" anyone boss him around.

Parker was interviewed by ABC News in 1987 to commemorate the ten year anniversary of Elvis. During the chat he was quizzed over not letting the star appear on some talk shows such as The Tonight Show with Johnny Carson. Parker explained: ""I kept him back but I didn't do it deliberately. I found out some of my friends - they had artists - they put them on all the shows talk shows for free and [the artists] had a hard time getting a job after that."" Parker added that he thought these shows were ""bad promotion"".

Parker was born in the Netherlands and entered the USA illegally. Because of this it has been suggested the boss was scared of leaving the country in fear he would not be granted a US passport thus locking him out of the country. This key detail is reportedly what prevented Parker from allowing Elvis to perform and tour in other countries potentially boosting his popularity even further.

The Electra hybrid-electric eSTOL aircraft is designed to be able to take off and land from spaces as small as 300 x 100 feet using a patent-pending “distributed electric propulsion and blown lift technology” that’s not totally unlike the blown diffusers used in the V8-era Formula 1 cars – only you know upside-down.

When it was in use in the race cars it directed fast-moving exhaust air into a sculpted “diffuser” at the rear of the car. The speed and pressure difference between the air above the car and the air below the car in the diffuser effectively “sucked” the car down to the road allowing for massive cornering grip far beyond anything civilians are likely to have ever experienced. The Electra turns that idea on its head using the same principles in reverse to quickly generate a buttload of lift in a matter of seconds.

Electra claims its blown wing technology can help the aircraft deliver more than twice the payload and “an order of magnitude longer ranges” (their words) with substantially lower operating costs than the fully vertical take-off eVTOLs that have been making headlines of late – and with a much lower certification risk.

Crucially the Electra concept’s claimed performance figures aren’t based on any “future” technology. The company claims it’s ready to deliver on its speed and range targets today. A claim that seems to have helped drive Lockheed Martin’s decision to invest. “Electra’s technical approach to sustainable aviation is differentiated and we are excited to see this concept mature” explains Chris Moran Vice President and General Manager of LMV. “We invested in Electra because of its focus on hybrid-electric technology. Hybrid-electric aircraft have the potential to deliver operational and environmental advantages over other aircraft including increased payload and range without gambling on battery improvements.

What makes it a hybrid

The Lockheed-backed Electra eSTOL concept’s propellers are driven by high-efficiency electric motors that draw electricity from on-board batteries. The batteries can be charged with a plug while the plane is grounded and where such infrastructure is available. Where it’s not an on-board gas turbine generator can be spun up to a high rpm – where thermal efficiencies are greatest – and charge the batteries up Chevy Volt-style to take flight again.

When needed the generator can also recharge the Electra’s batteries during flight significantly increasing the aircraft’s range.

The first Electra eSTOL proof-of-concept prototype is expected to be completed later this year and will be designed to transport up to 1800 pounds of cargo or up to nine passengers on trips of up to 500 nautical miles. With its minimal need for infrastructure the eSTOL aircraft could be used on the roof of existing parking garages and shopping centers as well as remote landing strips and even urban highways making everything from “on-demand intracity flights to medical missions cargo transportation and scheduled passenger service” possible.

The global urban and regional advanced air mobility market that Electra hopes to serve with its eSTOL aircraft is forecast by analysts to be valued between $250 billion and $1 trillion by 2040.

Electrek’s Take

The recent wave of eVTOL aircraft promise a flying car future that takes the shape of people flying around in big autonomous drones. As cool and futuristic as that all seems it also seems pretty sketchy at times.

The Electra eSTOL concept? That seems to be much closer to reality and seems like it could be just as easily put into place with the right partners. If I was putting down my own money? I’d wager that Lockheed Martin knows the space better than anyone and follow in their footsteps.

Its use was first reported by Defense News over the weekend. UAE Ambassador to the US Yousef al-Otaiba had earlier said there were interceptions during the attack on the Emirates but he did not mention the type of system used.

THAAD’s first operational military use

“A multibillion-dollar missile-defense system owned by the United Arab Emirates and developed by the US military intercepted a ballistic missile on Monday during a deadly attack by Houthi militants in Abu Dhabi marking the system’s first known use in a military operation” Defense News reported.

“It brought down a ballistic missile during its first recorded successful operational use in the hands of the United Arab Emirates” The Drive news site reported. “The ballistic missile that was targeted was fired by Houthi militants during last Monday’s attack on ‘sensitive Emirati sites and facilities.’” The remains of the wreckage of a drone that was shot down are seen at Ain al-Asad air base in Anbar province Iraq January 4 2022. (credit: IRAQI MEDIA SECURITY CELL/HANDOUT VIA REUTERS)

The system was used to stop a threat to oil facilities Defense News reported. The attack took place on January 17 and a key detail that was unknown at the time was why there were not more interceptions of the incoming drone and missile threats.

Speaking at an event at the Jewish Institute for National Security of America (JINSA) several days after the attacks Otaiba said they involved “a combination of cruise missiles ballistic missiles and drones targeted civilian sites in the UAE.” Several of the incoming threats were intercepted he said.

The details are based on anonymous sources but they have not been denied.

US Central Command confirmed that there was an inbound threat and that American service members at al-Dhafra base several kilometers from where the targeted oil facilities are located had to take shelter for 30 minutes Defense News reported.

“Airmen were directed to keep their protective gear close for 24 hours afterwards” Central Command spokesman Capt. Bill Urban was quoted as saying. “Everything was professional and disciplined. The ‘all clear’ was called at 9:27 p.m. local time. There was no mission impact.”

It is not clear if that event is linked directly to the attack on the UAE which apparently occurred the night before. Either way what is important is we now know that air-defense systems were used. That means some of the threats were detected.

The need for air defenses in the Middle East

All of this matters because air defense throughout the region is increasingly being tested by Iranian and Iranian-backed threats. Iran develops a plethora of ballistic missiles cruise missiles and drones and it continues to improve them. Along with their precision-guided munitions features they are a major threat – not only to the UAE and Saudi Arabia but also to Israel US forces and others.

Since 2019 these threats have radically increased.

Iran has flown drones into Israeli airspace twice once in 2018 and again in 2021. It has helped the Houthis target Saudi Arabia and even moved sophisticated drones into Yemen.

Tehran also attacked a ship in July 2021 killing two people. It also attacked Saudi Arabia’s Abqaiq in 2019 using drones and cruise missiles. It attacked US forces at al-Asad base in Iraq in January 2020 with ballistic missiles. The attack on the UAE was the latest complex attack and involved a variety of missiles and drones.

All this adds up. It also means that countries in the region such as Israel and the UAE need the right mix of radar and air defenses to stop these attacks.

There are a variety of systems made by Israel the US and other countries that can stop drone and missile threats. Israel’s Iron Dome is one such system. David’s Sling and Arrow both of which are made by Israeli defense companies and supported by the US in their development are also key defenses meant to stop various threats.

The Patriot system and THAAD as well as the lower-range C-RAM are American systems. Together these make up the variety of systems in the region that can defend against threats. European countries also make air-defense systems.

Taken together the story of the use of interceptors to stop some of the threats to the UAE is good news because it shows that some were detected and neutralized. However it is also problematic news because the Houthi threat was known and the escalation had been threatened for days before the attack.

That a US base and the UAE were still threatened and some projectiles got through means the region must learn the lesson from the attack.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmV1cmFzaWFudGltZXMuY29tL3doaWNoLW90aGVyLXdhcnBsYW5lcy1pcy10aGUtdXMtYWlyLWZvcmNlLWZpZ2h0ZXItamV0cy_SAVVodHRwczovL3d3dy5ldXJhc2lhbnRpbWVzLmNvbS93aGljaC1vdGhlci13YXJwbGFuZXMtaXMtdGhlLXVzLWFpci1mb3JjZS1maWdodGVyLWpldHMv?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,F-22 Raptors & F-35 Jets: Which Other Warplanes Is The US Air Force Banking On To Deflate Russian Chinese Air Power,"With threat perceptions at an all-time high the US Air Force is under pressure to improve its fleet and expedite the development of next-generation fighter jets. While several countries are still designing and developing fifth-gen warplanes the US is well ahead with its sixth-gen program.

The US has a long history of working with its allies to develop some of the world’s most advanced weaponry but it has always reaped the majority of the rewards in terms of military and economic might.

This trend appears to have somewhat faded in recent years with European and Asian allies seeking to build their own indigenous weaponry. Furthermore China and Russia are rapidly enhancing their capability to confront the United States in many areas including military and technical advancements.

Here are five fighters that the US Air force is expected to bank on in its possible confrontation with China and Russia.

The F-22 Raptor

A call for proposal for an advanced tactical fighter to meet increasing Soviet threats was made in 1985. The emphasized attributes were stealth and super-cruise speed and Lockheed and Northrop were the two companies nominated to participate in this competition.

The US Air Force had planned to purchase 750 F-22 stealth interceptors to build a formidable fleet for the 21st century. However soon after the USSR’s fall the US no longer saw the necessity for this aircraft and production ceased in 2011 with only 187 fighters delivered.

The F-22 is a quick and agile fighter jet. Its supercruise speed is roughly Mach 1.8 without externally deployed armaments and more than Mach 2 with afterburners.

The F-22 program’s primary issue was not the design flaws or emergent threats but a lack of funding. In 1985 the cost of 750 new F-22s was estimated to be around $44 billion. The estimated cost for 187 jets when manufacturing stopped in 2011 was roughly $67 billion.

After a deadly 2010 crash which was linked to the oxygen system the plane was grounded to investigate the reason and emergency backup oxygen systems were installed starting in 2012.

As The EurAsian Times recently reported Lockheed Martin has won a more than $10.8 billion US Air Force contract to provide for Advanced Raptor Enhancement and Sustainment for the F-22 Program Office.

This new contract covers the procurement of hardware kits as well as services such as updates additions and fixes besides performance-based logistics services to maintain and modernize the F-22 Raptor jet.

The Firepower & Tech Edge Of F-35 Lightning II

The F-35 was developed in the 1980s and 1990s in response to a desire to develop a Joint Strike Fighter (JSF) that would combine combat aircraft requirements into a single package. The Marine Corps desired a substitute for the Harrier jump jet while the Air Force and Navy wanted a multi-role attack/fighter to supersede the F-16 F-14 and A-6.

When all these specifications were integrated Lockheed and Boeing were picked to develop designs in 1997. The F-35 was developed in collaboration with allies as a joint strike fighter.

Apart from the US Britain Italy amongst others were among the nations that participated in the program. Lockheed was finally chosen to develop the JSF after an evaluation of concepts.

The Air Force model the F-35A was designed for normal takeoff and landing. The Marines’ F-35B had a short takeoff and vertical landing variant whereas the Navy’s F-35C was designed for carrier missions.

In 2012 both the A and B models were made available for operational training. Soon after the US Air Force and the US Marine Corps began training pilots and maintainers and the F-35 entered service.

The Lockheed Martin F-35 Lightning II includes a glass cockpit which means that instead of discrete analog equipment sensors and gauges are displayed on computer screens. The pilot’s helmet makes contact with the aircraft’s avionics suite to offer heads-up display data.

The helmet’s built-in sensors allow it to “see through” the aircraft providing pilots with helmet views that would otherwise only be viewable on cockpit screens.

However if improvements to Block IV are not implemented in a timely manner Washington worries that its F-35 fighter the world’s most expensive weapons system could fall behind.

The US Air Force intended to expedite the Block IV upgrades to its existing aircraft so that it could benefit from the much-needed enhancements. In addition many other countries like Spain and Greece are willing to buy this platform to strengthen their Air Force.

6th-Gen NGAD Programme

The US Air Force reportedly disclosed last year that it had designed manufactured and tested a secret prototype of a new fighter plane in just one year. The secretive fighter presumably a sixth-generation one is part of the Air Force’s Next Generation Air Dominance (NGAD) program which aims to boost and eventually replace the F-22 Raptor.

The graphic of NGAD can be seen on page 55 of the Air Force’s biennial acquisition report which was recently released.

The aircraft portrayed is a big diamond-shaped fighter jet with massive engine air intakes extending to the left and right of the cockpit protected from radar. The plane also has two engines a bubble canopy cockpit and two vertical stabilizers that can be folded flat into the wings when not in use.

The graphic also alluded to the possibility to update the aircraft’s weapon and motor systems. The V1 V2 and V3 versions of air-to-air missiles landing gear and engines are depicted alongside the fighter. The fusion of the body and wings would result in a massive internal volume that could be used to store fuel and weaponry in internal weapons bays.

The Powerful ‘Eagles’ And ‘Falcons’

The Boeing F-15 series of fighter jets is still one of the world’s most effective and powerful. The F-15A and B variants of the ‘Eagle’ fighter have been retired by the United States while the aged F-15C and D aircraft will be decommissioned soon.

The Air Force plans to maintain flying its significantly enhanced F-15E ‘Strike Eagle’ and F-15EX ‘Eagle II’ planes.

The Boeing F-15E dual-role fighter is a high-tech long-range tactical and interception fighter. It is the most recent iteration of the Eagle a twin-engine fighter capable of Mach 2.5.

When compared to the older F-15C Eagle and F-15E Strike Eagle models the F-15EX incorporates a range of updates including the Eagle Passive/Active Warning and Survivability System electronic warfare system a digital cockpit Honeywell’s more advanced ADCP-II mission computer and fly-by-wire flight controls.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWWh0dHBzOi8vbmF0aW9uYWxpbnRlcmVzdC5vcmcvYmxvZy9yZWJvb3QvZi0yMi1yYXB0b3ItZmlnaHRlci1waWxvdCVFMiU4MCU5OXMtZHJlYW0tMTk5NjU50gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,The F-22 Raptor Is a Fighter Pilot's Dream,"It also makes for one fun aircraft to watch in videos—thanks to the hotshots like the pilots in the F-22 Raptor Demonstration Team.

Here's What You Need to Remember: The Raptor was engineered with a unique weapons ability a dynamic which has in recent years been massively upgraded. The Air Force Raytheon and Lockheed have integrated performance-enhancing software upgrades into the F-22s weapons to include the construction of newer AIM-120D and AIM-9X air-to-air weapon variants.

Video footage of the F-22 in action aren't hard to come by on social media platforms but this 2:36 video—titled “INSANE F-22 Raptor Hype Video”— is unique in that it was produced by the actual F-22 Raptor Demonstration Team which is stationed at Joint Base Langley-Eustis in Hampton Virginia and regularly engages in flights that showcase the unique capabilities of the aircraft. It offered Hollywood-worthy production values that highlighted the aircraft's ability to perform a variety of maneuvers; but also included rare slow-motion footage of the Lockheed Martin-built fifth-generation fighter.

The 360-degree video footage was reportedly the first to be filmed from a helicopter and it showcased the F-22 Raptor's supermaneuverability as it flew over Joint Base Elmendorf-Richardson in March of this year as part of a JBER Salutes.

The Hype Video has also been about the best chance and perhaps only way to see the F-22 in action this year due to the coronavirus outbreak.

As The Aviationist reported “Although most of the airshows this year were canceled because of the COVID-19 outbreak the pandemic has not completely prevented the F-22 Raptor Demo team to perform some displays at the few airshows which have been held in a ‘drive in’ format with cars filled with people in attendance like the New York International ‘Drive In’ Air Show at the end of August or the 2020 Wings Over Houston Air Show and Bell Fort Worth Alliance Air Show last month.”

High Fliers

The F-22 Raptor Demonstration Team flies the advanced stealth aircraft at air shows around the globe and its demonstrations include the crowd-pleasing power loop split and tailslide as well as high-speed passes and dedication passes—maneuvers that are based on those designed for combat operations but are performed at much lower altitudes that most pilots are certified to fly.

The aerobatic display team has flown the F-22 since 2007 when the Air Force approved the aircraft for demonstration and this replaced the Air Combat Command's F-15C demonstration team. The team participated in its debut air show at Tyndall Air Force Base (AFB) in March 2007 and since that time has performed in more than 250 demonstrations across the world.

The U.S. Air Force F-22 is widely regarded as the most dominant fighter in the world. The F-22 Raptor is especially respected for its dogfighting ability and air-to-air maneuverability attributes which many contend separately it into a superior category compared with any other potential rival.

Despite the fact that it entered service in 2005 it has steadily been updated. The Raptor was engineered with a unique weapons ability a dynamic which has in recent years been massively upgraded. The Air Force Raytheon and Lockheed have integrated performance-enhancing software upgrades into the F-22s weapons to include the construction of newer AIM-120D and AIM-9X air-to-air weapon variants.

It also makes for one fun aircraft to watch in videos—thanks to the hotshots like the pilots in the F-22 Raptor Demonstration Team.

LOW,Lowe's,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMidGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNqLXIuY29tL3N0b3J5L25ld3MvbG9jYWwvMjAyMi8wMS8yMi9pbGxpbm9pcy13b21hbi10b2xkLWdvLWJhY2steW91ci1jb3VudHJ5LWxvd2VzLXNoZS1zYXlzLzY2MTUzOTUwMDEv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Illinois Realtor says she was told to 'go back to your country' at Springfield hardware store,"While many honored the legacy of the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. and called for racial healing on Monday one Springfield woman said she endured a shopping experience that puts a spotlight on anti-Asian racism.

Xuna Hu a 31-year-old realtor and Chinese immigrant said as she was shopping at Lowe's on Wabash Avenue and picked up two fire pits with the intent to buy them. Realizing they were too heavy she put them down and stood by while calling her father to help her load them in a cart but while waiting said she was harassed.

“A lady came over with her daughter a Lowe's employee while pointing to the fire pits and said to me ‘Hey I want one of those’"" Hu recounted. “I said 'Ma’am I'm taking both I'm just waiting for my dad to come over so he can help me load my cart and pay for it.' She then said ‘Well have you already paid?’ I said ‘No not yet’ so she said ‘Well I'm taking one from you.'""

At that point Hu said she decided to offer the woman one of the fire pits.

“I was like all right I’ll just give you one then"" Hu said but the woman responded that since Hu hadn't paid for the fire pits she could take one because ""this is how it works here.""

After more words Hu said the woman who was not identified yelled ""'go back to your country.'""

Hu said she took out her cellphone and began recording after the exchange. In the video posted to Tik Tok and Facebook that has since gone viral Hu confronts the woman at a register and asks for an apology for which the woman declined.

An unidentified Lowe's employee became involved when he saw that Hu was recording and asked her to delete the video. Hu refused.

“In this situation if I say something with my mouth it’s not gonna be stronger evidence than having a video. No matter how much I say they don’t have to believe me but if I have proof through the video they can’t deny it at all” Hu said.

As the conversation between Hu and the Lowe's worker continued the woman who shouted at Hu left the store. Hu said the worker then demanded she move on and not make the situation bigger than necessary

“They said ‘Hey she left there’s no point in talking to us about it anymore just pay your money and leave'"" Hu said. During that moment she said she felt helpless.

“I thought the staff came toward me to help me with the situation but ... I didn’t get any help. It was pretty sad.”

According to Hu State Rep Theresa Mah D-Chicago saw the viral video and started a petition on Change.org that urged Lowe's to issue an apology to Hu and require racial sensitivity training for employees. As of Saturday Mah’s petition had over 8000 signatures.

In a statement two days after the incident Lowe’s spokesperson Steve Salazar said the company was ""appalled to hear about this experience. At Lowe’s discrimination of any kind is unacceptable. We spoke to Ms. Hu and apologized letting her know we are taking swift action to address the matter. Our intent is to always ensure customers feel valued respected and welcome. We are committed to creating a safe and open environment for all customers.”

The Springfield Immigrant Advocacy Network also helped to circulate the petition.

“We were saddened to hear that this had happened because we know how damaging racism and xenophobia is and we know how these incidents impact whole communities” a network statement said. “Unfortunately we were not surprised. Incidents of hate and particularly anti-Asian hate have been on the rise across the country and we have seen other anti-immigrant sentiments here already.”

Veronica Espina the network's founder said it was Hu's right to record the situation. Instead of putting the victim of the attack on trial employees should have stood up for her.

“It has become necessary for persons of color and the targets of this kind of treatment to have a record of what happens to them to protect themselves. The reality is that without some record reports of their experiences are often discounted or ignored and It results in further marginalization and victimization.”

Hu said before the incident she had never experienced racism so bluntly.

“When she said that to me I thought ‘Oh my God the things I see on the news are actually happening to me right now. What do I do?’ I thought ‘I can’t just let this go because if I keep my mouth shut that means I’m giving her permission to say that to me and if she said it to me she will say it to my kids and anyone else who looks like me.'”

Hu said her family and friends were not surprised by what happened and told her they frequently experienced similar treatment but often couldn't respond because of the language barrier.

""That made me really sad to hear because due to the language barrier we have to deal with racism this way. So when this happened to me I was standing up not only for myself but for the people who can’t fight back because they don’t know how” she said.

Espina said Hu’s video brought attention to a problem faced by communities of color and should serve as a teaching moment.

“All of us in the community have a role in opposing and preventing these kinds of incidents"" Espina said ""and videos like this are instructive to understand the kind of treatment she and others have too often received and the responses they get when they try to stand up for themselves.”

Espina said the incident highlights the necessity of SIAN.

“Springfield unfortunately was identified a few years ago as one of the most segregated cities in America. Incidents like this serve as important reminders for why SIAN and many others worked to pass a Welcoming City resolution for the city of Springfield - a resolution that simply states that immigrants are both welcome and already an important part of our community” she said. “This would be an important time for the Springfield City Council to pass the resolution and send a message of goodwill.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiT2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5ld3lvcmtlci5jb20vY3VsdHVyZS9jdWx0dXJlLWRlc2svbG9zaW5nLWEtZmF0aGVyLXRvLXRoZS1tb3VudGFpbnPSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,“Torn” Review: Losing a Father to the Mountains,"“This isn’t going to be very fun Max.” A filmmaker named Michael Brown says this to Max Lowe about a third of the way through Lowe’s new documentary film “Torn” an autobiographical exploration of his family’s experience with tragedy and its aftermath. By “this” Brown means the experience they are about to have watching footage from the day in 1999 that Max’s father Alex Lowe perhaps the greatest American mountaineer of his generation died in an avalanche during an expedition in Tibet. Brown and Lowe have just dug a stack of videotapes out of a box and popped a promising one into a VCR.

We then see what Max is seeing for the first time in his life: the climbers at base camp waking up to fresh snow brewing espresso on a gas-jet stove setting out on an exploratory ramble to a moraine. An avalanche engulfs them. Two men Alex Lowe and a cameraman named David Bridges are buried. One man Lowe’s best friend and tentmate Conrad Anker survives. We see more footage of the aftermath—Anker back at base camp near-catatonic as his wounds are dressed and the finality sinks in; a futile search amid the debris—and then we return to the scene of Brown and Max Lowe the son solemnly taking it in. Brown stops the tape. “Well that’s um—”

“What else is on that one?” Max asks.

“It’s just—more stuff like that.”

They are both choking up.

“Thanks for shooting it” Max says.

“I’m sorry.”

Max was ten the eldest of three boys when his father died. The news reached his mother Jenni in Bozeman Montana via a satellite phone call from another member of the expedition Andrew McLean. Grief-stricken she found herself within months falling in love with Anker the survivor and friend who’d come to Bozeman to provide and seek emotional succor and support. Within two years they were married and Anker adopted her sons and Lowe’s as his own. A modern family of a kind.

Perhaps it seems unsporting of me to give so much away. But the Lowe-Anker story has been told many times in many media. I have written about it twice myself in pieces about Anker and McLean. It has almost become a kind of climbing-world folk song a dark and wondrous mountain myth open to new versions and interpretations. And yet even for someone familiar with the details and reverberations the experience of watching “Torn” is emotionally wrenching and uncommonly intimate. Its earnest and unadorned affirmation of love is a fine bracer in these sour suspicious times.

“Torn” is Max’s story—his attempt to come to grips with what he has lost and gained as well as to absolve and commend Anker for his taking of Lowe’s place. Alex Lowe Anker and Jenni Lowe-Anker are the film’s principal characters in many respects. One marvels at the dead father’s incandescence the widow’s frankness and courage the survivor’s taciturnity and inner turmoil. But the film’s protagonist its quiet heart is Max. We see him as a young boy in home videos shot mainly by his father and then after Alex’s death as a witness to the presence of his replacement. We watch young Max watching and then thirty-year-old Max watching his younger self watching. He doesn’t need to say much; his gaze—as child man and filmmaker—does the talking.

The seed of this project was the discovery in 2016 of Lowe’s body on Shishapangma on the glacier where he’d been buried by the avalanche. Two climbers David Goettler and Ueli Steck came upon his corpse; after seventeen years the ice and snow had released him. The family travelled to Tibet to retrieve and cremate the body in a pyre at base camp. They brought the cameras of course and as Jenni and the boys experienced some measure of closure Anker wrestled with a flareup of long-simmering survivor’s guilt and impostor syndrome. He had suicidal thoughts.

Max as the eldest had been more hesitant than his brothers to accept Anker. He’s the only one who didn’t change his surname to Lowe-Anker. The other boys hardly remember their father—to them he is “Alex” more legend than man and Anker is “Dad.” On camera Max questions his mother about her haste in taking up with Anker (“Why?”) and she offers a piquant declaration of both her love for Anker and her practical considerations for bringing him into the family. “ ‘Why?’ Why is it worth it to love someone?”

“I mean I just can’t—I can’t imagine in the wake of something so crushing—to come out of it so quickly in that way that you did.”

Jenni explains herself and says “There wasn’t time to overthink it Max. I just acted.”

At the same time that Max Lowe was making his film I happened to be reporting a piece that was partly about Anker’s psychological and emotional struggles. I was the latest curious outsider to gawk and pry while Max was taking it up from inside. I spent days with Conrad and Jenni in Bozeman had dinner at their house and had frank conversations with them about all they’d been through. I spoke with Max about the delicacy of his project. I found myself wondering if Anker had let me into his world and his head (a little ways at least) to inoculate himself against the deeper exposure of the film. Jenni seemed to regard my project with some wariness focussed as it was on the men who leave rather than the women who get left behind.

“Torn” is one of several prominent new climbing films. “14 Peaks” follows the Nepali mountaineer Nirmal Purja’s quest to climb the world’s fourteen mountains that rise higher than eight thousand metres in just seven months—an unfathomable feat. Such is his strength that the threat of death (his anyway) hardly comes into play; the film curiously depicts fund-raising as a steeper challenge than Annapurna. “The Alpinist” a documentary directed by Peter Mortimer and Nick Rosen about the elusive Canadian free soloist Marc-André Leclerc features what may be the most vivid and harrowing climbing footage I’ve ever seen. (After Mortimer’s previous film “The Dawn Wall” co-directed by Josh Lowell and Jimmy Chin and Elizabeth Chai Vasarhelyi’s “Meru” and “Free Solo” that bar is not low.) “The Alpinist” takes up questions of risk loss and grief but perhaps in the genre’s more conventional way of accepting death as the cost of pushing limits. The sadness is raw unprocessed. And no children get left behind so there’s apparently no one around to parse the mythmaking or the long-term consequences of untimely death.

In “Torn” the family members have been contending with the reverberations for two decades even if they haven’t worked through it all together. Early on Max’s brother Isaac says to him “I’m curious as to why you want to make this film considering it’s something that we haven’t really explored with just ourselves very much at all.”

The other brother Sam says “I feel like it’s probably just going to bring things out in the open and then we’ll just see if we can recover from that.”

The film turned out to be both a vehicle for and a chronicle of the family’s self-therapy. I got the sense from family members that it was not uncontentious. Jenni who in 2008 published a memoir “Forget Me Not” has long served as the guardian of Alex’s legacy and of her own story. It seems she had some trouble ceding control to her son. “Wouldn’t it have been easier just to go to therapy?” she told him.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiQ2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRhaWx5ZG90LmNvbS9pcmwvbG93ZXMtd29ya2VyLXNjb2xkcy1hc2lhbi13b21hbi12aWRlby_SAUdodHRwczovL3d3dy5kYWlseWRvdC5jb20vaXJsL2xvd2VzLXdvcmtlci1zY29sZHMtYXNpYW4td29tYW4tdmlkZW8vP2FtcA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,‘You’re being hostile’: Lowe’s worker accused of ‘gaslighting’ Asian woman subjected to racist remarks by white customer (updated),"An Asian American woman is demanding an apology from Lowe’s after an employee mishandled a racist experience she had with another customer—and many on social media are rallying behind her.

Xuna Hu was shopping at Lowe’s in Springfield Illinois on Jan. 17 when a white customer allegedly told her “Go back to your country” Hu said in a Facebook post. The customer made these comments after taking one of the fire pits that Hu was waiting to purchase.

In the attached video Hu asks the customer—a white woman—to apologize. Instead a white Lowe’s employee whose name tag identifies him as David scolds Hu telling her to delete the video and calling her “combative” and “hostile.” David also threatens to refuse her sale.

“I’m asking you politely to delete the video you are currently taking” David says in the video. “There is nothing that you need the video for. There is no crime being committed.

“It’s not right to be racist” Hu replies. “And I have full right to protect myself take the video just in case she does something bad to me. It’s nothing to you because you’re white.”

Hu’s story went viral on TikTok after several large accounts reposted her video. TikTokers Ed (@etchaskej) and Danesh (@thatdaneshguy) both made videos about Hu’s experience garnering 1.5 million and 484000 views respectively.

Many commenters provided words of support on Facebook and TikTok. Many criticized David for belittling Hu’s experience.

“David was gaslighting Xuna” one Facebook user wrote. “David doesn’t get to decide how big of a situation this is. HE wasn’t the subject of the racist remarks.”

“The worst part is that no one stepped in to help this woman” one TikTok user wrote. “Normalize standing up for the right thing.”

Now Hu is demanding change from Lowe’s. In another Facebook post she asked others to use her template letter to email the company’s CEO. A Change.org petition on Hu’s behalf has reached over 16000 signatures. According to the State Journal-Register Illinois state Rep. Theresa Mah started the petition after seeing Hu’s video. The email and petition both call for an apology to Hu and racial sensitivity training for employees.

The Springfield Lowe’s currently has a 1.4 star rating on Facebook. Many one-star reviews call on the store management to fire David.

Hu told the Daily Dot she appreciates the support she’s received from “people that I don’t even know.”

“All I hope is people to understand that racism is not ok’” she said in a Facebook message. “We are all humans. We don’t have to hate each other because we look different. Right now it’s the really hard time for everyone. Please love respect and support each other!”

The Daily Dot has reached out to Lowe’s via email.

Update 10:41 am CT Jan. 24: In a statement to the Daily Dot a Lowe’s representative said:

“We were appalled to hear about this experience. At Lowe’s discrimination of any kind is unacceptable. We spoke to Ms. Hu and apologized letting her know we are taking swift action to address the matter. Our intent is to always ensure customers feel valued respected and welcome. We are committed to creating a safe and open environment for all customers.”

Max Lowe was just 10 years old when his famed mountaineer father Alex Lowe died in an avalanche on Shishapangma in 1999; old enough to have formed strong memories of Alex and his achievements but too young to comprehend the void left behind by his death and its reverberations through his family. Max's mother Jennifer Lowe soon remarried Conrad Anker Alex's climbing partner on the expedition who survived the avalanche but suffered intense PTSD and survivor's guilt. Now aged 33 Max has candidly deconstructed the Lowe-Anker family's tragedy and togetherness in the documentary Torn giving him a new perspective on their collective and individual traumas.

Torn offers a rare introspective exploration of the other side of adventure—what happens when things go wrong and the implications for those left behind who often carry the burden of conflicting emotions. It's a intimate portrayal of a man who increasingly felt torn between his passion for adventure and his longing for domestic life and of a family torn apart by tragedy and torn between holding onto the past and embracing the present but ultimately brought together through risk chance and love.

""It's hard to find the courage and space to discuss difficult things with the people we love most"" Max says in a video call from Montana. ""You don't want to rock the boat too much. Asking my family to participate in the film was one of the first steps."" Initially the younger of his two brothers Isaac was unsure. Why should the family discuss something so personal publicly that they hadn't sufficiently broached amongst themselves Isaac asks in Torn.

""I used the film as a tool to help me find the bravery to address some of these issues"" Max says. He's at once a subject in the documentary and its driving force as filmmaker giving him the chance to zoom in and out and explore the story from different perspectives. ""I see the world through a storyteller's lens so to be able to create this film that roots itself in one of the most traumatic events of my life was pretty remarkable and a huge gift that my family gave me"" he explains.

""I've searched for resentment in the process of making this film but I never found it because I want to push my own boundaries.""

***

As a kid Max wasn't fully aware of the risks that Alex - as he refers to him - took in the mountains nor did he resent the time his father spent away from him and his brothers as he made cutting-edge first ascents in the USA the Greater Ranges and beyond. ""It was just his job his life and I loved him for it"" Max says. ""For me to have a dad who was an adventurer whom you'd read stories about who was travelling to the far side of the world and coming back to tell me these stories firsthand was just remarkable. I thought he was the coolest guy ever.""

Known for his obsessive feats of strength and endurance in both training and performance Alex earned the nicknames 'The Mutant' and 'Lungs with Legs.' Arguably the best all-round climber of his time Alex vehemently rejected such claims: ""I'm just the world's most dogmatic climber hardheaded very focused on the goal"" he once said.

In his youthful optimism Max never expected anything bad to happen. ""You trust that the world is going to work out in your favour up until it doesn't"" he says. ""For me that moment was when Alex was killed losing not only this figure that I looked up to in this intense way but also the trust and love that I held in our relationship.""

Alex's body - and that of cameraman David Bridges - could not immediately be recovered. The lack of closure confused Max. He felt ""frozen in time"" while Alex seemed in some sort of limbo ""like an astronaut lost in space"" he says in the film making it hard to accept Conrad into the family as a father figure. For younger brothers Sam and Isaac aged 7 and 3 their naïvety enabled a smoother transition. To them Conrad was adopted as ""Dad"" while Alex remained a more distant almost mythical figure. Max was the only member of the family who chose not to adopt the 'Lowe-Anker' surname.

""I outran an avalanche but two people didn't."" - Conrad Anker

""It was challenging when Conrad stepped into our lives for me to reconcile"" Max says. ""We didn't have the specific physical closure of seeing Alex's body but as a kid it's also harder to understand the finality of death. I held onto this idea that maybe he was still alive and he would come home."" There was also the realisation that Conrad was cut from the same climber's cloth as Alex—would he too leave the house one day and never return continuing a cycle of tragedy?

Conrad grieved Alex's loss differently. He battled with survivor's guilt made all the more heavy by the dependents that his close friend Alex had left behind: a wife and three sons. He felt suicidal ""Like it should have been me instead of Alex"" he says in the film. ""Because he had a young family. Because his life was worth more than mine."" The intense responsibility that Conrad had felt towards Alex in life - while roped together as his climbing partner on risky endeavours - continued beyond Alex's death. Painfully aware that Alex had begun to question the time spent away from his young family while in Tibet Conrad drives to the Lowe household to be present at their first Christmas following the accident and fulfils Alex's wish to take his boys to Disneyland.

When Conrad and Jennifer unexpectedly fell in love their relationship attracted unpleasant media attention. Alex's high profile led to mawkish interest in their story post-tragedy. Rumours and gossip ensued: Were they having an affair? Isn't it too soon?

In the film even Max admits to feeling perplexed as to how his mother could apparently move on so quickly following Alex's death. In a difficult conversation he comes to understand Jennifer's predicament as a young widow with three young children. ""You don't have time to wait around. There's no time to overthink it"" she explains to Max as a camera captures his emotions during the interview breaking the fourth wall. ""I'm not going to let the painful end be the end of me opening my heart"" she adds. It's clear that Jennifer drew great emotional strength through processing her trauma and in continuing her life alongside Conrad which she has passed on to her sons.

""I'm not going to let the painful end be the end of me opening my heart."" - Jennifer Lowe-Anker

""In retrospect I am not at all shocked that my mom and Conrad ended up together"" Max says. ""It was this big shocking thing when it happened because of who Alex was and because Conrad was another climber living on the edge of risk."" Max likens Jennifer and Conrad's relationship to those that occurred in the wake of World War Two when surviving soldiers returned and married the wives of their friends who had died next to them. ""I think that climbing is a very similar world and there are parallels because if you go through these traumatic events together even though it's confusing and difficult for people outside of it you probably understand that there's no greater closeness that you could find in life"" he says.

Conrad nonetheless felt a sense of imposter syndrome for having survived and stepped into Alex's hallowed shoes and his household. Occasionally both he and Jennifer were tormented by dreams that Alex had returned alive hurt by their situation.

""Part of my desire to make the film was to paint this picture of just what an amazing thing it was that Conrad ended up together with us"" Max explains. ""Just to quell any doubts or reservations that any of us might have had that this is the right path because it's the path that we've found together."" The film shows an awkward but heartwarming kitchen conversation between Max and Conrad - two hardened mountain men - in which they slowly work through their emotions and manage to find the words to express their love and gratitude for one another.

Torn is not the first film about the family. In 2007 the film The Endless Knot by Michael Brown (who was filming at Base Camp during the ill-fated expedition) examined Jennifer and Conrad's relationship and their commitment to finding meaning beyond tragedy in launching the Alex Lowe Foundation and the Khumbu Climbing Center. Max and his brothers were in their teens during filming while Alex's body was yet to be discovered.

In 2016 a phone call from Swiss mountaineer Ueli Steck immediately thrust the family back to 1999. Steck and his German climbing partner David Goettler were at Base Camp on Shishapangma when they spotted an anomaly in the grey and white surroundings: the glacier had melted and Alex and David Bridges' bodies were now visible. ""Everything resurfaced"" Conrad says in the film.

The family decided to recover Alex's remains together. The scene in Torn makes for tough viewing as they deal with the raw emotions upon seeing and cremating the bodies below the mountain. ""I asked them if they would be OK with me filming that experience"" Max says. ""I didn't know if it would become anything but I knew that having the footage of that experience could be a cathartic piece of our story to re-examine at some point.""

The discovery and the footage from their pilgrimage became catalysts for creating Torn leading to an in-depth exploration of archive materials. Max is shown observing footage from the 1999 expedition for the first time including hard-to-watch scenes from the day of the avalanche prefaced with a warning from filmmaker Michael Brown: ""This isn't going to be very fun Max.""

Producing Torn while difficult has brought the family closer together and given them more agency in their story Max says after years of their narrative being constructed and misshapen in the public eye. ""I think it all became a little impersonal to us"" he explains. ""The story of our lives became a story that didn't really feel like one in which we had all that much control but in the making of the film and the exploration of all this stuff from our perspective we got to tell the other side of the story.""

Influenced by early forays with his father and adventures with Conrad Max enjoys skiing and mountaineering. In parallel Alex's death has shaped his approach to risk. ""It's made me more cautious because I know the sharp end of the deal in a very personal way"" he says. ""But at the same time that's the world that I come from and know most intimately and I still find solace in the mountains. For me and for my brothers the mountains will always be a place where we find a connection not only to the world beyond ourselves but to our own heritage and history."" Max explains that Sam the middle son grew to know Alex better through making the film enabling him to come to terms with his own passion for the mountains and igniting a desire to pursue it further since he now understands ""why Alex did what he did.""

Torn is reaching general audiences in cinemas worldwide. To the outside observer mountaineering can seem a selfish endeavour. Max maintains that Alex's story is one that can inspire others. ""Exploration has always been of benefit to mankind"" he says. ""Seeing someone pushing the boundaries of what we can do and what we know whether that's in science or in storytelling or climbing the highest mountains on earth that inspires others to push the boundaries of humanity.""

But he's also acutely aware that adventure comes at a price as the son of a man who pushed the edge of risk and died doing it. ""The risk versus reward question isn't really one that I try to draw too much focus towards"" he explains. ""I've searched for resentment in the process of making this film but I never found it because I want to push my own boundaries. There's risk involved in pushing any boundary for personal gain. It might not be death you might not be risking your life but you're risking something and I still look up to Alex for setting that example.""

In 2021 Torn won Grand Prize at the Kendal Mountain Film Festival and Best Feature Film at the Banff Mountain Film Festival.

“We had a lot of conversations very early on in the process about the score … and for me it was very important to be able to reference the original film in some way but to try to steer clear of anything that was too concretely connected to the film” Lowe tells Gold Derby during our Meet the Experts: Composers panel (watch above). “I did in the end rework one of Philip Glass’ original pieces [‘The Music Box’] but that was the last thing I did. I had completed the entire score before I even approached a consideration of what that would be because I wanted to be able to build the world first. I wanted to have a very specific vocabulary that stood on its own as well as have the film stand individually living in the same universe as the original film but being its own entity.”

SEE Gold Derby interviews with 2022 Oscar contenders

Lowe took a different approach to the sonic palette. While Glass’ score was frenetic Lowe’s synthesized score lives in eerie suspense seemingly bubbling under the surface making one question not only what horrors could be around the corner but what’s real and what’s not. “I came up with some very clear intentions and things I really wanted to focus on … one of those things being the sort of psychic energy of that sound in the score as a textural element throughout so that the actual energy of the space lives inside basically building a landscape that would ultimately live as a character within the film” Lowe explains. “ make a complex score as I could — an electroacoustic score utilizing electronics utilizing acoustic instruments and then blending them in a way in which at times you don’t know what is what. And that also builds itself into the mythology and this idea of illusion or reality versus fantasy that is played with throughout the film.”

To create this visceral vague soundscape Lowe recorded his own voice and the voices of the film’s stars and his close friend and Oscar winner Hildur Guðnadóttir (2019’s “Joker”) who also plays the cello. Additionally Lowe was on site during production in Chicago’s Cabrini-Green neighborhood where he once lived recording atmospheric sounds from the humming of electrical boxes to the buzzing of bees.

“There were electrical boxes on the outside of the old row houses and I was doing recordings on the inside of the electrical boxes and basically collecting the sound of the door creaking the wind rushing through and basically being filtered through this metal box” he shares. “Then I took those sounds and processed them down again and utilized these cut-up techniques and rearranged the sounds so you don’t necessarily have the feeling of that specific thing.”

LULU,Lululemon Athletica,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiW2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZvb2wuY29tL2ludmVzdGluZy8yMDIyLzAxLzIzL3doYXQtd2F0Y2gtd2hlbi1sZXZpLXN0cmF1c3MtcmVwb3J0cy1xNC1lYXJuaW5ncy_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,What to Watch When Levi Strauss Reports Earnings This Week,"Sales growth likely accelerated compared to the previous quarter.

Levi Strauss (LEVI 0.73%) shareholders are in for a volatile trading week. The jeans specialist will close out its fiscal 2021 with an earnings report on Wednesday Jan. 26 and that announcement should be packed with fresh data about its growth opportunity in the next year.

The stock price has dropped in the weeks leading up to this report as Wall Street worries about slowing growth and Levi's ability to pass along higher prices as inflation surges. But the company might start shifting that sour sentiment with some stronger operating metrics heading into 2022.

Let's take a closer look.

The revenue trends

Levi entered Q4 with solid momentum. Sales jumped 41% compared to the pandemic-pressured year-ago period and were up 3% compared to the same time in 2019. Investors were initially pleased with the news that the apparel specialist is back to setting sales records in part thanks to booming demand in its digital channels.

""We delivered a strong quarter"" CEO Chip Bergh said in an early October press release ""with revenue growth versus pre-pandemic 2019 levels. The big question this week is whether Levi was able to build on that positive momentum. The company is aiming to boost sales by 21% in Q4 which would translate into accelerating growth compared to two years ago. Yet that forecast might prove too aggressive after the omicron variant pressured customer traffic and worsened labor shortages.

Paying more for jeans

Soaring inflation will show up in this week's report and investors will be keenly focused on how well Levi's did in passing along those higher costs. The news has been good so far on that score. In fact gross profit margin through the nine months ended in late August improved to 58% of sales compared to 54% a year earlier.

Executives said in October that they believe Levi's has enough pricing power to maintain those gains. Confirmation of that success will show up in steady or rising gross profit margins and solid earnings growth. Most investors who follow the stock are looking for per-share earnings to roughly double in Q4 to $0.40.

Looking ahead to 2022

The stock's movement will most closely be tied to the official 2022 outlook that management issues on Wednesday. Heading into the report most investors are looking for sales to rise by roughly 10% compared to 2021's expected 30% increase. Earnings are projected to improve to $1.53 per share from about $1.44 per share.

Levi's has some attractive growth avenues ahead as it expands to new geographies and widens its portfolio into athleisure apparel. While there are faster-growing more profitable rivals including Lululemon Athletica (LULU -1.38%) this stock is valued at a discount of about two times sales compared to seven times sales for the athleisure giant.

Long-term returns for holding Levi Strauss shares will depend a lot on how well the company follows Lululemon's blockbuster growth-and-profitability playbook. The good news is that with sales setting records again in fiscal 2021 the company has some growth momentum in that journey.",,,,,,,,,,,,

Ron DeSantis barred the sale of lab-grown meat in the Sunshine State.

DeSantis signed the legislation called SB 1084 into effect on May 1 casting it as a bid to stop the World Economic Forum’s goal of forcing the world to eat lab-grown meat and insects “an overlooked source of protein” according to a news release.

Rather “Florida is increasing meat production and encouraging residents to continue to consume and enjoy 100% real Florida beef” the governor’s office added.

DeSantis previously has blasted “the global elite’s plan to force the world to eat meat grown in a petri dish or bugs to achieve their authoritarian goals.”

4 Jeff Bezos and his fiancée Lauren Sanchez moved to Florida mere months before announcing a $60 million investment into lab-grown meats via the Amazon founder’s Bezos Earth Fund. Bezos Earth Fund

The move comes about a month after the Bezos Earth Fund chaired by the Amazon founder and Sanchez announced a hefty investment into sustainable protein including plant-based fermented and cultivated meats — part of the organization’s larger $1 billion commitment to expanding food production Fortune earlier reported.

“We need to feed 10 billion people with healthy sustainable food throughout this century while protecting our planet. We can do it and it will require a ton of innovation” Sanchez wrote in a statement announcing the $60 million investment.

Lab-grown meats differ from its slaughter-free counterparts like Impossible Foods in that they are grown from real animal cells that are replicated scientifically eliminating the need to farm animals.

Impossible burgers and other vegan proteins such as Beyond Meat meanwhile are made using alternative protein sources like tempeh tofu seitan and beans among other products.

According to science magazine Scientific American the US Department of Agriculture granted its first-ever approval of cell-cultured meat produced by two companies GOOD Meat and UPSIDE Foods last June — less than a year after the Food and Drug Administration declared the companies’ products safe to eat.

Florida for reference ranks 13th in the US in overall cattle numbers with a total herd size of 886000 among 15000 beef producers with total sales of $546 million according to Fortune citing the Florida Beef Council.

Before garnering US approval GOOD Meat had already been selling its cultivated chicken in Singapore. It made its debut in America in a dish curated by well-known chef José Andrés at his Washington DC restaurant China Chilcano.

The nonprofit Good Food Institute reports that the cultivated meat industry has grown to include more than 150 companies backed by $2.6 billion in investments Fortune cited — with Bezos among those funding the sector.

Bezos and DeSantis’s clashing opinions on the lab-grown meat industry are coming to light shortly after the 60-year-old tech billionaire moved from Seattle near Amazon’s headquarters to Miami closer to his space exploration firm Blue Origin’s home base.

In October 2023 it was revealed that Bezos had purchased two mansions on Florida’s exclusive “Billionaire Bunker” the man-made island formally known as Indian Creek Island.

Last month he added a third multimillion-dollar estate to his sprawling Miami portfolio in an off-market transaction reportedly worth $90 million.

Universal’s The Fall Guy the Ryan Gosling starrer inspired by the 1980s TV show kicked off the summer movie season at No. 1 with $28.5 million while Disney’s rerelease of Star Wars: The Phantom Menace surprised by coming in at No. 2 with $8.1 million.

Despite The Fall Guy’s No. 1 finish its haul came in behind initial expectations of $30 million to $35 million and overall the box office is down dramatically from the same frame a year ago when Marvel Studios’ Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 bowed to $118.4 million domestically. The weekend is down 53 percent from last year and off more than 66 percent from 2022 when Marvel’s Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness opened to $187.4 million domestically.

The Fall Guy is said to have a net budget of $130 million after tax incentives for shooting in Australia. Universal will now hope that Fall Guy’s A- CinemaScore from audiences will help it make up ground in the coming weeks with word of mouth. It also boasts strong reviews out of South by Southwest.

The feature hails from stuntman-turned-director David Leitch and has been marketed as a love letter to the stunt community. Gosling at the height of his star power thanks to his Oscar-nominated turn as Ken in Barbie fronts the picture as a beaten down stuntman who comes out of retirement to try to find a missing A-list star and save a film (which happens to be directed by his ex played by Emily Blunt). The feature has a global cume of $65.4 globally.

Phantom Menace‘s weekend is a nice turn of events for the film. It kicked off George Lucas’ Star Wars prequel trilogy in 1999 and for years after was a punchline for audiences and Star Wars fans but has grown in appreciation in the decades since with younger fans who grew up on the film coming into adulthood and star Ewan McGregor reprising his role of Obi-Wan Kenobi for his own Disney+ series in 2022 helping further build nostalgia for the film. It returned to theaters as part of the film’s 25th anniversary as well as for May the 4th the unofficial Star Wars holiday.

The Phantom Menace edged out Amazon MGM Studios’ sexy tennis drama Challengers for No. 2. The Luca Guadagnino feature had a solid hold in weekend two dropping just 49 percent for a weekend gross of $7.6 million and a cume of $29.4 million. Zendaya Josh O’Connor and Mike Faist star.

Sony and Screen Gem’s Tarot bowed in its first weekend to $6.5 million a solid start considering the feature cost $8 million and did not have a traditional marketing campaign. Sony embarked on its first digital-only campaign for Tarot meaning no TV spots or billboards for the feature in which seven friends accidentally unleash an evil entity trapped in a deck of cursed Tarot cards. Neither critics nor audiences embraced this one. It has an 8 percent on Rotten Tomatoes while audiences gave it a low C- CinemaScore. It ends the weekend with a global haul of $10.2 million to date.

For one night only this weekend it also had Madonna.

More than a million people thronged Copacabana beach on Saturday night turning its vast stretch of sand into a massive dancefloor for a free concert by the pop star as she completed her world tour.

“Here we are in the most beautiful place in the world” Madonna 65 told the tightly packed crowd. Pointing out the ocean view and the mountains she added: “This place is magic.”

In the run-up to the concert the city had been buzzing with fans lined up outside the stately Copacabana Palace hotel in the hope of catching a glimpse of the star. The city’s airport fielded an estimated 170 extra flights as fans poured in from around the world.

City officials estimated that 1.6 million people turned up for the concert some watching from brightly lit apartments or hotels overlooking the beach while others looked on from motorboats and sailboats anchored nearby.

As drones and helicopters flew overhead the singer offered up a dazzling show playing classics ranging from Like a Virgin to Like a Prayer and cycling through dozens of sets and costume changes.

Flanked by giant screens she began the show with her 1998 hit Nothing Really Matters eliciting a huge cheer from the crowd.

“Oi Rio!” she called out in Portuguese. The response was swift carried by more than a million voices: “Oi Queen Madonna!”

The singer also paid an emotional tribute to “all the bright lights” lost to Aids as she sang Live to Tell against a backdrop of black-and-white photos featuring people who died from the illness.

The Brazilian pop artists Anitta and Pabllo Vittar as well as younger musicians from samba schools also took part in the show.

The show which Madonna’s official website described as the biggest ever in her 40-year career marked the final stop on her Celebration tour. Giant screens and 18 sound towers had been spread out along the beach to ensure the crowds could enjoy the event.

Fans many of whom lined up hours or even days before the concert to get a good view hailed Madonna’s performance. “I have never seen such a powerful show” one told the BBC. “It’s unimaginable very much out of the ordinary” she added.

“Madonna is spectacular” said another. “There’s no concert better than Madonna’s.”

City officials on high alert after a young Brazilian fan died at a Taylor Swift concert last year as a result of heat exhaustion ordered firefighters to cool down fans by spraying water before the concert. Free drinking water was also handed out as temperatures hovered at about 27C (81F) during the late-night show.

More than 3000 police officers were deployed around the concert area where the Rolling Stones and Rod Stewart have also drawn million-strong crowds.

Across Rio anticipation had been building all week. “Welcome Queen!” read Heineken ads plastered around the city while bars and restaurants served up “Like a Virgin” cocktails. Across the Copacabana neighbourhood the singer’s image was emblazoned on billboards souvenirs and T-shirts.

As hotel bookings in Copacabana climbed to an estimated 98% of capacity Rio state’s security readied plans that included the presence of 3200 military personnel and 1500 civilian police officers on standby while the country’s navy carried out inspections of any vessel looking to follow the concert offshore. City officials estimated that the concert would inject as much as 293m reais (£46m) into the local economy.

Today we continue our movie roundtable series with four movies known for being true-to-life: “A League of Their Own” “42” “The Rookie” and “Eight Men Out.” Our panelists -- Mark Bowman Ian Browne Christina DeNicola Alyson Footer Steve Gilbert and Bill Ladson -- conducted a spirited debate diving into the nuances of each film. A note on the selection process: All movies debated were placed into brackets which brought forth a little bit of a conundrum given the high volume of terrific baseball movies that could easily fall into more than one category. “Best Ensemble Cast” was probably the most wide-ranging; after all it’s fair to say 80 percent of all baseball movies had A-plus A-list casts. But we placed movies in only one bracket each which is how “A League of Their Own” ended up in Based on a True Story and not Best Ensemble. Clearly this classic fits almost every category -- because it is a nearly flawless film. Previous movie roundtables:

• Best ensemble

• Best Hollywood ending

• Let the kids play! Best baseball movies featuring children

Alyson Footer editor/moderator: Baseball movies draw a wide range of opinions. Some people for example love “Major League” some don’t. Most love “Bull Durham” but not everyone. But it seems like everyone loves “A League of Their Own.” Fair comment? Ian Browne Red Sox beat reporter: Oh my gosh. “A League of Their Own"" is such a good movie. I watched it yesterday maybe for the first time since I saw it in the theater in 1992. I honestly forgot how good it was. Geena Davis is just spectacular in this. I love her sibling bond/rivalry with her sister. Christina DeNicola Marlins beat reporter: There may be no crying in baseball but there's one thing for certain: You've got to be a robot if you're not teary-eyed by the end of it. Footer: I fully boo-hoo every time and I've seen it 30 times. Steve Gilbert D-backs beat reporter: I think ""A League of Their Own"" is one of the most if not the most underrated baseball movies. Browne: Agree. I was thinking that as I re-watched. There are no flaws in that movie. Some baseball movies seem bound to go over the top with schmaltz. This really seemed so genuine. Bill Ladson MLB.com reporter: Prior to 1992 my all-time baseball movie was Pride of the Yankees because Gary Cooper did a great job playing Lou Gehrig. But then I saw ""A League of their Own"" -- Penny Marshall did one heck of a job directing the film. I thought Geena Davis was an actual baseball player. My favorite scene was Davis and Lori Petty colliding at the plate. I thought I was watching a real game. The song “This Used to be My Playground"" by Madonna brought tears to my eyes because the lyrics reminded me so much of the time I played baseball in the Astoria Projects in Queens New York. DeNicola: That song for the closing credits and with the actual ballplayers on the field?! Gilbert: The best-ever line in a baseball movie comes from ""A League of Their Own"" and it's not the “no crying” one. I think the scene when Dottie is leaving and she says to Jimmy Dugan that it just got to be too hard and he comes back with ""It's supposed to be hard. If it were easy everyone would do it. The hard is what makes it great."" -- That spoke to me as someone who has been around the game for a long time. Browne: Unlike most baseball movies the ending leaves you really conflicted. Because you’ve become attached to Geena’s character Dottie and her sister Kit who is played wonderfully by Lori Petty you don’t want either team to lose the World Series. The play at the plate where Kit rams into Dottie and the ball squirts free is a perfect ending. Deep down you wonder if maybe Dottie purposely let it get away.

Footer: She definitely did. DeNicola: There’s still debate about whether she dropped it on purpose! When you can keep the people talking this many decades later that's impressive. Browne: Yeah that's why I think it was so well done. There's ambiguity. Like maybe she subconsciously dropped it! Ladson: I think she didn't drop the ball on purpose. Also I loved the part when Lori Petty threw the rock after she was traded. Mark Bowman Braves beat reporter: ""A League of Their Own"" is one of those movies you stop to watch every time you find it while channel surfing. The comedy Jon Lovitz Tom Hanks Rosie O'Donnell and Madonna provide is tremendous. The movie provides a good feel what the women experienced while playing in this league. So it successfully blends comedy and history. Browne: Amazing to think that in 1992 Tom Hanks was well-established as mainly a great comedy actor. We go back and watch the movie now realizing he became one of the best actors of our lifetime playing so many huge roles from “Forrest Gump” to “Philadelphia” to “Cast Away” to “Saving Private Ryan” and on and on. He was fantastic as Jimmy Dugan basically falling asleep at the games after taking over the Rockford Peaches in the early scenes and then falling in love with the team to the point that he bypasses a Triple-A job at the end of the movie so he can keep managing these women. The arc of Jimmy’s character -- from a lost booze-bag to someone who gets his life back together -- is really well done. And no line has ever stood up more than ""There's no crying in baseball!"" Jimmy would not have been happy with what he saw in the 2003 Red Sox Game 7 ALCS clubhouse when giant men like David Ortiz were slumped over a couch sobbing.

Bowman: I just don't know why Kit didn't intentionally walk her sister with first base open in the ninth inning of Game 7. Guess she was just setting up the chance to score the dramatic winning run in the bottom half. Footer: Some of the real-life women who played in the AAGBPL have done a lot of interviews about the movie over the years and I love that they all say it's pretty true to life. The only thing they’ve quibbled with was the way the chaperones were portrayed. Shirley Burkovich said the chaperones were among the most important people in the players' lives; a lot of them were barely out of their teen years and living away from home for the first time. Chaperones were hugely important not nuisances. That’s pretty much the only thing the real players took exception with. DeNicola: So much of the film still resonates to this day. There's a line -- and I'm paraphrasing -- that Rosie O'Donnell's character says about how she was always a ""weird girl strange girl"" just because she could play. It doesn't happen as much now thankfully but if you're a girl playing sports you're seen different. Happened to me. Footer: The end scene when they all pour into the Hall of Fame to see the exhibit for the first time was so well done. Gilbert: It brought it all together at the end. Seeing Stillwell who lost his mom ... pretty touching. Ladson: One of the best endings I ever saw. Browne: This honestly might be the least-flawed of all baseball movies. DeNicola: So well done! I had a chance to meet a few of the ballplayers at the 2015 All-Star Game. Still one of my favorite moments. I got chills. Footer: Three members of the AAGPBL -- now in their 80s and 90s -- attend MLB's Trailblazer Series (a baseball tournament for girls ages 9-11) every year. They sit in the stands and literally watch these games from morning until the end of the day. Maybelle Blair (92 years old at the last tourney) brings her glove with her -- signed by Joe Torre -- and asks the kids to play catch. A few have taken her up on it. She still has a strong arm and pinpoint aim. Let’s move on to “The Rookie.” I re-watched it recently and while I was “meh” on the storyline as a whole I did find myself getting a little emotional when Jim Morris got news of the callup to the big leagues and when he got word in the ‘pen to start warming up. During my years covering the Astros beat there was nothing I loved more than covering guys when they got their first call to the big leagues. It never ever gets old. I felt like the way they portrayed it in “The Rookie” was pretty close to how this stuff happens.

DeNicola: It was a great reminder the Rays have been finding pitchers out of nowhere for years! Browne: Yes “The Rookie” is not a great movie. But it's one of those that leaves you entertained as you sit in your seat. It is kind of like a ""comfort food"" type of movie. Gilbert: It stayed pretty close to the actual story as well. Ladson: I thought this was going to be a boring film but I was impressed with the way Dennis Quaid played Jim Morris. Quaid’s perseverance was convincing -- going from a chemistry teacher/high school baseball coach to having a cup of coffee with the Devil Rays. The confrontations that Morris had with his father were sad because the father moved the family too many times when Morris was a kid.

Browne: Dennis Quaid to use a bad baseball cliché knocks it out of the park as Jim Morris. Forget about the movie for just a second. What a great human-interest story if probably turned up a few notches by Hollywood. Looking back I’m surprised more wasn’t made of the actual story when it happened in 1999. Must have been because MLB.com wasn’t around yet! Gilbert: It felt more like a family-relationship movie than a hardcore baseball movie if that makes sense. DeNicola: Exactly! The father/son dynamic in particular. Quaid not wanting to become his father and yet still wanting his approval. I've lived in Miami my whole life so seeing the impact one person's accomplishments can have on a small town is truly remarkable and moving.

Browne: Baseball movies so often seem to come down to fathers and sons right? No different here. Jim had a very icy relationship with his dad who moved the family around a lot and had little interest in Jim’s love for baseball. But Jim eventually realizes he was also being stubborn with his dad and took some accountability for the relationship not being what it should have been. Jim didn’t know his dad was at his debut until he saw him out of the corner of his eye while he was talking with reporters. That is pretty touching when he gives his dad the ball. His dad said poignantly after missing so many games in Jim’s youth “I wasn’t going to miss this one.” And it was Brian Cox the amazing lead character of Succession! Ladson: I loved that part of the movie. Footer: A nice father-son portrayal and I believe we're 6-for-6 in roundtable movies in the category of unrealistic media portrayals. Browne: Yes but spoiler alert that streak might end before this discussion is over! Maybe it is over the top but I liked the scene when Jim got out of his car at one of those speed trap spots on the road and fired the ball and thought it said ’76’. Then for dramatic effect when he turned his back the bulbs on the original ‘7’ fill out and become a 9. DeNicola: I would love to know if that actually works. Bowman: “The Rookie” was a story that might have seemed too good to be true for Disney before it actually happened. Love the story. But the movie itself just felt average. It's certainly not one I look forward to finding when looking for something to watch. Footer: Next up: “42.” I saw it twice in the theater in one week but while I’d like to say it was because I was so moved by the movie (which I was) it was more because Chris Meloni played Leo Durocher and I needed to see that more than once. But “42” was really well-done and the subject matter was a tough one given the language and abuse that Jackie Robinson had to endure while he broke the color barrier. From everything we’ve read on this piece of our history the movie seemed to jibe with reality. Gilbert: Considering Rachel Robinson thought it accurately represented what went on I think it's safe to say you're right about it being realistic. DeNicola: Revisiting “42” for the first time since Chadwick Boseman's death was very emotional. He was such a great actor and from all reports an even better person. Browne: I loved the movie. I actually got to go to a private screening with the Red Sox in 2013 at a theater in Fort Myers. I remember Jackie Bradley Jr. being blown away and really impacted by the movie. Ladson: I saw the Jackie Robinson story which starred Jackie Robinson and Chadwick Boseman was better playing Robinson in “42.” This is the movie where Boseman made a name for himself and what a job he did. I loved the way he showed his emotions while facing racism especially when he was facing Ben Chapman of the Phillies. Boseman broke his bat and nearly had a nervous breakdown. I also loved Harrison Ford as Branch Rickey. I thought I was going to love the Pee Wee Reese character the person people said helped Robinson the most in real life but I ended up loving the Eddie Stanky character more. I liked the confrontation between Stanky and Chapman. Stanky was always defending Robinson and challenged Chapman to a fight for all the racist language Chapman used against Robinson.

Browne: Two words: Harrison Ford. He is a dominant force as Branch Rickey throughout the entire movie. Nearly every line catches your attention. “I want someone who has the courage not to fight back!” That’s powerful stuff. I just loved him in this movie. Never could have pictured him in such a role when I saw ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"" when I was like 10. Bowman: I do want to believe Branch Rickey was exactly how he was portrayed by Ford. Browne: The Durocher character was so outstanding that I'm bummed he was suspended for the 1947 season. I would have loved to see him manage the whole season. Durocher would have destroyed Ben Chapman and that would have been amazing. Gilbert: The scenes with the Phillies manager are really hard to watch but it really slaps you in the face with what Robinson had to face. You think you have an understanding of it but you see those scenes and you're reminded of just how horrific it truly was. Footer: Former lefty reliever C.J. Nitkowski played the pitcher during the horrible scene with Chapman and C.J. said later he was just counting the minutes until that day of shooting was over. It was terrible for everyone. DeNicola: Got to show some love to André Holland as well who was superb in Moonlight and did a nice job as Wendell Smith. Bowman: “42” is one of the best sports films you will ever find. One of the best compliments I can give is that I didn't want to see it end. I wanted to continue to follow a story I know pretty well. But that's because Boseman Ford and so many others gave you reason to believe you truly were a part of that great journey.

Browne: I agree that Boseman was amazing as Jackie Robinson. So much so that it hit me like a truck when I heard about his death. I think he did a great job of not romanticizing the character. Even though others thought he was a hero Boseman’s performance shows what an internal struggle this all was for Jackie. Footer: Another tear-jerking moment for me was the very end when they showed all the photos of real-life Jackie and Rachel Robinson. Gilbert: When you see Jackie with the grey hair. It hits you the toll this took on him physically. Browne: I noted in a previous roundtable how the media is never portrayed accurately or well in baseball movies. This might be an exception. I loved Wendell Smith -- played by André Holland -- in this movie. “I’m going to be your Boswell"" he tells Jackie early in the movie. All the scenes with him are great. He tells Jackie he needs to “slow things down” with the media just like he does when he is playing. Ladson: I wished the movie went past 1947. I wanted more. I wished they showed Jackie Robinson's entire baseball career. Browne: I thought the sportswriter character -- the sportswriter Holland was cast to play -- comes off as very believable for that era. Ladson: But he had to do his work in the stands. I hated it. Gilbert: His character was great. I think it showed that racism wasn't just a baseball issue but how it impacted others as well. I mean Wendell couldn't sit in the press box. It's so hard to understand how that's even possible. A good reminder that Jackie paved the way not just for baseball players of color but from all walks of life. Bowman: Yeah I thought Holland was great. Wendell Smith played a significant role in this journey. He influenced the thoughts of countless individuals from the time Jackie signed with Brooklyn. DeNicola: And he warned Jackie about the types of questions he would get as soon as he stepped on the field for Spring Training that first day! Browne: It was just such a nice thing that at least one baseball movie decided not to make a sportswriter look like a bumbling idiot! In fact quite the opposite. Footer: “42” is a movie that needs to be shown in every classroom of every school in America. DeNicola: Absolutely. Heck to everyone in America. Bowman: I loved the scene when they were in Cincinnati and Pee Wee Reese stands with Jackie before the game starts. Loved hearing him say something like ""Maybe we can all wear 42 tomorrow so that they won't be able to tell us apart.""

Footer: And look at what we do now every April 15 ... Browne: Prophetic! Ladson: A lot of historians say that pat on the back was fake. I hear a lot more about Gil Hodges' role with Jackie Robinson. DeNicola: I suppose with any ""based on a true story"" we have to accept some creative licenses will be made for the sake of cinema. Browne: I would have liked one highlight from the 1947 World Series. That's my only baseball critique. They played the Yankees right? That's pretty huge. Footer: Let's move on to “Eight Men Out.” Guilty pleasure for me (see what I did there). I love the cast. John Cusack is one of the great actors of our time. Gilbert: I fell in love with the Buck Weaver character. When Buck plays with the kids on the street and his scene with Kid Gleason before Game 1 and talking about playing the game for free. I felt for Buck at the end. Browne: By far one of the most serious baseball movies I’ve ever seen. Not a lot of frills or comedy. Just one big fat scandal. A little bit of the beauty of the movie is what we still don’t know to this day. How involved was Joe Jackson in the scandal? Is he mostly as innocent as the movie makes him seem? Eddie Cicotte was very happy to be on the take but even he had mixed feelings when he won Game 7 to keep his team alive in the series demanding to his manager that he wanted to pitch that game. DeNicola: This was probably my least favorite of these films but mainly because it didn't deal with an underdog. What was it about the late 1980s and baseball films?

Browne: I agree that it wasn't a wildly entertaining movie to watch. But to me that doesn't detract from it being an important movie. Ladson: It’s always interesting to see how baseball was played back in the early 20th century. While I feel bad for Buck Weaver and Shoeless Joe Jackson the movie made me feel sad for Charles Comiskey the owner. He was expecting to win the 1919 World Series and was furious that he didn’t get the big prize. It’s sad the White Sox decided to fix the series because they didn't like the way they were getting paid by the owner. John Cusack was outstanding as Weaver and he convinced me that he was innocent and never should have been suspended. Gilbert: At least they got Shoeless Joe hitting from the left side (properly) unlike Field of Dreams. I agree Bill. I felt worse for Buck than I did for Shoeless Joe. Browne: John Cusack does a great job as Buck Weaver. He certainly acts as if he had nothing to do with the fix and it is believable by how he played in the series yet he was ultimately banned from baseball. The movie just gives you a lot to think about. I think Buck just had a much stronger personality than Joe. At least if you believe their portrayals in the movie. Joe seemed like kind of a weak character. He just loved to hit and was great at baseball. Maybe not a lot going on between the ears though? Ladson: Weaver wasn't able to prove his innocence. Browne: How about the scene with Lefty “0 and 3 in the World Series” Williams when the gambler asks him if he likes his wife? Lefty confirms that he does and the gambler tells him she will be dead if the White Sox win Game 8. No pressure right? Bowman: Count me among the many who have long been intrigued by Shoeless Joe Jackson. I thought the movie did a good job of stoking the debate about how much Jackson had to do with the fix. His play and production certainly didn't indicate he was throwing the series. But he was part of the conversation and didn't inform the team. Still feel bad for a guy who may not have realized what he was getting into. Gilbert: I want to know if Landis was really swatting flies when the owners were trying to hire him. Footer: I do think it's an important film to have been made even if it's not award-worthy. When you see the actual games being thrown you realize how disgusting it is. Browne: Yes it's really nauseating. And the book and subsequent movie really brought this to the forefront and educated people about an important if very sad baseball scandal. Gilbert: It really helped humanize the people involved. DeNicola: Absolutely and that's what you usually want to see in a film. You want the viewer to sympathize or feel bad for the characters because there are areas of gray. David Strathairn as Eddie is a perfect example.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMikwFodHRwczovL3d3dy5hbGxrcG9wLmNvbS9hcnRpY2xlLzIwMjIvMDEvc29uZy1qb29uZy1raS1hbmQtMnBtcy1sZWUtanVuaG8tZGVtb25zdHJhdGUtdGhlaXItY2hlbWlzdHJ5LWFzLWJlc3QtZnJpZW5kcy1hdC1qdW5oby10aGUtbW9tZW50LWZhbm1lZXRpbmfSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Song Joong Ki and 2PM's Lee Junho demonstrate their chemistry as best friends at 'JUNHO THE MOMENT' fanmeeting,"2PM's Lee Junho successfully held a fan meeting 'JUNHO THE MOMENT' on January 22 at 6 pm KST at the Blue Square Mastercard Hall Seoul.

Garoua Cameroon – The knockout rounds of the 2021 Africa Cup of Nations (AFCON) have arrived with 16 teams progressing and eight being eliminated.

While the opening round served just 12 goals in 12 matches the action picked up considerably after that.

It has proven to be a good tournament for the goalkeepers with a number of excellent performances.

Added to that are a number of heart-warming stories from some of the traditionally less accomplished sides who punched above their weights to create bits of history for their nations.

The overarching feeling for host nation Cameroon is vindication.

Despite doubts over its readiness and capability to host the proceedings have gone on with few hitches leading to a great atmosphere inside the stadiums and a memorable tournament so far.

Nigeria is the only team to collect 9 points in #AFCON2021. The last time just one nation managed to finish the group stage with the full mark in a #TotalEnergiesAFCON edition was in 2010: Egypt. They went on to win the title. 🏆 #TotalEnergiesAFCON2021 | #TeamNigeria pic.twitter.com/aXAug6WWY5 — #TotalEnergiesAFCON2021 🏆 (@CAF_Online) January 21 2022

Who made it through?

Four of the six top-seeded sides finished top of their groups with Nigeria the only side to post a 100 percent record.

Cameroon and Morocco finished with seven points each while Senegal – despite only scoring once in three matches – accumulated five points to top its group.

There was progress for dark horses Mali Ivory Coast and Burkina Faso as well as Gabon despite a troubled preparation and the loss of captain Pierre Emerick Aubameyang.

However the real story of the group stage was the surprising progress of debutants Comoros and The Gambia both advancing despite being handed challenging draws.

The Scorpions were impressive in winning two of their three matches while Comoros produced an improbable result against Ghana in the final group match to seal progress.

Malawi also made it through for the first time in their history holding Africa’s highest-ranked team Senegal to a goalless draw along the way.

Qualified teams: Cameroon Burkina Faso Cape Verde Senegal Guinea Malawi Morocco Gabon Comoros Nigeria Egypt Ivory Coast Equatorial Guinea Mali Gambia Tunisia.

Who crashed out?

The shocking elimination of reigning champions Algeria was the subject of furious discussion and analysis.

The Fennec Foxes exited the tournament following a 1-3 defeat to Ivory Coast bringing to an end a short-lived title defence that took in a draw with Sierra Leone and defeat at the hands of Equatorial Guinea which ended its 35-match unbeaten run.

There was heartbreak for Ghana too who finished bottom of Group C chastening learning experiences for Mauritania and Sudan reasons for optimism for Ethiopia Sierra Leone and Zimbabwe and disappointment for Guinea-Bissau whose goalless streak at AFCON stretched to seven matches.

What’s in store next?

The standout tie of the last-16 will take place in Douala with Ivory Coast winners of Group E taking on Group D runners-up Egypt on January 26.

This would be a game fit to be the final but nevertheless it promises to be a compelling match.

In Garoua Nigeria face Tunisia a repeat of the third-place playoff from the 2019 edition.

Player of the round

It is difficult to look past the tournament’s leading goal scorer Vincent Aboubakar as AFCON’s outstanding player so far.

The Al-Nassr striker has been a man on a mission in his home country Cameroon leading the line with intent and scoring in all of the group matches (including braces against Burkina Faso and Ethiopia).

Despite scoring the winner in the 2017 final Aboubakar has never really headlined a tournament with the Indomitable Lions. He is getting to do so now.

Play of the group

Moses Simon came off the bench in Nigeria’s final group match with Guinea-Bissau and produced a moment of mesmeric quality.

After weaving his way into the box and past three different challenges the Nantes’ winger’s shot cannoned back off the crossbar and into the path of team captain William Troost-Ekong who calmly prodded the ball home for the game’s second goal.

Likely finalists?

The final is still a long way but the tournament bracket does seem to suggest one of Africa’s classic matches – Cameroon against Nigeria – for the final.

These sides have met in the tournament on three occasions with Cameroon winning all three.

The latest meetings took place in Lagos when Nigeria co-hosted the tournament in 2000 and Nigeria’s thirst for revenge makes the prospect of a final rematch that much more exciting.

What has the interest been like?

Attendances during the opening match days were mostly lacklustre due to COVID-19 restrictions which require proof of vaccination and a negative PCR result for admission into stadiums.

However those regulations have been relaxed somewhat and the final group matches were played to sizable crowds in various centres across Cameroon.

There is also a thriving fan zone culture with spectators who are unable to gain access to the stadiums or reluctant to go through the COVID protocol banding together to follow the action in ad hoc open-air viewing centres.

Any controversies to talk of?

Of course.

The decision by the Confederation of African Football (CAF) to introduce the Video Assistant Referee (VAR) from the group stage was bound to lead to a number of controversial moments.

Malawi and Guinea-Bissau were left aggrieved by the decision-making process. The former had a penalty decision overturned in the match against Senegal while the latter had one of the goals of the tournament from striker Mama Balde ruled out for a perceived infringement much to the consternation of the Djurtus.

However the biggest controversy of the tournament came in the match between Tunisia and Mali. Referee Janny Sikazwe one of the continent’s most respected referees made a series of bizarre decisions late in the second half of that encounter.

First he called a late water break then signalled for added time with 11 minutes left on the clock before blowing the final whistle in the 86th minute awarded a red card and ran past the VAR screen when asked to review the incident before blowing the final whistle again prematurely.

It was a strange episode that prompted Tunisia – 0-1 down at that time – to file a petition with CAF for a replay.

It was summarily rejected and the decision upheld.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWWh0dHBzOi8vb2x5bXBpY3MuY29tL2VuL25ld3MvYXNpYW4tbWVuLWhhbmRiYWxsLWNoYW1waW9uc2hpcC0yMDIyLWluZGlhLXZzLXZpZXRuYW0tcmVzdWx00gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Asian men's handball championship 2022: India lose 38-33 to Vietnam,"India lost 38-33 to Vietnam in Group III of the main round at the Asian handball championship 2022 in Al Qatif Saudi Arabia on Saturday.

How the match played out

Chattogram Challengers brought down the very experienced Minister Group Dhaka by 30 runs to round off a thrilling second day in the BPL. Nasum Ahmed 's superb figures of 3 for 9 scripted Dhaka's doom including Andre Russell's wicket before he could get going in the chase of 162.

Left-arm quick Shoriful Islam mopped up the lower order with career-best T20 figures of 4 for 34 as Dhaka were bowled out for 131 in 19.5 overs. Chattogram had put on a competitive 161 for 8 in 20 overs with the English pair of Will Jacks and Benny Howell providing big hits at either ends of the innings.

Dhaka were unable to take advantage of a good start provided by Tamim Iqbal 's 42nd and second straight T20 half-century. Instead Shoriful and Nasum engineered a collapse by sharing seven wickets in their eight overs.

Big hit

Two big overs helped Chattogram knock over Dhaka. Shoriful took out Tamim for 52 and Jahurul Islam in the space of three balls in the 12th over. Nasum then removed Mohammad Naim and Dhaka captain Mahmudullah in the 14th over and Dhaka had slipped from 73 for 1 to 83 for 5 in the space of three overs.

Nasum then took out Russell in his last over. A big hit was palpable but when Russell mistimed a hoick and Shamim Hossain stayed calm under the skier for his third catch.

Chattogram got an early boost when Jacks struck 41 off 24 balls with six fours and two sixes over midwicket and square leg all within the first 7.4 overs. Howell added three sixes of his own one over long-on and two high over square leg towards the end of the innings in his 19-ball 37. Rubel Hossain  meanwhile made up for his poor figures in the first match this time taking 3 for 26.

Big miss

After being bizarrely run out on the tournament's opening day Russell had another day to forget. He conceded 17 runs in his only over before getting out for 12. He also dropped two catches. The only saving grace for Russell was the two good catches he held on to.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNwb3J0c2FkZGEuY29tL2Zvb3RiYWxsL2ZlYXR1cmVzL2JpZ2dlc3Qtd2luLWluLWZvb3RiYWxsLWhpc3RvcnnSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Biggest win in football history: Revisiting record matches,"The Australia women’s football team registered their biggest win in football history as they ran out 18-0 winners in their AFC Women’s Asian Cup match against Indonesia Women on Friday January 21.

Led by Chelsea star Sam Kerr the Matildas were 9-0 at half-time against their 94th-ranked opponents. Kerr’s five goals saw her go past Tim Cahill as Australia’s all-time leading goalscorer as her side opened their Asian Cup account in style.

Speaking of the biggest win in football history the record lies with Madagascar club AS Adema who registered an unprecedented 149-0 win against Stade Olympique L’Emyrne in a 2002 Madagascar National Football Championship match.

As a matter of fact all goals in the 149-0 win were deliberate own goals by SOE players as part of a predetermined protest over refereeing decisions that cost them the national championship.

At the end of the fixture the SO L’Emyrne coach Zaka Be along with four of the team’s players were suspended. While the coach got a three-year suspension the players were banned until the end of the season.

Australia hold the record for the biggest win in international football history as they humbled American Samoa 31-0 in an Oceanian qualifying match for the 2002 FIFA World Cup. Australia's Archie Thompson found the net 13 times and thus registered the most goals scored by a player in an international match.

In women's football the honour for the biggest win in football history goes to Canada Women. Taking on Puerto Rico in the 1998 CONCACAF Women’s Championship Canada registered a 21-0 win with forward Silvana Burtini scoring eight goals in the fixture.

Coming to the biggest win in Premier League history the record is shared between two teams - Manchester United (1995 2021) and Leicester City (2019). The first was achieved by Sir Alex Ferguson’s Red Devils in the 1994–95 Premier League season as they beat second-from-bottom Ipswich Town by 9-0 with striker Andy Cole becoming the first in Premier League history to score five goals in one game.

9-0 - On this day in 1995 Manchester United beat Ipswich Town 9-0 in the Premier League at Old Trafford. Andrew Cole scored five of these goals during the rout with United becoming the first team to score as many as nine goals in a Premier League match. Cloud. pic.twitter.com/6dkt4upxUj — OptaJoe (@OptaJoe) March 4 2021

Leicester City matched the record as they plundered nine goals past Southampton in their 2019 league meeting. Jamie Vardy and Ayoze Perez scored hat-tricks in the goal fest game as they matched the feat of a team having two hat-trick scorers in the same match (Robert Pires and Jermaine Pennant Arsenal 6-1 Southampton May 2003).

Southampton unfortunately had to relive the heart-quenching once again as they were at the mercy of Manchester United in their 2021 showdown at Old Trafford. Just one minute and 22 seconds into the match the Saints were reduced to 10 men after Alexandre Jankewitz’s tackle on Scott McTominay.

Seven players - including a brace from Anthony Martial - saw Ole Gunnar Solskjaer’s Manchester United match their biggest win in Premier League history.

Lastly the biggest win in football history by an Indian team came about in 2015 when FC Goa thumped Mumbai City FC by 7-0 in their Indian Super League match at the Jawaharlal Nehru Stadium in Goa.

Forwards Semboi Haokip and Dudu netted hat-tricks as the Gaurs exacted revenge for the 0-2 loss in the reverse fixture earlier in the campaign. The result continues to remain the biggest winning margin in the ISL.

Graeme McCormick who stood to become SNP president in 2023 earlier claimed he could gather the 100 signatures needed from 20 different party branches to mount a challenge for the leadership.

However McCormick’s decision not to pursue a leadership bid leaves Swinney the former deputy first minister of Scotland as the only official candidate after Humza Yousaf announced he is stepping down. The deadline for nominations is noon on Monday.

McCormick said he reached the nomination threshold of 100 signatures but chose to back Swinney after a “lengthy and fruitful conversation” and said this could be a “fresh start”.

In a statement on Sunday night he said: “John and I agreed the challenges which the SNP our government and our people face and explored new thinking on a range of issues which I am confident as they are advanced will inspire activists both within the SNP and wider independence movement in the following weeks and months.

“This is a fresh start for our members and our politicians and I’m sure that John’s determination to deliver independence will be rewarded at the forthcoming general election.

“I have therefore concluded that I shall not proceed with my nomination for party leader but instead support John Swinney’s nomination for party leader and first minister of Scotland.”

McCormick’s supporters had argued it would have been undemocratic for the party’s leader to win an unopposed coronation and insist that Swinney ought to face a contest. He won applause from hardliners when he denounced the SNP’s caution over mounting a second independence referendum without Westminster’s approval as “flatulence in a trance” during last year’s party conference.

One of McCormick’s backers Iain Lawson earlier attacked Swinney for criticising the planned challenge and in another post accused Swinney of being entitled and “raging” that an ordinary member was going up against him.

Swinney who described himself as the candidate to unite the party after a “difficult” few years said an election contest would delay the SNP’s essential rebuild. But he signalled he would win any potential contest telling Sky News that party members “probably know the outcome” between the two potential candidates.

His call for SNP members to realise the urgency of the need to restore public confidence in the party was underlined by a poll by Norstat for Sunday Times Scotland which said support for the party in a Westminster election had slumped to 29%.

The poll the first to be carried out since Yousaf suddenly quit last week put Labour on 34% and the Scottish Conservatives on 16%. Those figures suggest the SNP could lose 28 Westminster seats a fall from 43 MPs at present to 15. Labour which has only two Scottish seats would win 28.

Once Swinney is named the next SNP leader he will have to win a subsequent vote in Holyrood later in the week to become Scotland’s first minister.

The SNP said it does not comment on such matters.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMif2h0dHBzOi8vc3RlZWxlcnNkZXBvdC5jb20vMjAyNC8wNS9oZXMtYW4tdWx0cmEtZXhwZXJpZW5jZWQtZnJlYWstYnJldHQta29sbG1hbm4tbmFtZXMtbWFzb24tbWNjb3JtaWNrLWJlc3Qtc3RlZWxlcnMtdmFsdWUtcGljay_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,'He's An Ultra-Experienced Freak': Brett Kollmann Names Mason McCormick Best Steelers' Value Pick,"Adblocker is on ×

It means the party will avoid a three-week leadership contest which would have been triggered had Mr McCormick not stepped aside and received the required 100 nominations.

Assuming there are no last-minute challengers the leadership bid will not have to be put to SNP members and Mr Swinney is likely to become Scotland's next first minister as early as Tuesday.

Barring a bombshell - Swinney will become leader today Connor Gillies Scotland correspondent @ConnorGillies The SNP establishment is quietly breathing a sigh of relief after a wildcard challenger pulled the plug. Grassroots member Graeme McCormick has been a thorn in the side of the party hierarchy for a long time but the truth is he never stood a chance of becoming leader. Apparently he was gathering the required 100 signatures from party members on his clipboard at an independence rally in Glasgow on Saturday. It doesn't get more grassroots than that. His move to trigger a contest would have delayed the inevitable Swinney win but it would have forced the party to spend three weeks having another internal debate. It would have been difficult (and embarrassing) for Mr Swinney and co as they try and pull a divided party back together. Mr McCormick told Sky News he had a discussion with Mr Swinney on Sunday and it seems the pair came to some sort of agreement. Many will see this as a small diplomatic win for the incoming first minister as he uses soft power to spare the SNP’s blushes. Barring a bombshell Mr Swinney will become leader tomorrow and first minister of Scotland on Tuesday as Humza Yousaf packs his bags and heads for the same door he kicked the Greens out of a few weeks ago.

Who is John Swinney?

What direction will the SNP take?

Earlier on Sunday Mr Swinney warned potential challengers from entering the race saying it would delay the party from ""rebuilding"".

""My bid to become SNP leader has received very very comprehensive support within the SNP. I have sent out a message which is about unifying the SNP to strengthen our party and win Scottish independence"" he told Sky's Trevor Phillips.

""I think that is necessary as the SNP is not as cohesive today as the party needs to be and my campaign has attracted very wide support.

""So I think the SNP has got a chance to start rebuilding from the difficult period that we've had under my leadership and bluntly I would just like to get on with that as quickly as I can do because every day that we spend in an internal contest which I think we all probably know the outcome of we delay the ability for the SNP to start its rebuilding and I want to get on with that as quickly as I possibly can do.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMisgFodHRwczovL3d3dy5iZWhpbmR0aGVzdGVlbGN1cnRhaW4uY29tL3BpdHRzYnVyZ2gtc3RlZWxlcnMtcm9zdGVyLzIwMjQvNS82LzI0MTQ5ODc1L2NvdWxkLXN0ZWVsZXJzLWZvdXJ0aC1yb3VuZC1pb2wtbWFzb24tbWNjb3JtaWNrLWZpbmQtaGlzLXdheS10by10aGUtc3RhcnRpbmctbGluZXVwLWluLTIwMjQtbmZs0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Steelers rookie IOL Mason McCormick could find his way to the starting lineup in 2024,"The Steelers used their first two picks in the 2024 NFL Draft toward the continued overhaul of the offensive line by selecting tackle Troy Fautanu and center Zach Frazier. Along with last year’s first-round selection of tackle Broderick Jones and recent free-agent signings of starters James Daniels in 2022 and Isaac Seumalo in 2023 it seemed as though the job was complete. So when the Steelers were getting ready to make their fourth-round pick few were expecting it to be used on another offensive lineman.

Mason McCormick of South Dakota State would hear his name called with pick No. 119 and become the newest Steeler. Was this pick just meant to add depth or did the Steelers look past other obvious needs thinking they may have found a potential starter in McCormick? As a prospect McCormick was considered a versatile offensive lineman with the ability to play all five positions even though the 57 starts of his college career were spent exclusively at left guard. With the highest possible picks being used to select both tackles and a center over the past two drafts it would appear that McCormick’s fastest (only?) path to playing time is at guard. McCormick is most likely pushing someone off of the roster. Who might that be?

The Steelers rebuild their offensive line

In May of 2022 Omar Khan was named general manager of the Steelers and Andy Weidl was hired for the assistant GM job. Weidl has largely been credited with the push to rebuild the offensive line. Since their hiring Khan and Weidl have replaced every offensive lineman they inherited except left tackle Dan Moore and Daniels. Using back-to-back first-round picks on college left tackles demonstrates their desire to upgrade from Moore. In their first go-around at free agency they spent money on guards Seumalo and Nate Herbig. Both started their careers with the Eagles when Weidl was in the player personnel department in Philadelphia. Things looked solid with Daniels Seumalo and Herbig giving the Steelers three veteran players to man the two guard spots.

Just a month after spending that money the Steelers would use 4 of their 30 allowed pre-draft visits to meet with more guards. At the 2022 draft they would use a seventh-round pick on Spencer Anderson. Anderson like McCormick was touted to have the versatility to potentially play all five positions. He would make the final 53-man roster as a depth player on the interior as the Steelers had four players (Moore Jones Chuks Okorafor and Dylan Cook) make it specifically as tackles.

It doesn’t make enough sense to use a fourth-round pick on McCormick simply for more interior depth with Seumalo Daniels Herbig and Anderson already on the roster. It’s highly unlikely that the Steelers would keep all five. At tackle Moore is the only one with a season’s worth of experience. Jones and Fautanu are locks to make the final 53. Cook lacks experience and versatility but would the Steelers use a fourth-round pick just to replace the fourth tackle when Anderson already supplies that same ability?

Related Pittsburgh Steelers select Washington OT Troy Fautanu with 20th overall pick in 2024 NFL Draft

McCormick is most likely pushing someone off of the roster. Cook Herbig and Daniels are in the final years of their contracts but Daniels is the only one who wasn’t hand-picked by Khan and Weidl. Moving Daniels would create an additional $8.25 million in 2024 cap space. If the Steelers are happy with their alternatives it would make sense to include Daniels in a trade before the start of the season and it would make more sense out of drafting McCormick instead of addressing other needs.

By the end of training camp don’t be surprised if Daniels has a new home elsewhere. Even though it was against FCS competition don’t be shocked if McCormick’s 57 starts at guard are the reason why.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXGh0dHBzOi8vdGhlaGlsbC5jb20vaG9tZW5ld3MvY2FtcGFpZ24vNDYzMDQ2Ni1wZW5uc3lsdmFuaWEtc2VuYXRlLWJvYi1jYXNleS1kYXZpZC1tY2Nvcm1pY2sv0gFgaHR0cHM6Ly90aGVoaWxsLmNvbS9ob21lbmV3cy9jYW1wYWlnbi80NjMwNDY2LXBlbm5zeWx2YW5pYS1zZW5hdGUtYm9iLWNhc2V5LWRhdmlkLW1jY29ybWljay9hbXAv?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Casey leads GOP rival in Pennsylvania Senate race: Poll,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 429 Client Error: Unknown Error for url: https://thehill.com/homenews/campaign/4630466-pennsylvania-senate-bob-casey-david-mccormick/ on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXGh0dHBzOi8vdGhlaGlsbC5jb20vaG9tZW5ld3MvY2FtcGFpZ24vNDYzMDQ2Ni1wZW5uc3lsdmFuaWEtc2VuYXRlLWJvYi1jYXNleS1kYXZpZC1tY2Nvcm1pY2sv0gFgaHR0cHM6Ly90aGVoaWxsLmNvbS9ob21lbmV3cy9jYW1wYWlnbi80NjMwNDY2LXBlbm5zeWx2YW5pYS1zZW5hdGUtYm9iLWNhc2V5LWRhdmlkLW1jY29ybWljay9hbXAv?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen

You've got to have more ingenuity. Screenshot by ZDNet

The adjustments have been daily as have been the complaints.

The COVID-19 pandemic has affected moods behaviors and businesses in likely equal measure.

Yet on the surface fast food companies have done very well over the last few years. At one time it seemed like they were the only option.

They were certainly the best easiest and most familiar option.

But even McDonald's has its considerable problems and solving them won't exactly be simple.

Its CEO Chris Kempczinski took the route also taken recently by new Southwest CEO Robert Jordan -- he decided to be open about the issues.

In a bracing interview with the Wall Street Journal Kempczinski offered something of a litany of woes.

Customers now want a simpler more focused menu. Perhaps they're tired of thinking too much which would be understandable. Moreover in uncertain times the familiar becomes the necessary.

Yet younger customers want something more exciting. Because that's what it says on the Being Young membership card.

Moreover personalization has become a considerable need want and habit among many customers in many spheres.

Which is where technology comes in. Or in the case of McDonald's doesn't -- as much as the company would like.

McDonald's has been making many investments in technology. It's been testing such delights as robot drive-thrus.

But Kempczinski confessed the human component to this was a little more difficult.

In the Wall Street Journal's words: ""Mr. Kempczinski said he thinks a lot about how to attract talent particularly corporate employees who can improve the burger company's technological abilities.""

There you were thinking there just aren't enough burger flippers. There aren't. But it seems there's also a lack of fine tech-minded leaders who can direct and implement tech advancements.

Tech-minded people who can get things done are in extremely high demand even if some data shows that there may be a marginal cooling in the ardor. Some data that is.

Other data suggests many job vacancies in areas such as software engineering manager senior software engineer machine learning engineer and firmware engineer are staying open for more than 60 days.

Some might say McDonald's was a touch slow at seeing the impact that technology can bring.

But though Kempczinski didn't specifically expand on the sorts of tech-minded employees he was looking for he did expose this again in the Wall Street Journal's words: ""McDonald's needs to be a fun place to work he said offer jobs that people want and take care of workers.""

He may have been referring primarily to those who populate a McDonald's franchise every day evening and night.

Tech-minded types are though (somewhat) just like any other humans. The pandemic has made them too wonder about the quality of their lives and the things that are truly important. They have more options. And McDonald's has endured its own little scandals.

So here is something of a traditional company understanding that it needs to invest heavily in innovation and suddenly finding itself in an extremely competitive jobs market. In every single sphere.

It's wise for Kempczinski to be open about the company's problems.

When you know you can't please your customers in the way that you'd like to they're more likely to be forgiving if you're honest than if you peddle an unreality.

Still though there remains the question of how quickly the company can ramp up its technological side -- just as the likes of Travis Kalanick and Chick-fil-A populate the land with tech-infused ghost kitchens.

It's heartening though to see fast food companies needing more humans instead of just robots.

Over time we may discover that without humans the robots are really quite ineffective.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMimwFodHRwczovL3dsb3MuY29tL25ld3MvbG9jYWwvbG9jYWwtbWNkb25hbGRzLW1hbmFnZXItcmVjZWl2ZXMtaW50ZXJuYXRpb25hbC1hd2FyZC1yZWNvZ25pemVkLWFtb25nLXRvcC0xLW9mLW1hbmFnZXJzLWFzaGxlaWdoLWJlcnJ5LWFzaGV2aWxsZS1yYXkta3JvYy1hd2FyZNIBnwFodHRwczovL3dsb3MuY29tL2FtcC9uZXdzL2xvY2FsL2xvY2FsLW1jZG9uYWxkcy1tYW5hZ2VyLXJlY2VpdmVzLWludGVybmF0aW9uYWwtYXdhcmQtcmVjb2duaXplZC1hbW9uZy10b3AtMS1vZi1tYW5hZ2Vycy1hc2hsZWlnaC1iZXJyeS1hc2hldmlsbGUtcmF5LWtyb2MtYXdhcmQ?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Local McDonald's manager receives international award recognized among top 1% of managers,"The general manager of a local McDonald's restaurant has been selected for an international award given to just the top 1% of the entire chain's general managers.

Healthcare Stocks Are Appealing in Any Market Environment

It's fair to say that the healthcare sector is one of the most intriguing areas of the market for investors to explore. After all a global pandemic has reminded the world of just how important quality medical care is. Healthcare spending in the U.S. accounted for over 19.7% of the country's GDP in 2020 and that number is expected to get even larger over the next decade. Naturally there will be plenty of companies that are able to take advantage of this growth which is why the sector is worth a look for new investment opportunities even during a period of elevated market volatility.

Investors might be in store for some very appealing buying opportunities in 2022 if January is any indication of how the year might unfold in markets and focusing on a sector like healthcare makes a lot of sense given how the industry will always see heavy spending regardless of economic conditions. That's why we've put together the following list of 3 great healthcare stocks to buy now. Let's take a closer look at these fantastic companies below.



McKesson Corp (NYSE: MCK)

If you're looking for one of the strongest stocks in the market look no further than McKesson Corp. The stock is roughly flat year-to-date while major indices are getting pummeled which tells investors that it's showing a lot of relative strength. McKesson is the largest distributor of pharmaceuticals in the U.S. and also distributes medical-surgical supplies an intriguing business model that is poised to deliver double-digit adjusted EPS growth going forward. The company should see its pharmaceutical sales increase in 2022 thanks to higher prescription volumes as visits to primary care doctors get back to normal after the pandemic.

McKesson's management raised its forward guidance for FY22 last quarter and also delivered total revenues of $66.6 billion in Q2 up 9% year-over-year which are both signs of a healthy business. The bottom line here is that McKesson is a dominant force in the pharmaceutical industry with plenty of upside for long-term shareholders to consider and the fact that the stock price is barely being impacted by the current market weakness speaks volumes about the quality of this company.



HCA Healthcare Inc (NYSE: HCA)

HCA Healthcare is an underrated healthcare company that has come out of the pandemic a more efficient business which is why it should be on your shopping list at this time. As one of the largest hospital companies in the United States HCA has the leading market share in some of the largest areas in the country including Texas and Florida. The company has focused on improving its cost structure over the last few years which is a move that should pay off over the long term in the form of improved margins. There's also a good chance HCA will benefit from a rebound in elective procedures going forward which is another strong reason to consider adding shares.

The company delivered its fourth straight quarterly earnings beat back in October which saw HCA deliver EPS of $4.57 up from $1.92 in 2020 on revenue of $15.3 billion up 15% year-over-year. The company will announce its Q4 results on January 27th and could be gearing up for another strong report so keep an eye on the market's reaction to those numbers towards the end of the month. With the stock heading closer to testing the 200-day moving average investors might want to consider the recent weakness in this leading health care services provider as an intriguing opportunity to scoop up shares.

Merck & Co (NYSE: MRK)

If you're interested in exposure to a leading biopharmaceutical company that pays a very appealing dividend Merck & Co is a solid option to consider. The company's major drugs include treatments in oncology and diabetes and Merck also produces vaccines and animal health medications rounding out a diverse portfolio of products. The company's COVID-19 antiviral pill Molnupiravir has been granted emergency use authorization for the treatment of mild-to-moderate coronavirus disease and it will be interesting to see if it becomes a big winner for the company.

Merck has also announced an agreement to acquire Acceleron which is a biotech firm that develops therapies for serious and rare diseases. This move improves Merck's pipeline of new drugs and its cardiovascular disease treatment portfolio and should certainly be viewed as a positive from long-term investors. It's also worth noting that the company has been delivering strong earnings recently including Q3 adjusted EPS of $1.75 up 28% year-over-year. Finally the fact that Merck stock offers investors a 3.42% dividend yield makes it a top pick in the sector.",,,,,,,,,,,,

A deep dive into Amgen’s experimental obesity drug MariTide

There so much buzz around Amgen’s experimental obesity drug MariTide. The company simply saying it was “very encouraged” about interim Phase 2 data led to a 12% spike in Amgen’s stock — even though no new data were shared. STAT’s Elaine Chen answers some hot questions about the closely watched injectable.

Early data show MariTide a monoclonal antibody drug could potentially offer more profound weight loss than other treatments on the market. But it’s already difficult to manufacture peptide drugs like Wegovy and Zepbound — and antibodies are more complex molecules.

Although Novo and Lilly’s stocked dropped a little on Friday the companies are dominating the space and it’d be hard for competitors to catch up. The two companies are also developing next-generation candidates that are further ahead than MariTide. So even if other companies have strong contenders in the obesity space they’d be years away from an FDA approval and “so far behind [Novo and Lilly] that it’s still going to probably be hard to see how they catch up” one analyst said.

Studying stem cells and cancer in low Earth orbit

Turns out the microgravity of low Earth orbit allows scientists to study cancer growth at an accelerated clip. Catriona Jamieson of UCSD’s Sanford Stem Cell Institute is working with NASA to send tumors and stem cells into space — ferried aboard SpaceX and Axiom-3 flights to the International Space Station. STAT’s Nicholas St. Fleur chatted with Jamieson about why aging and oncology could potentially be better understood so far away from our planet.

She was inspired by a 2019 NASA study that showed that after 340 days in space astronaut Scott Kelly came back 2 inches taller than his earthbound twin.

“But then I noticed he had inversions and translocations in his chromosomes. His chromosomes were kind of mixed up in the immune cells which can happen if you have preleukemic conditions developing in your blood so that doesn’t look good” she said. “I thought maybe space is a way to understand stem cell aging when it starts to be premalignant and fully malignant but in an abbreviated time frame.”

Former Spark CTO suing for alleged discrimination

The former chief technical officer of Spark Therapeutics alleges she experienced discrimination and sexism while working there the Philadelphia Business Journal writes. Cynthia Pussinen led nearly 400 employees in Spark’s technical development and operations unit from February 2021 to December 2022.

Pussinen said she faced “repeated and ongoing acts and practices of sex discrimination by some of her male peers and colleagues most notably by Federico Mingozzi” who was the company’s chief scientific officer before leaving this past November. The lawsuit said that CEO Ron Philip allegedly told Pussinen in March 2022 that he was aware of Mingozzi’s “mistreatment” of women. But instead of sanctioning him she alleges Philip told her to “make it work” because everyone but Mingozzi is “expendable” and that “we need him more than he needs us.”

Pussinen who is now CEO of a small regenerative medicine company called Sernova is seeking unspecified economic damages along with compensatory damages for pain and suffering and emotional distress.

Merck may have a competition for ever-scarce BCG

There’s long been a global shortage of the BCG vaccine which has long been used to treat bladder cancer. This may change as FiercePharma points out. A couple of weeks back ImmunityBio won FDA approval for Anktiva an immunotherapy that’s meant to be used along with the BCG vaccine to treat patients with bladder cancer. Now ImmunityBio has partnered with the Serum Institute of India to manufacture BCG globally.

ImmunityBio framed it in a press release as “a long-term solution to chronic BCG supply shortage issues” and intends to produce the treatment “at large scale” so it can be used in combination with Anktiva. Merck has been the only U.S. purveyor of BCG since 2012 after Sanofi and another competitor bowed out due to manufacturing issues. In 2020 Merck laid out plans to boost BCG production but that will likely not come to fruition until at least next year. It’s been rationing BCG since 2019.

Merck on Thursday reported first-quarter revenue and adjusted earnings that topped expectations as it posted strong sales of its blockbuster cancer drug Keytruda and vaccine products.

The pharmaceutical giant also raised and narrowed its full-year revenue and adjusted earnings forecasts. Merck now expects 2024 sales to come in between $63.1 billion and $64.3 billion up from previous guidance of $62.7 to $64.2 billion.

The company expects full-year adjusted earnings of $8.53 to $8.65 per share up from its prior forecast of $8.44 to $8.59 per share.

That outlook includes a one-time charge of roughly 26 cents per share related to Merck's acquisition of Harpoon Therapeutics in January. The company develops immune-based cancer drugs. The guidance also includes a negative impact of 30 cents per share from foreign exchange changes.

Shares of Merck rose 4% on Thursday following the results.

Here is what Merck reported for the first quarter compared with what Wall Street was expecting based on a survey of analysts by LSEG:

Earnings per share: $2.07 adjusted vs. $1.88 expected

$2.07 adjusted vs. $1.88 expected Revenue: $15.78 billion vs. $15.20 billion expected

The company posted a net income of $4.76 billion or $1.87 per share for the first quarter. That compares with a net income of $2.82 billion or $1.11 per share during the year-earlier period.

Excluding acquisition and restructuring costs Merck earned $2.07 per share for the first quarter. Both adjusted and nonadjusted profit for the period include the charge related to the Harpoon deal.

Merck raked in $15.78 billion in revenue for the quarter up 9% from the same period a year ago.

Those results come as Merck shows substantial progress in preparing for Keytruda's patent expiration in 2028. The loss of exclusive rights to the drug will likely cause sales to fall forcing the company to draw revenue from elsewhere.

But Merck has a handful of new deals under its belt and key drug launches that will help it offset those losses. That includes Winrevair a medication approved in the U.S. last month to treat a progressive and life-threatening lung condition. Some analysts expect that worldwide sales of Winrevair could reach $5 billion by 2030.

Merck is seeing ""high interest"" in Winrevair from patient groups and a range of prescribers and is making ""good progress"" in enabling access to the drug Chief Financial Officer Caroline Litchfield said during an earnings call Thursday. Several payers have already established coverage policies for the drug she noted.

""We have confidence in a successful launch of Winrevair consistent with our prior expectations and look forward to providing updates on our progress"" Litchfield said.

Merck is also cutting costs under a new restructuring program it announced in February. Those efforts aim to improve the manufacturing network of both its pharmaceutical division and animal health business.

The company recorded charges of $246 million related to restructuring in the first quarter which are excluded from its adjusted results.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMihwFodHRwczovL3d3dy5yZXV0ZXJzLmNvbS9idXNpbmVzcy9oZWFsdGhjYXJlLXBoYXJtYWNldXRpY2Fscy9tZXJjay1yYWlzZXMtMjAyNC1wcm9maXQtZm9yZWNhc3Qtc3Ryb25nLWNhbmNlci1ocHYtZHJ1Z3Mtc2FsZXMtMjAyNC0wNC0yNS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Merck raises 2024 profit forecast on surging sales of cancer drug Keytruda,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 401 Client Error: HTTP Forbidden for url: https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/merck-raises-2024-profit-forecast-strong-cancer-hpv-drugs-sales-2024-04-25/ on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMihwFodHRwczovL3d3dy5yZXV0ZXJzLmNvbS9idXNpbmVzcy9oZWFsdGhjYXJlLXBoYXJtYWNldXRpY2Fscy9tZXJjay1yYWlzZXMtMjAyNC1wcm9maXQtZm9yZWNhc3Qtc3Ryb25nLWNhbmNlci1ocHYtZHJ1Z3Mtc2FsZXMtMjAyNC0wNC0yNS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiR2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm55dGltZXMuY29tLzIwMjQvMDQvMTgvaGVhbHRoL2hwdi12YWNjaW5lLWFmcmljYS1tZXJjay5odG1s0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Millions of Girls in Africa Will Miss HPV Shots After Merck Production Problem,"Nearly 1.5 million teenage girls in some of the world’s poorest countries will miss the chance to be protected from cervical cancer because the drugmaker Merck has said it will not be able to deliver millions of promised doses of the HPV vaccine this year.

Merck has notified Gavi the international organization that helps low- and middle-income countries deliver lifesaving immunizations and UNICEF which procures the vaccines that it will deliver only 18.8 million of the 29.6 million doses it was contracted to deliver in 2024 Gavi said.

That means that more than 10 million girls will not receive their expected HPV shots this year — and 1.5 million of them most likely will never get them because they will be too old to qualify for the vaccine in subsequent years.

Patrick Ryan a spokesman for Merck said the company “experienced a manufacturing disruption” that required it to hold and reinspect many doses by hand. He declined to give further details about the cause of the delay."

A woman in Connecticut is suing Meta and Snap alleging their platforms played a role in her 11-year-old's suicide.

Tammy Rodriguez claims her daughter killed herself in July after ""struggling with the harmful effects of social media.""

In a filing Rodriguez said her daughter had an ""extreme addiction"" to Instagram and Snapchat for more than two years.

A Connecticut mother is suing Meta the company formerly known as Facebook and Snap alleging their ""dangerous and defective social media products"" played a role in her 11-year-old daughter's suicide.

The complaint filed by Tammy Rodriguez in San Francisco federal court earlier this week claims Selena Rodriguez suffered from depression sleep deprivation eating disorders and self-harm tied to her use of Instagram and Snapchat.

According to the filing Selena began using social media roughly two years before her death by suicide in July 2021 during which time she developed ""an extreme addiction to Instagram and Snapchat."" The filing also claims the 11-year-old missed school multiple times because of her social media use and that she was asked to send sexually explicit content by male users on both platforms.

Rodriguez wrote in the filing that she attempted to get her daughter mental health treatment several times with one outpatient therapist saying she had ""never seen a patient as addicted to social media as Selena."" At one point Selena was hospitalized for emergency psychiatric care according to the complaint.

In a statement Snap said it couldn't comment on the specifics of an active case but told Insider ""nothing is more important to us than the wellbeing of our community.""

""We are devastated to hear of Selena's passing and our hearts go out to her family"" a Snap spokesperson told Insider. ""Snapchat helps people communicate with their real friends without some of the public pressure and social comparison features of traditional social media platforms and intentionally makes it hard for strangers to contact young people.""

The spokesperson continued: ""We work closely with many mental health organizations to provide in-app tools and resources for Snapchatters as part of our ongoing work to keep our community safe.""

Meta and lawyers for Rodriguez did not respond to requests for comment.

Internal Facebook documents leaked to The Wall Street Journal last year revealed the company is aware Instagram can be harmful to the mental health of teenagers with one document stating that ""32% of teen girls said that when they felt bad about their bodies Instagram made them feel worse.""

Karina Newton Instagram's head of public policy wrote in a September blog post that the Journal's story ""focuses on a limited set of findings and casts them in a negative light.""

In other documents retrieved by Facebook whistleblower Frances Haugen the company found 13.5% of teen girls said Instagram makes thoughts of suicide worse while 17% of teen girls said Instagram exacerbates eating disorders.

After Haugen gave an interview with ""60 Minutes"" about the findings Facebook previously issued this response: ""It is not accurate that leaked internal research demonstrates Instagram is 'toxic' for teen girls. The research actually demonstrated that many teens we heard from feel that using Instagram helps them when they are struggling with the kinds of hard moments and issues teenagers have always faced. This research like external research on these issues found teens report having both positive and negative experiences with social media.""







Earlier this month Angela Underwood Jacobs the sister of a federal officer killed last year sued Meta alleging the company ""knowingly promoting extremist content"" that contributed to her brother's death.

Selena Rodriguez died by suicide on July 21 2021. In the two years leading up to her death her mother Tammy did everything she could to quell her child’s intense dependence on social media. She brought her to a therapist and on one occasion she went as far as confiscating all of Selena’s electronic devices but the girl only ran away so she could continue to use the popular platforms.

(File) A Connecticut mother has filed a lawsuit against two social media giants accusing them of tactics that helped to fuel her 11-year-old daughter’s addiction to Instagram and Snapchat which ultimately resulted in her suicide.

On Thursday the mourning mother filed a wrongful-death lawsuit against Meta Platforms Inc the parent company of Facebook and Instagram and Snap Inc. which operates Snapchat claiming they are responsible for Selena’s suicide. Despite being too young to be on either platform per their terms of service — both Instagram and Snapchat have a minimum age of 13 — Selena was able to create her accounts due to a lack of adequate safety measures like parental controls and age verification checks.

“[The] defendants intentionally created an attractive nuisance to young children but failed to provide adequate safeguards from the harmful effects they knew were occurring on their wholly owned and controlled digital premises” the lawsuit said.

While using Instagram Selena was constantly solicited for sexually exploitive content according to a press release from Seattle-based law firm the Social Media Victims Law Center. She ultimately succumbed to the peer pressure and sent the images through Snapchat which were later leaked and passed around among her classmates.

“As a result Selena was hospitalized for emergency psychiatric care and experienced worsening depression poor self-esteem eating disorders self-harm and ultimately suicide” the statement reads.

The lawsuit comes amid increased scrutiny for social media companies prompted in part by allegations from former Facebook product manager Frances Haugen who said the company promoted profit over user safety.

“Meta Platforms and Snap knowingly and purposefully designed manufactured marketed and sold social media products that were unreasonably dangerous because they were designed to be addictive to minor users” according to the SMVL statement.

A spokesperson for Snap in response to the litigation told the Washington Post it was dedicated to keeping its users safe.

“We are devastated to hear of Selena’s passing and our hearts go out to her family. While we can’t comment on the specifics of active litigation nothing is more important to us than the wellbeing of our community” a Snap spokesperson said.

“In fact Snapchat helps people communicate with their real friends without some of the public pressure and social comparison features of traditional social media platforms and intentionally makes it hard for strangers to contact young people.”

Federal Protective Service Officer Dave Underwood was allegedly shot by Steven Carrillo an alleged extremist on May 29 2020 outside the federal courthouse in Oakland. That day protests were taking place in the city over the death of George Floyd.

Underwood's sister Angela Jacobs filed the suit in Alameda County Superior Court.

""We believe and intend to show that Facebook's conduct has led to a rise in extremism throughout the world and acts of real-world violence including the murder of Officer Underwood"" attorney Ted Leopold said in a statement. ""It is time that Facebook is finally held accountable for its actions.""

Dave Underwood slain federal security guard

Meta says the legal claim is baseless.

""We've banned more than 1000 militarized social movements from our platform and work closely with experts to address the broader issue of internet radicalization"" Meta spokesman Kevin McAlister said. ""These claims are without legal basis.""

Jacobs' attorneys allege that Meta allowed users to connect to extremist groups and promoted divisive inflammatory and untrue content leading to the slaying of Underwood.

When he was shot Underwood was providing security at the courthouse as protests were taking place over the killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis.

Carrillo allegedly shot Underwood in a drive-by shooting while alleged accomplice Robert Justus Jr. was driving.

Jacobs' attorneys allege that Carrillo and Justus identify as part of the Boogaloo movement. That movement aims to incite ""a violent uprising against perceived government tyranny"" according to federal prosecutors.

Jacobs' attorneys allege the shooting was not a random act. Rather the two men allegedly hatched and planned it on Facebook after connecting in a Boogaloo Facebook group via the company's algorithms.

Justus turned himself in at the FBI office in San Francisco on June 11 2020. He allegedly admitted to driving the white van Carrillo shot out of to kill Underwood and injure a second officer.

Justus allegedly told investigators he met Carrillo on Facebook and the two arranged to meet earlier on May 29 to go to protests taking place in Oakland.

A federal complaint said Justus said he ""did not want to participate in the murder but that he felt that he had to participate because he was trapped in the van with Carrillo.""

However the FBI obtained records from Carrillo's Facebook account that showed him talking about the ongoing protests being ""a great opportunity to target the specialty soup bois"" an apparent reference to federal agencies with various ""alphabet soup"" acronyms.

Justus responded with a comment ""Lets boogie"" according to the complaint.

Jacobs' attorneys also allege that by promoting inflammatory content and groups users stay engaged and active on Facebook and that improves ad sales for the company.

Facebook in recent years has tried to increase membership in groups Jacobs' attorneys allege.

Also the company knowingly did not warn its users of the role its algorithms play in enhancing extremist content Jacobs' attorneys say.

Or the effect that the content and groups like the Boogaloo have on promoting extremism including violent extremism.

Jacobs is seeking all economic and non-economic damages available including punitive damages.

Carrillo is also accused of killing Santa Cruz County sheriff's Sgt. Damon Gutzwiller eight days after the shooting of Underwood.

Think Again,"by Nina Valerio

Last year we heard a lot about how people wanted to opt out of the new WA Cares Fund program and how the program isn’t perfect. Well now our legislators are moving quickly to pass two bills that will strengthen and improve this program — the first of its kind in the nation — to provide flexible affordable benefits to help workers pay for long-term care when the time comes that they need it.

“The WA Cares Fundsm is a new fund to which we all contribute while we are working and through which we can access long-term care when we need it.” —WA Cares Fund website

It is concerning me greatly to hear opponents of the program point to private insurance policies as the better alternative. As someone fighting tooth and nail to get the benefits we paid for from our corporate long-term care policy I strongly urge my fellow Washingtonians to take a “buyer beware” attitude when relying on corporate long-term care policies to be there when you need benefits.

No matter what your age or circumstance we should all accept the truth that there’s a good chance we will need help at some point in our lives with daily living tasks like getting dressed bathing doing errands and managing medication. Or we may want the option to get paid when we have to take time off or quit a job to take care of a family member who needs us.

For those who choose to opt out of the WA Cares Fund I can tell you that the private market is not reliable. Long-term care insurance companies often take advantage of vulnerable people: They use scare tactics raise premiums by exorbitant amounts deny or delay benefits cancel policies and keep the thousands of dollars consumers paid in premiums for their policies.

My husband and I are retired professors who bought MetLife policies over 20 years ago and continue to pay into them today. Joseph is gravely ill (multiple myeloma sudden right-eye blindness cognitive impairment with memory loss prostate cancer) and I am his caregiver. We don’t know how much time we have left. MetLife has denied or delayed our benefits at every turn. They limit home care aides to no more than four hours (less than $150) a day. My husband’s benefits total over $323000. He automatically pays for his annual ever-increasing premium without lapses. I have the same insurance myself. Joe’s illnesses are tragic and our lives have been turned upside down. A caregiver’s responsibilities are enormous and the way MetLife has treated us makes us feel completely overwhelmed angry and powerless.

We learned from an S&P Global Market Intelligence report that the CEO of MetLife has an annual salary of $14 million while policyholders like us are facing the need to sell our home and downsize in order to pay for the care we need and while the company holds onto the thousands of dollars in premiums we paid into our policy. If we miss even one payment I was told by our client case coordinator our policy will be permanently canceled and all the premiums they have collected will stay with the insurance company.

A recent analysis found more than 800 complaints were filed against long-term care insurance companies with the Washington State Office of the Insurance Commissioner in just the past few years. Almost half were for delaying or denying benefits like in-home care and nursing home stays. Another third were for premium hikes of 30% 90% even 300%. Consumers need a way to hold these companies accountable now. That’s why I am joining with fellow consumers who have been wronged by insurance companies to ask our State Attorney General Bob Ferguson to investigate the practices of these companies.

The State’s new public long-term care benefit is sure to be more reliable and affordable than corporate insurance companies that can deny or cancel coverage for no reason jack up premiums or just go out of business with no notice. Experts including our own Insurance Commissioner Mike Kreidler are warning it’s not a matter of if but when the big long-term care insurance carriers will go insolvent. Consumers may well find themselves without benefits when they need them most even if they did everything right.

The WA Cares Fund will ensure workers have a safety net to tap into when they need care which I can promise most of us will need at one time or another. Just as we pay into Medicare and Social Security so it’s there for us when we need it it’s smart for workers to pay into a program that will be there for them when they need help caring for themselves or their loved ones — whether they have dementia diabetes or a broken hip. This kind of longer-term personal care is not covered by health insurance or Medicare and is denied by many private long-term care insurance policies.

I wish a reliable affordable public option like WA Cares had been around when Joe and I were still working. Washington can be a model for the nation creating a universal long-term care coverage system and fixing a broken long-term-care insurance industry.

Explaining WR's beef with Bruce Arians follow-up comments,"Vontae Davis locked up the fictional award for ""Most bizarre exit from an NFL game"" when he retired in the middle of a 2018 contest between the Bills and Chargers. He simply pulled himself out of the game saying in a statement he came to the realization he ""shouldn't be out there anymore.""

Well Antonio Brown somehow managed to top him this season. In the third quarter of the Buccaneers' Week 17 game against the Jets the seven-time Pro Bowler removed his jersey and pads jogged to the locker room and never returned to the field. Tampa Bay coach Bruce Arians told reporters after the Jan. 2 game that Brown would no longer be a member of the team and the Bucs made Brown's release official a few days after the game.

Needless to say there was a lot to digest with the incident — and the follow-up comments from Brown and the Buccaneers organization only complicated the situation. SN looks back at Brown's outburst and the aftermath.

Antonio Brown leaves Buccaneers-Jets game

Brown's meltdown came late in the third quarter with the Bucs facing a 24-10 deficit. The 33-year-old was visibly frustrated and got into a heated discussion with Mike Evans. Despite his best efforts Evans couldn't bring down the temperature on the sideline.

In a shocking move Brown removed his jersey and pads and then ripped off his undershirt and gloves. He tossed his undershirt and gloves into the crowd before jogging across the field toward Tampa Bay's locker room. He threw up a peace sign to the fans in attendance at MetLife Stadium and disappeared into the tunnel.

At the time of Brown's exit the Buccaneers' offensive unit was driving down the field. It scored a touchdown on that possession and Tampa Bay ultimately won 28-24. Brown finished with three catches on five targets for 26 yards.

Why did Antonio Brown leave the game?

This is where things get a little bit murky.

Brown claims he was ""cut"" by the Buccaneers because he refused to play with an ankle injury. In a statement released through his attorney Brown said Arians ordered him to take the field and when he told Arians he wasn't able to play with the injury Arians replied ""You're done!""

BUCS' WR DEPTH CHART: Roles change with Godwin out Brown gone

""I know we were losing to the Jets and that was frustrating for all of us. But I could not make football plays on that ankle"" Brown said. ""Yes I walked off the field. But there's a major difference between launching from the line and taking hits compared to jogging off the field with a rush of emotions going through your mind. I am reflecting on my reaction but there was a trigger.

""The trigger was someone telling me that I'm not allowed to feel pain. I acknowledge my past. But my past does not make me a second-class citizen. My past does not forfeit my right to be heard when I am in pain.""

The Bucs acknowledged Brown did receive treatment on his ankle and was listed on the injury report during the week but they asserted he was cleared to play. They also said Brown never indicated to the medical staff he could not play.

""At no point in time during that game did [Brown] ever ask the trainer or doctor about his ankle. He never went through — that's the normal protocol"" Arians said. ""You go through protocols during games. I was never notified of it.""

There is another element in play here though. Brown was reportedly close to earning three bonuses (for receptions receiving yards and receiving touchdowns) that would have paid out $333333 each. During an appearance on the ""I Am Athlete"" podcast former Tampa Bay running back LeSean McCoy said Brown was ""angry"" about his lack of targets. McCoy explained that Arians and Bucs offensive coordinator Byron Leftwich openly discussed player incentives in 2020 leading Brown to believe they would help him hit his 2021 season goals.

McCoy's full breakdown from the ""I Am Athlete Podcast"" podcast:

""[We're in] like Week 13 or 14 [Leftwich is] like 'Hey anybody got any incentives in your contract? If you do let me know. I'll get you your paper because I'm all about that.' ... One of the games Mike Evans was playing. We played Detroit. The year is over for real. We're good playoff berth and all that. Mike's out there trying to get 1000 yards. I say 'Yo I love this type of coach. I respect it.' [Arians is] cool with it. ""So let's fast forward. That's last year. So this year [Brown] is like 'Oh I see that. Oh that's what we're doing? So now I'm up. You know what I mean? I can't get my eight catches? Oh you're throwing the ball to these other people? You know what I'm saying?' I won't get into all the details because those are my boys. I'm not going to put all of their business out there. But he's like 'Yo you're throwing the ball to these other dudes? OK I'm hot. Man I'm hurt. I ain't going in.'""

Arians noted Brown was ""very upset"" at halftime about which receivers were being targeted but he said the players ""took care of that."" Arians also admitted he told Brown to ""get the f— out of here"" after Brown refused to re-enter the game.

Buccaneers official team statement

""The Tampa Bay Buccaneers have terminated the contract of Antonio Brown effective immediately"" the Bucs said in a statement released Jan. 6. ""While Antonio did receive treatment on his ankle and was listed on the injury report the week leading up to last Sunday's game he was cleared to play by our medical team prior to the start of the game and at no point during the game did he indicate to our medical personnel that he could not play.

""We have attempted multiple times throughout this week to schedule an evaluation by an outside orthopedic specialist yet Antonio has not complied. Maintaining the health and wellness of our players is of the utmost importance to our organization.""

How did Antonio Brown react?

Social media posts

On Jan. 6 Brown tweeted what appeared to be a conversation between him and Arians showing they had discussed Brown's ankle injury before the game.

""I'm all-in coach"" Brown said in the alleged text conversation. ""Really [can't] get to full speed. I wanna win wanna be there. [If] I wake up tomorrow [and] feel better I'll be ready.""

""Come see me [in] the morning"" Arians replied according to the screenshot. ""We'll talk it out. Definitely want you with us in case you're ready.""

Then Brown took aim at Brady and his longtime trainer Alex Guerrero sharing an alleged conversation he had with Guerrero regarding a financial issue. Brown asked Guerrero for half of the $100000 that he paid for services according to the screenshot and Guerrero asked where he should send the money.

""[Brady's] guy [Guerrero] charging me [$100000 and] never doing the work on me!"" Brown said in the Instagram caption. ""[How do you] even work [with] people like this!""

In another post Brown explained he was ultimately more upset with how the team handled his injury than any actions by his teammates.

""Don't get it twisted. My brothers have been good to me"" Brown tweeted. ""From Tom to practice squad we were a top-level unit. They have been good to me and knew nothing about my talks with coach last week. The team mishandled this situation. They let me down and more importantly my teammates.""

'Full Send' podcast

During a Jan. 7 interview on the ""Full Send"" podcast Brown reiterated he was dealing with an ankle injury saying a player has a right to tell his coach when he can't play. He also questioned the nature of his friendship with Brady and wondered why he wasn't being targeted like a true No. 1 receiver.

'I Am Athlete' podcast

Brown made his own appearance on the ""I Am Athlete"" podcast telling former NFL wide receiver Brandon Marshall that there is ""nothing wrong"" with his mental health. Brown had previously dismissed concerns about chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE) a degenerative disease found in those who have experienced repetitive brain trauma.

""Someone told me to get the f— out of here. I'm not passive-aggressive. . . . It's bigger than me because a lot of guys [are] going through this"" Brown said. ""How do you protect your mental health as a football player in regards to getting what you want? How do you do that?""

What will Antonio Brown do next?

Brown said he plans to undergo surgery on his ankle and play again next season though it is unclear if any teams have expressed interest in signing him.

""Once my surgery is complete I'll be back to 100 percent and looking forward to next season"" Brown said in the statement released through his attorney. ""Business gonna be boomin'!""

In 15 games with the Buccaneers Brown totaled 87 receptions for 1028 yards and eight touchdowns. He is No. 21 on the all-time receptions list (928) and No. 24 on the all-time receiving yards list (12291) and all-time receiving touchdowns list (83).",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiamh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRoYWthdHJpYnVuZS5jb20vc3BvcnQvY3JpY2tldC8yNjI0NDQvbXVzaGZpcXVyLXJhaGltLWJlY29tZXMtbWV0bGlmZS0zNjAtaGVhbHRoLWFwcCVFMiU4MCU5OXPSAW5odHRwczovL3d3dy5kaGFrYXRyaWJ1bmUuY29tL2FtcC9zcG9ydC9jcmlja2V0LzI2MjQ0NC9tdXNoZmlxdXItcmFoaW0tYmVjb21lcy1tZXRsaWZlLTM2MC1oZWFsdGgtYXBwJUUyJTgwJTk5cw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Mushfiqur Rahim becomes MetLife 360 health app’s health ambassador,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.dhakatribune.com/sport/cricket/262444/mushfiqur-rahim-becomes-metlife-360-health-app%E2%80%99s on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiamh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRoYWthdHJpYnVuZS5jb20vc3BvcnQvY3JpY2tldC8yNjI0NDQvbXVzaGZpcXVyLXJhaGltLWJlY29tZXMtbWV0bGlmZS0zNjAtaGVhbHRoLWFwcCVFMiU4MCU5OXPSAW5odHRwczovL3d3dy5kaGFrYXRyaWJ1bmUuY29tL2FtcC9zcG9ydC9jcmlja2V0LzI2MjQ0NC9tdXNoZmlxdXItcmFoaW0tYmVjb21lcy1tZXRsaWZlLTM2MC1oZWFsdGgtYXBwJUUyJTgwJTk5cw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZ2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNwb3J0aW5nbmV3cy5jb20vdXMvbmZsL25ld3MvYW50b25pby1icm93bi1ub3ctYnVjY2FuZWVycy1yZWxlYXNlL24zbjUzd3lpdXBubDE0cGpjanRwbGNsMGzSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,What is Antonio Brown doing now? Latest updates after release from Buccaneers,"It has been a whirlwind of a month for Antonio Brown.

When 2022 began he was poised to step up and take on an even larger role with the Buccaneers after a late December injury to Chris Godwin. Days later Brown was out of Tampa Bay taking off his jersey pads and shirt and leaving MetLife Stadium midway through a 28-24 win over the Jets on Jan. 2 leading to his release by the Buccaneers.

Another NFL team could have picked up Brown on waivers after he was cut but he went unclaimed and is now on the outside of the playoff picture looking in. Since the release he's done a variety of interviews and has made many public appearances.

Antonio Brown timeline since Buccaneers release

Jan. 3: Rap song release

Hours after he walked off the field against the Jets Brown released a song on his Instagram story called ""Pit Not the Palace."" It has since been released to all streaming platforms.

This is not the first rap song released by Brown. He has made other music under the stage name AB including a song called ""Whole Lotta Money"" that features Rick Ross. Brown had previously appeared in a Drake music video as well.

Jan. 6: Lawyers release statement

Brown spoke out for the first time since his release in a form that wasn't a cryptic response when his lawyer Sean Burstyn sent out a statement from Brown claiming that he had an ankle injury that was known to the coaching staff and that it inhibited his play. He said the team injected him with a painkiller to help him play through the pain but he said he got to a point where he could no longer play. Brown said he was scheduled to undergo surgery to repair the ankle.

The Buccaneers refuted Brown's claim saying that the medical staff looked at the ankle and deemed that he was fit to play.

Jan. 6: Social media outburst

It didn't take long before Brown himself started sounding off. He shared on his Instagram text messages allegedly between him and Bucs coach Bruce Arians where they discussed the ankle injury and more between the wide receiver and Tom Brady's longtime trainer Alex Guerrero. Brown clarified that his dispute with Tampa Bay was not directed at the players but instead was entirely about management of the team.

Jan. 7: First interview

Brown first spoke into a microphone about the drama with the Buccaneers on Jan. 7 when he was interviewed on the ""Full Send"" podcast.

Brown reiterated that he had an ankle injury that kept him from wanting to play. He also went off on Brady saying that he was on a ""prove it"" contract while Rob Gronkowski another of Brady's friends was not. He also said that Brady is championed and his supporting cast often gets left out of the picture.

Brown also brushed off concerns of CTE saying that he doesn't need anyone questioning his health status.

Jan. 13: Spotted with Kanye West Madonna Floyd Mayweather

Brown has spent a lot of time in Los Angeles where he has been seen recently with Kanye West Madonna and Floyd Mayweather. According to TMZ Brown met up with Mayweather at the Tengoose boxing gym in LA and later met up with Madonna West and Julia Fox at the restaurant Delilah.

TMZ reported that earlier in the week Brown had spent time with West at another Los Angeles restaurant Craig's.

Jan. 21: Complex interview

Speaking with Complex Brown explained that much of his recent time has been spent hanging out with West The Game Big Sean and others as he has begun to focus more on music as of late.

Brown said he has a new album coming out called ""Himmothy 2"" and hinted that he and West might have made music together. He also said he has worked on the Donda sports brand with West. He said he was thinking about putting together a documentary through Amazon and release more music through it.

Jan. 24: ""I AM ATHLETE"" interview

Though the full episode has yet to be released reports have come out about Brown's appearance on the show ""I AM ATHLETE"" hosted by Brandon Marshall.

During the interview Brown reportedly said that there is nothing wrong with his mental health and questioned why whenever something bad happens people question his mental health. He also said during the interview that he wants to play again in the NFL.

Did Antonio Brown sign with an NFL team?

Brown was released on Jan. 6 officially putting an end to his time as a Buccaneer.

But before he became a free agent Brown was placed on waivers giving any team the chance to claim him before the start of the playoffs. However no team claimed the wide receiver and he has yet to sign elsewhere.

There are several reasons why this might have been the case. The first is the potential baggage that would come with signing Brown. He has faced multiple accusations of sexual assault though he has denied them. He once threw furniture out of his 14th-floor apartment and nearly hit an infant below. He was cited for speeding more than 100 miles per hour. He was charged with burglary of a vehicle misdemeanor battery and misdemeanor assault. All of that happened before he signed with and won a Super Bowl with the Buccaneers.

If that all wasn't enough he also maintained after his release from Tampa Bay that he had a serious ankle injury that prevented him from playing against the Jets. He said Arians didn't believe in the severity of the injury and told him to play prompting Brown to leave. Even if a team had signed him there was a chance he might not even be able to play if the injury was deemed serious enough.",,,

Road underdogs won the first three NFL divisional-round playoff games on walk-off field goals. But the dramatic finishes were only warm-up acts for Sunday night’s main event between the Bills and Chiefs.

The AFC powerhouses traded leads three times in the final two minutes of regulation before Kansas City tied it on Harrison Butker’s 49-yard field goal as time expired to force overtime.

The Chiefs (-2½) who gained 44 yards in the final 13 seconds on two Patrick Mahomes’ passes to set up Butker’s kick won the coin toss and marched downfield for a 42-36 win on Mahomes’ 8-yard touchdown pass to Travis Kelce.

“It was one of the most exciting divisional rounds ever” Red Rock Resort sportsbook director Chuck Esposito said. “The last two minutes of the Chiefs-Bills was arguably one of the best games and best finishes in the history of the league.

“From the booking side of it there were dramatic swings. Our blood pressure was really high.”

Kansas City’s win was a major swing in favor of the sportsbooks because it denied countless bettors a four-team money-line underdog parlay that would’ve paid about 40-1.

“Having Kansas City win was a huge difference than Buffalo winning which would’ve taken away a monster day (Saturday)” Esposito said.

‘Most we’ve ever won’

Las Vegas sportsbooks had one of their biggest winning days ever in the NFL playoffs Saturday when both No. 1 seeds lost. The Bengals who closed as 4-point underdogs and +180 on the money line beat the Titans 19-16 and the 49ers (+6 +220) stunned the Packers 13-10.

“(Saturday) was probably the most we’ve ever won in a playoff round” MGM Resorts director of trading Jeff Stoneback said. “The public was all over the Packers and Titans. We had big wins on both games.”

A BetMGM bettor lost a $550000 straight bet on the Titans -3½. The Westgate SuperBook also won big on the Bengals who prevailed on rookie Evan McPherson’s 52-yard kick after Tennessee QB Ryan Tannehill threw his third interception at midfield with 20 seconds left.

The Titans lost despite sacking Bengals QB Joe Burrow nine times.

“It’s hard to believe that the Bengals and Titans were one of the biggest decisions. But they really loaded up on Tennessee” SuperBook vice president Jay Kornegay said. “The outright win by the Bengals was one of the bigger wins of the year for us.

“Give the Bengals a lot of credit. But they’re going to have their hands full against Kansas City.”

Conference championship lines

The Chiefs are 7-point home favorites over the Bengals in Sunday’s AFC title game and the total is 53½ after it opened at 50½ at the SuperBook.

In the NFC championship the Rams are 3½-point home favorites over the 49ers and the total is 46½. Los Angeles opened at -4 at the SuperBook before the line dropped to -3 and then crept back up to -3½ (Even).

“I feel like the AFC is kind of a run-and-gun show and the NFC has a lot more physical teams especially the Rams and 49ers” Kornegay said.

Bucs comeback falls short

The Rams (+3 +125) escaped with a 30-27 victory over the Buccaneers after blowing a 27-3 third-quarter lead. Tampa Bay tied it with 42 seconds left but Matthew Stafford completed a 44-yard pass to Cooper Kupp to set up Matt Gay’s game-winning 30-yard kick.

BetMGM won big on the game as a bettor lost a $575000 straight bet on the Bucs -2½ (-115).

Tampa Bay was as high as a 25-1 long shot on the in-play money line.

“It would’ve been really bad if they had won the game straight up” Stoneback said. “We took a lot of money-line action.”

Bad beat

A Caesars Sportsbook bettor who wagered $200000 on the Bucs-Rams game to go over 23½ in the first half suffered a painful bad beat when with the score 20-3 Cam Akers lost a fumble at the Tampa Bay 1-yard line with 24 seconds left before halftime.

Green Bay QB Aaron Rodgers didn’t throw a TD pass and fell to 0-4 against the Niners in the playoffs as the Packers failed to reach the Super Bowl as the No. 1 seed for the second straight season.

San Francisco scored 10 unanswered points in the final five minutes tying it 10-10 on a blocked punt return TD and winning on Robbie Gould’s 45-yard kick in the snow.

“That wasn’t as big a win as the Bengals but it was still the best-case scenario for us” Kornegay said. “It produced one of the bigger days we’ve had in a long time.”

Now B-Real Sen Dog and Eric Bobo are ready to deliver the 10th entry in their colorful discography — the Black Milk-produced Back In Black.

To coincide with the release Cypress Hill has shared another single from the project called “Bye Bye” featuring Dizzy Wright. As B-Real explained in a press release “In Cypress Hill tradition we always try to make a dark song. It’s what we’ve been known for especially on our first three albums. This song is a statement. In a roundabout way we spoke to the politics of today. Being lulled into this dreamworld by the government. Trying to blind us from the separation that they created to put us to sleep while they do whatever they want.”

Bye Bye” follows the 2021 release of additional album highlights “Open Ya Mind” and “Champion Sound.” The only other feature on the 10-track project is Demrick who’s a member of the supergroup Serial Killers alongside B-Real and Xzibit.

AD AD LOADING... AD

“If you’re making music you don’t just want to make one song” B-Real says. “You want to make an album to show people like your skillset your versatility and to capture their minds. You can do that with one song but an album is a journey. You have to take the trip. We were always fond of taking people on a journey the rollercoaster ride if you will and you can only do that with an album.”

Friday Intel announced plans to invest $20 billion in Licking County to construct two semiconductor microchip factories to meet the surging demand through driven partly by the COVID-19 pandemic.

This marks the largest single private-sector investment in Ohio's history and it is expected to create 3000 jobs with Intel and 7000 construction jobs needed for the build which is scheduled to begin later this year and to be operational by 2025.

This is good news for Marion's tech education programs.

Intel plans to invest $100 million over the next 10 years in partnership with Ohio universities community colleges and the U.S. National Science Foundation to build the workforce needed for the new plant.

This investment will go toward collaborative research projects and building semiconductor-specific coursework for associate and undergraduate degree programs.

For The Ohio State University's regional campuses including The Ohio State University at Marion the news of the plant coming to central Ohio is exciting in light of the bachelor of science in engineering technology program that launched in 2020 exclusively through the Lima Mansfield and Marion campuses.

Specifically geared toward setting students up to be highly skilled and equipped for plant managerial roles the first class of graduates will graduate in Spring 2024: just a year before the Intel facilities are set to open for production.

The Ohio Manufacturing Institute (OMI) at Ohio State Executive Director Kathryn Kelley said the timing of the project couldn't be better for the students in the program who may be interested in a career with Intel.

“We do believe that the regional campuses offering this new engineering technology program are definitely geared toward the types of careers that will take place at Intel"" Kelley said.

""These are graduates with advanced systems-level and management skills. They understand process engineering and they can integrate between production supply chain and logistics. So they have that broadly based skillset that Intel will need.”

Curriculum adjustments

For students in the engineering technology program at Ohio State Marion and the other regional campuses the curriculum can be tailored to meet the need for industry knowledge related to microchip production as the program was designed to be adaptable given current manufacturing needs.

Staff hope the opportunities created by Intel will encourage more students to enroll in the program and foresee increased opportunities for research internships and experiential learning from partnership with the global corporation.

“It’s not a static program. We do expect and we had already expected that the curriculum would adapt to manufacturers needs because not only do the manufacturers change but the technologies change” Kelley said.

This is also true for Marion Technical College.

Marion Tech's Director of Workforce Solutions Mike Augenstein explained the flexibility in its programming especially with regard to increased online learning as result of the pandemic will expand opportunities for students.

“As things like this are built in Ohio then we have a need to fill which means there will be new degree programs new certificate programs. We move at the speed of business so as they need people with a certain skillset we adapt to train those people” Augenstein said.

Opportunities to Marion County students

With this shift toward online and hybrid education Marion Tech is advancing Augenstein said he has hope for students in Marion County who are interested in jobs with Intel as teleworking and remote learning have become the new normal.

“As a college we have adapted to this even more. Obviously we had online classes before but we will be able to train people almost wherever they are in the skills they will need to do these jobs” he said.

Now that workplaces are primarily hybrid or operating on a work-from-home basis Marion Tech will encourage its students to consider pursuing a career with the plant since it is not only a reasonable distance but also the new reality of many workplaces does not require coming into a physical office five days per week.

Due to Marion's strategic location along U.S. 23 and its strong logistic presence opportunities with supporting industries will likewise grow due to Intel's presence in central Ohio Augenstein explained.

“When you get a huge facility like that there are supporting industries that will also be created. So it’s not just this one thing: it’s all the ancillary industries. We could end up being part of that supply chain; we’re located right off 23” he said.

“It is a huge economic boost and it’s not just that one facility: they’ll need support”

For students pursuing jobs in manufacturing or logistics the new plant will thus likely increase opportunities within Marion to help support its operations.

One related industry which will be positively affected is the automotive industry.

Boosting Marion's economy

Joe Ballinger owner of Marion-based car dealership Midwest Auto Group LLC explained the production of chips in the next few years will help help address the need that has been placing strain on the industry.

He also said Intel's presence in the Greater Columbus area will cause an economic boost pointing back to the opportunities in education the plant will bring to Ohio's students.

""These are extremely highly skilled jobs very high pay and that’s going to trickle down to a lot of things as far as the education that is going to help"" Ballinger said.

Marion will likely not be excluded from these opportunities he explained.

""I think we’re close enough that it could help the local economy as far as education in the tech industry. It’s going to be close enough that people could drive from Marion to work there” Ballinger said.

RAMTEC Ohio's Robotic Coordinator Mark Edington said the creation of chips would address the shortages within the automotive industry one of the major industries where graduates of the RAMTEC program often work.

“We all know the microchips are an issue right now in the automobile industry"" Edington said.

Edington explained that his students exit the program with highly developed skills and manufacturing credentials. This makes them able to meet the workforce needs which will be required to supply Intel's supporting industries with skilled workers.

“Our students come out of this program here with a multitude of certifications qualifications and I have them placed in all kinds of different jobs all over whether its Whirlpool Honda Bridgestone US Yachiyo all sorts of different venues are students are in coming out of this engineering program” he said.

If you find yourself forgetting details here and there you're not the only one. And now scientists believe it may actually be associated with a process that aids learning.

Forgetting is learning

Forgetting something may actually be a form of learning scientists recently outlined in the journal Nature Reviews Neuroscience. While most of our social conditioning makes us believe forgetting is an error on the brain's part it's actually an very ""functional feature"" of the brain NeuroScienceNews reported.

Whether we retain access to certain memories or lose them actually depends on our ""environmental feedback and predictability."" If you find yourself forgetting more often than others it means that you're more likely to indulge in flexible behaviour and smarter decision-making.

For instance some people who don't enjoy a certain mobile operating software tend to never forget a particular bad experience. This prevents them from giving it a shot again in the future even though it may have significantly improved.

Essentially scientists believe forgetting is as essential as remembering to balanced living. Research indicates that instead of memory loss us losing access to those memories is what causes us to forget things.

The team posits that that forgetting happens due to a ""circuit remodelling"" in brain cells (neurons) called ""engram cells"" that store memories. Think of it as losing your external hard drive. While the content stored on it may live forever your access to it is effectively lost.

Quick Take

Multiple social media users have claimed that Microsoft has developed a microchip implant to store Covid-19 vaccine information of people. We fact-checked and found the claim to be Mostly False.

The Claim

“Human trials will start this July on a micro-chip implant smaller than a pin-head that will hold your booster status and other information to enable a fast and easy way to access things like shops and events. All powered by Microsoft technology. A very exciting technology”.

The posts can be seen here and here.

Fact Check

What is a microchip implant?

The microchip implant is a small electronic device that is placed under the skin. Such chips use technology like RFID to store information related to health finances and other lifestyle and professional memberships.

Are there microchip implants available to be implanted into humans?

Yes. A company named Epicentre is reportedly ready with microchips that can be placed under human skin and can hold data.

Many people in Sweden are considering the microchip implants by Epicenter after the government made a new rule of travelling within the European Union with a coronavirus vaccine passport. More details are available on the Swedish-language eHealth Agency website here.

Has Microsoft developed microchip implants to store Covid-19 vaccine information?

No evidence. There is no news about Microsoft inventing a microchip implant. There is also no recent press release from the company about any such human trials.

The social media posts have not presented any evidence that proves Microsoft has developed such a chip. Most posts seem to have confused the technology developed by Epicenter as a invention of Microsoft.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiO2h0dHBzOi8vdGVjaGV2YWx1YXRlLmNvbS9kb2VzLXRlY2hub2xvZ3ktZG91YmxlLWV2ZXJ5LXllYXIv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Does Technology Double Every Year? – Tech Evaluate,"Whether we first heard about it in school over dinner or on TV most of us are familiar with the rapid growth of technology in today’s society. Some claim that this growth is so extreme that technology doubles every year. Hearing this factoid often makes people wonder: How fast does technology really grow?

Technology is building on itself and in many ways accelerating exponentially. Since 1965 the approximate number of transistors on a computer chip has doubled about every year and a half. In an electronic sense technology doubles approximately every 18-24 months.

This article will discuss some current and future technologies and what technologies will develop in their place?. It also looks at modern transistors with the smallest structures on the most advanced microchips currently measured in nanometers in the concept of Moore’s Law and how it applies to technological growth in today’s world. Read on to learn more about the rate at which technology is growing.

How Fast Does Technology Grow?

How Fast Does Technology Grow?

When it comes to explaining the rate of technological growth in today’s society many experts refer to Moore’s Law. Although it is called a law this is not a legal term. Instead it is a principle used in the computing industry to explain the growth of technology.

Moore’s Law

Moore’s Law originated in the 1960s and is named after Intel co-founder Gordon Moore. Intel was an essential part of the development of computers in the late 1960s. In fact the company is known to this day for the invention of the microprocessor; over 50 years later we still use microprocessors in our computers and other electronic devices!

Gordon Moore’s involvement in developing the microprocessor led to some interesting observations. Over a few years Moore realized that the number of transistors that could fit on a microchip was increasing at a remarkable rate. This observation led to the theory that technology doubles after a certain amount of time.

At the beginning of the theory’s existence in the late 60s technology was thought to double every year. However Moore revisited his forecast in 1975 and predicted that technology would double every two years. This prediction marked the beginning of Moore’s Law as we know it today.

What Qualifies As Technology?

What Qualifies As Technology? In the Ancient Stone Age a fire a knife or an ax was technology.

Technology is anything from a Neo-Lithic Axe Head to Artificial Intelligence depending on your current time and place in history. Arthur C. Clarke said Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic.”

In terms of Moore’s Law technology refers to computers and their capabilities. To fully understand the growth of technology it’s essential first to have some basic knowledge of how computers work.

Transistors and Integrated Circuits allow your computer to complete calculations and complex tasks on a fundamental level.

What Are Transistors?

IBM 2 Nanometer transistor in nanosheet structure horizontally stacked GAA chip design with four “gates.”

A transistor or nano transistor is an incredibly tiny binary device capable of switching between two modes or states. Believe it or not these two simple states make it possible for computers to complete simple calculations and eventually complex tasks.

The most used semiconductor device globally is the metal-oxide-semiconductor field-effect transistor (MOSFET) which Mohamed M. Atalla and Dawon Kahng invented at Bell Labs in 1959.

Individual nano transistors today are unbelievably small. For reference one nanometer is a billionth of a meter—that’s smaller than a strand of DNA! A modern transistor is approximately 2 nanometers wide.

Transistors work together to make an integrated circuit or what is more commonly known as a microchip. The more transistors a computer has on a chip the faster it can complete tasks and calculations. With all of the individual transistors working together computers can complete more complex tasks.

What is an Integrated Circuit?

A picture of the IBM 2 Nanometer Integrated Circuit wafer.

Integrated circuits or microchips are at the heart of almost all current electronics and have achieved the use of nanoscale components. An integrated circuit (IC) is a set of electronic circuits on a small substrate of semiconductor material like silicon. Transistors act as miniature electrical switches that turn an electrical current on or off on the IC.

Integrated circuits can hold billions of nano transistors resistors and capacitors. The integrated circuit comes in many forms like a System on a Chip (SoC) microprocessors microcontrollers logic gates motor controllers and voltage regulators. They are in everything from your smartwatch and headphones to supercomputers.

Integrated circuits can perform calculations and store data using digital or analog technology. Digital integrated circuits use binary code with values of 1 and 0. Digital integrated circuits are what run all modern computers and most consumer electronics.

Moving Transistors Integrated Circuits and Moores Law Forward

Extreme Ultraviolet Lithography (EUV) Technology is a testament to moving Moore’s Law forward and advancing technology. If you look at what scientists and engineers are doing with tech like this we would say Moore’s Law is far from dead.

A Dutch company named ASML is building school bus-sized machines that apply billions of transistors to the most advanced microchips at 7.5 and 3 nm nodes. Microchip companies utilize novel and tinier transistor designs and chip architectures to make their chips more energy-efficient powerful and faster.

Thanks to integrated circuit microchips technology has increased computing power one trillion-fold since its inception in the mid-1950s to today. They run the SoC on-device artificial intelligence used in smartphones and robotics and the many new and upcoming technologies listed above.

Please see some of our other interesting articles on “What Is DNA Data Storage?” and “Smartphone AI: Helpful Artificial Intelligence For The Beginner.”

How Do We Measure Technological Growth?

How Do We Measure Technological Growth?

With a basic understanding of transistors and microchips it becomes much easier to understand how technological growth is measured.

Today such growth is calculated according to how many operations a computer can carry out in a second. Specifically we can track this progress by measuring how many floating-point operations a computer can complete in one second.

What Are Floating-Point Operations?

Floating-point operations (also known as FLOPs) are the most commonly used devices for measuring technological growth. Scientists measure this growth by tracking computer efficiency using FLOPs.

Essentially FLOPs represent the number of valuable calculations a computer can complete. By frequently measuring how many calculations a computer can complete in a second we can more clearly understand how computers’ efficiency changes over time.

What Causes Technological Growth?

The technological evolution of robotics design with stages of development by year.

At any given moment technological engineers are working to advance technology as we know it today. Such exponential growth that we have seen in computers and technology results from various factors.

Engineers and developers constantly discover ways to utilize their time and resources more efficiently. As they find new ways to increase productivity tech developers also make discoveries that make technology continually more efficient. As a result we see growth in overall technology.

At the same time scientists are constantly researching to understand modern technology and its capabilities better. As a result new scientific discoveries surface. This type of productive collaboration also leads to growth in technology.

Algorithms and Software Improvements

In today’s world Algorithms and Software Improvements will probably be the innovation leaders to take us to the next level of improvement in computing capacity. We are already using AI-enhanced computational techniques algorithms and machine learning-powered neural nets to push forward.

It is expected that AI will be necessary to offer a hundredfold growth in technology from where we are today. With the expansion of deep learning neural network architectures move into other areas like self-supervised learning.

If AI can learn without the need for labeled data and become closer to how the human mind works on its own without human intervention. In that case it is definitely on the path to continued technological expansion and growth.

Technological Growth in History

In 1971 an essential computer chip could hold 2308 transistors. From 1975 to 2009 it took 18 months for technology to double. By consistently progressing at this rate by 2009 engineers could fit up to 2.31 billion transistors on a computer chip.

On its own Moore’s forecast has shaped the development of technology over the previous 50 years. As of October 2021 the Apple M1 Max contains 5nm technology that makes it possible to fit 57 Billion transistors on a single GPU chi. This exponential growth is an excellent display of Moore’s Law in action.

Depending on the source TSMC will manufacture its first 3 nanometer chips that will arrive in late 2022 or early 2023. IBM has already released news about its 2-nanometer chips so who knows how many transistors will ultimately fit on an IC chip.

How Quickly Will Technology Grow in the Future?

Touching the future with modern touchscreen Interface technology.

Technological growth has remained relatively consistent over the last five decades or so. However recent developments in the modern world are making some scientists question whether this progress will continue at the same rate it has moved since the 1960s.

Is Moore’s Law Still True?

When Gordon Moore first formed his theory about technological growth he predicted it would hold for ten years or more. Moore was correct in his prediction; the forecast has consistently represented technological progress over nearly fifty years!

As Jim Keller a believer in Moore’s Law discusses in this video there are millions of people working on thousands of technologies moving it forward. There are so many things that contribute to these systems like transistor architecture materials components power dissipation and operating voltage just to name a few.

Is Moore’s Law Ending?

Jim Keller on Why Moore’s Law is not ending and the future of AI Chips.

Moores Law has remained consistent for 50 years so why would it suddenly come to an end with the parameters and constraints of physics (as we see it)? In short computer engineers have not run out of ways to make computer chips smaller while simultaneously increasing the number of transistors they can hold.

As we have already seen in recent years as discussed with EUV Technology above scientists and engineers have found their way around transistors and IC limitations and continue to do so.

With the variants of technology and the infusion of AI into the equation with algorithms and software picking up the possible slack of future hardware it is unlikely that an equivalent Moore’s Law will end. It may not be Moore’s Law if the only variant we look at moving technology forward is transistors but technology will continue to move forward.

What Will Happen Next?

Although engineers are not at a loss for further innovating the already remarkable computer chip progress is still very possible. Many technological experts have formed predictions about how engineers will make this progress. Some predict that instead of focusing on transistors specialized engineers will dedicate more of their attention towards increasing energy efficiency and the lifetime of the technology we use today.

We have computer algorithms that can improve automatically through experience and by the use of data. Soon will be the time when AI can design a device or chip that will be beyond human engineers. We are already on our way.

We also see that arenas like Quantum Computing combined with classical computing and machine learning will somehow intertwine and facilitate the growth of the Quantum state. Testing and better metrics will be developed with systems engineering aspects of building a quantum computer.

Quantum Computing

IBM’s Quantum 127 Qubit Eagle Processor

In the early 1980s brilliant men like Yuri Manin Paul Benioff and Richard Feynman were credited with introducing the field of quantum computing. Richard Feynman proposed building universal quantum computers to simulate other quantum systems.

While there are disagreements on the metrics for measuring Quantum Computing systems today Google believes it can create a functional error-corrected quantum computer within the decade. IBM seems concerned with quantum advantage where quantum computers outperform classical ones on common problems for companies.

IBM’s current largest quantum computer of 127 quantum bits (qubits) was introduced on November 15 2021. In the realm of Moore’s Law with qubits instead of transistors IBM’s first goal to stay on track with its quantum processors of 127 then 433 qubits in 2022 and 1121 qubits by 2023 has been met.

Comparison of a Classical Computer and a Quantum Computer

Google Research Labs Quantum Computer

The difference between a Classical Computer and a Quantum Computer is space and scaling besides the fact that quantum computers currently look like chandeliers. Theoretically one hundred qubits on a single quantum computer processor would be more powerful than all the supercomputers on the planet combined. Three hundred qubits can hold more states than the number of atoms in the universe.

Quantum computers are still very much experimental devices and are being made available for research with practical access to business and the public. Major corporations are using them for specific tasks that they are better at than classical computers. They cannot yet do what classical computers as we understand them do daily but their potential is so far beyond their counterpart.

The current goal is to turn experimental quantum machines into reliable machines with “logical qubits” with logical gate error rates below 1%.

Do We Know What We Are Doing In The Quantum World?

The Quantum world operates at a sub-atomic level. Our answer to the question “Do We Know What We Are Doing In The Quantum World?” is most assuredly “sort of” or “no.” We do not entirely understand quantum physics let alone quantum computing.

At a quantum level entanglement describes two particles that can be at two places across the universe from each other simultaneously but affect each other the moment they are measured and observed. Showing that quantum mechanics permits instantaneous connections between distant locations or as Einstein called it “Spooky action at a distance.”

Quantum tunneling shows that particles can exhibit the “Hartman effect” and a tunneling particle can travel faster than light. So good luck if we flip the wrong “sub-atomic quantum switch!!” Oh and let’s not forget parallel and multiple universes. Are you guys staying in touch with your buddies at CERN?

Why Is Technological Growth Important?

Why Is Technological Growth Important?

Improved technology makes our lives more convenient but it also has a massive impact on economics and the overall social environment of today’s world.

In terms of economics tech companies are constantly trying to increase their product quality and decrease their prices simultaneously while still making a profit. As tech prices fluctuate over time so does the consumer market and flow of currency.

Final Thoughts

Since the 1960s technology has grown steadily doubling every 18-24 months. In the long run Moore’s Law has shaped innovation and our views of technological growth over the last fifty years. However despite the end of the Law if that ever happens growth will continue to progress according to upcoming innovations and discoveries in science and technology.

Though due to the current shortage DDR5 memory is not widely available at the moment and it’s almost impossible to get in certain places. For our ongoing DDR5 memory test this time we’ll be taking a look at a faster DDR5 memory kit that has a rated speed at DDR5-6200 from TeamGroup the T-Force Delta RGB DDR5.

Since we already have some data for some game performance with DDR5-4800 DDR5-5200 and DDR5-5400 let’s see what kind of performance we can expect from DDR5-6200.

Specifications

Module Type DDR5 288 Pin non-ECC Unbuffered DIMM Frequency 6400 6200 6000 Latency CL40-40-40-84 CL38-38-38-78 CL38-38-38-78 Capacity 16GBx2 16GBx2 16GBx2 Data Transfer Bandwidth 51200 MB/s

Unboxing

The T-Force Delta RGB DDR5 ships in a box this time as compared to the clear hard plastic packaging on the Delta RGB DDR4. There are not many details on the technical specifications of the kit that can be found on the box but one thing we can confirm as of now is that the RGB lightings can be controlled using the RGB software as listed at the back.

Design-wise the Delta RGB DDR5 looks very similar to the Delta RGB DDR4 (both the heatsink and light bar) but the debossed design on the DDR5 variant is very minimal this time.

The RGB lighting is not too bright and even though the color transition isn’t the smoothest we’ve seen so far it’s still decent and we’re able to sync it easily using the ASUS Aura Creator software.

Test System

For the quick test we did some games benchmarks and overclocking tests with the T-Force Delta RGB DDR5 using the following list of hardware:

CPU Intel Core i9-12900K Motherboard ASUS ROG Maximus Z690 APEX Memory Teamgroup T-Force Delta RGB DDR5 Graphics Card NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3080 Power Supply Cooler Master V1200 Platinum Primary Storage PNY XLR8 CS3040 Secondary Storage WD Black 6TB CPU Cooler ASUS ROG Ryujin II 360 Chassis Cooler Master MasterFrame 700 Operating System Windows 11 64bit

Overclock Test

Starting off with the overclock test we first check what are the timings and memory ICs the T-Force Delta RGB DDR5 has and then try to increase the memory frequency while tightening the timings along the way. As of now the known memory ICs used on DDR5 memory kits are from Micron SK Hynix and Samsung.

For the T-Force Delta RGB DDR5 we have here its rated speed is DDR5-6200 CL38 and it’s using the memory ICs from SK Hynix. Depending on the motherboards you’re using 1.25V for VDD might not be enough to run stable with the XMP profile and you’ll have to bump up the voltage a little bit more.

We’re able to slightly tighten our timings for DDR5-6200 to CL30 and 1T on the command rate with 1.38V for VDD and VDDQ while the rest of the relevant voltages are left on auto.

Bumping up to DDR5-6400 we weren’t able to get it to run stable with 1T this time so we settled down with 2T instead. We also bumped up the VDD and VDDQ to 1.435V TX VDDQ to 1.4V memory controller voltage at 1.281V and system agent on auto.

DDR5-6666 is currently the highest we can achieve with the T-Force Delta RGB DDR5 and we stopped going further at this point as we’re already hitting the 1.5V mark on VDD but still can’t get it to run fully stable. As the temperature can be seen hovering around 58ºC during some occasions as well we’ve decided that lowering the settings back to our stable DDR5-6400 which barely hit 55ºC during our previous stress test is a better option for our game benchmarks later.

Game Performance Test

Moving on with the game benchmarks we’ve run a series of tests with different settings on the memory while leaving the rest on default so we can see the impact from just tuning the memory settings alone.

While some games don’t show much improvement on the average FPS even with higher memory frequencies and tighter timings we can still see that the minimum frames for pretty much all of the titles we’ve tested have improved quite a bit even with our slightly optimized settings. This will often be reflected in-game as smoother gameplay which can benefit users who are very sensitive to everything that is moving on the screen.

First Impression

If you’re into the RGB lighting for your build the T-Force Delta RGB DDR5 is one of the DDR5 memory kits that comes with all the RGB blings you need. The design might not be the fanciest one around but as far as the RGB software compatibility goes it’s probably the last thing to worry about as TeamGroup has done a pretty good job on that.

Compared to the DDR5-5200 memory kit we’ve previously tested the T-Force Delta RGB DDR5 (DDR5-6200) is a lot easier to overclock and we can see some further improvement in gaming performance on some of the AAA titles we’ve tested even if everything is left on auto. Tightening the timings and increasing the memory frequency will give you some extra boost on certain titles as well and it’s also noticeably easier to deal with as compared to the kit with Micron ICs. As for if it’s worth the effort at all that totally depends on the games you’re playing but we still recommend giving it a try.

As for the price the T-Force Delta RGB DDR5 is expected to be priced at around 1800+ MYR for the DDR5-6200 variant we’ve tested. It’s a pretty steep price for a memory kit but the availability seems to be a much bigger issue at the moment due to the ongoing shortage of DDR5 memory kits especially ones that come with Hynix memory ICs. Hopefully we’ll see an improvement in the DDR5 memory kit availability soon but until then the T-Force Delta RGB DDR5 (DDR5-6200) will remain on our list of ‘recommended but only if you manage to find one’.

Pros

Reasonable overclocking headroom

Lower stock operating voltage on higher frequencies compared to DDR4

Cooling for PMIC seems good

RGB lightings are not too bright

Cons",,,,,,,,,

On January 18th the firm said it would pay that sum—in cash—for Activision Blizzard a video-game developer. It is by far the biggest acquisition in the video-game industry’s history and the largest ever by Microsoft more than twice the size of its purchase in 2016 of LinkedIn a social network (see chart). The move which caught industry-watchers by surprise and propelled Activision Blizzard’s share price up by 25% represents a huge bet on the future of fun. But not perhaps a crazy one.

Gaming was a big fast-growing business even before the pandemic. Lockdowns bolstered its appeal—to hardened gamers with more time on their hands and bored neophytes alike.

This post includes parts from entries 55-57 shedding light on the transition of Microsoft Office from an end user–focused product to an enterprise product. Although enterprise sales and multi-year contracts proved incredibly lucrative they added unforeseen complexity to product development.

Over the course of two decades Sinofsky held a variety of roles beginning as a software design engineer in 1989 before eventually leading the development of Office and ultimately serving as president of the Windows division.

It was 1999 and Microsoft Office was riding high. Millions of people around the world used the product and the company had just released Office 2000. It was a legitimate cash cow. Inside the Office team however we had our share of challenges.

Office 2000 was released during a sea change for Microsoft and the technology industry. Office was not the only place (or even a place) for excitement at the time. Individuals were excited by web browsers MP3 players and new gaming systems — not laptops and productivity software. And enterprise IT teams weren’t excited by anything that caused them work — they were spending their cycles trying to stabilize internal infrastructure convert legacy client-server applications to the web and prepare for Y2K.

In a sense Microsoft was losing competitively … to itself. Office 97 was a good product that individual consumers office employees and IT teams really liked especially after investing the time and effort to deploy it across the organization. Switching to Office 2000 came at a monetary cost to consumers and with a time-and-energy cost to enterprises that already owned it via multi-year licensing agreements. What’s more Office 2000 represented the product’s hard pivot into an enterprise-first product. That move meant lots of new features that end-users didn’t want and new licensing approaches designed to better suit the enterprise business.

It was a double-edged sword: The enterprise reviews for Office 2000 were extremely solid and really couldn’t have been much better. The consumer reviews were not so positive. The Wall Street Journal’s Walt Mossberg — a star among tech reviewers at the time — wrote an article headlined “Microsoft Updates Office Suite but It’s Not for the Little Guy.” The sting was real.

I was hurting. Did we really mess up? Should we have seen this coming and adjusted along the way? It seemed so obvious. On the other hand we did exactly what we set out to do. In Microsoft performance review lingo this was a 4.0 (on our 2-5 scale of the time where almost no one got a 4.5 or 5).

The answer regretfully in some ways was that we did not mess up. The Office business depended on building a product for business customers. The reviews were positive in that regard. The consumer reviews were not the key to the success we were achieving and needed to achieve going forward. We built what we could sell. And we were selling what we built — one of just-appointed CEO Steve Ballmer’s favorite sayings.

We should do both was a constant refrain during discussions — we should have a great consumer product and a great enterprise product. On paper that is the ideal situation. In practice it was not that the needs and desires of each type of customer were diverging; they were increasingly in conflict. It was not that consumers wanted different features; they also explicitly did not want the features of the enterprise. This worked both ways as enterprise IT decidedly did not want more features but rather fewer.

Practically any time someone tries to take on two conflicting perspectives in one product the product comes across as a compromise. It is neither one nor the other but a displeasing mess. The hope I had at the start was that by deprioritizing our traditional retail-customer focus on personal productivity at the start of the release we avoided the messy middle. We succeeded at that but I was struggling with how unsatisfying this felt.

Enterprise Agreements and ‘unearned revenue’

Most quarters our Office finance lead would come to a senior manager meeting discuss the earnings announcement and put it in context. As a giant public company these discussions were not news but as we transitioned Office into an enterprise-first business they were useful to help the broader team understand where the money came from (and how much we were spending). Each quarter of results had a new entry in the filings and disclosure went something like this from Microsoft’s 2000 annual report:

At June 30 1999 and 2000 Windows Platforms products unearned revenue was $2.17 billion and $2.61 billion and unearned revenue associated with Productivity Applications and Developer products [Office] totaled $1.96 billion and $1.99 billion. Unearned revenue for other miscellaneous programs totaled $116 million and $210 million at June 30 1999 and 2000.

It would be an understatement to say that finance was almost giddy over the unearned (i.e. contractually guaranteed but not yet realized) revenue renumber. It was growing at a crazy rate and the numbers were in the billions of dollars. Sometimes it felt like the world’s largest rainy-day fund (even though Microsoft’s cash on hand was also astronomical) or like we could stop selling software and run the company on unearned revenue for a couple of years. The company had come a long way from Bill Gates’ founding principle of maintaining a full year of cash on hand to weather economic uncertainty.

Revenue was no longer as simple as how many copies of Office were sold. The turn of the millennium was about selling multi-year contracts for Office (and other Microsoft products often all together). While Office for $100 or even $150 seemed low gone was the angst over upgrades. The largest companies in the world were buying our software for every PC and committing to keep buying it for the next three years. It was effectively a massive increase in revenue per customer; in exchange customers received the full enterprise treatment of support sales teams strategic partnering and more. Those benefits were known as Software Assurance or SA.

Instead of booking the revenue for one box of Office entirely in the quarter it was sold revenue was formally recognized over the life of the contract (usually three years). Contractually the revenue was guaranteed but accounting rules meant Microsoft had to wait to recognize revenue. It is easy to see why this is a good idea as absent that we could conceivably have monster quarters only to fail to sell more products in the future.

This created a radically new problem for how we thought of the business and as quickly as these enterprise agreements took over we had to change how we thought about product development. Unearned revenue (almost an oxymoron and certainly not a phrase coined by marketing) could sound like an accounting gimmick and was especially tricky for the teams in headquarters that had no real insights into pricing number of agreements or even the promises and terms. We only had one important rule which was that we could not (ever) disclose the future release date of a product. Doing so would potentially turn unearned revenue into earned revenue as the rights to buy an upgrade went from “if” one was available to “when” one was available. Disclosure would also cause customers to attempt to time their deals so as to maximize the number of upgrades they received.

Microsoft’s enterprise server products evolved to “focus on customers” as the team often said which really meant veering off into increasingly IT-centric strategies making it difficult to surface these features for end-users in Office. The problem was that selling Office to retail customers was a big business but was going nowhere compared to enterprise licensing. Easily half the business was new volume licensing products and the switch from retail especially for medium and larger businesses was progressing rapidly. Soon the bulk of all revenue would be volume licensing and retail would simply be for lack of a better word a rounding error.

Still the Office 2000 product felt too enterprise. I was determined that Office maintain both end-user excitement and broad horizontal appeal — those were our roots and people sat in front of Office hours every day. Microsoft was rapidly becoming a company of extremes with Xbox and internet services targeting the latest consumer trends and servers at the extreme of enterprise. Office used by most everyone with a PC it seemed occupied a broad space in the middle as products used by individuals and teams at home and at work but purchased and managed by IT professionals. This was our product design challenge — how to build a product where the buyers and users differed so dramatically.

Nonetheless creating the Enterprise Agreement or EA was one of the most brilliant decisions in all of Microsoft history right up there with the MS-DOS license or committing to Macintosh applications. It is why the company today could so easily transition to selling Office as a modern software as a service offering. Microsoft developed and used a muscle so to speak for changing the business terms while maintaining product compatibility. Once again we see the foundation of the company today forming decades earlier. The EA which got its start in the late 1990s was also quintessential Steve Ballmer combining exactly what the customer wanted with just enough nuance and complexity that Microsoft could stay ahead on the business side and yes it was also ahead of where we were in the product groups too. The EA started as an “offer” as Steve would say and then we worked backwards and filled in the details or the SA benefits.

Multi-year contracts complicate product development

Key to all of this when it came to product development was that new releases seemed to be able to bypass market validation to appear successful. Customers already purchased the next and latest release which meant we could easily fool ourselves into thinking the product was a hit by looking at the revenue numbers. Customers were buying a sales and support relationship with Microsoft as much or perhaps more than the software itself even when running old releases. While this was not a short-term issue over time the lack of individual buyers acquiring specific products seriously clouded Microsoft’s collective product judgment. In many ways the mostly captive Windows OEM model (Original Equipment Manufacturers the makers of PCs who buy Windows) selling to a very small number of enormous accounts would presage this product-market challenge.

Unaware of what was possible end-users never really demanded specific new features but IT professionals were aware of the possibilities and what they wanted was not necessarily representative of what individuals valued. Individuals however seemed to have a decreasing voice in what software a company used as IT gained control of the chaos that PCs unleashed. EAs were the tool IT needed — in their mind they paid so they dictated every aspect of the PC. The divergence of the target buyer from the target user increased with each new enterprise agreement.

The complexity of enterprise agreements was often comical. There were hundreds of thousands of different deals and price permutations. There was no easy way to sell billions of one thing just like Coca-Cola didn’t only sell 12-ounce cans of Coke — so went the conversation I would have with those on the team tasked with implementing and tracking seemingly endless and ever-changing SKUs. Not all companies (customers) were on the current release; in fact most were not. Not all customer EAs started in the same year or at the same time.

Collectively customers were equally spread into three cohorts expiring that year and each of the following two. This meant that any given release was deployed by at most one-third of customers. When buying new PCs the oldest customers upgraded from a version two releases back a version none of us were running that Microsoft had long forgotten about. Seemingly overnight EAs created a complexity matrix based on the outside chance that the most out-of-date customers might upgrade to the latest release. We were committing to upgrading from software potentially six or seven years old because at any given time the current and previous two releases of Office were each used by about one-third of customers — a fact that remained stubbornly true for a very long time.

PCs were also starting to last longer. The first decade of the PC was marked by software consuming every bit of hardware that could make it to market (CPU memory or disk space). By 2000 typical PCs had ample specifications for business productivity. The guideline most businesses followed was that new versions of software rolled out commensurate with new levels of hardware. Many companies were trying to get on a cycle to regularly update hardware but they were finding that doing a refresh of the software load got another year or more out of a PC. Whereas people previously wanted a new PC at work so much they would spend their own money a practice eventually disallowed everyone eventually grew content with whatever their workplace provided. PCs and software seemed good enough.

This dynamic was entirely appropriate to the middle age of the PC era. Instead of moving to a new home it seemed far simpler to repair the existing one. As central as the PC was to the workplace environment and health businesses were slowly making different choices. EAs were the perfect way for a business to make one decision and not worry about it again even if it meant paying a bit more.

EAs also created a crazy environment where concerns over hitting a ship date for retailers and OEMs were secondary to those of IT professionals trying to time the start date of their enterprise agreement. They knew they owned the current version but if they delayed purchasing for as long as possible the next two versions might be released and ready to ship as they signed. They deployed the current release and owned the next one and if Microsoft hit a target ship date then they’d also own the third. As the renewal dates for a given customer approached the pressure from that account team to the Redmond marketing team for a public commitment to a ship date only increased. This was all invisible to the broader market but the idea of renewals was front and center for the entire sales and business leadership.

These IT customers assumed that Office continued to improve but they were only marginally interested in the product strategy. They really wanted to know if a new release was due within their EA subscription window. For customers even a month error was a massive dollar-value issue. If we were a month late and a customer didn’t qualify for the product then every impacted customer sought compensation. Plus a date range was a joke. Inside Microsoft if someone said the “first half” of a year as they often did then other product groups might assume June 30. Customers hearing the same likely assumed January 1.

A ship date is a date not a range. A quarter is 90 dates. A half of a year is 180 dates. I hated this game.

Convincing customers to upgrade from ‘good enough’

EAs came about to maximize an available revenue opportunity and customer relationship (thinking back to a 1993 retreat where we talked about filling the void left by IBM — this was it) even if the product or product development process had not caught up to that opportunity. As we bundled already successful Word and Excel into Office even though the products were not yet integrated we were selling enterprise licenses even though our processes (and product) had not yet matured to that level. We were selling subscriptions long before subscriptions were cool or even built — this is an important and hugely significant legacy of Steve Ballmer’s enterprise sales leadership (eventually these EAs would be called recurring revenue).

Given this Office needed to create features that delivered so much value to IT professionals in the enterprise that they outweighed the cost of deploying (and in their view training) employees. Simply making Office more enterprise-friendly and easy to deploy was nice but it was still more difficult to deploy than to do nothing. We needed to accomplish this on time and within the magical three-year window.

I genuinely believed that we had created an unsolvable problem — creating enough business value to justify an upgrade in the eyes of the gatekeeper. Imagine trying to make Word Excel and PowerPoint so much more valuable that the new features were worth more than the sum of all the old features? Difficult enough but what made this even more absurd was that the IT people were actively customizing Office to disable features they deemed to be of low business value. It was not surprising to see companies disable access to HTML templates Visual Basic programming or data connectivity features simply for concern or fear that they might get misused waste time or generate support calls. While this was acute for Office upgrades were an industry-wide challenge.

Failing to create value some in the industry moved to upgrades by force by changing the file formats creating proprietary connections between servers such as Exchange or the Windows web server or by requiring the new version for patches or updates. Office generally resisted these artificial growth methods.

This ran counter to new internet-era companies which were not about such tightly coupled software but about loosely coupled software. This philosophy was the exact opposite of how Microsoft created new features. The connection between Exchange and Outlook was as tightly coupled as could be — each required the other and without both there was no value at all. Internally there was increasing pressure to make the Office Server Extensions (OSE built with FrontPage — the code that made possible collaboration using Office and HTML) less about the browser and more about the core productivity apps (Word Excel PowerPoint) like there was pressure to more closely connect innovations in Office to the browser.

Enterprise agreements were making it look increasingly difficult to build the right product. How ironic.

If there was one lesson building the apps business it was that great releases empowering individuals and helping them to create compelling documents pulled Office into companies. There needed to be some balance. Achieving that balance was our goal for planning what would become the next product Office10.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiY2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRvbXNndWlkZS5jb20vb3Bpbmlvbi81LXJlYXNvbnMtbWljcm9zb2Z0LWJ1eWluZy1hY3RpdmlzaW9uLWJsaXp6YXJkLWlzLWdvb2QtZm9yLWdhbWVyc9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,5 reasons Microsoft buying Activision Blizzard is good for gamers,"In a move that rocked the gaming world Microsoft announced it will buy major publisher Activision Blizzard for a huge $68.7 billion; that’s the largest acquisition in the gaming industry ever.

This follows in the footsteps of 2020’s move by Microsoft to buy Bethesda and all of its developers. So understandably there have been murmurs that this could be bad for the gaming world seeing PS5 and PS4 players left out on the cold as Microsoft bolsters the Xbox Series X and Xbox Series S with exclusive games.

While I’m no business guru I don’t think being bought by Microsoft is a bad thing for Activision Blizzard or a sign of an insipid monopoly building up inside the gaming industry. Rather I feel there are some positive things here and the deal could benefit gamers hugely. Let me tell you why.

Update: We ponder the question of what does Microsoft’s Activision acquisition mean for gamers?

Xbox Game Pass becomes an even better deal

(Image credit: Shutterstock)

It’s not original to say Xbox Game Pass is the best deal in gaming; for a flat fee you can get access to a seemingly ever-growing range of games. These stretch from generic shooters to intriguing indie games as well as all of Xbox Game Studio’s first-party titles like Halo Infinite and Forza Horizon 5.

With the Bethesda purchase Microsoft added a suite of the developer's games to Game Pass. And it plans to do the same with Activision Blizzard's portfolio meaning a range of Call of Duty games Overwatch Diablo and more are set to arrive on Game Pass likely in 2023.

When you add those up with games from Bethesda and a range of EA games not least of all Mass Effect Legendary Edition Game Pass becomes a killer service for pretty much any device that’ll support it.

Affordable access to more games

Not everyone can afford the $50 to $70 prices many games now command let alone a $499 Xbox Series X. And that's especially true of nations not blessed with the wealth of the U.S. or Europe; affording one game a month could be quite the ask for some.

But for roughly $10 a month Xbox Game Pass provides access to a bounty of games old and new meaning you don’t even have to be a long-time Xbox gamer to play some of the best Xbox games over the space of twenty years. Blizzard has already announced development of a new survival game one that's likely to be an Xbox and PC exclusive. That democratizes gaming and that's good for gamers from all walks of life.

Sure Microsoft could ramp up the price of Game Pass as we’ve seen Netflix do by hiking prices. But I feel it’ll still be a bargain for what it’s offering: access to a load of games across multiple platforms generations and publishers.

Play console-quality games anywhere

Building upon the accessibility point expanding Xbox Game Pass also seems set to have the knock-on effect of making the likes of Overwatch World of Warcraft and more available for anyone to play on pretty much any platform providing they have a decent internet connection be it wired or 5G.

That’s because with Xbox Game Pass Ultimate you don’t actually need an Xbox console to play a range of games with cloud-powered game streaming piping the like of Gears 5 to the best phones and best Chromebooks.

With Xbox Series X restocks still tricky to pin down being able to stream the latest and best Xbox Series X games to an Xbox One or another compatible device is brilliant. It means those who can’t get the latest console or afford to buy it can still enjoy a fresh generation of gaming. This would also benefit PlayStation fans as even if they don’t want to get an Xbox console they could still access Game Pass on a myriad of devices.

Heck even if you have all of the consoles being able to stream modern games to a smartphone when you’re out and about is very slick; Microsoft has even worked on retrofitted touchscreen controls for some games.

A purge of toxicity

(Image credit: 343i)

Activision Blizzard is currently embroiled in a U.S. lawsuit around the way it's treated its workers. And the company has come under a lot of scrutiny from allegedly creating a toxic work environment especially onwards women.

While the publisher isn't struggling too much financially it’s no surprise that it’s not put out a stellar game for a while; unhappy workers rarely do good work. Prior to the acquisition announcement Phil Spencer Xbox boss and newly minted CEO of Microsoft Gaming has been vocal against the behavior of Activision Blizzard as a company and its executive board.

Due to the way acquisitions and publicly traded companies work Microsoft can't come out and say exactly what will happen to Bobby Kotick the CEO of Activision Blizzard and a man heavily involved in the publisher’s controversy. But the structure of the Microsoft Gaming division seems to make it clear that there's no room for two CEOs — meaning it's likely to be game over for Kotick.

As a result I’m optimistic that Microsoft will purge the toxic elements of Activision Blizzard and bring in a better working culture. After some initial slip ups with its early acquisitions of studios like the now-defunct Lionhead Microsoft seems to be a lot more savvy when it comes to letting studios define their own path yet supporting them financially. So a lot of Activision Blizzard’s studios and teams could find themselves with greater freedoms and a less challenging environment to work under.

That could all make for better and more creative games rather than just another rote Call of Duty game. Spencer has said he’d like to see more of Activision Blizzard’s older games make a comeback in some form or another. So we could see a burst of creativity from the publisher’s developers; that's good for gaming. Evidence of this could be traced back to the likes of Obsidian being given the scope to work on Avowed or Double Fine being able to create Psychonauts 2 a game that may not have had the approval of a traditional publisher.

Access to globe-spanning tech

Microsoft might be deeply involved in gaming but it’s a tech company first. And that means all the developers it has acquired could tap into the mass of technology Redmond has. Microsoft has the second-largest cloud platform that supports everything from streaming services to development tools and machine learning.

As such a developer who may have been on a cash-strapped budget and needing to purchase Azure cloud tools would now have access to them. I can imagine games getting better AI thanks to Microsoft’s work on machine learning. Or having more stable servers thanks to the support of the Microsoft Cloud.

Again for gamers this is good as it could mean more innovative games that also look better and run better. These games could even be bundled into the new version of Windows; it might sound silly but imagine if the next Windows 11 update came with Skyrim as that game seems to be installed just about everywhere.

I will caveat all the above by saying I could be very naïve and be putting too much faith in a corporation I think has been a good entity over the past few years. And I’m sure some diehard PlayStation fans will balk at the deal.

But of all the companies that could have bought Activision Blizzard I think Microsoft is the right one.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMijQFodHRwczovL3RoZWNvbnZlcnNhdGlvbi5jb20vbWljcm9zb2Z0LWJ1eXMtYWN0aXZpc2lvbi1ibGl6emFyZC13aXRoLXRoZS12aWRlby1nYW1lLWluZHVzdHJ5LXVuZGVyLW5ldy1tYW5hZ2VtZW50LXdoYXRzLWdvaW5nLXRvLWNoYW5nZS0xNzU0MzPSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Microsoft buys Activision Blizzard: with the video game industry under new management what's going to change?,"In 1979 a group of disgruntled Atari employees decided to quit and create their own company. Activision was the world’s first “third-party” game development company producing and publishing titles for other companies’ platforms.

Fast-forward 43 years and the company that is now Activision Blizzard has been bought by one of the major platform owners in the industry Microsoft for a blistering US$68.7 billion dollars (around A$95.6 billion) – the largest sale in the history of the video game industry.

This sale is also massive in terms of the game franchises Microsoft now has control over; it now owns blockbuster franchises such as Call of Duty Diablo Starcraft Candy Crush and World of Warcraft. And tens of millions of fans of these titles will now be wondering: what does this change in ownership mean for them?

Why now?

Big dollar acquisitions aren’t new in the video game industry. Activision Blizzard itself became one of the largest video game companies in 2008 when Activision merged with Blizzard in a US$18.9 billion dollar deal. Microsoft and Sony regularly buy successful pre-existing development studios to take over their intellectual properties (IP) and make them available exclusively on their platforms.

But Microsoft has become particularly aggressive in its approach. In the last decade alone it has made a number of high-profile purchases including Minecraft developer Mojang in 2014 for US$2.5 billion and Elder Scrolls and Doom publisher ZeniMax in 2020 for US$7.5 billion. With the Activision Blizzard acquisition Microsoft is now the third-largest company in the industry behind TenCent and Sony.

This is all part of Microsoft’s current video game business strategy which is less about selling game products and more about increasing subscriptions to its Game Pass service. Similar to services like Netflix and Spotify Game Pass gives subscribers access to a massive digital catalogue of games in exchange for a monthly fee.

In its announcement of the Activision Blizzard purchase Microsoft also boasted Game Pass has surpassed 25 million users. With each user paying US$16 a month that’s about US$400 million (or A$556 million) in monthly revenue.

With Activision Blizzard Microsoft now owns a huge new range of franchises it can make available through Game Pass attracting even more users.

Gaming landlords

If it wanted Microsoft might even make these franchises only available through Game Pass forcing customers away from other consoles like PlayStation and distribution platforms like Steam. In other words it could pull consumers into its own exclusive sphere.

This is now a common strategy. Now through subscription-based digital platforms we have all stopped being owners of product and instead have become renters.

This is also true of individual video games. Call of Duty Hearthstone Fortnite (and many others) are no longer games that players purchase once but are instead their own ecosystems in which players are encouraged to continuously spend money on battle passes cosmetics and access to new content.

Meanwhile the companies that own these titles can constantly farm new data from their millions of players further increasing their company value.

With the purchase of Activision Blizzard Microsoft has effectively purchased a city of existing renters in the player ecosystems of Call of Duty Hearthstone World of Warcraft and many other titles.

That’s tens of millions of players already committed to closed ecosystems including many in the difficult-to-penetrate Chinese market playing Blizzard titles Hearthstone and World of Warcraft. All of these players can be farmed for more personal data and more rent.

So what does it mean for players and developers?

In the short term probably not a whole lot.

Over the coming years however Microsoft might decide to keep more of these newly acquired franchises for its own platforms. For a PC player this might simply mean having to transition away from Steam to the Microsoft Game Store if they want to access the franchises: an inconvenience but hardly a radical change.

For PlayStation and Mac players the situation could be more dire and they might find themselves having to purchase a PC or an Xbox if they want to play new entries to these franchises in the future.

Some are also worried ongoing giant mergers will stifle creativity and innovation across the video game industry. But this is unlikely since the bulk of the revenue generated by the industry has always been concentrated in a relatively small number of risk-adverse companies.

In her book Global Games researcher Aphra Kerr estimated that in 2015 the top ten video game companies accounted for 49% of the entire industry’s revenue. In spite of this concentration of capital the creativity and innovation that produces new genres almost always emerges at the periphery in much smaller independent groups working with far fewer resources.

The explosion of new and diverse genres we’ve seen over the past decade occurred in large part because independent creators are now able to access far more powerful tools such as game engines Unity and Unreal and greater audiences through digital marketplaces such as Steam or Xbox Game Pass.

The situation is far from ideal but the companies that control most of the capital in the video game industry – and the companies that are the most innovative – have rarely been the same. So this latest acquisition is unlikely to stifle creativity.

But there’s more at stake in this historic sale. Activision Blizzard is facing accusations and lawsuits of harassment abuse and sexism across its offices and CEO Bobby Kotick has been under intense pressure to resign for months. Kotick is now set to walk away from the company with US$400 million; the allegations of a toxic workplace are now Microsoft’s responsibility to clean up.

Perhaps this is the important question coming out of the recent sale: not which piece of hardware will have access to which games but whether Microsoft will take responsibility for improving the work culture and working conditions for game developers? We’ll have to wait and see.

With a budget that hasn't kept up with the pace of work at the antitrust agencies and that pales in comparison to that of the companies it takes on the FTC has instead fired messages as warning shots to indicate its seriousness. One such action was the agency's announcement that it would send letters to some companies seeking to merge letting them know the FTC would continue investigating their deals even if the statutory waiting period had passed. The letter essentially warned that businesses could merge at their own risk but the FTC may later file a lawsuit for them to undo their transaction. While such letters don't actually set new policy — it's always the case that enforcers can seek to block or undo mergers even after they've reviewed them — the change in tone marked a sharp pivot from the past. But that may not work to actually change company behavior said Gordon. Until courts decide on regulators' interpretation of antitrust law large businesses will likely keep up the torrid pace of deals hoping to close as many as possible he said. ""Once you've cracked the eggs and made the omelet it's hard to get the eggs back into the shells"" said Gordon. ""You're going to be more likely to crack the shells scramble that omelet up and put the government in a position where they go into court and say this deal has to be undone and the judge looks at them and says how are you going to do that?"" Khan in her first on-camera sit-down interview since taking the job told CNBC's Andrew Ross Sorkin and Kara Swisher host of The New York Times' ""Sway"" podcast the agency is trying to be thoughtful about sending broad messages while acknowledging its own resource limitations. ""What are instances in which certain types of actions could have a market-wide impact?"" Khan said giving an example of the type of question she would consider. ""If we are able to obtain a particular settlement or consent decree or get a good outcome in court what are instances in which that could really change the dynamic in the entire market rather than just you know here or there?"" Bill Kovacic a former FTC commissioner and current law professor at George Washington University said it's only a matter of time until the antitrust enforcers act on their threats. ""The players are in place largely the commitments have been made they have the president of the United States in his executive order from July saying 'go get 'em' "" said Kovacic referring to Biden's order directing various government agencies to consider new ways they can address issues of monopoly concentration and competition in the economy. ""If you don't do it right now in the coming twelve months you will never get this opportunity again. And I think not only do they realize they have to deliver they want to deliver.""

Time to fight

In her CNBC interview Khan said that fighting Big Tech ""takes courage"" though she stopped short of suggesting her agency would block any existing deal. ""These are enormously well-resourced companies"" Khan said in the interview. ""They are not shy about deploying those resources. We're really showing these companies but also showing the country that enforcers are not going to back down because of these companies flexing some muscle or kind of trying to intimidate us."" Big technology companies often pay dozens of lawyers both in-house and outside counsel to give advice about the chances of deal approval. Microsoft Amazon Facebook parent Meta Alphabet and Apple may be the five most scrutinized companies in terms of the type of market power they wield over society and rivals given their collective market valuations which total close to $9.5 trillion. On the surface Amazon buying a movie studio (MGM) or Microsoft acquiring a gaming company (Activision) or a health-care artificial intelligence software (Nuance) company don't ring traditional antitrust alarm bells. These aren't deals where there's a limited competitor base arguing to get even smaller such as the wireless or broadband industries. This puts Khan in a ""prove it"" position where she'll likely have to make the case that antitrust law interpretation should adjust to current capitalist dynamics. Meanwhile Congress is working on new laws that could ease enforcers' jobs of proving to a court that certain behavior by online platforms is illegal. On Thursday the Senate Judiciary Committee advanced a major bill that would bar dominant online platforms from discriminating against rivals' products on their platforms. While that bill is focused on company conduct lawmakers in the House have also considered a bill that would shift the burden of proof in merger transactions onto dominant firms. ""Deciding when moving forward and taking action is still worth it even when it's not a slam dunk case"" Khan said in her CNBC interview. ""Even if there's a risk you still may lose there can be enormous benefits from taking that risk. You might win. You lose all the shots you don't take. But what we can see is that inaction after inaction after inaction can have severe costs. That's what we're really trying to reverse.""

Making a statement

In President Joe Biden's first year in office his chosen antitrust regulators have picked two significant media and technology deals to block. The Department of Justice sued to block Penguin Random House’s acquisition of rival publisher Simon & Schuster in November and Khan's FTC sued to block Nvidia's $40 billion acquisition of U.K. chip design provider Arm in December. Both of those deals carry unusual importance because they're two of the first big cases out of the gate said Kovacic. ""It's an enormous advantage to win your first cases"" he said. ""To show you can do it. To show it's not just talk."" The relatively short amount of time enforcers have to take action during their terms also puts a ""fierce sense of urgency"" into the FTC which understands that it must build on precedent to change the way companies think about mergers and acquisition Khan said.

But many observers don't see that waiving the intellectual property (IP) rights on Covid vaccines is an effective way to put a stop to the pandemic.

Supporters of patent waivers like Harsha Thirumurthy associate professor of medical ethics and health policy at the University of Pennsylvania argue the issue lies at the heart of the reason why vaccines are less accessible in lower-income countries.

""It limits how much manufacturing there can be of that product or that vaccine"" said Thirumurthy adding it keeps the price ""artificially high enough that it limits the ability of other countries in the world.""

But critics counter that patent waivers will not automatically lead to an improvement in global vaccine distribution.

Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates was among those who originally spoke out against the patent waiver emphasizing that there are problems beyond patents that must be addressed first. Gates later reversed his stance and is now in full support of temporarily waiving the protections over coronavirus vaccine patents.

""Having a billion vaccines sitting in a warehouse of a lab that's developing will do no good getting us back to normal"" said Heath Naquin vice president of government and capital engagement at the University City Science Center a nonprofit research organization in Philadelphia.

""The patent waiver itself doesn't actually solve that core issues in many developing countries which are not related to the recipe they are related to the way you get that out the door to people.""

However experts on both sides of the debate seriously doubt whether a patent waiver on Covid-19 vaccines will ever come to be.

""I think we had the best hope of it last year when there was a proposal that was put forward at the WTO and the Biden administration had supported it"" said Thirumurthy.

""But we had European countries that objected to those patent waivers.""

Haiti - NOTICE : Allowed interchangeability of vaccines against Covid-19





The Directorate General of the Ministry of Public Health informs the Departmental Health Directorates Health Institutions partners involved in vaccination and the general population that according to the recommendations of the World Health Organization (WHO) the interchangeability of vaccines used against Covid-19 and its variants is allowed in Haiti.



Indeed the WHO recommends vaccination (2 doses) with the same vaccine as a priority but in the event of unavailability interchangeability between laboratory vaccines: PFIZER (""vaccine: Comirnaty"") MODERNA (""vaccine: Spikevax"") and JOHNSON and JOHNSON (""vaccine: Janssen"") is accepted to complete a vaccination schedule.



Depending on the case:



""The 1st dose of ""Spikevax"" vaccine (MODERNA) can be followed by a 2nd dose of ""Comirnaty"" vaccine (PFIZER) or ""Janssen"" vaccine (JOHNSON and JOHNSON).



Or



""The 1st dose of ""Comirnaty"" vaccine (PFIZER) can be followed by a 2nd dose of ""Spikevax"" vaccine (MODERNA) or ""Janssen"" vaccine (JOHNSON and JOHNSON).





The General Directorate of the Ministry of Public Health is counting on the collaboration of all the actors concerned for the application of this provision at the level of all the points of delivery of vaccination services against Covid-19.



Vaccination:

125492 Haitians (1.08% of the population) +221 in 24 hours have received a 1st dose of ""Spikevax"" vaccine from the MODERNA Laboratory since July 16 2021 date of the first injection through 149 open vaccination centers https://www.haitilibre.com/en/news-35051-haiti-covid-19-list-of-149-vaccination-centers-open-in-the-country.html and 79410 Haitians are fully vaccinated (2 doses 0.68% of the population) + 270 .

Monster Beverage Corporation — the company known for Monster Energy Drink — has acquired the collective that includes Utah-based Wasatch Brewing and Squatters. The company is not acquiring the taprooms the two labels run in Park City and Salt Lake City.

The company behind one of America’s most-popular energy drinks is getting into the beer business buying the brewing collective that includes two well-known Utah beer brands: Squatters and Wasatch Brewing.

Monster Beverage Corporation — best known for its Monster Energy Drink — recently announced it was buying CANarchy a Colorado-based craft brewing collective whose brands include the two Utah labels for $330 million in cash.

Monster vice chairman and co-CEO Hilton Schlosberg announced the sale during an online investor meeting on Jan. 13 explaining that the deal provided the company with “a springboard form which to enter the alcoholic beverage sector.”

The sale Schlosberg said gives Monster a “fully in-place infrastructure including people distribution and licenses along with alcoholic beverage development expertise and manufacturing capabilities in this industry.”

The sale which is expected to close before the end of March includes manufacturing facilities for the beer brands.

What is not included in the sale are physical breweries or taprooms which means the future of Salt Lake Brewing Company’s Utah restaurants is up in the air. CANarchy which is the nation’s sixth-largest craft beer company did not return requests for comment.

Both Wasatch — which was founded in 1986 and is Utah’s oldest microbrewery — and Squatters operate brewpubs in downtown Salt Lake City in Sugarhouse in Park City and at the Salt Lake City International Airport.

The CANarchy sale came three days after a national beer importer United States Beverage acquired Uinta Brewing the state’s largest craft brewer.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmtzbC5jb20vYXJ0aWNsZS81MDMzMjEyNC9wYWlyLW9mLW5hdGlvbmFsLWNvbXBhbmllcy1zd29vcC1pbi10by1hY3F1aXJlLTMtdXRhaC1iZWVyLWJyYW5kc9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Pair of national companies swoop in to acquire 3 Utah beer brands,"Estimated read time: 3-4 minutes

SALT LAKE CITY — Utah beer is making a national splash.

Three of Utah's biggest beer brands are set for market expansion after they were snatched up by national brands within days of each other this month.

It started when Connecticut-based United States Beverage announced it had acquired Uinta Brewing Utah's largest independent craft brewer on Jan. 10. The terms of the agreement weren't disclosed and it wasn't clear if the transaction had been finalized.

Three days later the California-based Monster Beverage Corporation scooped up CANarchy Craft Brewery Collective which includes Squatters Craft Beers and Wasatch Brewery in a $330 million transaction. The cash buyout is pending regulatory approval but is expected to be finalized by the end of the quarter according to the company.

The deal brings Wasatch and Squatters beer brands to the company such as Apricot Hefeweizen and Hop Rising Double IPA. However stand-alone restaurants aren't included. Squatters Craft Beers and Wasatch Brewery were previously acquired by CANarchy Craft Brewery Collective in 2017.

In separate announcements spokespeople for the two purchasing companies said that neither transaction will affect organizational structures or jobs. That means all three Utah breweries will continue to run the same as in the past.

Both acquisitions appear to have instead focused on distribution and market growth making it possible for Utah's beer brands to become more mainstream across the country.

Wasatch Brewery founded in 1986 is Utah's oldest brewery. Squatters opened three years later while Uinta Brewing Company opened in 1993.

""In joining U.S. Beverage we align two exceptionally strong complimentary beverage teams at the perfect time"" said Jeremy Ragonese president of Uinta Brewing in a statement. ""I am thrilled to have the opportunity to collaborate with U.S. Beverage to expand opportunities for our brewery advance our current initiatives and invest in our future.""

Monster Beverage Corporation's purchase is a bit more surprising in that the company is most known for its energy drink and its portfolio mostly consisted of energy drink brands heading into this year.

Hilton Schlosberg the vice chairman and co-chief executive at the company said in a statement that Monster made the purchase in an effort to move into another market sector.

""The addition of CANarchy and its brands to the Monster beverage portfolio represents an excellent opportunity to further grow our already robust product offerings"" added Rodney Sacks the chairman and co-CEO. ""We are excited to build and expand upon CANarchy's existing brands with innovative new products.""

KSL.com was unable to reach anyone at Wasatch or Squatters breweries for comment. In a statement Tony Short the CEO at CANarchy Craft Brewery Collective said the company is ""thrilled"" to join Monster in the new venture and ""expand our product portfolio to meet the ever-changing needs of our customers and to grow our business.""

Utah's craft beer industry contributes to about $415 million toward the state's economy annually according to the Utah Brewers Guild a nonprofit trade organization made up of Utah's craft breweries. These companies also employ about 12000 full-time and part-time employees across the state.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFiYzQuY29tL25ld3MvaXZpbnMtbWFuLXNlbnRlbmNlZC1hZnRlci1tdXJkZXJpbmctd2lmZS13aG8tdHJpZWQtdG8tbGVhdmUtaGltL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Ivins man sentenced after murdering wife who tried to leave him,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 429 Client Error: Unknown Error for url: https://www.abc4.com/news/ivins-man-sentenced-after-murdering-wife-who-tried-to-leave-him/ on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFiYzQuY29tL25ld3MvaXZpbnMtbWFuLXNlbnRlbmNlZC1hZnRlci1tdXJkZXJpbmctd2lmZS13aG8tdHJpZWQtdG8tbGVhdmUtaGltL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,,,

So what are they waiting for? People there keep telling me they need asset prices of merger partners to “normalize” aka fall enough so Goldman remains in control of the combined company.

Well we’re starting to see some “normal.”

A look at the asset prices of potential partners — PNC Bank US Bancorp State Street BNY Mellon some mid-sized asset managers and even potentially brokerage firm Charles Schwab & Co. — are starting to come back to earth as the Fed begins raising interest rates.

Another factor that might force CEO David Solomon’s hand are the obvious holes in Goldman’s business model. Goldman has a long and storied rep killing it in M&A and trading.

Tough competition

But it’s tough having only two horses in the race competing against banking behemoths like JPMorgan. Sure Goldman wasn’t the only bank to experience a hiccup because of trading volatility and higher expenses (the vaunted JPM did as well). But JPM has a big balance sheet far larger than the size of Goldman’s and JPM CEO Jamie Dimon can paper over surprises such as rapid and unexpected increases in compensation costs which bedeviled Solomon in the fourth quarter of 2021 and possibly into 2022.

That’s why Goldman’s earnings miss last week has the Wall Street rumor mill spinning again.

Solomon also knows that if you’re Goldman the merger has got to be the right one or else the CEO will go down in infamy as having evaporated one of the world’s greatest corporate brands.

3 JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon is definitely not in the market for mergers or acquisitions. REUTERS/Carlo Allegri/File

And this is where it gets tricky. As for potential partners Schwab — the world’s most prestigious discount broker — would be an obvious choice. Schwab’s business involves registered investment advisers selling high-end financial products to rich people which complements Goldman’s own very high-end wealth-management business.

But Schwab’s price in Goldmanese hasn’t been normalized enough. The San Francisco-based Schwab has a market value of $168 billion compared to Goldman’s $115 billion. Charles Schwab’s ego — and yes the company’s 84-year-old founder namesake and chairman is still around — won’t let him sell out a bunch of traders in New York if he doesn’t have to.

Both PNC and US Bancorp have lower market caps than Goldman and they would be attractive particularly in a high-interest-rate environment the Fed has signaled; banks make a lot of money when rates rise.

But like Schwab neither has to do a deal. The monetary-policy environment favors their business model over Goldman’s.

Asset managers that might be available — think T. Rowe Price — would get Solly around $1.5 trillion in assets and entry into the lucrative mutual-fund business.

Ask yourself though: Why ­haven’t there been more marriages between fund companies and Wall Street? Answer: Combining those cultures is a little like trying to get Hillary Clinton to play nice with Donald Trump.

With all these variables to weigh the conventional wisdom among bankers is that Goldman isn’t rushing to do anything. Solomon is doing a great job; he’s beat earnings expectations seven times before the recent fourth-quarter 2021 miss. Some analysts say his stock looks cheap compared to competitors like Morgan Stanley but Goldman has the edge in market prowess.

That’s one way to look at it; another way is the reason why Morgan Stanley beat fourth-quarter expectations: It has a huge wealth-management business that stabilized and papered over a trading slowdown.

Again Solomon and his people are smart. They know they have to do a deal and the right one at the right time.

Sensible ‘Fink think’

Larry Fink’s annual letter to CEOs is always must-read material this year even more so because he added a fair amount of common sense to the relentless push by the Biden administration and corporate America to adopt green-energy policies.

Fink the CEO of BlackRock is no stranger to this effort. He’s used his clout as chief of the world’s largest money-management firm ($9 trillion in assets) to prod companies to adopt policies that he believes will transition the country and the world to what’s known as “net zero” carbon admissions.

With that came criticism from conservatives and this column since BlackRock alumni fill the Biden White House. Yes green energy sounds good in practice and Teslas are very popular in Beverly Hills but working-class Americans can’t afford electric cars. Higher oil and gas prices are tax increases on Middle America.

Fink didn’t back off his embrace of green energy. But in the letter he also pointed out how this movement is being hijacked by environmental zealots.

He advocated for a transition that takes into account that “any plan that focuses solely on limiting supply and fails to address demand for hydrocarbons will drive up energy prices for those who can least afford it resulting in greater polarization around climate change and eroding progress.”

Let’s hope his friends in the Biden administration are listening.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiP2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZ0LmNvbS9jb250ZW50LzQyYmI2NjM5LTc5YTAtNDhkYS05ZjIxLTAxZjMzZTczNzBmOdIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Warren Buffett closes in on Cathie Wood as tech stocks tumble,"Print this page

Simply sign up to the US equities myFT Digest -- delivered directly to your inbox.

Cathie Wood’s flagship Ark fund is on the cusp of being overtaken by Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway in the post-pandemic performance table reflecting a dramatic shift in fortunes between the two prominent investors.

Ark Invest’s Innovation exchange traded fund — known by its stock market ticker ARKK — smashed most of its competitors in 2020 thanks to Wood’s aggressive bets on high-growth disruptive companies like carmaker Tesla. That attracted billions of dollars from investors lifting Ark Invest’s overall assets to a peak of $61bn early last year and helped make Wood the face of the bull run.

However many of Wood’s biggest bets started sagging last year and have this year tumbled further in a violent pivot towards cheaper stocks in often less glamorous old-fashioned or otherwise out-of-favour industries.

Meanwhile Berkshire Hathaway’s shares have continued to climb steadily narrowing the performance gap between Buffett’s investment conglomerate and the Ark Innovation ETF since the start of 2020 to just 8 percentage points.

The relative performance of the two fund managers has been particularly stark this month with Berkshire’s stock climbing around 2 per cent since the start of January even as Ark’s biggest ETF has slid 24 per cent. ARKK has now tumbled 43 per cent from the beginning of 2021 to Friday’s close while Berkshire Hathaway is up 34 per cent.

Wood’s Ark Invest ETF and Berkshire Hathaway are often seen as prime examples of two very different investment styles — growth and value respectively. The reversal of their share prices reflects a jarring rotation between the two tribes in recent years.

The start of 2022 has been particularly tough for often-unprofitable technology growth stocks favoured by Wood and buoyant for the steadier equities that are the hallmark of Buffett’s investing style. The power of the shift has raised eyebrows across markets and triggered speculation that a new market environment is looming.

“Does the violence of [the] rotation suggest regime change is upon us and a sustained reversal in the performance of growth versus value is under way?” Wellington Management’s analyst team mused in a recent note.

Growth investors look for companies that may not be profitable but are expanding rapidly often found in hot sectors like technology. Value investors are more price-sensitive and often look for bargains in dowdier or beaten-up industries — such as energy and banking recently.

The improving economic growth outlook and central banks shifting to a more hawkish position on inflation — led by the US Federal Reserve —have been the primary triggers for the investor rotation from growth to value. Value stocks are typically found in sectors that benefit from stronger growth and higher interest rates while the allure of growth stocks dims somewhat in such environments analysts say.

Many fund managers surveyed by Bank of America expect this shift to continue with a net 50 per cent of those asked in January predicting that value would continue to outperform growth — near a record high.

“With the Fed pivoting on towards tightening it is possible for rates to move higher with some persistence” Lisa Shalett chief investment officer at Morgan Stanley Wealth Management said in a note. “That would signal that the value-to-growth rotation we have been observing has some legs in 2022.”

A host of disruptions to production and shipping interacted with soaring demand for goods to produce bare shelves and rising prices. Although goods have been in short supply the number of measures tracking supply-chain woes has proliferated at an impressive pace in recent months. All paint a picture of historically high levels of disruptions and an uncertain path ahead.

One gauge is an “ocean timeliness indicator” published by Flexport an American logistics firm. This reports how long it takes a shipment to move from the supplier’s warehouse to the departure gate of the destination port for two big freight routes out of China: to Europe and America. Three years ago the journey to Europe took just under 60 days and that to America just under 50. Travel times then rose steadily after the pandemic struck. But the trends for the two routes have diverged a little in recent months. Shipping times to Europe have fallen from above 110 days down to 108. Transport to America at 114 days’ total journey time takes longer than ever (see chart top panel)."

Pro teams including the NBA's Detroit Pistons have purchased the artwork. Courtesy: Dylan Sadiq | The College Cuber

It started with a portrait of his favorite basketball player Luka Doncic. Then came fellow NBA star Damian Lillard. International soccer clubs like Manchester United and FC Barcelona took notice. A Major League Baseball team reached out as did the National Football League. Before he knew it Dylan Sadiq was inundated with requests for his mosaics consisting of cubes (as in Rubik's Cubes but copycats). Sadiq 21 is a student at Rutgers University where he's now known as the College Cuber. Sadiq charges $8000 and can make a cube portrait in under four hours. After getting traction on social media platforms and retweets on Twitter teams including the NFL's Tennessee Titans National Hockey League's New Jersey Devils and Major League Soccer's Philadelphia Union and New York Red Bulls sought Sadiq's work. ""This is not what I expected"" Sadiq told CNBC this week. While he was speaking a new mosaic he created of Patrick Mahomes the star quarterback of the Kansas City Chiefs was going viral.

Covid ruined everything

Sadiq is currently in his final semester at Rutgers and plans to graduate with a degree in biomedical engineering. But he doesn't envision pursuing a career in the field. His interests changed during the pandemic as virtual schooling failed to keep him engaged. ""When I was in person I was grinding and studying"" he said. ""I was getting immersed in my education. But since we've been online it's nowhere near the same and it's sad. I feel like I didn't learn much. If you put me in a situation to make an impact I don't even know how I can help."" With no opportunities for in-person internships or hands-on experience in school Sadiq took a detour. He combined his social media accounts and his interest in engineering to master the Rubik's Cube.

Dylan Sadiq known as ""The College Cuber"" charges $8000 for his mosaics made of cubes. Courtesy: Dylan Sadiq | The College Cuber

Sadiq likes to tell the story of how his brother Brandon challenged him at age 10 to solve the cube. His reward was Activision Blizzard's Call of Duty video game. Sadiq said it took him a week to complete the task. In February 2021 Sadiq practiced solving cubes so he could get faster. Then he turned his newfound skill into an avenue for art creation. Sadiq purchased $1000 worth of cubes and figured out how to assemble 560 pieces to create a mosaic of Doncic the Dallas Mavericks' all-NBA guard. He posted it on Instagram in April and the Mavericks noticed sharing it with team's followers. That sparked another mosaic of Lillard with similar results from the Portland Trail Blazers. ""I'm not sure Luka Doncic ever saw the mosaic"" Sadiq said. ""And Mark Cuban I'm not sure he saw it either"" he added. Cuban the owner of the Mavericks told CNBC that he didn't see it. While Sadiq said he's almost certain to forego potential jobs in engineering he doesn't consider his time at Rutgers which can cost over $40000 a year as a waste. He said the university hires him for live events including the football game against Ohio State in October and the inauguration of the new school president. ""That's a huge part of the reason I'm the College Cuber"" said Sadiq. ""Everything was ruined because of Covid. But where I feel valuable is through my artwork.""

Finding motivation in Detroit

In July the Detroit Pistons became the first pro sports team to pay for a mosaic. Sadiq took a trip to the Motor City and created a portrait of Ben Wallace the Pistons' Hall of Fame center. While in town he made the Red Wings a mosaic for their NHL draft party. He also made sales to the NFL's Lions and for the MLB's Tigers he created a mosaic of slugger Miguel Cabrera. The team presented it to him to celebrate his 500th home run. ""I didn't understand what I was doing"" Sadiq said of his experience in Detroit. ""I was just trying to make an experience out of it."" Wandering around Detroit Sadiq said he became interested in the artwork that promoted Black pride in the city. That sparked an idea to expand the College Cuber. ""The artwork was amazing"" Sadiq said. ""One of the things I imagined – I wish I could see the creation live. I felt like it deserved a crowd because artwork like that had a powerful message and looks beautiful. It's colorful vibrant – I wish I could see it being made in front of my eyes.""

Dylan Sadiq said Black artwork in Detroit motivated him to create live performances of the mosaics. He uses over 500 cubes to assemble the artwork in three hours. Courtesy: Dylan Sadiq | The College Cuber

So Sadiq made it happen. He started charging up to $3000 for a live performance and can create a piece of art in about three hours. For a flat fee of $8000 clients can see the live event and keep the artwork. Last September Sadiq turned the College Cuber into a limited liability company. He said that of the $38000 he's generated in revenue since the Pistons became his first paying client in July about $27000 landed as profit. He keeps costs down through a deal with a toy wholesaler and pays no rent on the studio in his mom's basement where he makes his mosaics. ""She'll probably start charging me (rent) now"" he joked. Sadiq projects he can exceed $100000 in sales this year. So far the Chiefs purchased the mosaic of Mahomes and Titans running back back Derrick Henry is seeking a piece. The NFL paid $8000 for a mosaic of league commissioner Roger Goodell after Joe Favorito a well-knowns sports public relations guru and a sports business professor at Columbia University saw a video of one of Sadiq's mosaics. Favorito said he ""was immediately blown away"" and coordinated an introduction. ""Creative talent sometimes we take for granted"" said Favorito. ""I think it's our job to help amplify these young content creators who do something truly unique. His engineering and science background wire him in a particular way and that's how he's able to do it. The fact he can almost do it in his head and then know which pieces to set up and create something remarkable and unique in a few hours is a gift."" It all started on the trip to Detroit. ""I learned so much from that experience"" said Sadiq. ""I went from a kid making videos online to taking action. I would say that weekend in Detroit changed my entire life.""

Making money on social media

Sadiq isn't the first person to monetize cubed mosaics. In 2019 CNBC profiled Italian artist Giovanni Contardi who uses Rubik's products to create art. Contardi sold a mosaic of the late Amy Winehouse for roughly $5000 and gained social media attention for a piece on NBA star LeBron James. Sadiq has been in contact with Rubik's for a brand deal. The company is owned by Canadian toymaker Spin Master which trades on the over-the-counter marketplace. ""The pandemic was a problem for him but it's also created digital opportunities that he can take advantage of"" said Favorito. Social media is central to the College Cuber's business. His Instagram account became eligible for Facebook's bonuses program which pays creators to post reels. Sadiq said he's made about $550 so far from Instagram. He also joined TikTok's creator fund after his mosaic of Mahomes gained over 100000 views. For additional revenue he'll make mosaics and charge clients $750 for the video that companies can post in their advertisements. But Sadiq doesn't charge pro sports teams for the video post. Instead he seeks retweets or reposts to build exposure. Manchester United and Barcelona have helped with soccer fans and the NBA's Orlando Magic also promoted the work on Twitter . Sadiq said he plans to use the extra attention as a force for good. Last year he attended his first NBA game courtesy of the New York Knicks after creating a mosaic of all-star Julius Randle. Sadiq a New Jersey native said visiting Madison Square Garden was ""life-changing"" as he was able to understand further ""the culture and the unity of [sports] fans."" Sadiq now requests that teams that become clients provide free tickets to fans who have never attended a sporting event. ""That's what I want to experience with my artwork – to bring the fans together"" he said. Of building the College Cuber Sadiq said ""It was just something that came to be and I realize the value I bring to people.""

A yogi. A “meditation and breathwork advocate.” And an avid supporter of entrepreneurs.

Those descriptions in his own words apply to native Detroiter Ken Harris. And he wants it known that who he is as a total human being is what directly drives his work each day as national president and CEO of the National Business League the nation’s oldest and largest trade organization serving Black businesses.

Barnes Jr. at their Heritage Optical location in northwest Detroit on Friday Jan. 21 2022. Kimberly P. Mitchell Detroit Free Press

“It's holistic entrepreneurship; there can be no wealth without health — mind body soul and spirit” stated Harris who has an office in the National Business League’s Midwest Regional Office in downtown Detroit. “I make a concerted effort to prioritize self-care just as the pursuit of Black economic freedom is my life’s purpose design and contribution during this lifetime and probably the next. It all ties in together as a lifestyle channeling balance and alignment of right frequency positive energy and high vibrational activity daily which is a part of ancient African traditions.”

Harris 48 speaks fondly of growing up in the late 1970s and '80s on West Buena Vista Street off Petoskey in the Russell Woods area. During his boyhood days he was skilled enough in basketball to eventually earn a full basketball scholarship to Clark Atlanta University. And as an adult he has become adept at the advocacy game by being an active player in the movement to advance Black businesses. Prior to assuming the leadership of the National Business League in 2017 Harris created the International Detroit Black Expo which became one of the largest showcases for Black businesses in the country.

Barnes Jr. at their Heritage Optical location in northwest Detroit on Friday Jan. 21 2022. Kimberly P. Mitchell Detroit Free Press

Feeding off the Detroit Black Expo’s momentum Harris went on to start the Michigan Black Chamber of Commerce which grew to more than 26000 members with chapters throughout the state. He also has been a featured speaker at numerous conferences across the country; and as a subject-matter expert Harris is regularly quoted in national publications. But putting aside his resume and credentials Harris is hoping that 2022 will be the year that his work along with the entrepreneurs it serves is seen and valued completely because as he explains the success of Black businesses should matter to our society as a whole.

“We have to create a conscious culture and cooperative mindset in supporting Black businesses because the opportunity is here to return Detroit as one of the more preeminent epicenters for Black entrepreneurship in the country” Harris said emphatically. “And that would be extremely important to our overall economic recovery and revitalization as a city.”

True to his academic background which includes bachelor’s and master’s degrees in psychology from Clark Atlanta and a Ph.D. in African American/African Studies and economics from Michigan State University it is Harris’ way to defend his statements with extensive supporting data. But when explaining the importance of Black businesses to Detroit as a whole he makes his strongest case by focusing on just a few numbers.

Barnes Jr. at their location in Northwest Detroit on Friday Jan. 21 2022. The Heritage Group is a national brand that is in all 50 states. Kimberly P. Mitchell Detroit Free Press

“Most people wouldn’t believe this but 80% of the roughly 62000 (2019 census data) businesses operated in Detroit are Black owned. But most of those businesses don’t have any additional employees beyond the owner” Harris said. “We should be viewing those businesses as untapped potential for growth because if those businesses were to add one two three or four more people we could quadruple our economy. It’s simple math.”

Harris said a major reason that corporations entrepreneurs and the community at large should support the National Business League is because of the organization’s recent track record. He points to the earlier stages of the pandemic during which he proudly reports his organization generated more than $20 million to assist rebuilding and innovation for national and Detroit businesses.

“In October of 2019 when the experts began talking about this potentially deadly disease our leadership led by National Chairman Thomas W. Dortch Jr. began thinking about how we could best support Black businesses in the event of this economic crisis” said Harris whose organization sells tier-level memberships to businesses and corporate partners. “And then January (2020) it hit the fan. And in March (2020) we had statewide shutdowns. But the NBL had already been partnering with government agencies and companies (including the U.S. Department of Commerce Minority Business Development Agency Stellantis Comerica Bank General Motors and American Express) so that the organization could at least stand in the trenches for Black businesses.”

Along with expressing his gratitude to his governmental and corporate sponsors Harris said Detroiters should be aware that long before the pandemic there have been Black business and civic leaders across the city that have generously and strategically used the resources available to them to support Black businesses in Detroit for decades. When asked to name some of the more noteworthy supporters of Black businesses Harris not wanting to risk forgetting anyone methodically took his time and put together a written list of deceased business and community leaders that he reveres. His list included: Brent Hamilton; Don Barden; Don Davis; Douglass Diggs; Glenn E. Wash; John Barfield; Kathie Dones-Carson; La-Van Hawkins; Marlowe Stoudamire; Mel Farr; Nathan Johnson; O’Neil D. Swanson; Ron Hall Sr.; Sam Logan; and Harris’ “personal mentor” William C. Brooks.

“If this was basketball that list would make up my all-star team in the spiritual realm and it’s fitting because each person supported the dreams of many Black entrepreneurs in this city” said Harris whose great uncle Dr. DeWitt T. Burton founded Wayne Diagnostic Hospital (later called Burton Mercy Hospital) at 271 Eliot with Dr. Chester Ames in 1939. “These people have joined the ancestors but they should never be forgotten especially by Detroit entrepreneurs and the community. And remembering these leaders is a part of holistic entrepreneurship. Sankofa means going back to reclaim to move forward. We as Black people need to take time and learn our history because a people without knowledge of their history origin and culture is like a tree without roots.”

On the same evening that Harris discussed the importance of his list he also shared his plans to visit Heritage Optical Center’s Livernois location on the morning of Jan. 21.

Barnes Jr. at their Heritage Optical location in northwest Detroit on Friday Jan. 21 2022. Kimberly P. Mitchell Detroit Free Press

“As part of the NBL’s national platform I have traveled extensively lectured and met with business leaders across the country; and it’s nothing like coming back home to your roots and visiting my tribe in Detroit’s Black business community like Heritage Optical which has been in business for over 50 years.”

Harris said his visit to Heritage Optical would not be guided by an agenda by choice. But if meeting with the Heritage Optical team leads to the implementation of new ideas down the road he believes that would be a big win.

“Our organization doesn’t try to operate as CEOs for local Black businesses instead we try to help the CEOs” Harris explained. “But we always need to be looking for new and unconventional ways to support Black businesses as a whole because the conventional ways simply haven’t worked well enough for everyone.”

Associate Research

2021 was a disappointing year for emerging markets (“EM”) as an asset class. The MSCI Emerging Markets Index was down 2.5% lagging MSCI ACWI by 21%.

For global asset allocators there are a few key themes to consider for this year as it relates to EM:

A high-inflation environment Rising interest rates The overhang of China regulatory risks/China slowdown under its “zero COVID-19” policy

The WisdomTree Emerging Markets High Dividend Fund (DEM)—which outperformed the MSCI EM Index by 1425 basis points (bps) in 2021—may be well positioned for contending with these themes.

Theme 1: High Inflation

DEM is over-weight in the most inflation-sensitive sectors—Financials Real Estate Materials and Energy—making it a prime candidate we believe for investors in search of inflation hedges.

Unlike the 2000s the current sector weights of the broad MSCI EM Index skew more toward technology and tech-enabled companies making it less of a beneficiary of a potential commodity supercycle.

Theme 2: Rising Interest Rates

As we’ve seen in recent weeks when high-growth names have come under pressure growth stocks that derive more of their value from far-out cash flows are more negatively impacted by higher rates.

Conversely value stocks that have higher current cash flows and pay out higher dividends are more positively impacted.

Out of all of WisdomTree’s ETFs no product screens higher on value and income than DEM with its dividend yield more than 7% and a 6x price-to-earnings multiple.

Theme 3: China Risks

China’s regulatory crackdown on its large tech-enabled companies came as a surprise to markets in 2021. It’s possible that this risk is fully priced-in/appreciated by investors.

Nonetheless concerns about the investability of Chinese companies—accentuated by U.S. government blacklists of Chinese companies—or merely concerns about the disproportionate weight of China in the MSCI EM Index (34%) have led some investors to search for “ex-China” solutions.

By screening on the high-yielding companies in the emerging market universe DEM is naturally under-weight in the high-growth Chinese companies that have accumulated significant weights in the MSCI EM Index. On an aggregate country basis DEM is under-weight in China by 9% with a more modest 25% weight as of December 31 2021.

With just a 15% holdings overlap to MSCI EM DEM can be a useful complementary EM allocation to dial back exposure to China-tech headline risk or used in isolation to navigate the themes we’ve highlighted for this year.

Please read the prospectus carefully before investing.

As the new year begins perhaps the only sure thing is that there will be more surprises to come in 2022. So how can investors prepare for unexpected developments driven by macroeconomic forces the pandemic and geopolitical risk?

Despite bouts of volatility the MSCI World Index advanced by 24.2% in 2021 in local currency terms. US large-caps led the gains and weren’t derailed in late December after the Federal Reserve unveiled plans to accelerate monetary policy tightening in 2022. Developed markets outperformed emerging markets as Chinese stocks struggled. Energy technology and financial stocks outperformed while defensive sectors such as utilities lagged.

Style returns flipped repeatedly. Value stocks rallied through May but growth stocks regained leadership until December. As a result global value and growth stocks delivered similar full-year returns. In the US however small-cap value stocks outperformed smaller-cap growth stocks by a wide margin. The MSCI World Minimum Volatility Index underperformed as investors shunned defensive stocks.

Many Predictions Missed the Mark in 2021

At the start of 2021 few predicted that US stocks would post another year of resounding gains or that Tesla shares would soar to join the ranks of the megacaps. Supply-chain bottlenecks that fueled inflationary pressures were unexpected. Hopes that vaccines would quash COVID-19 were premature with the recent surge of the Omicron variant pushing the world into a third pandemic year. Consensus forecasts were far off macroeconomic and market outcomes.

Perhaps the extreme divergence of forecasts from reality reflects the times we live in. No living investor has experienced a global pandemic or the extraordinary monetary and fiscal policies that have been deployed to keep economies afloat. Without a playbook in hand investors should beware of assuming that trends in recent years will repeat in the future. For long-term investors we believe it’s much more effective to focus on the business forces that drive individual stocks and to assess how they could be affected by macroeconomic developments rather than fickle market forecasts.

Earnings Gains and Economic Distortions

So why did stocks do so well in 2021? The simple answer is because earnings were even stronger than expected across the board as the world emerged from the lockdowns and deep recession induced by COVID-19 in 2020. This was good news for investors because robust earnings provide fundamental support for valuations.

But don’t be dazzled by last year’s earnings. In some cases unusually strong profits reflect economic distortions created by extreme policy responses during the 2020 recession. For example in parts of the retail sector supply-chain constraints have meant fewer discounts for consumers and higher profits than normal; recent earnings may be unsustainably high over the long term when conditions normalize. For credit-sensitive companies investors must ask: What will be a normal level of earnings in more normal credit conditions when consumers aren’t paying down debts with cheap money? Prices for raw materials and key inputs like semiconductors should fall as supply constraints ease reducing profits for producers.

Perspectives on Inflation and Monetary Policy

For many companies inflation looms large. US consumer prices surged by a seasonally adjusted year-on-year rate of 6.9% in November a pace not seen for four decades. Inflation is soaring in many other developed countries.

But rising inflation isn’t necessarily bad for stocks. Moderate inflation fueled by a rebound in demand is usually a sign of a healthy economic recovery. And we don’t expect inflation to stay stuck at the especially high levels seen in late 2021. While wage-driven inflation could be sticky some price pressures are likely to ease as supply chains are unclogged. Our research shows that over the past 50 years stocks have done well during periods of moderate inflation between 2% and 4%. In inflationary environments above 4% US stocks have historically underperformed other regions.

The inflation conundrum will shape central bank policies. Stocks may suffer if sticky inflation provokes a more aggressive monetary policy response than expected. But markets are already gradually adjusting to the prospect of rising rates in the US. There was no taper tantrum in December when US Fed Chairman Jerome Powell announced plans for an accelerated reduction of asset purchases and three rate hikes in 2022. And the policy outlook differs by region. The Bank of England has already started raising interest rates while the European Central Bank is moving much more gradually and has signaled it will refrain from raising rates amid less severe inflation pressures.

As fundamental stockpickers it’s not our job to predict monetary policy. Yet we do need to understand how different types of companies business models and stocks may be affected by changes.

What Could Go Wrong?

Market bears point to several ominous forces. If high inflation endures central banks are likely to tighten monetary policy sooner than had been expected just a couple of months ago—just as GDP growth is slowing from the initial sharp rebound after the 2020 pandemic-induced recession. Efforts to contain COVID-19 have been jeopardized by the rapid spread of Omicron which could slow the release of pent-up consumer and business spending to support the next stage of the recovery. Geopolitical friction from potential Russia-Ukraine hostilities to Iran’s nuclear program and tensions between China and Taiwan could flare up and sour market sentiment.

These are all real risks but we think a bear market is unlikely in 2022. Historically a peak-to-trough decline of at least 20% happens when economies are in recession. Even if inflation reduces the rate of real economic growth the world economy is on course to keep expanding during 2022. AB economists forecast real global GDP growth at 5.9% for 2021 slowing to 4.2% in 2022. That should provide sturdy support for company earnings in our view.

Valuations and Concentration Risk

Still the rapidly changing dynamics of growth inflation and interest rates could affect returns for different types of stocks.

Rising rates push up the discount rate used by investors to evaluate company cash flows. This often leads to multiple compression particularly for higher-growth stocks whose cash flows are further out in the future. As a result the relative performance of different styles will be affected by inflation and monetary policy trends. Higher inflation and faster rate hikes will probably benefit value stocks while easing inflation and more moderate hikes could favor growth stocks. This pattern was evident during most of 2021.

Either way we believe the dominance of the largest US growth stocks could be challenged. In 2021 five megacap stocks outperformed again. As a result US markets—and particularly the growth index—remain heavily concentrated in the largest names. While each company has its merits significant exposure to the entire cohort could leave investors vulnerable if sentiment turns. Instead we believe companies with strong profitability and earnings trading at relatively attractive valuations offer more resilient return potential particularly if rising rates compress valuations dramatically at the more expensive end of the market.

In emerging markets Chinese stocks were hit in 2021 by a wave of regulation debt troubles in the property sector and growth concerns. Yet policymakers continue to seek a balance between supporting near-term growth and pressing ahead with structural reforms underpinning the common prosperity initiative which could add a recovery catalyst for select shares. Stocks in other emerging and frontier markets countries did well last year and attractive long-term opportunities can still be found across the developing world.

As the new year begins we believe investors should check their allocations. Given the uncertainties we believe a balance of exposures to different regions and styles with a focus on high-quality stocks and reasonable valuations will underpin a successful strategy in 2022. For all equity portfolios integrating analysis of environmental social and governance issues in fundamental research will play an increasingly vital role in developing investment insights to drive returns.

Strategic Antidotes to the Element of Surprise

Big data tools can also provide advantages. For example our data science team has developed a tool to identify supply-chain hot spots in real time. We’ve also deployed an application to alert when a stock is getting hot on Reddit so portfolio teams can prepare for potential speculative activity.

One principle can guide investors through uncertain times: develop insight into what a company’s normal earnings trajectory will look like after temporary effects fade. By forecasting how businesses and cash flows will evolve over three to five years investors can gain conviction in a stock’s ability to deliver on return expectations when faced with macroeconomic or market curve balls. Sticking to a disciplined process—based on company fundamentals—is the best strategic antidote to short-term surprises.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiP2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZ0LmNvbS9jb250ZW50LzFhZjY3MjJlLWJhMmYtNDY4My1hZTMyLWY4YjA4MjBmMTI4ZNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,US investors shun currency-hedged ETFs despite outsized returns,"Print this page

Currency-hedged exchange traded funds remain resolutely out of favour in the US — despite posting outsized returns in the past year.

The largest currency-hedged ETFs in the US all comfortably outperformed their unhedged equivalents last year helped by the strength of the dollar which rose 6.7 per cent against a basket of six other developed world currencies as measured by the DXY index.

Yet the collective assets of US-listed currency-hedged ETFs — which neutralise the movement in foreign currencies against the dollar while still providing exposure to overseas assets — ended last year at just $16.9bn according to Bloomberg data.

This tally is down by almost three-quarters from the year-end high of $61.3bn in 2015 despite the wider US ETF industry having more than tripled in size since then according to figures from ETFGI.

The popularity of currency-hedged ETFs exploded in the US in 2014 and 2015 as the DXY index rallied by 23 per cent a significant rise for a developed world currency in two years eroding returns for unhedged US investors.

The greenback’s gains were particularly sharp against the Japanese yen which plummeted after the government of then Prime Minister Shinzo Abe pursued an aggressive policy of quantitative easing.

“Currency-hedging took off after Abe got elected in Japan. Abe was like the [latter-day US Federal Reserve] on steroids” said Eric Balchunas senior ETF analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence with WisdomTree’s Japan Hedged Equity Fund (DXJ) a leading beneficiary.

“Then currency-hedging started in Europe. They were outperforming by 20-30 [percentage] points” he added.

“WisdomTree shot up the league tables. Every asset manager that had an international equity ETF launched a currency-hedged alternative to give investors a choice” said Todd Rosenbluth head of ETF and mutual fund research at CFRA Research.

“They were positioned as a core international equity replacement to reduce the risk of currency fluctuations let alone the potential to benefit from currency fluctuations.”

The decline in the format was almost as swift however as a slide in the dollar index from a high of 103.3 in December 2016 to 89.4 in early January 2021 eroded returns and meant dollar-based investors were better off using unhedged vehicles to access European and Japanese stocks.

Last year though the greenback rallied again with the DXY index gaining 6.7 per cent allowing hedged ETFs to shine once again.

The iShares Currency Hedged MSCI EAFE ETF (HEFA) for example at $3.4bn the largest currency-hedged fund returned 19.4 per cent comfortably ahead of the 11.2 per cent gain of iShares’ MSCI EAFE ETF (EFA) its unhedged sister product.

Three hedged eurozone equity products Xtrackers’ MSCI Europe Hedged Equity ETF (DBEU) WisdomTree’s Europe Hedged Equity Fund (HEDJ) and iShares’ Currency Hedged MSCI Eurozone (HEZU) all returned between 23 and 24 per cent while their unhedged peers the iShares MSCI Eurozone ETF (EZU) and Vanguard European Stock Index Fund ETF (VGK) made 13.6 per cent and 16.4 per cent respectively.

Yet despite these successes the 26.9 per cent uptick in the sector’s assets last year lagged behind the rate of asset growth witnessed by US-listed ETFs at large and were suggestive of very limited inflows.

“About 70-80 per cent of the money left. Then [currency-hedging] started working again and nobody cared” said Balchunas.

“There are probably some investors that will use them but not the mass market. They are not into currency-hedging any more. [The ETFs] still have more assets than they did before Abe [in 2012] but [it’s a case of] rags to riches to barely above rags” he added.

Rosenbluth believed investors had been “burned” by the poor showing of currency-hedged funds in recent years.

“They are less likely to come back for a second bite of the apple. They touched something that was too hot they got burned and now they are hesitant to do it again.”

Moreover Rosenbluth said many of the currency-hedged funds that launched at the height of the boom have since disappeared due to lack of demand.

Even WisdomTree the manager that propelled the original boom has largely moved on Rosenbluth argued.

“[WisdomTree] was such a big proponent of currency-hedging. It was where they put their marketing dollars” he said but the New York-based issuer has since diversified into areas such as thematic ETFs cryptocurrencies and leveraged and inverse products.

“I don’t think the education of investors as to the benefits of currency-hedging is as prevalent” Rosenbluth added.

Can the strategy yet make a comeback?

Andrew Jamieson global head of ETF product at Citi said if there was a “compelling argument to buy [say] a currency-hedged Japanese index product people would” but compared to the mid-2010s ETF investors were now “spoilt for choice”.

“We have battery tech clean energy online gambling meme stocks crypto ETFs you name it. That is what is capturing the imagination [of retail investors]. That is the reason [currency-hedged] products are not the titans they used to be.”

Balchunas said that once investment strategies slipped out of favour it could be hard to regain widespread acceptance.

“Once something stops working and people move out of it and then it starts working again can you get investors back? What we found with currency-hedging is not in that case.”

Rosenbluth also saw little chance of a large-scale comeback. US retail investors “are often home biased and like to take the simple route and likely don’t have the confidence to forecast currency movements” he said.

“They are too comfortable with the devil they know rather than learning more about the devil they don’t know.”

For a comeback to happen “we would need to see a prolonged period of outperformance” he said.

However subscriber growth has been slowing ever since that initial surge cooled off in the spring of 2020.

Last week investors finally lost their patience. Weaker-than-expected fourth-quarter subscriber growth and a fairly dismal forecast for the first quarter caused Netflix stock to plunge 22% on Friday. Yet this pullback could make Netflix an attractive value stock in 2022.

Management finally admits that growth is slowing

Netflix's subscriber growth moderated significantly in 2021. The company grew its paid streaming membership base by 18.2 million users last year. For comparison Netflix reported a record 36.6 million paid net additions in 2020 and it averaged just over 28 million paid net additions over the previous two years.

In short Netflix expanded at a much slower pace in 2021 than it did before the pandemic. Its growth slowdown looks even more dramatic in percentage terms. In 2021 Netflix grew its paid streaming subscriber base just 9% compared with a 26% increase in 2018.

Despite clear signs that growth was slowing Netflix executives spent most of last year arguing that the deceleration in subscriber growth was temporary.

Management finally acknowledged the obvious in conjunction with the company's Q4 earnings release. Netflix reported 8.3 million paid net subscriber additions for the fourth quarter -- slightly below its Q4 2020 performance and its forecast -- and it expects to add just 2.5 million subscribers in the first quarter (down from 4 million a year ago). CFO Spence Neumann said that subscriber retention has been healthy but the pace of new member acquisitions hasn't recovered to pre-pandemic levels.

Netflix stock plummets

Investors punished Netflix stock viciously for the subscriber miss. Barely more than two months ago the shares hit an all-time high of $700.99. The stock had already retreated to just above $500 before Netflix's earnings report largely because of a broader sell-off in high-flying tech stocks. Netflix stock dropped another 22% after the earnings report pushing the shares below $400 for the first time in almost two years.

The abrupt pullback is hardly surprising in light of Netflix's recent results and forecast. For many years Netflix has been valued as a growth stock. Now investors have to reckon with the fact that Netflix may be close to saturating many of its markets. If the company's Q1 guidance is any indication subscriber growth could moderate again to roughly 6%-8% this year.

To be fair price increases should keep Netflix's revenue growing at a double-digit rate in 2022. (Netflix is raising the prices of most plans by 10% to 11% in the U.S. and Canada this quarter.) But that was a small consolation to investors as Netflix risks further handicapping its subscriber growth if it raises prices too much.

Could Netflix be a good value stock?

While Netflix is falling out of favor with growth-focused investors it is starting to gain merit as a value stock. Despite its somewhat disappointing subscriber gain Netflix posted earnings per share (EPS) of $1.33 last quarter easily beating its guidance and the analyst consensus of $0.82. This brought its full-year EPS to $11.24.

Netflix expects its operating margin to retreat somewhat in 2022 -- largely due to exchange rate pressures -- following several years of extremely strong margin expansion. Still margin expansion will likely resume in 2023. Even with slower subscriber growth the operating leverage inherent in Netflix's business model should enable the company to grow revenue faster than expenses for the foreseeable future.

Netflix stock's recent plunge has left it trading for just 35 times the company's 2021 earnings. While that still represents a premium to the market it's a far cry from a year ago when the stock traded for over 80 times earnings.

Moreover analysts on average expect Netflix's EPS to reach roughly $15 in 2023 and $19 by 2024. Netflix shares now trade for just 21 times the 2024 analyst consensus.

Looking ahead earnings growth and free cash flow may become more important drivers of Netflix stock than subscriber gains. If the company can keep its costs under control the stock could perform well for a new crop of value investors even if subscriber growth never reaccelerates.

(NASDAQ:PAYX) Goes Ex-Dividend Soon,"Some investors rely on dividends for growing their wealth and if you're one of those dividend sleuths you might be intrigued to know that Paychex Inc. (NASDAQ:PAYX) is about to go ex-dividend in just 4 days. Typically the ex-dividend date is one business day before the record date which is the date on which a company determines the shareholders eligible to receive a dividend. It is important to be aware of the ex-dividend date because any trade on the stock needs to have been settled on or before the record date. Meaning you will need to purchase Paychex's shares before the 28th of January to receive the dividend which will be paid on the 24th of February.

The company's upcoming dividend is US$0.66 a share following on from the last 12 months when the company distributed a total of US$2.64 per share to shareholders. Last year's total dividend payments show that Paychex has a trailing yield of 2.2% on the current share price of $118.67. Dividends are a major contributor to investment returns for long term holders but only if the dividend continues to be paid. We need to see whether the dividend is covered by earnings and if it's growing.

See our latest analysis for Paychex

Dividends are typically paid out of company income so if a company pays out more than it earned its dividend is usually at a higher risk of being cut. Paychex is paying out an acceptable 73% of its profit a common payout level among most companies. Yet cash flows are even more important than profits for assessing a dividend so we need to see if the company generated enough cash to pay its distribution. Dividends consumed 74% of the company's free cash flow last year which is within a normal range for most dividend-paying organisations.

It's positive to see that Paychex's dividend is covered by both profits and cash flow since this is generally a sign that the dividend is sustainable and a lower payout ratio usually suggests a greater margin of safety before the dividend gets cut.

Click here to see the company's payout ratio plus analyst estimates of its future dividends.

Have Earnings And Dividends Been Growing?

Businesses with strong growth prospects usually make the best dividend payers because it's easier to grow dividends when earnings per share are improving. If earnings fall far enough the company could be forced to cut its dividend. Fortunately for readers Paychex's earnings per share have been growing at 11% a year for the past five years. Paychex has an average payout ratio which suggests a balance between growing earnings and rewarding shareholders. This is a reasonable combination that could hint at some further dividend increases in the future.

Many investors will assess a company's dividend performance by evaluating how much the dividend payments have changed over time. Since the start of our data 10 years ago Paychex has lifted its dividend by approximately 7.8% a year on average. It's encouraging to see the company lifting dividends while earnings are growing suggesting at least some corporate interest in rewarding shareholders.

The Bottom Line

Is Paychex worth buying for its dividend? Higher earnings per share generally lead to higher dividends from dividend-paying stocks over the long run. However we'd also note that Paychex is paying out more than half of its earnings and cash flow as profits which could limit the dividend growth if earnings growth slows. Overall it's hard to get excited about Paychex from a dividend perspective.

In light of that while Paychex has an appealing dividend it's worth knowing the risks involved with this stock. For example we've found 1 warning sign for Paychex that we recommend you consider before investing in the business.

A common investment mistake is buying the first interesting stock you see. Here you can find a list of promising dividend stocks with a greater than 2% yield and an upcoming dividend.

*Stock Advisor returns as of January 10 2022

Jon Quast: I don't mean to put you on the spot here Chris but as I'm thinking this through is there advantage for PayPal to create its own stablecoin versus simply supporting a stablecoin that's already in existence? What does PayPal get out of this?

Chris MacDonald: Well that is interesting. I know we're going to talk in the next piece about a company that's using another stablecoin. I think there's pros and cons to both.

PayPal probably would get more transparency into what's actually backing the stablecoin and they would have control over that. There's probably that control aspect that they would want. Like I said with Tether for example there's been some questions about what assets exactly are backing the token. In terms of transparency that can be a little bit opaque let's say in the crypto world.

There's probably maybe a strategic reason for PayPal to step in and do it themselves or try to do it themselves. Having a regulatory approval or a stamp of approval for a stablecoin would be great for a company like PayPal and theoretically could be a competitive advantage I guess over other large tech companies looking to do the same thing.

Maybe they're looking for a first-mover advantage.

But it is an interesting development and that's an interesting question to why not just use Tether or USDC or some of the others.

Jason Bateman's crime drama Ozark has been a favorite amongst subscribers and critics through its first three seasons. The fourth installment of the series will be its last but Netflix is dividing that final season into two parts extending its victory lap. The first half of that final season was released on Netflix this past week.

Friday saw the debut of Ozark's first final season episodes on Netflix. It should come as no surprise that Ozark quickly shot up the charts given how much excitement there was surrounding the show's return. After all Ozark was already popping up into the Top 10 in preparation of the final season's debut.

Sunday's edition of the Netflix Top 10 shows that Ozark is once again the most popular title on the entire service with the arrival of new episodes. Ozark is listed as the number one TV show or movie on Netflix and it will likely remain in that position for some time.

But at the same time it has also received critical acclaim and been strongly defended by the artistic community and beyond.

The film — the latest in a long line of international remakes of the 2016 Italian hit Perfect Strangers and starring Capernaum writer-director Nadine Labaki and Egyptian star Mona Zaki — tells the story of a group of friends in Lebanon who one night play a game where they make all the calls and text messages on their phones available to one another unveiling various secrets and scandals. While it was expected to become a major talking point and push boundaries — featuring a gay character and other storylines considered taboo and rarely discussed outright on screen in many Middle East countries — few would have anticipated the immediate wave of controversy it would provoke.

On Twitter the film sparked a barrage of homophobic messages accused by some of encouraging homosexuality and “moral degradation” and “putting Western ideas in a conservative society.” One user accused the film of being a “crime” adding that not only should it be banned but that everyone involved should face “prosecution.”

Recently films such as Eternals and West Side Story have been blocked from cinemas across much of the Middle East due to their inclusion of LGBTQ issues (even if minor). As a film being streamed online however Perfect Strangers didn’t need to go through regional censors and was able to land on Netflix uncut.

Much of the anger has originated in Egypt (Perfect Strangers is an Egyptian co-production) particularly against Zaki who in one scene of the film removes her underwear (although nothing is seen as there is no nudity at all). One Twitter user accused Zaki — a huge star in Egypt — of being part of an overseas agenda to force social change.

Spilling outside of social media Egyptian lawyer Ayman Mahfouz claimed that the film was a “plot to disrupt Arab society” and that Zaki was the “champion” of it all. According to reports Mahfouz — who in 2020 sued the transgender son of Egyptian actor Hesham Selim over an Instagram post he claimed was promoting homosexuality — is now preparing a lawsuit to remove Perfect Strangers from Netflix.

Various Egyptian news sites and the Arabic edition of CNN have also reported that film has even been addressed by Egyptian politician Mustafa Bakri who in a statement to the speaker of Egypt’s House of Representatives said it “incites homosexuality and betrayal.”

In Egypt unlike countries in the Gulf homosexuality isn’t officially illegal although it is regularly cracked down upon in society.

But with the fiery backlash has come a flood of support for the film with many people praising both the storyline — for raising real-life topics often ignored — and the production itself while also criticizing the attitudes of those attacking it.

“Arabs losing their minds over a movie that shows cheating spouses teenagers being teenagers gay characters; makes me realize that we are not 1% close to discussing topics like civilized beings instead of enclosing ourselves in a hypocritical regressive bubble” said one user. Meanwhile a hashtag from supporters that translates as #ImAlsoAPerfectStranger has emerged.

One of Egypt’s biggest international stars Amr Waked known for roles in Syriana Lucy and Salmon Fishing in the Yemen tweeted that anyone who was “afraid” that a movie could change their faith didn’t actually have faith. Many other famous names have come forward with their support for the film and it stars including Hend Sabry Ahmed Fahmy and Ghada And El Razek.

Meanwhile the Egypt’s professional actors union issued a statement in solidarity with for the cast of Perfect Strangers particularly Mona Zaki calling for the preservation of “creative freedom” and emphasizing the role of the arts in addressing issues in society.

For all the furor in terms of numbers Perfect Strangers has been a huge success so far topping Netflix’s viewing charts in the region and helping underline the drive for more localized content. In France it’s currently the sixth most popular title on the platform.

The Hollywood Reporter has reached out to both Netflix and the producers of Perfect Strangers for comment."

My first cell phone back in the 1990s was from Radiofone. Was it the first local cell phone company? What’s its history?

Dear reader

Brothers Larry and James Donald Garvey were among the pioneers of mobile telecommunications in the New Orleans area when they founded Radiofone in 1958.

According to The Times-Picayune their parents had established a local doctor-calling service Doctor’s Exchange in 1921. The sons used that experience to launch their Radiofone paging service. They added mobile telephone service in 1960 though the technology was primitive when compared to today.

Radiofone’s Cellular One portable phone was introduced in 1984 soon after the service was demonstrated at the World’s Fair. It cost $99 per month with 45 free minutes of usage each month and extra charges above that.

“Our portable telephone can go with you wherever you are” Larry Garvey said in a 1986 Times-Picayune article. “We are a society that is never at home or in one place all the time. It’s difficult to stay in touch. People don’t like to stay by the phone 24 hours a day as in the past. The cellular car telephones and portables answer that need.”

As one of only two wireless service providers in the New Orleans area until 1994 (the other early company was BellSouth Mobility) Radiofone grew to serve 300000 subscribers in 11 states with annual revenue of $132 million.

The company was known for its philanthropy and TV commercials featuring Buddy Stall (who was also a local author and historian) promoting various charities.

In 2000 Radiofone was purchased by SBC Communications Inc. (the successor to Southwestern Bell Corp.). Later that year SBC sold Radiofone to Alltel Corp. of Little Rock for $400 million. Alltel was purchased by Verizon in 2008 creating the nation’s largest wireless carrier at the time.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFiYy5uZXQuYXUvbmV3cy8yMDIyLTAxLTI0L3ByaW1lLW1pbmlzdGVyLXNjb3R0LW1vcnJpc29uLXdlY2hhdC1hY2NvdW50LWhpamFja2VkLzEwMDc3Njg5ONIBKGh0dHBzOi8vYW1wLmFiYy5uZXQuYXUvYXJ0aWNsZS8xMDA3NzY4OTg?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,China accused of foreign interference after Prime Minister Scott Morrison's WeChat account hijacked and renamed,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.abc.net.au/news/2022-01-24/prime-minister-scott-morrison-wechat-account-hijacked/100776898 on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFiYy5uZXQuYXUvbmV3cy8yMDIyLTAxLTI0L3ByaW1lLW1pbmlzdGVyLXNjb3R0LW1vcnJpc29uLXdlY2hhdC1hY2NvdW50LWhpamFja2VkLzEwMDc3Njg5ONIBKGh0dHBzOi8vYW1wLmFiYy5uZXQuYXUvYXJ0aWNsZS8xMDA3NzY4OTg?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMioAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5uemhlcmFsZC5jby5uei9zcG9ydC9hdXN0cmFsaWFuLW9wZW4tc2VjdXJpdHktZ3VhcmRzLW9yZGVyLXdvbWFuLXRvLXJlbW92ZS1zaGlydC1mZWF0dXJpbmctbWVzc2FnZS1zdXBwb3J0aW5nLXBlbmctc2h1YWkvTklERkVHMzVHNzdPSFFIT05EM0NWVkdXN0Ev0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Australian Open: Security guards order woman to remove shirt featuring message supporting Peng Shuai,"Shuai Peng  36 of China made a social media post on November 2 that accused former China vice-premier Zhang Gaoli of sexually assaulting her in 2017.

Tennis Australia is standing by its decision to order an Australian Open spectator to remove a shirt that featured a message in support of Peng Shuai amid ongoing concerns for the Chinese tennis star's welfare.

Over the weekend footage emerged of security and police at the Australian Open requesting a spectator remove her shirt which featured an image of Peng on the front and the message ""Where Is Peng Shuai?"" on the back.

The video ends with police saying that Tennis Australia was permitted to confiscate any paraphernalia that referenced Peng.

Tennis Australia told News Corp Australia that it feared for Peng's safety but that fans were not permitted to make political statements with their clothing at the Australian Open.

""Under our ticket conditions of entry we don't allow clothing banners or signs that are commercial or political"" a Tennis Australia spokesperson said.

""Peng Shuai's safety is our primary concern. We continue to work with the WTA and global tennis community to seek more clarity on her situation and will do everything we can to ensure her wellbeing.""

Victoria Police told News Corp Australia it was aware of ""a small number of protesters"" outside the Australian Open.

""As part of the conditions of entry to the Open nothing politically motivated can be displayed"" a police spokesperson told News Corp.

""Police engaged with the patrons in support of security referencing the conditions of entry as they exited the venue.""

A GoFundMe page seeking to distribute Peng Shuai shirts at the Australian Open raised $6500 within 24 hours of being uploaded this weekend.

In November Peng 36 made a social media post that accused former vice-premier Zhang Gaoli of sexually assaulting her in 2017.

""Why did you come and look for me again take me to your house and force me into sex? I have no proof and it would be impossible for me to keep any evidence. You denied everything afterwards"" Peng is quoted as having written.

The post was deleted within half an hour and Shuai was not heard from for weeks afterwards prompting #WhereisPengShuai to trend on Twitter.

In December Peng resurfaced and denied having claimed she was sexually assaulted in an interview with a Singaporean network.

The tennis community has continued to express its concern for Peng's welfare during the Australian Open.

""Hopefully it's not too long until we see her back out here"" said Australian world number one Ash Barty after her win on Wednesday.

Nick Kyrgios said he believed the situation ""obviously"" required attention.

""Obviously if that's still something that's ongoing it needs to be found out and kind of I guess we need more awareness about it. We can't forget about her"" Kyrgios said.

""We have to use our platforms as athletes. I think we're obligated to do that we're obligated to speak up and you know get to the root of what's happening and why it's happening.""

Victoria Azarenka a member of the WTA Player Council said she had not heard from Peng directly.

""There hasn't been that much development in terms of contact with Peng Shuai even though from our side we will continue to make any and all efforts to make sure that she is safe she feels comfortable"" Azarenka said.

""Hopefully we will get to hear from her personally at some point. I think that's the goal the main goal right now.""

Advocates say a utility-backed bill imperils rooftop solar in the Sunshine State,"CNN —

Steve Rutherford had a unique mission as a Navy SEAL: Help the military harness the power of the sun.

Traces of his work could be seen around Afghanistan starting in 2010. The solar panels he installed turned the desert’s relentless rays into energy that kept bases operating even when cut off from diesel lines.

When he retired from the military in 2011 Rutherford expected Florida would be a more inviting climate to install solar panels than war-torn Afghanistan. He started Tampa Bay Solar and within a decade grew it into a 30-person operation with plans to expand. But now the retired commander told CNN he is fighting for his livelihood.

A bill moving through the state legislature backed by a powerful utility company would slash the financial benefits of rooftop solar panels. Opponents of the legislation – including environmental groups solar builders and the state NAACP – say if it passes a fast-growing green power industry would be turned off overnight casting a dark cloud over solar’s prospects in the Sunshine State.

“It’s going to be a crusher for the solar industry” said Rutherford who predicted he would have to lay off much of his workforce. “For 90% of the people that work for me this will be a significant blow for their pocketbooks.”

Lawmakers across the country are weighing the future of residential solar as the industry enters the next phase of its growth. The promise of energy independence a cleaner power source and lower electric bills has attracted tens of thousands of customers to solar. Its rise in popularity has threatened the business model of traditional utilities which for decades relied on customers that had no alternatives to their neighborhood electric company. Some utilities are pushing back.

The implications of the fight are acutely felt in Florida where sunshine is an abundant commodity and residents face an existential crisis from climate change. Solar industry insiders say the bill that Florida’s lawmakers are considering would make it one of the least welcoming states to residential solar in the country and would eliminate thousands of skilled construction jobs.

“It would mean that we would have to close our business here in the state of Florida and pivot to another state” Stephanie Provost chief marketing officer for Vision Solar told lawmakers at a recent committee hearing.

At the center of the debate is the amount solar-powered homes are reimbursed for the excess energy their panels pump back into the grid. It’s an arrangement known as net-metering and it’s the law in about 40 states. Some customers generate enough power to lower their utility bills to zero dollars.

Like many states Florida homeowners are reimbursed at roughly the same rate power companies charge their customers usually in the form of a credit on their monthly bill. Sen. Jennifer Bradley a Republican who represents parts of north Florida has introduced legislation that could cut that rate by about 75% and open the door to electric companies charging solar customers monthly minimum fees.

Bradley contended that the existing rate structure created in 2008 was intended to help jump-start rooftop solar in Florida. She told a Senate committee that non-solar homes are now subsidizing an industry that is “mature with many competitors large publicly traded companies and substantially reduced prices.”

Despite its recent growth solar’s foothold in Florida lags behind many states. About 90000 households are solar-powered which is 1% of all electric customers in the state. Florida ranks 21st in the country in solar residential systems per capita according to an industry analysis from the Solar Energy Industries Association the national trade organization for solar energy builders. In comparison California – where regulators are also considering utility-backed changes to its net-metering policy – has 1.3 million customers fitted with solar panels.

Advocates of rooftop solar in Florida see a familiar foe behind the legislation: Florida Power & Light the state’s largest electric utility and one of the most prolific political donors in the state.

A draft version of the bill Bradley introduced was delivered to her by a Florida Power & Light lobbyist on October 18 according to emails first reported by the Miami Herald and provided to CNN by the Energy and Policy Institute a watchdog organization that targets fossil fuel and utility interests.

Two days later Florida Power & Light’s parent company NextEra Energy made a $10000 donation to Women Building the Future a political committee affiliated with Bradley according to state campaign finance records. The committee received another $10000 contribution from NextEra in December those records show.

In an emailed statement to CNN Bradley did not address the political contributions or the utility’s involvement in drafting the legislation. She said she filed the bill because “I believe it is good for my constituents and the state.”

“Requiring utilities to buy electricity at the same rate they sell it is not surprisingly a poor model that results in solar customers not paying their equitable share to support the operation and maintenance of the electric grid that they use and which utilities are legally required to provide” she said in the statement.

Ahead of this year’s legislative fight Florida Power & Light and NextEra donated $3 million to political campaigns and committees. They have given to both parties but mostly to Republicans and GOP-aligned groups. Republicans have majority control of the Florida House and Senate. The bill passed a Senate committee earlier this month on a 6-2 vote.

Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis who ran on a promise to “drain the Tallahassee swamp” of special interests has not publicly taken a side. DeSantis spokeswoman Christina Pushaw said the governor was aware of the net-metering legislation but did not have a comment. Florida Power & Light and NextEra have donated a combined $42000 to DeSantis since he took office including a $12000 donation in December according to state campaign finance records.

“Like all legislation we will be monitoring them as they move through the process” Pushaw said.

Chris McGrath a spokesman for Florida Power & Light acknowledged the company has worked with lawmakers on the legislation but declined to discuss specifics about the company’s political donations. NextEra Energy did not respond to a request for comment.

“Since every aspect of our business is impacted by policy decisions at every level of government it’s important for us to be involved and be a leader in issues that affect our customers our employees and our company” McGrath said.

Solar’s expansion to the middle class

In Florida where sunshine is bountiful solar was slow to catch on frustrating environmentalists who see it as a key tool in the battle against climate change. Wealthy earth-friendly Floridians once made up the bulk of the market for solar power.

But drive through many Florida neighborhoods these days and you’ll find solar panels on the pitched roofs of modest middle-class houses. Households with income less than $100000 now make up about half of the solar market according to a 2021 US Department of Energy analysis. In Florida the median income of solar-powered homeowners fell by 11% in the last decade.

Falling production costs and increased competition have certainly contributed to this trend. But advocates say net-metering has also made solar affordable to the average homeowner.

The upfront price tag of equipment puts solar out of reach for most single-family homes averaging $19000 not including roof improvements according to the National Renewable Energy Laboratory. But homeowners can finance or lease solar panels over 15 to 25 years based on the expected savings on their energy bills from net-metering.

The proposed legislation “will cost thousands of Floridians … their ability to recover their investment in rooftop solar” said Dave Cullen president of the Sierra Club Florida.

Jodi James of Melbourne Florida told a Senate committee hearing earlier this month that she and her husband retired to Florida and saved for 15 years to outfit their 1300 square-foot home with solar panels. They hoped to someday be energy independent and perhaps put the money that would’ve gone toward an electric bill toward enjoying their twilight years.

With her fixed income James is worried lawmakers are pulling the rug out from under her.

“I’m just frightened that the investment that we made is suddenly going to be eaten up by fees” James said.

The bill as written would allow current solar customers to receive energy credits at the existing rate for the next 10 years. Many solar customers could still see dramatic increases in their electric bill before they’ve paid off their lease or loan.

Florida Power & Light says when solar customers like James receive credits for their energy production they’re not paying for their share for services the utility provides. In Florida utilities must be prepared to serve all customers including those with solar installations. It costs power companies money to harden the grid against storms clear power lines and complete other maintenance and those costs get shifted to everyone else.

Florida Power & Light says solar customers cost its 5.5 million non-solar customers $30 million a year – or about 50 cents a month – and the amount will nearly triple by 2025 and continue to grow as solar’s popularity spreads.

Solar advocates say that figure doesn’t account for the benefits of rooftop solar such as lessening the demand on utilities to build expensive new plants the costs of which are often passed along to ratepayers. They also note that taxpayers have for decades subsidized the fossil fuel industry.

“We believe anyone should have the right and ability to put solar on their roof if they choose to but we do not believe everyone should be forced to pay for that decision” McGrath the FP&L spokesman said.

At a committee hearing for the bill Bradley called net-metering a “regressive policy” that benefits the well-off at the expense of people who can’t afford solar.

In an op-ed Lewis Jennings the environmental & climate justice chair for the NAACP Florida State Conference said rate increases pushed by utility companies not solar-powered homes are “felt by poor communities where too many residents already live without consistent access to electricity.”

The lesson in Nevada

Florida Power & Light insists it is a part of the green energy revolution. The company has plans to build 30 million solar panels by the end of the decade. Pictures of solar farms and commitments to clean energy are scattered across the website of its parent company NextEra Energy.

“World’s largest producer of wind and solar energy” NextEra declares in large print on its main page.

Six years ago Florida Power & Light led a campaign to alter the solar landscape through a ballot referendum. The company and other utilities tried to convince voters the measure promoted solar in Florida according to campaign finance records.

In fact it would’ve led to more fees and less competition for solar rooftop customers. The effort drew national scorn when a political adviser for an industry-affiliated think tank was caught on audio seeming to acknowledge the deceptive nature of the campaign calling it “a little bit of political jiu-jitsu.” Newspaper editorial boards lined up against it as did labor unions and singer Jimmy Buffet and the referendum failed.

The lack of certainty in Florida has kept some of the nation’s largest solar companies from entering the state said Abigail Ross Hopper president and CEO of the Solar Energy Industries Association. If more businesses felt comfortable operating here it would further drive down costs and Florida could become a national leader in rooftop solar energy she said.

“As we think nationally about what we need to do to achieve President Biden’s goal of being carbon free the residential solar piece is a critical part” Ross Hopper said.

Bradley told a Senate committee she doesn’t anticipate a slowdown in solar construction in Florida if her bill passes. She said that didn’t happen in other states where net-metering rates were reconsidered.

Few states have adopted changes to net-metering as drastic as what is proposed in Florida Ross Hopper said though one tried: Nevada.

Nevada’s desert made the state an attractive market for solar companies and a burgeoning industry to lease sell and install panels on homes was ready to take off. Then state regulators decided in 2015 to cut the net-metering rate to a percentage of what it was and implemented new fees.

Travis Miller the owner of Great Solar Basin who was working for a national firm at the time said the solar industry immediately went dark. California-based SolarCity eliminated 550 jobs blaming the new net-metering rate. Other companies pulled out of the state.

“Most of the local shops went out of business and closed their doors” Miller said. “There wasn’t an industry at all.”

After two years of public outcry and a lobbying campaign from Tesla maker of solar batteries Nevada reversed course. But the effects of the action in 2015 lingered Miller said. Solar builders remained wary of regulators he said and investment was slow to take off.

Miller suggested Florida should tread carefully.

“It created a lot of skepticism and nervousness on the part of consumers” Miller said. “They thought: ‘What happens if next year they decide to change the rules again?’”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZvb2wuY29tL2ludmVzdGluZy8yMDIyLzAxLzIyLzQtc3RvY2tzLXdpdGgtdHJhY2stcmVjb3JkLW1ha2luZy1pbnZlc3RvcnMtcmljaGVyL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,4 Stocks With Exceptional Track Records of Making Investors Richer,"Down years are few and far between with these moneymaking stocks.

Whether you're a new investor or a tenured veteran who's been putting your money to work on Wall Street for decades you're likely aware that the stock market doesn't move up in a straight line. Although its major indexes have a knack for increasing in value over time even the best stocks have down years.

However a select group of highly profitable time-tested stocks have shown that down years can be few and far between. The following four companies have exceptional track records of generating positive total returns including dividends for investors and have made them a whole lot richer.

Costco Wholesale

Most people are probably familiar with warehouse club Costco Wholesale (COST 1.69%). Whether you have a membership to its stores or have been stuck in the line of traffic leading up to its mammoth shopping locations Costco and its more than 560 U.S. stores are tough to miss.

What you might not realize is that including dividends paid Costco has delivered a positive total return in 18 of the past 20 years. Between Dec. 31 2001 and Dec. 31 2021 Costco generated a total return for investors of more than 1700%!

One of the most obvious reasons Costco is such a success story is its size. Similar to how Walmart throws its weight around to undercut local mom-and-pop stores on price Costco uses its size and deep pockets to buy goods in bulk. Buying large quantities of goods often means getting each unit for a lower price. Costco is then able to pass along these savings to its members and regularly undercut grocery chains and retailers on price.

This leads to the next key factor of the Costco operating model: Its memberships. Since the margins on grocery items are razor-thin Costco relies on membership fees to buoy its margins and keep customers loyal to the brand. Getting members into its stores also encourages them to shop around and purchase higher-margin discretionary items such as clothes electronics and jewelry.

Lastly since a sizable percentage of the items Costco sells are basic need goods the company often generates highly predictable cash flow -- and Wall Street values predictability.

UnitedHealth Group

Another well-known company with an exceptional track record of making its investors a lot richer is UnitedHealth Group (UNH 0.39%). The largest healthcare stock by market cap has also generated a positive total return for shareholders in 18 of the past 20 years with an aggregate gain in excess of 3300% over two decades.

UnitedHealth is arguably best known for providing individual and commercial health insurance. Just like any insurance company periods where claims and/or expenses spike higher do occur from time to time. However the great thing about insurers speaking from a business standpoint is that they have little issue passing along premium price hikes to cover their expenses. Whether it's higher costs experienced from treating COVID-19 patients or the expectation of higher future medical care expenses UnitedHealth Group's insurance division is consistently profitable.

What investors might not realize is that subsidiary Optum is the far more intriguing segment. Optum is itself split into three divisions (OptumRx OptumInsight and OptumHealth) with a focus on everything from providing pharmacies with prescription refills to supplying hospitals and medical organizations with software designed to streamline their operations. Optum is growing considerably faster than UnitedHealth's insurance segment and it should bring in juicier long-term margins.

Thanks to Optum's rapid growth and the transparency of the company's traditional insurance operations there's a good likelihood that UnitedHealth's incredible run will continue.

NextEra Energy

When it comes to consistency virtually none of the thousands of listed securities have delivered the green quite like electric utility stock NextEra Energy (NEE 1.58%). Since the end of 2001 NextEra has had only one year where it's produced a negative total return (2008). With 19 positive total returns over 20 years NextEra has rewarded its patient shareholders with aggregate gains of around 2400%.

If you're noticing a recurring theme among these stocks it's that businesses providing necessary goods and services tend to perform well. If you own a home or rent there's a very good chance you'll need electricity and/or natural gas to live comfortably. Demand for NextEra's services won't change much from year to year. Furthermore utility operations tend to be monopolies or duopolies which provides a steadiness to the cash flow of electric utilities.

What sets NextEra Energy apart from its peers is the company's renewable energy focus. NextEra plans to spend an aggregate of $50 billion to $55 billion on new infrastructure projects between 2020 and 2022. The company is already generating more capacity from wind and solar power than any other utility and this is unlikely to change anytime soon. These clean-energy projects are helping to reduce electricity generation costs which ultimately is what's lifted NextEra's compound annual growth rate to the high single digits in a notoriously slow-growing sector.

Additionally NextEra's traditional utility operations provide cash flow stability. By ""traditional"" I mean those not powered by renewable energy. Having some of its operations regulated by public utility commissions ensures the company doesn't have to contend with potentially volatile wholesale electricity pricing.

Berkshire Hathaway

A fourth and final stock with a nearly unbeatable track record of making its long-term shareholders richer is Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.A 0.96%) (BRK.B 1.01%).

Aside from generating a positive return in 16 of the past 20 years the company's Class A shares (BRK.A) have averaged an annual return of better than 20% since the beginning of 1965. Between Dec. 31 1964 and Dec. 31 2021 Berkshire Hathaway produced a gain of more than 3600000% for its investors.

If you're wondering why Berkshire Hathaway is such a successful investment look no further than its CEO billionaire Warren Buffett. The Oracle of Omaha as he's known has a knack for investing in and/or acquiring cyclical businesses in the financial utility consumer staples and information technology sectors. Even though recessions are an inevitable part of the economic cycle Buffett understands that periods of economic expansion last many times longer than recessions. He's playing a numbers game with time as his greatest ally.

Berkshire Hathaway's success is also a reflection of Buffett and his investing team loading the company's investment portfolio with dividend stocks. In 2022 Berkshire is on track to collect more than $5 billion in dividend income which equates to a yield relative to cost basis of around 5%. Dividend stocks are almost always profitable and time-tested making them the perfect place to park money for the long run.

Riding Warren Buffett's coattails has been a profitable venture for a long time.",,,,,,,,,

Work started on both the Chevy Chase and Purdy projects earlier this month the company recently announced.

Customers may experience brief gas shutoffs over the course of the next five months.

The Chevy Chase Road project is taking place in the area just west of the Mansfield YMCA and is bounded by Edgewood Road Woodland Road Andover Road and Lexington Avenue.

Crews will install nearly 9000 feet of new pipe in the area which will serve 165 homes.

Across town on the east side the Purdy Street project will take place in the area bounded by Ashland Road (U.S. 42) East 5th Street and the Norfolk-Southern railroad tracks.

Crews there will install nearly 3000 feet of new pipe that will serve 20 properties.

New pipes are more durable

Columbia Gas and its contractor Mid-Ohio Pipeline are beginning the project by installing the new mainline and then will move on to service lines for individual properties.

Interior gas meters will be moved outside the building during the project.

The company says the new plastic pipe has several benefits including enhanced safety features and the ability to bend to the earth's contour while expanding and contracting with shifting temperatures.

Once installed the modernized system will last longer and reduce the amount of future maintenance required.

The project requires only a short interruption to natural gas service. Columbia Gas crews or contractors will contact affected customers to schedule appointments for the brief shutoff and relight.

All employees and contractors carry identification cards with their name and photograph and must show them upon request.

After more than a decade of planning and dreaming construction on a segment of the long-anticipated Shelby rail trail is set to begin over the next few months.

City Manager Rick Howell said a section of the trail they are calling Phase 1a which runs from the north side of Marion to Grover Street will go out for bidding in the first quarter of this year and depending on pricing and approval by City Council members construction will start soon after. Other portions of the trail are being designed.

Howell said the section of the trail that is within city limits — approximately between Dekalb and Grover streets — is under engineering design and is expected to be completed by late spring or early summer.

“Engineering basically entails all the normal things you do…surveying evaluation of existing drainage systems and looking at what has to happen in order to meet DOT standards to cross a DOT street which may include additional signage and striping” he said. “It will be a design of the trail so it is ready to go to bid and meet DOT standards.”

Howell said the engineering phase was funded by local dollars in anticipation of paving the way for future grant awards.

“If you show there is local commitment to the project it helps with grant applications” he said.

Funding the rest of the project

So far the city has received a total of $6.1 million in grants for the project.

The total cost is estimated at $25 million.

Howell said that is a high end estimate but given the rising construction costs and pricing the city wanted to be conservative in its planning.

Funding still remains an issue. The city applied for a large grant in 2020 and 2021 but did not receive it. They intend to apply again this year.

Howell said it is a very sought after grant with around 700 applications submitted and only around 70 projects funded.

“It is very competitive with lots of worthwhile projects so you really have to be on top of your game and meet administrative priorities” Howell said. “We've improved our application each time and we'll be debriefing and working with our grant writer and other partners to make it better.”

The city intends to resubmit in July.

“I want to be optimistic and we'll do our best to compete for the funding. We think it will be a very worthwhile project not only for Cleveland County but the surrounding regions. From a wellness perspective transportation perspective recreation perspective” he said. “We’re hopeful it will be an economic catalyst for the areas that are served by the rail trail.”

He cited the Swamp Rabbit Trail in Greenville South Carolina as an example of the economic development opportunities that trails bring with them.

In addition to the $6.1 million in state and federal funding already received Howell said the city has a little over $1 million in private donations and the city has set aside around $4 million over the past several years.

“Obviously how much we are able to do depends on bids that come in and cost of materials” he said. “We will move forward and spend the money we do have but pricing may mean we have to break it into smaller segments and complete it in smaller segments as we go along.”

There will not be any city funding spent outside city limits.

Building the trail

The city has to factor in crossings of heavily trafficked DOT streets including Warren and Dekalb which have to comply with DOT standards. In addition there are three trestles that are located on the trail that still have to be evaluated for structural integrity. Howell said the city is planning for extensive work on those trestles.

“It may not be as expensive or difficult as we’re anticipating but we’re trying to be conservative and careful about our approach to the project” he said.

Steady progress is being made.

Last May a litter sweep sponsored by the city’s storm water division and Keep Shelby Beautiful was held on Market Street to clean up the area that will one day be a depot park featuring an amphitheater splash park playground and other amenities.

A copy of the rail trail master plan is available for viewing on the city of Shelby’s website. The plan displays a map of the route details the project goals and includes public comments from prior meetings including the various features people would like to see integrated into the trail such as water fountains dog stations and increased connections to neighborhoods.

The trail which has been years in the making is set to see the first phase begin as soon as February.

The trail follows the former Norfolk Southern train tracks and will wind through the heart of Shelby through Patterson Springs and end at the South Carolina state line near Earl.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMipAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5mb3gxM21lbXBoaXMuY29tL25ld3MvdHJlbmRpbmcvYW1lcmljYS1zLWZ1bm5pZXN0LWhvbWUtdmlkZW9zLXdpbGwtaG9ub3ItYm9iLXNhZ2V0LXdpdGgtd2Vla2x5LXNlZ21lbnQvYXJ0aWNsZV84ZWU3ZmY5My02NjU1LTU0MGEtOTZlNy1hNDJmMzE5YjEwNzQuaHRtbNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,'America's Funniest Home Videos' will honor Bob Saget with weekly segment,"Memphis TN (38111)

Work started on both the Chevy Chase and Purdy projects earlier this month the company recently announced.

Customers may experience brief gas shutoffs over the course of the next five months.

The Chevy Chase Road project is taking place in the area just west of the Mansfield YMCA and is bounded by Edgewood Road Woodland Road Andover Road and Lexington Avenue.

Crews will install nearly 9000 feet of new pipe in the area which will serve 165 homes.

Across town on the east side the Purdy Street project will take place in the area bounded by Ashland Road (U.S. 42) East 5th Street and the Norfolk-Southern railroad tracks.

Crews there will install nearly 3000 feet of new pipe that will serve 20 properties.

New pipes are more durable

Columbia Gas and its contractor Mid-Ohio Pipeline are beginning the project by installing the new mainline and then will move on to service lines for individual properties.

Interior gas meters will be moved outside the building during the project.

The company says the new plastic pipe has several benefits including enhanced safety features and the ability to bend to the earth's contour while expanding and contracting with shifting temperatures.

Once installed the modernized system will last longer and reduce the amount of future maintenance required.

The project requires only a short interruption to natural gas service. Columbia Gas crews or contractors will contact affected customers to schedule appointments for the brief shutoff and relight.

All employees and contractors carry identification cards with their name and photograph and must show them upon request.

Bubba Watson is one of the most prominent names on the PGA Tour. Bubba is well-known for his unique style of play and has 12 PGA Tours and two major championship wins in his career so far. The shot shapes he produces especially off the tee are a treat to watch.

Furthermore he is also a master of escape shots from difficult lies. Bubba has escaped unharmed from diabolic lies especially early in his career. Hence people also refer to him as a master of escape shots. And now it looks like these qualities have been transferred to his son as well.

No fewer than 30 youth-based Non-Governmental Organisations in the North have on Sunday met in Kano to appeal to Dr Ibrahim Abubakar Lajada a US-based businessman to run for Nigeria’s President in 2023.

The groups under the umbrella of Lajada Support Group said with the presidential assent to Not TooYoung To Run Bill into law in 2018 their candidate has what it takes to rescue the country from what they described as failed leadership.

According to the Chairman of the group Salisu Idris Abdullahi they were impressed by Lajada’s antecedents hence their call on him to run for the position.

He said “Though our candidate is based in the United States as a successful businessman he has always had Nigeria’s interest at heart.

“He has contributed a lot in empowering many youths in the country secured admission for many settled hospital bills for less privileged as well as supported many IDPs.”

Abdullahi also said the Borno State indigene Lajada will help Nigeria actualise the dream of having a youth as President.

Similarly the Secretary-General of the group Mustapha M. Basheer said it was time for youths to stand up and fight for themselves as there was no better time than now.

“If politics is all about the number we the youths have it and are ready to take what rightly belongs to us and we believe Lajada has the quality of shouldering this responsibility” Basheer added.

Northern Community Board councillor John Douglas said the Lumsden and Mossburn Community Pool committees approached the council last year requesting ongoing funding to help with pool operating costs.

The Mossburn pool committee requested $8625 and the Northern Southland (Lumsden) pool committee requested $9200.

Mr Douglas said the Northern Community Board considered the request and proposed the establishment of a new targeted rate and fund to provide annual assistance to the two pools the initial amount of $17825 to be included in the next annual plan.

Before any decision the community would be consulted but a report from the council’s finance development co-ordinator Nicole Taylor suggested two options.

The first would have the entire Northern Community Board area paying the same fixed amount of $19.29 and the second of a combined Five Rivers hall Lumsden hall and Mossburn hall rating area in which properties would pay $24.28.

Cr Douglas said a swimming pool was a vital asset for those communities.

""As a councillor I’m of the firm belief that every child should have the opportunity to learn to swim and develop water safety skills.""

Some pools in the Southland district had a pool rate a fund which was added on to residents’ rates in that particular area however those areas relied only on community funding he said.

He believed implementing this levy would take some of the pressure off them.

""It would assist them and not only keep them open but functioning to a standard ... We don’t want just pools we want quality covered and heated pools.""

Mossburn Community Pool committee member Margaret Taylor agreed saying it had been ""awfully hard"" to keep operating that way.

She appreciated the support and efforts of the community but believed a targeted rate was the right move to avoid any closure.

Lumsden Northern Southland pool chairman Pete Wilkinson said the trust had had funding shortages issues for years even decades.

He said ongoing funding was paramount to enable the trust to keep the pool open.

The council and the board would consult the community about the options and any new rate even if approved would not be coming into force until July 2022.

The aircraft is intended for the US Navy. This E-2D is equipped with Delta System / Software Configuration [DSSC] Build 3. This software configuration gives the aircraft improved operational capability as well as better refueling technology.

The US Navy still has orders for this type of aircraft but they are under the MYP 2 contract which means that this year their production will begin and next year will begin deliveries of aircraft. According to Northrup Gruman they will be equipped with much more modern software and engineering technologies to respond to changing and evolving threats.

What is DSSC?

DSSC has several versions. DSSC 3 which is integrated into the latest E-2D Advanced Hawkeye has an automatic identification system a built-in national tactical receiver updates to the fire control system and a better version of the air refueling system.

DSSC 4 is the sweetest software solution in this category. As the name suggests in addition to this version having everything included in DSSC 3 version 4 has a multifunctional system for tactical radio transmission of information network technologies for tactical targeting secret chat router for Internet protocol sensors for anti-electronic warfare etc.

DSSC 5 is being developed and is expected to have a sensor network that will help store and merge data from all five military domains received during the mission. Version 5 is expected to have a better system for countering electronic warfare.

Development and testing of the latest known version – the 6th. DSSC 6 is expected to appear in the 2026 budget. In addition to improving all the functionality of the latest versions DSSC 6 must have a much better and more powerful combat identification system than existing known systems as well as the next generation of anti-EW systems.

More on the E-2D Advanced Hawkeye

This aircraft is important to the US military because it plays a key role in reconnaissance or actual combat operations. Its main function is to analyze the intelligence gathered or that of combat operations to analyze them and to develop real-time strategies for orienting US troops by air sea and land.

But even though the United States was a pioneer in this technology government interest in taking it from the lab to orbit has been tepid at best.

The U.S. military is now trying to revive the effort. The Naval Research Laboratory launched an experiment in 2020 aboard the Air Force’s X-37B space plane that successfully tested hardware to capture sunlight and convert it into direct current electrical energy.

The NRL experiment however was only an in-space demonstration and not intended to beam the power captured in space back to the ground. That capability will be attempted by the Air Force Research Laboratory if all goes as planned in a $100 million experiment projected to launch in 2025.

AFRL’s mission named Arachne was conceived in response to a military logistics challenge: securing reliable energy sources at austere bases where there is no infrastructure. Today fuel used to operate field generators has to be transported by trucks turning these convoys into targets for adversaries. AFRL believes that access to solar power from space could help reduce this vulnerability.

The lab also argues that greater government support for this technology would send a signal to the commercial industry and investors which would broaden market opportunities.

“Much like the Global Positioning System which started out as a military asset and transitioned to a technology now used by people everywhere this solar power beaming system could transition to broader usage providing solar energy regardless of weather time of day or latitude” said AFRL.

Arachne took a leap forward last month when AFRL and Northrop Grumman engineers at a lab in Linthicum Maryland demonstrated a so-called “sandwich tile.”

The tile is a critical component that enables energy collection and conversion explained AFRL program manager James Winter. One side of the tile has a panel of photovoltaic cells that receive solar energy. The electronics in the middle convert direct current to radio-frequency signals and the other side of the tile has an antenna to beam power.

Now that the tile has been demonstrated Winter said the next step will be to figure out how to encapsulate an array of nine tiles into a rocket fairing so it can be launched to orbit on a Northrop Grumman ESPAStar – a bus that can ride as a secondary payload on big national security rockets. Once the satellite is deployed RF energy will be beamed to a receiving station on the ground and a rectifying antenna will then convert the RF into usable power.

Winter said the 2020 experiment aboard the X-37B provided helpful insights on the sandwich module which are being applied to Arachne.

Jay Patel vice president of Northrop Grumman’s remote sensing programs pointed out that photovoltaics and RF conversions are well-understood technologies. “But what we’ve been able to do is translate them into the environment that we want them to operate in” he added. “Arachne is not a lot of invention but innovation in how we translate some of these tried and true technologies into a mission that’s really going to open up different avenues.”

Space-based solar power got a major endorsement in a November report published by the U.S. Space Force the Defense Innovation Unit and AFRL. “Incorporating space solar power into America’s space and climate agenda could not only provide yet another arrow in the quiver to address climate change but provide novel ways to engage industry the public and international partners” said the report.

But despite military advocacy and technological progress space-based solar power faces a steep uphill climb.

“Proponents have portrayed it as the smartest most comprehensive energy solution available while detractors have seen it as an insanely expensive scheme that will never work” noted the Aerospace Corp. in a recent study.

As is typically the case in these arguments the reality lies somewhere in between. But as scientists working on the Arachne mission point out we will never know the true potential of this technology until the U.S. invests sufficient resources to find out.

This will place it into its desired orbit nearly 1 million miles away from the Earth at what is called the second Sun-Earth Lagrange point or “L2” for short.

Mathematically Lagrange points are solutions to what is called the “restricted three-body problem.” Any two massive gravitationally significant objects in space generate five specific locations – Lagrange points – where their gravitational forces and the centrifugal force of the motion of a small third body such as a spacecraft are in equilibrium. Lagrange points are labeled L1 through L5 and are preceded by the names of the two gravitational bodies that generate them (the big one first).

While all Lagrange points are gravitational balance points not all are completely stable. L1 L2 and L3 are “meta-stable’ locations with saddle-shaped gravity gradients like a point on the middle of a ridgeline between two slightly higher peaks wherein it is the low stable point between the two peaks but it is still a high unstable point relative to the valleys on either side of the ridge. L4 and L5 are stable in that each location is like a shallow depression or bowl atop the middle of a long tall ridge or hill.

So why send Webb to orbit Sun-Earth L2? Because it is an ideal location for an infrared observatory. At Sun-Earth L2 the Sun and Earth (and Moon too) are always on one side of space allowing Webb to keep its telescope optics and instruments perpetually shaded. This enables them to get cold for infrared sensitivity yet still access nearly half the sky at any given moment for observations. (See video embedded below.) To view any and every point in the sky over the course of time requires merely waiting a few months to travel farther around the Sun and reveal more of the sky that was previously “behind” the Sun.

Moreover at L2 Earth is far enough away that the roughly room-temperature heat radiating from it won’t warm up Webb. And because L2 is a location of gravitational equilibrium it is easy for Webb to maintain an orbit there. Note that it is simpler easier and more efficient to orbit around L2 than to dwell precisely at L2. Furthermore by orbiting rather than being exactly at L2 Webb will never have the Sun eclipsed by Earth which is necessary for Webb’s thermal stability and for power generation. In fact Webb’s orbit around L2 is larger in size than the Moon’s orbit around Earth! L2 is also convenient for always maintaining contact with the Mission Operations Center on Earth through the Deep Space Network. Other space-based observatories including WMAP Herschel and Planck orbit Sun-Earth L2 for the same reasons.

Generally speaking getting a spacecraft to Sun-Earth L2 is fairly straightforward but Webb’s architecture added a wrinkle. Karen Richon Webb’s Flight Dynamics lead engineer describes getting Webb to L2 and keeping it there:

“Think about throwing a ball straight up in the air as hard as you can; it starts out very fast but slows down as gravity pulls it back towards Earth eventually stopping at its peak and then returning to the ground. Similar to your arm giving the ball energy to go up a few meters from the Earth’s surface the Ariane 5 rocket gave Webb energy to go the great distance of 1.1 million kilometers but not quite enough energy to escape Earth’s gravity. Just like the ball Webb is slowing down and if we allowed it would eventually stop and fall back towards Earth. Unlike the ball Webb wouldn’t return to the Earth’s surface but would be in an extremely elliptical orbit with a perigee altitude of 300 kilometers and an apogee altitude of 1300000 kilometers. Utilizing thrust every three weeks or so from small rocket engines aboard Webb will keep it orbiting L2 looping around it in a halo orbit once every six months. “So why did the Ariane not give Webb more energy and why did Webb need course correction? If the Ariane had given Webb even a little bit too much energy than needed to get it to L2 it would be going too fast when it got there and would overshoot its desired science orbit. Webb would have to do a significant braking maneuver by thrusting toward the Sun to slow down. Not only would that big burn cost a lot of propellant it would be impossible because it would require Webb to turn 180 degrees in order to thrust toward the Sun which would have exposed its telescope optics and instruments directly to the Sun thus overheating their structures and literally melting the glue that holds them together. Mounting thrusters on the telescope as a way to direct braking thrust was infeasible for a number of reasons and was never a design option. “Therefore Webb requested just enough energy from the Ariane rocket to ensure that we would never have to do a retro burn but would always require a burn from the observatory to precisely make up the difference and place it in the desired orbit. The Ariane 5 targeted Webb so accurately that our first and most critical burn was smaller than we had to plan and design for leaving more fuel for an extended mission!” —Karen Richon Webb Flight Dynamics lead engineer NASA’s Goddard Space Flight Center

How Did It Go?

United Launch Alliance (ULA) successfully launched another mission for the U.S. Space Force’s Space Systems Command (SSC). On the USSF-8 mission their Atlas V 511 rocket carried two identical Geosynchronous Space Situational Awareness Program (GSSAP) satellites — GSSAP-5 and GSSAP-6 — that were inserted directly into a near-geosynchronous (GEO) orbit. This mission marked the first launch for the company in 2022 and the first and only planned flight of the Atlas V 511 configuration. The rocket lifted off from Space Launch Complex-41 at Cape Canaveral Space Force Station in Florida.

USSF-8 Mission

GSSAP-5 And GSSAP-6

The USSF-8 mission launched two GSSAP satellites that will operate in a near-geosynchronous orbit approximately 36000 km (22300 miles) above the equator. In conjunction with ground-based radars and telescopes these satellites will support surveillance operations as a dedicated Space Surveillance network (SSN) sensor for the U.S. Space Force’s SSC.

The GSSAP satellites work in pairs: one of them operates below the geosynchronous belt while the second one operates above it. The main objective of the GSSAP-5 and GSSAP-6 is to track objects in the heavily-trafficked geosynchronous belt that a lot of companies use for placing their communication satellites. This will help not only to manage traffic and avoid collisions but also to detect potential threats from space objects. Moreover the GSSAP-5 and GSSAP-6 satellites will be able to adjust their orbits to approach and image other satellites.

The GSSAP satellites are developed by the Air Force and Orbital Sciences Corp. (now Northrop Grumman Corp). The first two GSSAP satellites were launched on July 28 2014 atop a Delta IV M+(42) rocket. The second pair of these satellites was deployed on August 19 2016 again using a Delta IV M+(42) rocket.

Even though the GSSAP was declassified in 2014 some of the characteristics of the satellites are still unknown. As can be seen in the render above two deployable solar arrays generate power for the satellite. It is also reported that most likely they use Orbital’s GEOStar-1 bus as a satellite bus and mono-propellant propulsion system to adjust their orbit.

What Is The Atlas V?

The Atlas V is an expendable medium-lift launch system and member of the Atlas rocket family. The rocket has two stages. The first is a Common Core Booster (CCB) which is powered by a single RD-180 engine that burns kerosene (RP-1) and liquid oxygen (LOx). This is accompanied by up to five strap-on solid rocket boosters (SRB). The second stage is the Centaur upper stage which is powered by one or two RL10 engines and burns liquid hydrogen (LH 2 ) and liquid oxygen (LOx).

The CCB is 3.8 m (12.5 ft) in diameter and 32.5 m (106.5 ft) in length. This stage is capable of producing 3.83 MN (860200 lb) of thrust at sea level. Each SRB can provide additional 1.6 MN (371550 lb) of thrust. The Centaur second stage in turn is 3 m (10 ft) in diameter and 12.6 m (41.5 ft) in length and is capable of producing 101.8 kN (22900 lb) of thrust.

What Does 511 mean?

Atlas V rockets have a three number configuration code. The first number represents the fairing diameter size in meters. The second number denotes the number of solid rocket motors (SRMs) which attach to the base of the rocket. The number of SRMs for a 4 meter fairing can range from 0 – 3. However the 5-meter fairing Atlas V can support up to 5 SRMs due to the different aerodynamic properties of the fairing. For the USSF-8 mission there was one SRM attached to the center core. The third number denotes the number of engines on the Centaur Upper Stage.

CNN —

Cruise ships turning around mid-voyage. People placed in quarantine cabins on board. Voyages abruptly canceled. Crew members trying to appease unhappy customers.

It all feels a bit like deja vu but the cruise industry is soldiering on as the Omicron coronavirus variant makes its presence felt at sea as it has on land.

In the early days of the pandemic cruise ships became synonymous with Covid-19 as virus-hit vessels struggled to disembark passengers and crew. The cruise industry subsequently shut down for months and while some European journeys recommenced in summer 2020 cruise ships didn’t navigate US waters for another year.

When cruising did return it was with stringent rules designed to mitigate the impact of Covid-19. This combination of mask-wearing testing vaccinations and increased medical facilities led Martyn Griffiths of industry body Cruise Lines International Association (CLIA) to tell CNN Travel in June 2021 that cruise ships were “one of the safest vacation environments available today.”

Vessels weren’t guaranteed virus-free CLIA said but the goal was to avoid severe illness and major disruption.

Six months later as the highly transmissible Omicron spreads around the world the situation seems a little more precarious.

Health and safety

“There is no doubt that the Omicron variant has cast a great deal of uncertainty into the travel and tourism sector overall” said Bari Golin-Blaugrund another CLIA representative in a recent CNN Travel interview.

Golin-Blaugrund made the case that while there have been several recent reports of Covid outbreaks on board the world’s cruise ships Covid cases are a “minority.”

She said cruise lines remain confident in their health and safety measures adding that these measures “are proving successful to virtually eliminate severe outcomes” as hospitalizations are minimal.

While fully vaccinated people are not immune to Omicron Dr William Schaffner an infectious diseases expert at Vanderbilt University told CNN Travel that “booster shots improve the individual’s protection against getting severe disease.”

However Schaffner cast doubt on cruise lines’ ability to control the spread of the virus on board even with fully vaccinated passengers and crew and additional levels of protection in place such as mask wearing and regular testing.

“It’s not so clear how much boosting helps to diminish transmission especially in such high potential transmission circumstances where people are so close together for such prolonged periods of time” he said.

Schaffner suggested any traveler who chooses to go on a cruise at present is likely aware of the potential risk and uncertainty and will have weighed this up before boarding.

“I think they must share a certain confidence in what it is that both the cruise line industry as well as their fellow passengers are doing in order to mitigate the risk” he said.

“And to a degree they must feel themselves if not invulnerable but likely to survive an infection. I mean you would have to go through that kind of thinking before you decided to go cruising at the present.”

Certainly unlike the passengers caught up in the Covid fallout of Spring 2020 those on cruise ships today are aware Covid-19 is a risk in the sense that they could catch it and fall ill or the virus could disrupt travel plans.

British traveler Joy Bailey experienced first-hand what happens during a Covid outbreak at sea when she flew with her husband from the UK to Florida to embark on a Christmas/New Year sailing on board the Celebrity Equinox in late 2021. The 2850 passenger capacity vessel operated by Celebrity Cruises was sailing at 60% capacity.

Bailey told CNN Travel that she accepted “we’re all going to get Omicron at some time” but hoped the decreased capacity and other measures enforced by Celebrity Cruises would mitigate the likelihood of her catching the virus on board.

From the outset Bailey said she was a little uncomfortable as many passengers ignored Celebrity Cruises’ face mask policy.

Five days into the journey she tested positive. Bailey spent the rest of the voyage confined to a quarantine cabin joined there by her husband when he tested positive a few days later.

Isolating on the ship was “good and it was bad” according to Bailey.

The couple had a balcony cabin so they could sit in the sun to pass the time. But they also describe waiting an hour on the phone to order meals.

When the voyage came to an end Bailey told CNN Travel she was advised by Celebrity Cruises to head to a hotel she and her husband had pre-booked in Fort Lauderdale. The couple now faced a longer stay there before their return to the UK as Bailey’s husband was still isolating.

The cruise company told them to contact its “care team” on shore to get assistance re-arranging their flight but according to Bailey the couple struggled to get through to the number provided. When they did get through they were told no help could be given because they weren’t in Celebrity’s designated isolation hotel.

“That was a crazy moment” said Bailey. In the end they contacted their travel agent who contacted Celebrity directly and changed their flight.

Celebrity paid for Bailey’s stay in isolation. She and her husband were also offered up to $100 a day to spend on food. The cruise line is also covering the days they lost on the cruise itself.

“All in all it wasn’t too dreadful” said Bailey. “But the experience with Celebrity on the ground in Miami was awful. I think they were just overwhelmed.”

This was Bailey’s first cruise in the wake of Covid. Pre-pandemic she would cruise every couple of years. Testing positive on board hasn’t put her off traveling by sea she said but she’d like to see better coordination between the ship and the ground staff.

“We deeply regret this guest’s experience as it was not in keeping with the high levels of care and service we pride ourselves on providing” a Celebrity Cruises spokesperson told CNN Travel in response to Bailey’s claims.

“We quickly learned from the experience and have since introduced a dedicated concierge team to ensure the needs of any guests impacted onboard are met every step of the way.”

Changing itineraries

The current Omicron chaos has also led cruise lines to cancel sailings sometimes mid-voyage.

Passenger Daniel Jay Park said the unexpected termination of his January 9 sailing on board the Norwegian Gem – a 294-meter-long ship which was sailing with a reduced capacity of 800 – didn’t impact his enjoyment of the voyage.

The ship set sail from New York before cutting its voyage short at the Caribbean island of St Maarten. Park told CNN Travel that when letters were sent to cabins to inform of the cancellation passengers were “confused” and “a little frazzled.”

While Park and his husband were disappointed to miss the scheduled Caribbean ports they decided to make the most of the circumstances assured by the fact that everyone on board would have been vaccinated.

“I trust science and technology” Park told CNN Travel.

The letter also stated that travelers would be entitled to full refunds.

Passengers were still able to freely roam around the ship and enjoy activities said Park. Essentially the voyage became a “cruise to nowhere” – something some many have opted into voluntarily in recent months in countries including the UK Singapore and Hong Kong.

Park said the experience didn’t put him off cruising he also has nothing but praise for the way Norwegian Cruise Line handled the unexpected situation.

“We were just having so much fun and they were so good to us” he said. “And now that the cruise was free I’m like ‘Oh my god we have all the money back on our credit cards let’s go again.”

Park said that the cruise line didn’t give an exact reason for Norwegian Gems’ cancellation.

A spokesperson for Norwegian Cruise Line told CNN Travel that Norwegian Gem was impacted by the “current fluid public health environment” which means the cruise line must “make tough decisions and often times with very short notice.”

The spokesperson confirmed passengers were refunded with their original form of payment and also provided with $100 onboard credit per stateroom and given a “Future Cruise Certificate” valued at 50% of the voyage fare paid.

“The rapid spread of the Omicron Variant around the world may shape how some destination authorities with limited medical resources view even a small number of cases even when they are being managed with our vigorous protocols” said CLIA’s Golin-Blaugrund.

She added that CLIA is not aware of any situations in which passengers have been prevented from disembarking at their final destinations.

Crew perspective

Crew members working on cruise ships right now face an uncertain day-to-day. CLIA’s Bari Goin-Blaugrund confirmed reports that sometimes Covid-hit crew are transferred to specific quarantine vessels.

“CLIA ocean-going member lines have been utilizing out-of-service ships for crew members who have tested positive for Covid-19” she said. “Crew members are then monitored by the ships’ medical team during the course of their 10-day quarantine before returning to their assigned ships.”

A crew member working on a ship operated by Regent Seven Seas in the Caribbean told CNN Travel that while they felt relatively well-protected from Covid-19 there are other stresses involved in working on board during the pandemic – including dealing with schedule changes.

“A lot of our guests actually they’re just enjoying the process” said the crew member who spoke on condition of anonymity as they were not authorized to speak to the media. “But some they start to complain and of course it affects the crew because if during your work during the service on a daily basis you have to calm them down it’s not very pleasant.”

The crew member who spent four months sequestered at sea during the spring 2020 Covid outbreak said they were prompted to sign up again in October 2021 partly due to a lack of hospitality jobs on land.

They said they started their present contract before Omicron hit and subsequently agreed to an extension to help cover staffing shortages.

While there was no written guarantee the crew member hoped the cruise line might allow staff to disembark for shore leave. So far that’s not been permitted.

“It’s illogical because the safe bubble is already destroyed when some people go ashore” the crew member said adding that not being allowed off board impacts crew mental health.

Regent Seven Seas and its owner Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings did not immediately respond to request for comment.

Looking to the future

Golin-Blaugrund is hopeful for a brighter cruising future – CLIA’s goal is all ocean-going cruise ships back in operation by summer 2022.

Cruise ships in US waters were previously subject to Covid-19 rules enforced by the US Centers for Disease and Protection (CDC). This has now become optional but Golin-Blaugrund said most cruise lines will likely continue to work with the CDC.

Meanwhile infectious disease expert William Schaffner is cautiously optimistic about how Covid-19 might develop in 2022 – at least in countries with readily available vaccines – as boosters and rising natural immunity could render the virus endemic rather than pandemic.

“If that occurs then the risk for all kinds of congregate activities including cruising would go way down” Schaffner said

Still added Schaffner cruise ships by their nature travel across the world stopping in different ports – and each destination may be in a different stage of its Covid-19 journey. The cruise ship population – both passengers and crew – are also international.

The junior welterweight contender who lost a close but unanimous decision to Petros Ananyan in 2020 broke down and then stopped Ananyan after nine rounds in their rematch Saturday night in Atlantic City New Jersey.

“This was my defeat. I wanted to avenge this loss” Matias said afterward.

Matias (18-1 18 KOs) got off to a strong start but faded in the first fight with his Armenian rival.

That wasn’t the case on the Gary Russell Jr.-Mark Magsayo card Saturday. The fighters fought toe-to-toe from beginning to end in another slugfest but Matias clearly landed more and harder punches than he rival.

Thus Ananyan (16-3-2 7 KOs) began to slow down by the middle of the fight at which time Matias’ hard shots were taking a significant toll.

The biggest punch of the fight came in Round 9 when the Puerto Rican landed a left hook in the final seconds that put Ananyan onto the canvas and hurt him.

Ananyan was able to get up. However the ring doctor who examined him after the round didn’t like what she saw and had the referee stop the fight.

Matias ranked No. 2 by the IBF has now won three consecutive fights since the loss to Ananyan.

A boiler at the retired Philip Sporn Power Plant was safely dropped Saturday morning and the remainder of the demolition project should be finished by the end of this year according to a news release from the Frontier Group of Companies.

The Sporn Power Plant closed in 2015 and was purchased by FGC in 2019. It has been since been named the New Haven Industrial Park.

“Since we acquired the former power plant we have invested significant resources into repositioning this 280-acre brownfield site including preparing a plan to transform this brownfield into a modern industrial park” Chief Executive Officer David Franjoine said.

Franjoine noted the site is located near the future home of the Nucor steel mill and has the utilities and infrastructure needed to attract industrial developers.

The Nucor Corporation recently at the cost of about $ 2.7 billion.

Demolition Advanced at Former Philip Sporn Plant

NEW HAVEN West Virginia – The Frontier Group of Companies (FGC) announced that it had safely demolished Boiler #5 at the retired Philip Sporn Power Plant in Mason County WV marking a significant milestone toward its goal of repurposing the former coal burning power plant for further redevelopment. FGC expects the balance of the plant will be demolished by the end of this year.

The Sporn Power Plant was one of three AEP power plants closed in 2015 and has been vacant since that time. During its operation Unit No. 5 the first of the boilers dropped this morning generated 450000 kilowatts of electricity and was the largest of the units at the former Sporn Power Plant. The other four units generated 145000 kilowatts each.

Frontier Group of Companies purchased the site in 2019.

“Since we acquired the former power plant we have invested significant resources into repositioning this 280-acre brownfield site including preparing a plan to transform this brownfield into a modern industrial park” said David Franjoine CEO for the Frontier Group of Companies.

Franjoine added that in addition to being ideally situated near the recently announced Nucor plant this site has the necessary utilities and infrastructure to attract companies specializing in value-added steel energy material handling and transportation logistics.

Nucor Corporation recently announced plans to build a state-of-the-art sheet mill in Mason County. The new facility is expected to cost approximately $2.7 billion andhave the capacity to produce three million tons of steel annually. When fully operational as expected in 2024 the new mill is projected to employ approximately 800 full-time workers.

“The New Haven Industrial Park (name of the former Sporn Power Plant site) is a tremendous asset to Mason County and the state” said John Musgrave Executive Director of the Mason County Development Authority. “We have a great relationship with the Frontier Group and look forward to working with them to bring companies to their site and the other major industrial sites in Mason County.”

Pat Ford Director of Business Development for the Frontier Group of Companies said there were multiple factors that made this site attractive to Frontier.

“The most important factor was the potential to attract multiple industries in steel energy and transportation logistics to our site once it is repurposed” Ford said. “We are confident the site’s unique attributes including its location on the Ohio River and existing infrastructure will attract investment from multiple types of industries.”

Mason County Commissioner Rick Handley reflected on how the power plant was an economic boom for Mason County when it was operating. When the plant shut down Mason County lost 350 family-sustaining jobs and $429000 in annual tax revenue.

“However as the Frontier Group advances its demolition and site preparation work after the recent announcement of Nucor building their new sheet mill in Mason County we are excited about the tremendous opportunities for spinoff development and the economic benefits that will come with new development on Frontier’s site” said Handley.",,,,,,,,,

The graphics card features the Lite Hash Rate algorithm or LHR which drops as low as 12.5 MH/s in only a few seconds. The graphics card also has a power consumption of 73 watts. Another leaker also verifies this information on Twitter (@wxnod) who publishes comparable results using different software for mining crypto. The leaker reports that the GeForce RTX 3050 by NVIDIA is capable of 13.66 MH/s with a power consumption level of 57W achieved through tuning the power limit of the card and optimizations to the memory/core clocks.

With NVIDIA's choice of pricing and the cost of Ethereum presently a crypto miner would only see a return investment of the GeForce RTX 3050 upwards of 500 days at a retail price of $250. If the card retails for $100 more ($350) then the period for the return on investment would be closer to 700 days.

Since the value of digital currencies is currently dropping & with Ethereum is transitioning to a proof of stake standard starting June 2022 it has been concluded that NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3050 graphic cards is a terrible choice to utilize for crypto mining. This new information should free up the market for gamers looking for affordable graphics cards in 2022.

Besides mining performance the 3DMark TimeSpy and Firestrike benchmarks have also been leaked by the source. According to the numbers the NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3050 offers up to 19% boost compared to the Radeon RX 6500 XT in TimeSpy whereas in Firestrike the difference is only 4%. The graphics card is also on par with the GeForce GTX 1660 Ti but the RTX 3060 which utilizes the same GA106 GPU (with 40% higher cores & 60% higher bandwidth) offers up to a 47% increase in performance.

NVIDIA's new flagship GeForce RTX 3090 Ti graphics card is reportedly right around the corner with the suped-up card packing the GA102 GPU -- the flagship GPU and the fastest gaming GPU that NVIDIA has ever created -- alongside 24GB of ultra-fast GDDR6X memory.

The new GeForce RTX 3090 Ti continues on the GPU dominance that NVIDIA built with its current flagship RTX 3090 offering the same but also changed 24GB of GDDR6X memory. We still have the same 24GB of GDDR6X but it is both faster -- clocked at 21Gbps -- and has a much wider 384-bit memory bus that for the first time ever has a GeForce GPU pushing over 1TB/sec of memory bandwidth.

NVIDIA is using the GA102 GPU with 84 SM units that provide a huge 10752 CUDA cores -- up from the 82 SM units and 10496 CUDA cores on the RTX 3090 -- but there's also next-gen RT (Ray-Tracing) cores Tensor cores and brand new SM (streaming multi-processor units). The GA102 GPU inside runs at a base GPU clock of 1560MHz while boost GPU clocks hit 1860MHz. The TDP has been massively increased at 100W

Micron has provided the GDDR6X memory once again with NVIDIA's new GeForce RTX 3090 Ti having 24GB of GDDR6X clocked at 21Gbps -- but it's also on a 384-bit memory bus -- capable of just over 1TB/sec of memory bandwidth (well 1008GB/sec memory bandwidth to be specific).

We are expecting NVIDIA's in-house GeForce RTX 3090 Ti Founders Edition to be the first PCIe 5.0 graphics card ever with a single 16-pin PCIe power connector that will provide up to 450W of power to the card while the PCIe 5.0 connector itself can handle up to 600W of power so dual-GPU setups using dual PCIe 5.0-capable GPUs would be consuming in excess of 1200W. Insanity but man do I love it and I can't wait to play around.

We have some first benchmark results of the upcoming RTX 3050 desktop entry-level GPU.

In 3DMark Time Spy NVIDIA’s latest card can offer up to 24% more performance than AMD’s Radeon RX 6500 XT. Interestingly the AMD card is just a few percent slower than RTX 3050 in FireStrike which favors powerful rasterization engines such as AMD’s RDNA2 GPUs.

A bit more interesting comparison is with RTX 3060 the upcoming card’s closest sibling. Both cards are based on the same GA106 GPU but the higher-end model has 40% more cores (2560 vs 3584) and 60% higher memory bandwidth (360 vs 224 GB/s). The RTX 3060 is up to 46% faster than RTX 3050 in Time Spy Extreme (rendered at 4K resolution). Meanwhile in the Fire Strike Performance profile (rendered at 1080p) the difference is ‘just’ 30%.

Of course 3DMark scores are no longer as important for gamers as they used to especially when new technologies are in places such as raytracing or DLSS. However they still serve well for SKU comparisons especially under the same architecture.

One should notice that RTX 3050 performance should be on pair with NVIDIA GTX 1660 Ti the most powerful non-RTX Turing from the previous generation. This card lacks ray tracing and DLSS support and yet it retails at a minimum of 480 EUR. Hopefully this is not an indicator of RTX 3050 ‘actual’ retail price.

The card launches on January 27th but the first independent reviews drop a day sooner. The card will retail at 250 USD/279 EUR and it should become available on the same day it launches. It has already been confirmed that the RTX 3050 is not good at Ethereum mining so maybe just maybe this time around it will be easier to buy NVIDIA’s newest card.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMieGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5vdGVib29rY2hlY2submV0L052aWRpYS1HZUZvcmNlLVJUWC0zMDUwLXMtY3J5cHRvY3VycmVuY3ktbWluaW5nLXByb3dlc3MtcmV2ZWFsZWQtYnktbmV3LWxlYWsuNTk0NzcxLjAuaHRtbNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Nvidia GeForce RTX 3050's cryptocurrency mining prowess revealed by new leak,"Attempting to mine Ethereum with the Nvidia GeForce RTX 3050 will be a futile endeavour. The graphics card can hit a peak hash rate of 13.66MH/s due to its in-built hash-rate limiter. This should make it unattractive to miners allowing more gamers to pick one up on its January 27 launch.

The GeForce RTX 3050 undoubtedly generated some hype at its CES 2022 reveal. However that excitement died down pretty quick because the graphics card had just enough VRAM for cryptocurrency mining. So it begs the question just how well does the RTX 3050 mine cryptocurrency. Videocardz and Twitter user @wxnod have the answer to that question at least for Ethereum.

Videocardz heard from its sources that the Nvidia GeForce RTX 3050 could mine Ethereum at 12.5MH/s which was corroborated by @wxnod who states that it can go as high as 13.66MH/s. Both figures are less than the GeForce RTX 3060's hash rate of 35MH/s. It seems that the GeForce RTX 3050 much like most Ampere cards produced in H2 2021 comes with a built-in hash-rate limiter.

Tumbling Ethereum prices combined with the awfully high investment recuperation time makes the Nvidia GeForce RTX 3050 a terrible choice for miners. However that only eliminates a part of the problem as it will do nothing to dissuade scalpers from flipping the card at inflated prices. Yes the GeForce RTX 3050 is horrible at mining but how well can it play games? Based on its spec sheet alone we can expect it to outperform the Radeon RX 6500 but that isn't really saying much.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiP2h0dHBzOi8vZW4ub3ZlcmNsb2NraW5nLmNvbS9udmlkaWEtcnR4LTMwNTAtYS0xNjYwdGktd2l0aC1kbHNzL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,NVIDIA RTX 3050: a 1660Ti with DLSS?,"For a while now there have been indications about the positioning of the RTX 3050 in the Nvidia range. We began to understand that the greens do not really want to keep their GTX range alive. In these conditions on several occasions a positioning around a GTX 1660S or 1660Ti has been mentioned for this RTX 3050.

In the last few hours the first benchmarks of the GeForce RTX 3050 under 3DMark have leaked. The first observation is that this little 3050 is up to 24% faster than the much maligned Radeon RX 6500 XT that AMD has just launched. If we compare it with its big sister RTX 3060 the gap is quite big. The 3060 is up to 46% faster than the RTX 3050 in Time Spy Extreme (in 4K resolution). Under Fire Strike Performance (rendered at 1080p) the difference is about 30%.

RTX 3050: A 1660Ti in 2022?

The performance of the 3050 is really almost identical to the GTX 1660Ti a card launched in 2019. However it is difficult to stop there in our analysis. Firstly because the 3050 has hardware support for raytracing and especially access to DLSS which fundamentally changes the game in many games. Finally the crazy situation we are in leads to prices above 400€ to find a 1660Ti today. Announced with a starting price of 279€ we will have to see where the real cursor is and the availability."

The reason why certain stocks are priced so high is usually due to the company having never or rarely having completed a stock split.

There are many ways to evaluate a stock in addition to its absolute share price. Here we take a look at some of the largest companies in the U.S. and abroad.

Key Takeaways Companies are typically valued by their total market capitalization on a stock exchange or number of shares outstanding times the share price.

Still many investors are interested in the most pricey shares available on an exchange which can indicate exclusivity.

Companies can also be ranked by revenue and profitability.

Top Companies by Stock Price

The most expensive publicly traded share of all time is Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.A) which was trading at $458675 per share as of January 2022. Berkshire hit an all-time high on Jan. 18 2022 at $487255. Thanks to spectacular shareholder gains and the idiosyncrasies of its founder this share value is unlikely to be matched by anything other than continued gains in Berkshire’s share price.

The next company behind Berkshire in terms of nominal share price is NVR (NVR) at $5154.98 per share as of January 2022. Then there is the Seaboard Corporation (SEB) which was trading at $3731.02 and Amazon.com (AMZN) at $2852.86 followed by Alphabet Inc (GOOG) at $2607.03 a share.

Top Companies by Market Cap

By market capitalization as of January 2022 Apple (AAPL) is the biggest company at $2.652 trillion followed by Microsoft (MSFT) at $2.222 trillion Google (GOOGL) at $1.725 trillion Amazon.com (AMZN) at $1.446 trillion Tesla (TSLA) at $947.92 billion and Meta (META) formerly Facebook at $843.34 billion.

Back in 2007 Chinese energy giant PetroChina (PTR) reached an estimated market value of around $1 trillion. However this valuation didn't stick. As of January 2022 PTR's market capitalization stood at just $146.95 billion.

Top Companies by Revenue

In terms of the biggest global companies by revenue Walmart (WMT) comes in as number one—according to the Fortune 500 list. Walmart's revenues were $523964 billion in 2021. Behind Walmart was State Grid with $383906 billion in revenues followed by Amazon with $280522 billion and China National Petroleum at $379130 billion.

Sinopec Group ranks fifth with $407009 billion in annual revenues and the sixth and seventh spots are covered by Apple and CVS Health with $260174 billion and $256776 billion in yearly revenues respectively.

Based on only U.S.-headquartered companies' 2020 performance Walmart still has the top spot while Amazon comes in second. Exxon Mobil ranks third and Apple ranks fourth. Healthcare companies take up the fifth seventh and eighth spots: CVS UnitedHealth Group and McKesson generating $256.78 billion $242.15 billion and $231.05 billion respectively.

Berkshire Hathaway ranks sixth with $254.62 billion in annual revenues and the ninth and tenth spots are covered by AT&T and AmerisourceBergen at $181.19 billion and $179.59 billion in yearly revenues respectively.

Based on only U.S.-headquartered companies' 2019 performance Walmart still has the top spot while ExxonMobil (XOM) comes in second with $290.21 billion a year in revenues. Apple ranks third with $265.59 billion and Berkshire Hathaway fourth with $247.84 billion. Healthcare companies take up the sixth through eighth spots: UnitedHealth Group McKesson and CVS generating $226.25 billion $214.32 billion and $194.58 billion respectively.

Top Private Companies

In terms of private companies Forbes ranks Minnesota-based Cargill as the largest private U.S. company with $134.4 billion in annual revenues. The company has 155000 employees. Second is Koch Industries with $115 billion in revenues and 122000 employees. Ranking third is the grocery chain Publix Super Markets with $44.9 billion in annual revenue and 227000 employees.

The fourth and fifth largest private companies are Mars and H-E-B which generate $40 billion and $32.8 billion respectively. Each employs over 100000 employees.

The Bottom Line

On a pure market value measure Apple has often been considered the most valuable publicly traded company of all time. Although Microsoft did briefly hit the $2 trillion market cap mark in June 2021. It is certainly possible another company’s market cap will exceed these measures and maybe—though less likely—another company will surpass Berkshire Hathaway as the highest priced single stock share.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXGh0dHBzOi8vdHJpYmxpdmUuY29tL2xvY2FsL2JldGhlbC1wYXJrLXJlYWwtZXN0YXRlLXRyYW5zYWN0aW9ucy1mb3ItdGhlLXdlZWstb2YtamFuLTIzLTIwMjIv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Bethel Park real estate transactions for the week of Jan. 23 2022,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://triblive.com/local/bethel-park-real-estate-transactions-for-the-week-of-jan-23-2022/ on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXGh0dHBzOi8vdHJpYmxpdmUuY29tL2xvY2FsL2JldGhlbC1wYXJrLXJlYWwtZXN0YXRlLXRyYW5zYWN0aW9ucy1mb3ItdGhlLXdlZWstb2YtamFuLTIzLTIwMjIv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiKGh0dHBzOi8vdHJpYmxpdmUuY29tL2xvY2FsL3ByaW50LW9ubHktNS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,North Hills area real estate transactions for the week of Jan. 23 2022,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://triblive.com/local/print-only-5/ on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiKGh0dHBzOi8vdHJpYmxpdmUuY29tL2xvY2FsL3ByaW50LW9ubHktNS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMicGh0dHBzOi8vdHJpYmxpdmUuY29tL2xvY2FsL2Nhcmx5bnRvbi9jaGFydGllcnMtdmFsbGV5LWFyZWEtcmVhbC1lc3RhdGUtdHJhbnNhY3Rpb25zLWZvci10aGUtd2Vlay1vZi1qYW4tMjMtMjAyMi_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Chartiers Valley area real estate transactions for the week of Jan. 23 2022,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://triblive.com/local/carlynton/chartiers-valley-area-real-estate-transactions-for-the-week-of-jan-23-2022/ on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMicGh0dHBzOi8vdHJpYmxpdmUuY29tL2xvY2FsL2Nhcmx5bnRvbi9jaGFydGllcnMtdmFsbGV5LWFyZWEtcmVhbC1lc3RhdGUtdHJhbnNhY3Rpb25zLWZvci10aGUtd2Vlay1vZi1qYW4tMjMtMjAyMi_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,,,

The generosity was evident at the 2022 Auction of Junior Livestock Champions where the Grand Champion Steer sold for a record-high $160000.

The top eight champion animals tallied sales of $519000. The Reserve Grand Champion Hog sold for an impressive $50000 breaking the previous record by $14000. The Grand Champion Goat set a record sale of $44000.

The money invested supports the junior exhibitors that raised the animal as they plan for their agricultural future and college educations. In addition a portion of the proceeds supports the National Western Scholarship Trust. The Scholarship Trust funds agriculture studies and rural medicine scholarships at colleges throughout Colorado and Wyoming. This year 110 students received funds to aid their education. For more information regarding the NW Scholarship Trust please visit nationalwestern.com.

The top six Junior Livestock animals were auctioned off live on 9NEWS at 6:30 p.m. with John Korrey of Iliff serving as auctioneer and the exciting results are as follows:

The Grand Champion Steer fondly known as Yellers weighs 1358 pounds and sold for a record-high $160000 to Ames Construction Company. Yellers was shown by 12-year-old Rhylee Rodgers from Searsboro Iowa who hopes to attend college to study embryology one day.

Junior exhibitor Aven Horn showcased her 1330-pound Reserve Grand Champion Steer named Bicardi. Aven is 16 years old and wants to attend college at Texas Tech to study agriculture and play volleyball. The generous buyer Transwest Trucks Inc. purchased the steer for $100000.

Junior exhibitor Cole Phillips’ Grand Champion Hog weighing 272 pounds sold for $60000 to Occidental Petroleum. Cole is from Bullard Texas and is no stranger to the Jr. Auction ring. He was the exhibitor for the Reserve Grand Champion Hog in 2016. Cole has set his sights on starting his own construction business.

The 271-pound Reserve Champion Hog “CJ” was bought by the Denver Metro Chamber of Commerce for $50000. Nineteen-year-old Alia Rodgers from Napa California was emotional as she thanked her buyers. This was her first time exhibiting at the National Western Stock Show and was a dream come true for her.

The Grand Champion Lamb shown by 19-year-old Colt Randall of Canute Oklahoma sold for $42000 to Wagner Equipment Co. Colt plans to attend Seminole State to play baseball and study ag business or ag science.

Bruce and Bev Wagner purchased the Reserve Grand Champion Lamb for $40000 tying the record set in 2020. Twelve-year-old junior exhibitor Sayde Allen showed the lamb. Sayde has two champion animals in the show as she also won Grand Champion Goat. Her Grand Champion Goat sold for a record-high $44000 to Babson Farms. The major accomplishment comes during her first time showing at the National Western Stock Show.

The Reserve Grand Champion Goat named Frank after Frank Sinatra for being the G.O.A.T. (Greatest of All-Time) sold for $23000 to the TKM Foundation Kevin McNicholas. “Frank” was shown by Jack Hoyle who celebrated the crowning of his Reserve Grand Champion Goat on his 18th birthday.",,,,,,,,,

The junior at Oconee County High School in Watkinsville Ga. continued a busy January with a visit to Tennessee for its junior day on Saturday. Weeks said after the visit that he enjoyed the opportunity to continue building his relationship with linebackers coach Brian Jean-Mary and head coach Josh Heupel and is considering the Vols for one of his official visits.

The 6-foot-2 190-pound Weeks whose father David was a three-year starter and All-SEC offensive lineman at Georgia in the 1990s (and accompanied him for Saturday's visit) and whose brother West just transferred to LSU made his third trip to Tennessee in the past year. After getting an offer from the Vols in May he attended one of their camps in June. Weeks ranked the No. 458 overall player and No. 36 linebacker in the industry-generated 247Sports Composite for the 2023 class also visited for Tennessee's home game against South Alabama in November.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMikgFodHRwczovL3d3dy5waWxvdG9ubGluZS5jb20vMjAyMi8wMS8yMi9zYXR1cmRheXMtbmF0aW9uYWwtY29sbGVnZS1iYXNrZXRiYWxsLXJvdW5kdXAtbm8tMi1hdWJ1cm4taGFuZGxlcy1uby0xMi1rZW50dWNreS1mb3ItMTV0aC1zdHJhaWdodC12aWN0b3J5L9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Saturday's national college basketball roundup: No. 2 Auburn handles No. 12 Kentucky for 15th straight victory,"Walker Kessler scored 19 points and K.D. Johnson added 17 helping No. 2 Auburn keep its hot streak alive with an 80-71 victory over No. 12 Kentucky on Saturday.

The Tigers (18-1 7-0 SEC) rallied from a 10-point deficit to win their 15th straight in likely the biggest home game since Auburn Arena opened in 2010. It was big enough that the traditional football school had students set up tents Friday morning camping out to make sure they got in.

The Tigers who have matched the highest ranking in program history made it worth the wait. Fans chanted “No. 1? in the final moments hoping to supplant Gonzaga.

Kentucky’s No. 2 scorer TyTy Washington only played eight minutes and scored four points before being helped off the court with a left ankle injury.

Oscar Tshiebwe had 16 points 14 rebounds and four blocks for Kentucky (15-4 5-2).

Guest columnist

More than 40 years ago Intel broke ground on a new factory in a small agricultural town just outside of Phoenix Ariz.

More:Intel picks Greater Columbus for $20 billion semiconductor factory to employ 3000 workers

What began life as an empty patch of desert farmland has since become a manufacturing powerhouse with an annual economic impact of nearly $10 billion.

Today Intel employs more than 12000 people in Arizona and drives a vibrant community of supporting services and suppliers with a magnitude on the order of a small city.

We also have seen significant impact at our other U.S. sites in Oregon and New Mexico. Now we are bringing these benefits to Ohio.

Intel has committed $20 billion to fund the construction of two new leading-edge chip factories in Licking County.

With the potential to grow to more than $100 billion over the next decade this investment is an essential part of our strategy to restore U.S. leadership in semiconductor manufacturing – an area where the nation has fallen behind to foreign competitors.

More:Intel hopes to save the chip industry one competitor at a time

The U.S. needs to grow its chipmaking capability and capacity and Intel is excited to partner with the state of Ohio to create a new epicenter of economic growth. The chips made in Licking County will not only help diversify the region’s economy but they will also make U.S. supply chains and the overall economy more resilient.

Chips made here will power everything from personal computers to jet engines. Intel’s Ohio site is expected to become a full-fledged “mega factory” a major contributor to Intel’s leading-edge manufacturing network.

In the short term Intel’s Ohio investment is expected to create 3000 Intel jobs 7000 construction jobs and tens of thousands more local long-term jobs. In addition Intel is already working with Ohio leaders and top technology companies to encourage them to build supporting capabilities right here in Ohio with investments of their own.

Several members of our supply chain have already committed to establishing a presence in Ohio because of this investment and we anticipate many more commitments in the coming weeks. Chips made in Ohio will boost a healthy ecosystem of innovation and create the kind of virtuous cycle that the U.S. needs to win back its place as the global leader in semiconductor manufacturing.

As we searched for a site that could support the next phase of Intel’s growth we had insightful conversations with leaders from states across the country. But we ultimately decided that the Licking County location offered the best combination of attributes to meet our needs.

More:Intel picks Greater Columbus for $20 billion semiconductor factory to employ 3000 workers

The region has a proud heritage as an industrial and manufacturing powerhouse it sits near the fast-growing Columbus metropolitan area it has a robust existing infrastructure with the capacity for future growth and a strong talent pipeline sustained by world-class educational institutions in the area.

The site is also within a day's drive to every major Midwest city making it possible to create an ecosystem across the entire region. We are “all in” on Ohio. We could not be more impressed by the partnership that has developed with local and state leaders and we feel confident that this will be a mutually beneficial long-term relationship.

Construction of our factories will begin at the end of 2022 but we plan to have an immediate impact in the community.

We look forward to building strong relationships with our new neighbors by bringing jobs forging close partnerships with the educational institutions so vital to establishing a rich local talent pipeline and continuing to be good stewards of the environment – a commitment we have demonstrated over decades at other sites in the U.S. and around the globe.

Intel is proud to be the only American chipmaker making investments of this size and scale to grow our country’s chipmaking capacity. We are committed to investing even more in years to come but we continue to need close partnership with the federal government to meet the urgent need for more U.S. based chipmaking.

Congress has shown strong bipartisan support for our industry in enacting the critical CHIPS for America Act and it now must move forward to fully fund this important legislation. With that support Intel is prepared to invest faster and up to $100 billion in our new Ohio operations over the next decade to establish additional factories.

Our journey to establish the U.S. as a leader in semiconductor is far from over but I am confident that with strong partnership a common vision and continued support we can help create a new era of manufacturing here at home in the U.S. We look forward to becoming part of the community.

The market of 2021 is over"" | Ctech","Shlomo Kramer is the godfather of the cybersecurity world. As someone who was among the founders of the pioneering Check Point Imperva that was sold for $2.1 billion and now Cato Networks and has also invested in nearly every significant company in the field Kramer is one of the founding fathers of the industry in the entire world and particularly in Israel. But his enormous contribution to the industry stands in outstanding contrast to his low profile: Kramer is known as someone who prefers to remain far from the spotlight remains silent and rarely grants interviews.

Therefore his agreement to sit for this interview was a special surprise. When I wonder about the meaning of this openness he explains with confidence ""With all my record as an expert in building companies and I think that I am one of the best in the world in this field when I established Cato with Gur Shatz many investors told us 'This is a very ambitious project.' In ""American"" it means 'Are you out of your minds? It has no chance of success.' The first years after its establishment in 2015 were dedicated to proving that it was possible technologically and from a business standpoint. Now - with 1100 customers the backing from research firm Gartner that created a new category for the product that we developed and an IPO on Wall Street in the not too distant future - you can start to be open.""

Alongside the quiet confidence Kramer's remarks evoke a tone of insult in the face of investors' distrust of his new venture. This insult only caused him to work harder at proving to the entire world that Cato is making the task of enterprise network security simpler through a router-like device that enters the corporate communications network and provides most of the protection functions which will revolutionize the concept of enterprise security. In the seven years that have passed since those initial refusals the entire regular Silicon Valley investors' club has come around and injected into Kramer's new baby over a half-billion dollars. Since the last round of funding in October 2021 that was held according to a valuation of $2.5 billion Cato is sitting on a cash reserve of $400 million that is meant according to Kramer to lead it to two primary goals: the offering on Wall Street in 2024 and sales of a half-billion dollars in 2026. Today the company is already selling at an annual rate of $100 million.

The numbers that Kramer is now exposing in an interview to the weekend edition of Calcalist show the $2.5 billion valuation as being relatively low - certainly when looking at the funding round held during the same days for Wiz it too an Israeli company that operates in the cyber cloud market. Wiz whose sales volume is currently a quarter of that of Cato received a $6.5 billion price tag. Kramer however shows little emotion ""First of all I am quite pleased from the value attained by Wiz because I am invested in them through Gili Raanan's Cyberstars fund (that were among the first investors in Wiz S.S.). But aside from this the value of Cato was not built on the point-by-point maximization of valuation that an investor gives but on the future of the company. An investment round is part of the company building process. In such a process one must look ahead and weigh an uncertain environment: I am building Cato vis-a-vis an unknown future and this is meant to build a resilient and conservative company that will succeed in any scenario.""

""Although our wages are not the highest the name will look excellent on a resume""

For now this resilient and conservative company also has a conservative price tag ""The value in the last round was $2.5 billion"" Kramer says. ""It is built on economic parameters and I hope that it is the last private round. I formulated a scenario surrounding the value we will receive in the offering two years from now so that investors from the last round will profit even if the market will not be as hot as now rather a cold market.""

Then to what market value are you aiming for in the IPO? $5 billion? $10 billion?

""Is a double return on money good or bad in a regular market?""

Depends on the year.

""The secondary celebration will not continue. The market of 2021 is over.""

Precisely and therefore the question may be asked why the IPO is at all important to you. Look what happened to the Israeli unicorns that went public in 2021: They were slaughtered by tens of percentage points while there is a lot of money and willingness to invest at fantastic value levels in the private market.

""There is a phase where a company requires stock share liquidity for among other things to bring new employees. At the Lightspeed fund one of our largest investors they are constantly asking me how we are the only company in their portfolio that is ahead of their employee recruitment goals by one quarter consistently. My answer is that Cato is now two years before its IPO and for the employees in an ideal place in terms of the risk-chance ratio: We already have a nice income we are transparent with the employees and know what value to expect in two years.""

So you are playing primarily on the options field and less on wages? What about generous signing bonuses?

""People who come to us must be those who care very much about options because they can get higher wages or a signing bonus from the giant corporations. But what is important for me is that Cato will be a company that builds its employees' careers. In another five years when looking for another job and Cato appears on their resume employers will say 'I know the company let's talk with them.' We are not doing some small feature or widget rather building a company for decades to come. It is the energy that I try to pass on.""

And yet for employees to meet with the money it is not necessary to go public. Today it is possible to do it in a secondary round in which they sell their shares to investors also as part of a private company.

""In 2021 it was possible because the risk was priced at zero and the lack of liquidity did not interest investors as much. But I am not sure that the secondary celebration of the past years will continue because the risk will no longer be priced at zero. The entire relationship between holding public capital and private equity will be rebalanced in the coming years with the rise in interest rates and the rise in the cost of risk.""

Will we see fewer mega-rounds of funding than those we saw during the past two years?

""The non-liquid asset will have a lower value than liquid assets"" Kramer says noting that the private market that is still distributing hundreds of millions of dollars on nascent start-ups will close the gap vis-a-vis Wall Street where valuation levels of technology companies were cut by an average 50% in recent months.

So what do you expect in the coming years in the funding market and valuation estimates in technology in general particularly in cyber?

""I am not a macroeconomics expert.""

And if I ask you as Shlomo Kramer the legendary investor who invested in nearly every successful cyber start-up?

""My problem as an investor has been resolved because I don't have time. I am still writing out small checks to young and enthusiastic companies a little help to entrepreneurs meet with them brainstorm but I don’t sit on their board of directors and commit to companies like a venture capital fund.""

Could it be that lack of time is an excuse for taking the foot off the gas? When you announced your last round you said there is a bubble in the cyber market.

""It's not an excuse; just last week I invested in two seed rounds. But it is a fact that public shares were cut by 50%. A few months earlier the price was double.""

It seems that the private market has yet to internalize the change in direction that Wall Street investors have already sensed.

""I have been in quite a few cycles like these. In previous rounds it took three-four months until the crash in the public market reached the private market. It could be that this time there is a soft landing and a slower process of the air coming out.""

""Until today I was in a training camp. Cato is the real battle""

Kramer's load returns us to Cato. While he could rest on his laurels and exits (the largest of which was Check Point from which according to estimates he left with a billion dollars in cash in exercised shares) Kramer is a full-time CEO. Instead of sitting on a well-upholstered investor's chair he is still in the trenches making the trek between investment funds at a time when most of the investors around him are young many of them smug and will soon learn up close and personal what he has already forgotten.

""I'm not so young but I am infantile"" he says laughing. ""I love creating and innovating. Gur Shatz and I have been together for some twenty years back in the days of Imperva (Shatz was the first employee hired by the founders S.S.) and Incapula (a company that the two established with Marc Gaffan and later sold to Imperva S.S.); Cato is their third company together. In the straightest sense - I open the door in the morning enter the office and feel good. I feel young energetic and feel like stirring up a revolution. There are not many times in life that you come up with the idea that can truly change the world.""

The idea behind Cato is more innovative and exciting than the firewall that you developed at Check Point? You invented the cyber market as we know it today.

""Everything that I did until today was a training camp in advance of Cato. This is the real battle.""

So what exactly does Cato do that has made Kramer an enthusiastic 55-year-old kid? Cato bravely enters into a market controlled today by the strong and ancient elephants the communications operators the AT&T and the Verizons of the world. Until today Kramer explains companies purchased from their communications operators a range of devices that gave them protection and were assembled on the network until at a certain stage they drowned in a jungle of these types of devices that no one knew how to manage efficiently. Now Cato packages everything into a single product and digitally transforms all these devices into convenient applications. Cato says to these companies ""Forget all about your collection of boxes transfer everything up into our cloud."" It is this cloud that Kramer compares to an iPhone. ""The idea is to do a digital transformation to enterprise network security and turn everything into something simpler. You don't need to buy all the devices separately - everything becomes an application precisely like the alarm clock camera and flashlight. No user needs any particular knowledge to operate the applications on their iPhone and they can be operated together or individually.""

The newest area in the enterprise security field received the acronym SASE (Secure Access Service Edge). ""What we wrote as a vision for Cato in 2015 has been wholly adopted by Gartner as the definition for SASE"" Kramer noted enthusiastically. ""I've never had anything like this happen in my entire career. Take the firewall for example; Gartner initially went with a different firewall concept and what Gil and I pushed was then perceived as a competitive solution. Only with time it became the dominant solution.""

""The fat waistline of the market is not covered. We will cover it""

Cato's daring stems not only from the fact that it invented a new market but rather that it enters head-on into the most basic communications infrastructure one supplied by the strong conglomerates that have been sitting deep in the corporations for decades and largest among them is the American communications giant AT&T. It is also a very profitable market for all the players since approximately 80% of the security budget of enterprises goes toward procurement from communications operators that supply a basic wrapping of protection for the communications network; the remaining 20% from the security budget is designated primarily for protection solutions against external connections.

In absolute numbers the SASE market encompasses approximately $10 billion; at present there are only a few companies - but those companies entering are all the ""right"" names that give Kramer the confidence that he launched his arrows in the correct direction. Cato is the only start-up defined as a player in the market (although recently the Israeli start-up Perimeter 81 is also strengthening in this field) but alongside it operate companies like Cisco Zscaler VMWare and Nir Zuk's Palo Alto. Kramer was one of Palo Alto’s first investors and even sat on its board until its IPO on Wall Street. ""It is good for us that they are there and this way they are saying that we were right…"" he says and immediately exposes the personal competition between the Israeli cyber giants - ""…but it cannot be forgotten that Palo Alto in contrast to Cato was not born as a cloud company and arrived at its capabilities in SASE as part of a lengthy line of acquisitions."" To be on the safe side he adds ""When you attack a new market it is always important that a player will come with a serious reputation even if Palo Alto is a small company."" Small of course is a matter of personal perspective: Palo Alto is traded at a market value of $50 billion and sells over $4 billion annually.

How was the idea at the foundation of your technology born?

""Despite the cyber craze with the high valuations and growing sales - in the field in enterprises that purchase security solutions these solutions were failing and corporations were unsuccessful in protecting themselves. It is evident for example in the cyber insurance world where the large players left the market after internalizing that most of the companies were breached. Allegedly there is a showroom with tons of shiny security products but there is a true sense of failure in the field.

""This is because the entire cyber community is geared towards the large enterprises which can buy a lot of boxes and invest in the dedicated teams and resources required for implementation and integration. These conglomerates are well protected but these are primarily giant corporations the 'Bank of Americas' of the world. In contrast medium-sized companies - which can reach thousands of employees - lack these resources. They do not have the people the knowledge and the budgets. These companies are responsible for 44% of the American GDP. These are the fat waistlines of the market that are not covered.""

Whose fault is this?

""Companies have an awareness today but all of the VC funds are pushing the start-ups in advance to the large corporations because it is easy to sell to them and make an exit.""

So you decided to take on the communications operators and the giant cyber companies.

""All the players from Cisco to Palo Alto are not cloud companies. This transition is not just a product challenge but conceptual at the DNA level of the enterprise. Some will succeed but it will take them a long time - and during this time we will run. Last year we grew by 100% and it will be our growth rate this year too; later on we will grow by more than 50% each year so that by 2026 we will reach an income of a half-billion dollars.”

But you are a thorn in the side of companies like AT&T. They will prefer to buy you before you become too big.

""There are five phases of mourning and they are somewhere there in the process. We are already signing several of the companies that have completed this process like KDDI the Japanese communications operator. Cato is a company with tremendous potential which differs from all of my companies until today. It can be a company of many billions of dollars in sales. The IPO that I am talking about is only one more round of funding. The good companies build their value after the IPO not before.""

""I’m here for many years""

Do you see yourself managing Cato for all this time even after the IPO? Can you imagine yourself as CEO for decades like Gil Shwed who has become one of the most veteran CEOs of companies traded on Wall Street and has been criticized for this?

""Yes I see myself here for many years. At Imperva I managed the company for 12 years. At the moment I’m not tempted by starting another start-up.""

But what do you think when you see today the value of Check Point $15 billion which is similar to the value of companies issued this year and far from that of companies like Palo Alto ($50 billion) or Zscaler ($37 billion)?

""I understand how to build companies. How value is determined in the market I have less of an understanding.""

Then let's talk in terms of growth. Check Point is not there it has been growing for years at a low single-digit rate but the investors love seeing growth in the many tens of percentage points.

""Check Point is a company with 6000 employees. I do not know how to manage it nor do I feel I am in the position of understanding how to make it succeed. People also forget that Check Point brings a billion dollars to its shareholders every year.

""There are five people with whom I have worked throughout my lifetime and I have the utmost respect for them professionally as exceptional product-oriented people; Gil who was my friend when we established Check Point and we are still in contact today is one of them. Nir Zuk is also one of them.""

But today you no longer hold shares not in Check Point nor Palo Alto. Why?

""I prefer to invest the money in start-ups. In my soul I am an entrepreneur. Check Point is only my first famous start-up but not the first. My first was back in high school with Ofer Shemtov (who later became one of the developers of VoIP and transitioned into a leadership position at VocalTec S.S.). It was the 1980s and we sold it to a software firm. Entrepreneurism is DNA. I also love helping entrepreneurs to mentor and therefore I am also an investor.""

""The cyber industry is facing at least another 20 years of growth""

In 2003 Kramer became the first of Check Point's founders to leave the company. He established immediately with Mickey Boodaei and Amichai Shulman who are also Israeli cyber giants in their own right Imperva. The company which dealt with enterprise defense software against external attacks was issued on Nasdaq in 2011 at a value of $460 million and in 2015 was sold to the Thoma Bravo investment fund for $2.1 billion. Over the years Kramer sold shares in the company for $150 million. In 2015 he established Cato; his holdings in the company are valued at a half-billion dollars per the last round of funding.

What did you take from Check Point and Imperva to the way you manage Cato today?

""It is impossible to turn lemons into oranges but lemonade also tastes good.""

What is easier for you and what is more difficult in the current round?

""The jet lag is more difficult. When I was young I would hop on an El Al overnight flight change into a suit in the handicapped restroom in JFK go for a whole day of meetings dinner at a restaurant and sleep that night for three hours. Today I cannot do that. On the other hand I am discovering that everything is easier and clearer to me. I am better trained at reading the situation working with people building a company.""

Do you make fewer mistakes?

""A lot fewer. I look back at myself from 20 years ago shocked. Everything now is more on a plain with fewer ups and downs.""

And where are we on the timeline of the cyber market? There is numerous talk about a bubble and on the other hand the breaches into companies are multiplying becoming more sophisticated and causing security budgets to swell.

""Looking twenty years ahead the cyber field is only just at the beginning of its path and can expect many continued years of growth. Its growth must be directed not only to the giant enterprises that are regulated but also to everyone because the attacks are already creating real economic pressures. I am full of optimism and energy to be part of the journey of this market.

""I am also very proud of my role during the past 30 years in building the Israeli cyber brand. When we started in Check Point we sat in Boston with an American consultant who said to us 'Hide the fact that you are from Israel say that the company headquarters are here in Boston.' It was the spirit of the times back then. Now I sit in a meeting in Japan with 20 Japanese who know nothing yet about Cato and they say to one another 'it's an Israeli security company' and that is enough.

""Israeli cyber is the real deal and it is the world leader today. It's like a pandemic. First some bring it from abroad and it can be said that this is what the army did - but what is happening today is a 'community acquired infection' everything is fermenting within itself start-ups beget start-ups and the whole thing is exceptional. We have achieved quite a lot and we are at the start of achieving something very significant.""

Speaking of Israeli identity Check Point and Imperva you managed primarily from abroad while at Cato you do everything from Israel. Is this something that has changed in you or the world?

""When I was with Check Point and Imperva I relocated to the United States around the time of the IPO because it was believed that Israel was a place for development but the moment you want to begin selling and seriously enter the market you need to move to the United States. At Cato I decided to establish a company entirely in Israel the headquarters and its entire management. I am fed up; and because my wife (the filmmaker Dorit Hakim S.S.) refused to relocate once again. I had a feeling that there was a maturation of the ecosystem in Israel that makes it possible to establish a whole company and that there is tremendous talent here in the field of online marketing. We are a superpower in this field like in cyber. The entire senior management that reports to me sits here on the floor where we are sitting. I had a perception of a decentralized company with Zoom and Slack. The idea was strange here for many of the managers and they requested that we establish offices in other locations but then came Covid-19.""

In light of the expose in Calcalist regarding the use of NSO products to hack into telephones of Israeli citizens is the next phase of cyber protection going to be for private phones? Is this the next boom?

""This field already exists although it is for the most part aimed at the corporate market and not the private consumer market. I invested in the Israeli start-up company Lacoon before it was sold to Check Point for $100 million in 2015. They turned to the mobile device security market and from what I know it has become a very successful Check Point product when it comes to investing in offensive cyber. I have long since decided not to invest in offensive cyber companies. I concluded that you must choose sides either you are on defense or offense.""

""There must be an integration between hi-tech and the rest of Israel""

Cato is currently entering into an accelerated employee recruitment process after it was decided to advance the plans and hire 180 new employees who will join the existing 500 employees of the company. Half of the employees are based in Israel and half of these new employees will also be based in the company’s Tel Aviv offices.

Will this madness of increasing the company's workforce by almost 50% within a year continue? As a tribal elder don't you ever say to yourself ""soon the whole thing will burst?"" Is it not exaggerated; the gaps between those in high tech and those who are not? Can it continue?

""The important point is how to reach a better integration between hi-tech and the rest of the country. Many sectors do not find expression in the job market and need to be nurtured. We have 15-20 employees in Ramallah for example through an outsourcing company; I have not been to Ramallah they do come here from time to time I see them in the dining room. But it is impossible to hire them directly as employees at Cato.”

How can this gap be reduced?

""This is a very big question"" Kramer says evasively careful not to enrage the entire sector - the way Nir Zuk did at the ""Calcalist"" Conference this past December when he declared that the tax rate on high-tech workers' salaries should be raised. ""Just because I know how to build a company does not mean I know how to integrate a business sector within the country effectively. I contribute what I can.""

It's not just big organisations who lose millions as a result of cryptocurrency theft hackers also target individual users to steal small amounts new data revealed.

According to Chainalysis the blockchain data platform scammers stole a record $14bn (£103bn) in cryptocurrency in 2021 with losses from crypto-related crime rising 79% compared with 2020.

In its latest report it said sophisticated attacks take careful planning and skill to pull off but through other types of malware hackers can take a cheaper “spray-and-pray” approach spamming millions of potential victims and stealing smaller amounts. The malware families sampled received 5974 transfers from victims in 2021 up from 5449 in 2020.

It identified found four types of common “cryptocurrency-focused malware families”.

The most dangerous of these is cryptojacking possibly the most prolific of all malware families where hackers make unauthorised use of a victim device’s computing power to mine cryptocurrency. In 2020 Cisco’s (CSCO) cloud security division reported that cryptojacking malware affected 69% of its clients.

Chart: Chainalysis

Hackers also love trojans – viruses that look like a legitimate program but infiltrates a victim’s computer.

There are also clippers which hackers use to replace cryptocurrency addresses copied into a user’s clipboard with their own allowing them to reroute planned transactions to their own wallets.

A 2018 report from Palo Alto Networks estimated that 5% of all Monero (XMR-USD) in circulation was mined by cryptojackers which would represent over $100m in revenue.

Another type of malware is called info stealer which collect credentials a user may have saved on their browser. Cryptbot an infostealer that steals victims’ cryptocurrency wallet details was the most prolific malware family in this group in 2021 raking in almost half a million dollars in pilfered bitcoin (BTC-USD).

Many of these malware strains are available for purchase on the darknet making it even easier for less sophisticated hackers to deploy them against victims.

Story continues

Chart: Chainalysis

After receiving cryptocurrency from victims malware operators send the majority of funds on to addresses at centralised exchanges.

However that majority is slim and getting slimmer. Exchanges only received 54% of funds sent from malware addresses in 2021 down from 75% in 2020. Decentralised finance (DeFi) protocols make up much of the difference at 20% in 2021.

Watch: Watch: Can you live exclusively off bitcoin?

DeFi is a rapidly growing sector that aims to cut out middlemen such as banks from traditional financial transactions like securing a loan. But many of the new protocols being launched have code vulnerabilities that hackers are able to exploit.

Malware attacks aren’t necessarily carried out by the administrators of the malware family itself but instead are often carried out by smaller groups renting access to the malware family – the report said this is something law enforcement needs to keep in mind.

Studying how cybercriminals launder stolen cryptocurrency may be investigators’ best bet for finding those involved it said.

Using blockchain analysis investigators can follow the funds find the deposit addresses cybercriminals use to cash out and subpoena the services hosting those addresses to identify the attackers.

Last week Microsoft (MSFT) said it had found destructive malware on dozens of Ukrainian government and private-sector computers which as the ability to wipe computers of data and render them inoperable.

It said there are several reasons why the activity it found was inconsistent with cybercriminal ransomware activity observed by Microsoft.

""Explicit payment amounts and cryptocurrency wallet addresses are rarely specified in modern criminal ransom notes"" but were specified in this case Microsoft said.

Meanwhile in a separate report Chainalysis said North Korea seems to be the hub of crypto crime.

Hackers in the country launched at least seven attacks on cryptocurrency platforms that extracted nearly $400m worth of digital assets last year.

These attacks targeted primarily investment firms and centralised exchanges and made use of phishing lures code exploits malware and advanced social engineering to siphon funds out of these organisations’ internet-connected “hot” wallets into North Korea-controlled addresses.

Once North Korea gained custody of the funds they began a careful laundering process to cover up and cash out.

The series which just wrapped up its fourth season follows Costner's John Dutton as he fights to preserve his family's way of life on a sprawling ranch in Montana's Paradise Valley. The action-packed drama has captured the attention of Americans across the country—many of them in small-market towns and cities in ""flyover"" states.

The show's popularity—with its sometimes corny dialogue and Middle America–focused themes—has media elites scratching their heads. Vox called it ""a watchable yet almost relentlessly three-out-of-five-stars TV show"" and lamented that it ""is not particularly interested in saying anything grand or sweeping about the world."" HBO's Succession which has a similar family business legacy theme is an Emmy-winning darling of media critics but it draws only a fraction of Yellowstone's viewership. Just 1.7 million viewers tuned in to Succession's season finale last month compared to more than 11 million for Yellowstone's. A Yellowstone prequel starring Tim McGraw and Faith Hill that debuted last month 1883 drew nearly 5 million viewers making it the largest cable premiere since 2015.

Yellowstone's appeal along with the apparent disinterest of the chattering class reveals familiar red-state–blue-state cultural divisions. The show isn't moralizing or preachy. But part of its appeal is how it features real-world issues facing heartland communities—topics that are often unfamiliar or poorly understood by coastal critics who might perceive Yellowstone as lowbrow.

Consider the show's depiction of the tensions between urban and rural communities—whether in the context of disputes over water rights property boundaries or wildlife interactions. Our organization the Property and Environment Research Center (PERC) which is based in Bozeman Montana near where Yellowstone takes place recently published an entire magazine issue exploring issues in the show. Many of the plotlines involve big-city developers or transplants butting heads with locals who see the outsiders as a threat to their traditions and livelihoods and the result is usually conflict instead of cooperation.

For instance in the series premiere developers from California sit in a Bozeman conference room looking over their plans to build a subdivision next to the Duttons' ranch. When one wonders whether they can unilaterally dam a river diverting it from the ranch to supply their vacation-home development with water and power another says: ""On our land it's our river. This isn't California gentlemen. This is Montana. We can do whatever we want."" It's fantasy—a sophisticated Western water rights system known as prior appropriation emerged more than a century ago to preclude such a conflict-ridden approach—but it captures the urbanite-elite disdain for traditional ways of life that Yellowstone so often illustrates.

Take another example: the Duttons' constant challenges with federal endangered species regulations. At various times throughout the show the Endangered Species Act is either hamstringing the Duttons' cattle-ranching business or being used by their adversaries as a weapon to remove them from the land. In one scene a lawyer for a real estate investor devises a plan to use environmental regulations to attack the family with ""a thousand little cuts."" In another one of the Duttons' cowboys shoots an endangered grizzly bear in self-defense prompting a protracted investigation and an attempt by the Duttons to avoid legal punishment under the Endangered Species Act.

The basic problem with the Endangered Species Act is that it penalizes landowners who like the Duttons provide habitat for imperiled species. The show shines a light on the urban-rural divide between animal-loving city dwellers who want to save species and the rural landowners who bear the costs of doing so. This often pits endangered wildlife against landowners and leads to a ""shoot shovel and shut up"" approach that is bad for species as well as people. ""When someone kills a bear"" says the local sheriff in the grizzly bear scene ""10000 vegans send letters to their congressmen. You should have buried that thing in a hole before I got here because I ain't the problem—the feds are!""

Other scenes depict challenges associated with wolves and livestock. As wolf populations have rebounded throughout much of the American West in recent decades some states have created funds to compensate ranchers for livestock lost to wolves and other predators. Such programs have helped ranchers mitigate some of the costs of living with wolves but they do little to turn wolves into economic assets in the eyes of rural landowners. For wolf recovery to be sustainable strategies will need to benefit the local communities that bear the costs of providing habitat for the predators.

Similar issues are playing out in real time. Montana and Wyoming have both recently petitioned the feds to remove grizzly populations from the federal endangered species list citing dramatic recoveries in recent decades and growing conflicts with rural landowners and residents. Despite attempts by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service to delist Yellowstone grizzlies dating back to 2005 the species remains listed in the region due to protracted litigation from environmentalists. Meanwhile controversies over recent wolf-killing measures adopted in Montana and Idaho are prompting calls to relist wolves which had previously been delisted. And in 2020 Colorado voters approved a ballot measure to reintroduce wolves in the state—in what amounted to a stark urban-rural split—angering rural residents who will bear the costs. Grim us-versus-them outlooks over wildlife turn disputes about species into all-or-nothing battles ultimately undermining landowners' incentives to help recover wildlife.

Strife doesn't have to triumph. In the real-life Paradise Valley in Montana ranchers face many of the same challenges as the Duttons—pressures to subdivide the reality of being land-rich but cash-poor and modern global economic shifts that increasingly make it difficult to stay in the business of bringing beef to market. To help address such challenges while also promoting conservation PERC recently launched a new tool to reward landowners for providing wildlife habitat funded entirely by local groups interested in conserving iconic Yellowstone wildlife. Last fall we partnered with one ranch family to create the state's first-ever ""elk occupancy agreement""—a voluntary contract that compensates the family for setting aside 500 acres of land as winter habitat for the valley's migratory elk herds.

Other similar free market arrangements are in the works in the valley all with the same goal: to reward private landowners who voluntarily conserve habitat that does not benefit just them but also serves as a boon to Bozemanites and even faraway out of staters many of whom may never vote the same way they would. More new tools will be needed to replace controversy with cooperation and connect animal-loving urbanites to ranchers who provide habitat especially given the national backdrop of polarized red-county–blue-county politics. Even as it exaggerates conflict on the screen Yellowstone frequently alludes to the underlying institutions that are supposed to help settle conflicts over water land and other resources. While the show often chooses violence we shouldn't have to in the real world.

""There's a war being waged against our way of life"" John Dutton says in the latest season. For many people across the country this sentiment rings true. Yellowstone captures it and in the process the attention of more viewers than most other television series. Media critics along with conservationists and policy makers who care about these issues in the real world dismiss it at their own peril.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiP2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZ0LmNvbS9jb250ZW50LzBkMGFmMzdhLWM4YjAtNDIzNy1iYzU3LTczN2YwOTdlY2IzZNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Netflix faces a dystopian future in which hits do not guarantee growth,Today's FT newspaper for easy reading on any device.

In the view of The New York Times “Unlike most movie stars — who are walking answers machines who reliably fill expectations rather than confound them — he rarely does the obvious thing whether in his choice of roles or how he plays them.” And as Vox put it “Among American actors he is inarguably singular.

(NASDAQ:PAYX) Goes Ex-Dividend Soon,"Some investors rely on dividends for growing their wealth and if you're one of those dividend sleuths you might be intrigued to know that Paychex Inc. (NASDAQ:PAYX) is about to go ex-dividend in just 4 days. Typically the ex-dividend date is one business day before the record date which is the date on which a company determines the shareholders eligible to receive a dividend. It is important to be aware of the ex-dividend date because any trade on the stock needs to have been settled on or before the record date. Meaning you will need to purchase Paychex's shares before the 28th of January to receive the dividend which will be paid on the 24th of February.

The company's upcoming dividend is US$0.66 a share following on from the last 12 months when the company distributed a total of US$2.64 per share to shareholders. Last year's total dividend payments show that Paychex has a trailing yield of 2.2% on the current share price of $118.67. Dividends are a major contributor to investment returns for long term holders but only if the dividend continues to be paid. We need to see whether the dividend is covered by earnings and if it's growing.

See our latest analysis for Paychex

Dividends are typically paid out of company income so if a company pays out more than it earned its dividend is usually at a higher risk of being cut. Paychex is paying out an acceptable 73% of its profit a common payout level among most companies. Yet cash flows are even more important than profits for assessing a dividend so we need to see if the company generated enough cash to pay its distribution. Dividends consumed 74% of the company's free cash flow last year which is within a normal range for most dividend-paying organisations.

It's positive to see that Paychex's dividend is covered by both profits and cash flow since this is generally a sign that the dividend is sustainable and a lower payout ratio usually suggests a greater margin of safety before the dividend gets cut.

Click here to see the company's payout ratio plus analyst estimates of its future dividends.

Have Earnings And Dividends Been Growing?

Businesses with strong growth prospects usually make the best dividend payers because it's easier to grow dividends when earnings per share are improving. If earnings fall far enough the company could be forced to cut its dividend. Fortunately for readers Paychex's earnings per share have been growing at 11% a year for the past five years. Paychex has an average payout ratio which suggests a balance between growing earnings and rewarding shareholders. This is a reasonable combination that could hint at some further dividend increases in the future.

Many investors will assess a company's dividend performance by evaluating how much the dividend payments have changed over time. Since the start of our data 10 years ago Paychex has lifted its dividend by approximately 7.8% a year on average. It's encouraging to see the company lifting dividends while earnings are growing suggesting at least some corporate interest in rewarding shareholders.

The Bottom Line

Is Paychex worth buying for its dividend? Higher earnings per share generally lead to higher dividends from dividend-paying stocks over the long run. However we'd also note that Paychex is paying out more than half of its earnings and cash flow as profits which could limit the dividend growth if earnings growth slows. Overall it's hard to get excited about Paychex from a dividend perspective.

In light of that while Paychex has an appealing dividend it's worth knowing the risks involved with this stock. For example we've found 1 warning sign for Paychex that we recommend you consider before investing in the business.

A common investment mistake is buying the first interesting stock you see. Here you can find a list of promising dividend stocks with a greater than 2% yield and an upcoming dividend.

10 stocks we like better than PayPal Holdings

When our award-winning analyst team has a stock tip it can pay to listen. After all the newsletter they have run for over a decade Motley Fool Stock Advisor has tripled the market.*

They just revealed what they believe are the ten best stocks for investors to buy right now... and PayPal Holdings wasn't one of them! That's right -- they think these 10 stocks are even better buys.

See the 10 stocks

*Stock Advisor returns as of January 10 2022

Jon Quast: I don't mean to put you on the spot here Chris but as I'm thinking this through is there advantage for PayPal to create its own stablecoin versus simply supporting a stablecoin that's already in existence? What does PayPal get out of this?

Chris MacDonald: Well that is interesting. I know we're going to talk in the next piece about a company that's using another stablecoin. I think there's pros and cons to both.

PayPal probably would get more transparency into what's actually backing the stablecoin and they would have control over that. There's probably that control aspect that they would want. Like I said with Tether for example there's been some questions about what assets exactly are backing the token. In terms of transparency that can be a little bit opaque let's say in the crypto world.

There's probably maybe a strategic reason for PayPal to step in and do it themselves or try to do it themselves. Having a regulatory approval or a stamp of approval for a stablecoin would be great for a company like PayPal and theoretically could be a competitive advantage I guess over other large tech companies looking to do the same thing.

Maybe they're looking for a first-mover advantage.

But it is an interesting development and that's an interesting question to why not just use Tether or USDC or some of the others.

However the recent lawsuit found that Plaid got more financial data than it was telling users and the companies now facing a class-action settlement to all its victims.

Plaid Class-Action Lawsuit Settlement: Available for Victims of Data Collection

Plaid is a company that significantly plays a role in FinTech. This is because the company holds massive data required to verify its identity and collect data. However it is now the focus of a class-action lawsuit that came to a settlement for its victims especially now that it compromised the users' data.

The company partnered with a lot of the world's leading FinTech companies mainly as they started their services to bring its promise of data security. Plaid did not exactly leak their data but the dispute now is that the company overstepped in its boundaries and got more of what they intended from users and it is harmful to many.

Plaid is offering its services to help people get the proper compensation from them for the inconvenience and supposed breach that they did against the users of multiple platforms. It is not only Venmo and Robinhood to face its effects especially as the company has a lot of clients on its list.

From 2013 through 2021 applications to different fintech platforms Plaid will include the users affected on the settlement.

Moreover the claims website will only accept submissions by April 28 this year.

Plaid will settle $58 million for the case divided into the claims made by affected users.

Venmo Robinhood and other Online Platforms

Venmo is a known fintech app that came from PayPal bringing a platform that allows to split the bill and invite friends into the purchase without the need for lengthy transfers and transactions. It is also known for many disputes now including a friends list leak that compromised a user and their contacts within the app.

On the other hand Robinhood is a known platform to trade stocks and invest on different platforms companies and listed features in the application. Last year towards early November the company faced a massive hack that involved almost seven million users that suffered victims to the threat actors that breached Robinhood.

The world of FinTech and online currency is massive and dangerous especially as it talks about sensitive financial data that needs to be available online for verification.

Plaid is one of the services that offer the feature to users and help connect bank accounts from one platform to another. However overstepping their boundaries is a significant dispute that harms people hence settling the lawsuit and bettering its use of the information available to them.

But many observers don't see that waiving the intellectual property (IP) rights on Covid vaccines is an effective way to put a stop to the pandemic.

Supporters of patent waivers like Harsha Thirumurthy associate professor of medical ethics and health policy at the University of Pennsylvania argue the issue lies at the heart of the reason why vaccines are less accessible in lower-income countries.

""It limits how much manufacturing there can be of that product or that vaccine"" said Thirumurthy adding it keeps the price ""artificially high enough that it limits the ability of other countries in the world.""

But critics counter that patent waivers will not automatically lead to an improvement in global vaccine distribution.

Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates was among those who originally spoke out against the patent waiver emphasizing that there are problems beyond patents that must be addressed first. Gates later reversed his stance and is now in full support of temporarily waiving the protections over coronavirus vaccine patents.

""Having a billion vaccines sitting in a warehouse of a lab that's developing will do no good getting us back to normal"" said Heath Naquin vice president of government and capital engagement at the University City Science Center a nonprofit research organization in Philadelphia.

""The patent waiver itself doesn't actually solve that core issues in many developing countries which are not related to the recipe they are related to the way you get that out the door to people.""

However experts on both sides of the debate seriously doubt whether a patent waiver on Covid-19 vaccines will ever come to be.

""I think we had the best hope of it last year when there was a proposal that was put forward at the WTO and the Biden administration had supported it"" said Thirumurthy.

""But we had European countries that objected to those patent waivers.""

“Once a year it is easier to convince people to do it. It is easier for people to remember. From a public health situation it is an ideal solution. We are looking to see if we can create a vaccine that covers Omicron and doesn’t forget the other variants. And that could be a solution unless something completely different comes out” he told Channel 12 news.

“The virus will not be eradicated. The virus will be with us for years to come” Bourla said adding that “we should be able to come to normal lives… in a few months.” However he stressed there will continue to be “anomalies such as Omicron… that we will be able to control.”

He noted Pfizer was working on a vaccine against the Omicron variant but predicted “there will be more variants.”

“This virus is having the tendency to create new variants… and to escape immune protection [whether] from vaccines or natural protections” he said.

Unlike other variants to date Bourla said “only Omicron” was able to bypass the protection against infection provided by vaccines but stressed inoculation remains effective at preventing hospitalization.

Bourla also told the network that he is regularly targeted by anti-vaccine activists who post false information about him online and send him threatening letters.

Differentiating the “sizable minority” of people who are hesitant to take the vaccine Bourla said in a separate interview with Channel 13 news that “there is a tiny minority of people who profit from circulating misinformation.

“They know very well everything; they just make it a way of living to circulate this misinformation; they are criminals” he said.

He said anti-vaxxers falsely claimed his wife had died and that this was because he forced her to vaccinate causing him to frantically call his kids and wife’s elderly parents to let them know everything was fine.

“But that’s the least of the damage. The biggest thing is because people believe those things… people who die are predominantly not vaccinated” Bourla said.

“Millions of people have died because of them this small number of criminals.”

Commenting on his ties with Israeli leaders he told Channel 12 that he developed “very cordial relations with Bibi [Netanyahu] before and [Prime Minister] Naftali [Bennett] now.” He added that he has remained in contact with Benjamin Netanyahu.

“I know in Israel… you have politics that sometimes divides you. For us the Jews outside there is Israel. There is not one party or the other” he said. “We feel Israel is a safe harbor that we can always go [to]. So for us Israel is very important.”

He added that whoever leads the Jewish state “for me it is very important to take the call immediately.”

The interviews came days after the Genesis Foundation announced that Borula was the winner of its annual prize. President Isaac Herzog will present Bourla with the $1 million prize at a ceremony in Israel to be held on June 29.

An aging and highly sun-exposed population plus an increasing number of immune problems may be causing a rise in a rare cancer related to the skin’s touch receptors called Merkel cell carcinoma.

Merkel cell carcinoma (MCC) is a rare but aggressive skin cancer that forms in the top layer of the skin near the nerve endings that sense touch. It’s a quick-growing cancer that can be hard to treat if it spreads to other parts of the body or metastasizes. In the U.S. there are about 2500 new cases of MCC diagnosed a year which comprises a little less than one percent of total skin cancer cases.

Approximately 5-12% of patients with MCC have metastatic disease and less than half of these patients survive more than one year. While MCC is rare compared to other skin cancers the incidence of MCC tripled from 1986 to 2001 making it the most rapidly increasing skin cancer. In addition to a greater sun-exposed aging population and more immunosuppressed patients higher incidence of MCC may be due to advances in tools to diagnose the disease.

Appearance

Merkel cells are found in the basal layer of skin about 0.1 mm from the skin’s surface. Under normal conditions Merkel cells help transmit touch information to the brain and also produce hormones. Recent evidence suggests that MCC does not begin directly from normal Merkel cells. Rather it’s more likely that the malignant cells derive from a precursor of a normal Merkel cell (a stem cell in the epidermis).

MCC commonly appears as a dome-shaped flesh-colored to red-violet bump on frequently sun–exposed areas of the skin such as the head neck arms and legs. It’s not usually painful but sometimes the top of the skin may break open and bleed.

Causes

Like most other skin cancers extensive sun exposure is a major risk for developing MCC and this cancer is more common in those with fair skin. The sun’s ultraviolet (UV) rays cause DNA damage to the skin’s cells which can lead to cancer growth. Tanning beds are also another source of harmful UV rays.

Age is a factor as well. Some 75 percent of patients are over the age of 65 at diagnosis with the average age being 74.

People with weakened immune systems are also at higher risk of developing this cancer. The risk of developing MCC is eight times greater in HIV infected individuals ten times greater in organ transplant patients and 40 times greater in those with chronic lymphocytic leukemia.

In 2008 scientists at the University of Pittsburgh discovered a virus known as Merkel cell polyomavirus found in nearly 80 percent of MCC tumors. Most people are exposed to this virus at some point in their lifetimes with no symptoms. Scientists are still figuring out how it’s linked to MCC in some individuals. One theory is that the virus is more likely to proliferate and flourish in those with a suppressed immune system which in turn can raise the risk of MCC.

One of the brightest was Keyonte George the rookie out of Baylor who burst onto the scene from day one and seized the Jazz starting point guard role.

It’s hard to expect any more from the 20-year-old who was taken with the 16th pick in last summer's draft. George averaged 13.0 points 4.4 assists and 2.8 rebounds per game for the Jazz. Those numbers were good for fourth in scoring and second in total assists amongst all rookies this year. The passing in particular was a lot better than advertised after not being asked to do much of that while at Baylor.

George’s scoring remains the most intriguing piece of his game. He recorded three games in which he scored over 30 points and went over 20 points in nine others. When he’s playing confidently he can get buckets from all three levels and has plenty of juice from long-range. On February 15 George etched his name into the record books when he knocked down nine three-pointers which tied him for the rookie record and put him all alone for Jazz rookies.

An underrated storyline from the season was the leadership role the rookie took on as the season progressed. Jazz head coach Will Hardy thrust him into the starting point guard role early on and along with this came added responsibility- a responsibility that George seemed comfortable with. Heading into his first full offseason George will have even more of an opportunity to be a leader for this Jazz team that is looking to improve.

Despite all the positives it wasn’t a perfect season for George. He like the Jazz's other guards struggled with efficiency. There was a point in the middle of March where George seemed to have figured out how to get to his spots and score more efficiently but those numbers dipped as his teammates missed games and his name became more prominent on opposing scouting reports. Judging by his end-of-season comments he’s not worried about the misses. George said getting stronger and in better shape would result in the shots falling at a higher clip.

Defensively George is still a work in progress. Although his length stands out there's still plenty of room to grow. He has enough size to play either backcourt position which he used to showcase some nice individual defensive sequences. His off-ball awareness needs to improve as does his general focus on that end but he certainly has the potential to be a fine defender in this league.

One area where George can improve is in his words emotional intelligence. He’s immensely talented but he needs to keep his head up when he misses a shot or makes a silly turnover. He’s young though and there’s so much good that it’s hard to dwell on the bad.

Overall it was a very promising season for George. He’ll head into a big offseason with a lot to learn but a great foundation of skills & intelligence to build on. In a postgame press conference Hardy said that Keyonte could become the future of the Jazz program. That is high praise from his head coach but it is certainly a quote that should make you feel good as a Jazz fan.

Point guard Deivon Smith is transferring to St. John's from Utah giving Hall of Fame coach Rick Pitino a veteran replacement for Daniss Jenkins next season.

A fifth-year senior Smith ranked sixth in the country with 7.1 assists per game last season. He averaged 13.3 points and 6.3 rebounds for the Utes compiling five triple-doubles -- second most during a single season in NCAA history and the most by any Pac-12 player.

In a St. John's news release Monday Pitino said the 6-foot Smith reminds him of Miami Heat guard Terry Rozier a standout player for Pitino at Louisville.

""Super excited to have Deivon Smith joining the Johnnies"" Pitino said. ""Total dog who rebounds creates and scores.""

Smith from Decatur Georgia played his freshman season at Mississippi State and then spent two years with Georgia Tech. He shot a career-high 46.7% from the field in 28 games during his only season at Utah.

Two of his triple-doubles came during Utah's run to the NIT semifinals and he scored a career-best 28 points against tournament runner-up Indiana State on April 2.

Smith becomes the third notable transfer the Red Storm have landed this offseason joining 7-foot-1 center Vincent Iwuchukwu from USC and 6-foot-7 forward Aaron Scott from North Texas. They both committed last month.

At point guard St. John's also returns sophomore Simeon Wilcher a touted recruit who began to show marked improvement late last season in his limited role as a freshman. Wilcher averaged 2.8 points and 9.1 minutes in 28 games as Jenkins' understudy.

Jenkins followed Pitino from Iona to St. John's for his senior season and propelled the Red Storm to a 20-13 record including 11-9 in conference play for their most Big East wins in 14 years. They reached the Big East tournament semifinals for the first time since 2000 losing 95-90 to eventual NCAA champion UConn.

Jenkins led the team in scoring (14.9 points per game) assists (5.4) steals (1.6) and minutes (30.7) earning second-team All-Big East honors.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZmh0dHBzOi8vZmFzdGVyc2tpZXIuY29tLzIwMjQvMDUvZm9ydC1rZW50LW91dGRvb3ItY2VudGVyLWlzLWFjY2VwdGluZy1hcHBsaWNhdGlvbnMtZm9yLWl0cy1wZy1wcm9ncmFtL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Fort Kent Outdoor Center is Accepting Applications for its PG Program – FasterSkier.com,The Fort Kent Outdoor Center in Fort Kent Maine is currently accepting applications for our 2024-2025 post graduate program.

McConnell continues surprising for Pacers,"Former Arizona Wildcats point guard T.J. McConnell is approaching a decade in the NBA an unlikely journey that has even seen McConnell become a playoff X-Factor for his Indiana Pacers. He was a huge part of Indiana nearly pulling off the upset in the first round versus the New York Knicks in a 121-117 Game 1 loss.

McConnell had 18 points three assists and three steals on 9-of-16 shooting in 22 minutes.

McConnell went undrafted in 2015 not thought of as much of a NBA prospect. He was not a shooter at the time and hasn’t developed into one since. He’s generously listed at 6-foot-1 lacks explosive movement and didn’t score too much as a Wildcat either.

What McConnell can do however is read the floor at an expert level and use his quickness from there to shift it mostly to set up his teammates. This got him a shot at making the Philadelphia 76ers roster which he did and he has been a near-constant as a rotation player since.

This season McConnell’s ninth in the league has really seen him break out as a bucket-getter. Yes you read that correctly. From Feb. 6 on McConnell off the bench averaged 13.3 points per game while shooting 58.2% from the field. Again that’s while taking less than one 3-pointer a game and for the season he knocked down 56.8% of his 2s.

McConnell’s quite honestly weird midrange game at Arizona consisting of 12-foot fallaways and other odd touch shots at the rim is now something he’s able to activate more frequently with confidence and a high level of understanding for where the real estate will be. On a spaced-out roster built around floor general Tyrese Haliburton McConnell has the room to scoot around and take his goofy shots.

He’s even got a little bit of shake to his handle despite dribbling like someone from a half-century ago.

T.J. McConnell slices through the defense and gets to the hoop for two 💨 pic.twitter.com/DzNx7AAHj5 — Indiana Pacers (@Pacers) May 7 2024

Defenses just aren’t used to defending someone like him. Looking at guards around his size McConnell was the first to put up at least 10 points a game with under one 3PA/G since Derrick Rose in 2016-17 and Tony Parker in 2015-16 per Stathead. New York was understandably trying to get away with either Jalen Brunson or Miles McBride defending McConnell without using its best perimeter options on him before changing that late.

One of McConnell’s signature attributes is his pace of play which will help the Pacers tremendously against the Knicks. McConnell always wants to get the ball up quickly and is rarely going to waste dribbles looking to at least threaten for the paint whenever possible like one of his all-time favorites Steve Nash. Defensively he will pick guys up fullcourt to do some pest work and moves like a guy who never runs out of energy.

The Knicks play a short rotation and commonly put starters in the low-to-mid 40s for minutes and Indiana was deliberately speeding the game up on both ends to play the long game of wearing New York down. McConnell will be a key part of that effort with his importance in a second-round series still being hard to believe.

Blocker played in 27 games starting five for Arkansas as a true freshman. He averaged just under four points per game.

As a member of the Class of 2023 Blocker was a four-star recruit out of Little Rock (Ark.) Sunrise Christian (Kans.) according to the On3 Industry Ranking a weighted average that utilizes all four major recruiting media companies. He was the No. 2 overall prospect coming out of Kansas the No. 12 point guard in the class and the No. 45 overall prospect in the class.

Blocker shared on social media when he intended enter the transfer portal.

“Prayer hard work and sacrifice opened up the doors for me to have an opportunity to play college basketball” Blocker said. “First and foremost I want to thank God for blessing me with the talent to play this game. I want to thank the University of Arkansas basketball coaching staff for recruiting me. It was an honor to represent the state of Arkansas and the Razorback program. I’m grateful for my teammates that have become brothers that who’ve all supported me on this journey.

“Thank you to all of the fans and the community for your love and support throughout the season. I also want to give a special thanks to the local businesses for your support. After much discussion and consideration I’ve decided to enter the transfer portal.”

To keep up with the latest players on the move check out On3’s Transfer Portal wire.

Blocker’s former coach Eric Musselman who left to take the USC gig raved about his former player’s development back in February.

“I thought he played really good tonight” Musselman said. “Obviously his two steals in the 23 minutes that he was in he was able to guard (Wade) Taylor and did a really good job other than the fouls. But we want him to be aggressive defensively. I thought he was phenomenal tonight.”"

Coronavirus health protocols meant to reduce the risk of infections and vaccines that significantly prevent the likelihood of severe disease and death have helped significantly reduce the number of people who succumb to the pandemic especially in Africa experts have said.

It is believed that the same approach can be used to lower the scourge of smoking-related deaths.

“Africa is less affected by Covid-19 and there are many reasons for that” said Dr Imane Kendili who is currently the vice president of the African Centre for Health Research at the recent Harm Reduction Exchange webinar.

She is also the president of the Moroccan Association for Addictive Medicine and Associated Pathologies.

“Mask wearing vaccines and social distancing are meant to reduce risk. We have to give people the best option possible . . . I think in Africa more than elsewhere we know our limitations in health and infrastructure budgets compared to other countries. I think harm has been the main approach. It is not about having the best infrastructure possible but having good behaviour . . . Harm reduction works across a spectrum of issues.”

The Harm Reduction Exchange aims to create awareness and promote dialogue on the concept of harm reduction across the continent.

In essence harm reduction refers to policies programmes and practices aimed at minimising negative health social and legal impacts associated with the use of harmful products.

According to Dr Kendili people especially those facing increased risk of harmful and addictive products can be assisted to accept better and safer alternatives through exposure to evidence- and science-based information.

“People are reluctant to take many things but when you engage and involve them that might help. Communication is key . . . We must take this into account. The issue is how to give people information and let them decide . . .

“It’s not about forcing people to take the vaccine. When you impose it it doesn’t work.

“We need public policy based on harm reduction . . .

“The all-or-nothing approach does not work. “If you have a person who has been smoking for years even lung cancer will not force them to stop.”

Scientists are increasingly pushing for the same approach to be adopted to reduce smoking-related deaths.

While the coronavirus pandemic has killed about 56 million people in the past two years smoking continues to claim eight million lives annually especially in middle- to low-income countries. Africa is estimated to have more than seven million smokers of which 250 000 die annually.

The World Health Organisation through the Framework Convention for Tobacco Control (FCTC) has tried to ban tobacco but with little success.

Switching to harm-reducing alternatives therefore is thought to be a pathway to safer alternatives with favourable health outcomes particularly for those who cannot quit.

“Quitting (smoking) is by far the best option but it is not always possible” Professor David Khayat a French oncologist told the same webinar. “Smoking is an addiction and it is difficult to stop an addiction . . .

“Accepting that some level of bad behaviours are inevitable and therefore target to minimise the harms people suffer as a consequence not the behaviour becomes important.”

Studies have proven that prohibitionist interventions being pushed by the FCTC which came into force in 2005 have met with little success.

At one time France which took aggressive measures to prevent smoking saw a 15 million decline in smokers before they relapsed a year later proving that it was increasingly difficult for some smokers to quit. But experts believe alternative nicotine-delivery systems such as heat-not-burn products (for example IQOS) snus and e-cigarettes among others could provide a way to reduce risk.

Burning tobacco generates smoke which contains more than 6 000 chemicals and ultrafine particles.

Ninety-three of the chemicals are listed by the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) as harmful and potentially harmful constituents.

The majority — almost 80 — are carcinogens or potential carcinogens.

Prohibition has been empirically proven to be ineffective.

In the US for example the national prohibition of alcohol between 1920 to 1933 was a failure.

“The elephant in the room for Africa is the WHO” said Dr Kgosi Letlape who is the president of the Africa Medical Association and co-founder of the Africa Harm Reduction Alliance.

He noted that the FCTC has inherent limitations since it focuses solely on combustible cigarettes and does not take into consideration the efficacy of safer alternatives that significantly reduce the harm caused by tobacco.

But policymakers around the world seem to be moving in the right direction.

In July 2020 the FDA which is considered as the gold standard allowed Philip Morris International (PMI) to market IQOS in the US.

In October last year it also approved e-cigarette for sale for the first time.

There is now a general push for public health experts to not only consider tobacco harm-reducing alternatives but to make them readily accessible at reasonable prices.",,,,,,,,,,,,

Well that’s not the philosophy this weekend and it’s even grimmer next weekend as most majors figured in the wake of MLK weekend and a traditional box office dead zone like January with omicron flying around that it’s not worth the P&A spend to release any movies.

Back in the good ole days and we’re talking five years ago post-MLK was the time when Universal turned M. Night Shyamalan’s Blumhouse horror movie Split into an event with a $40M start and Paramount settled for second on their Vin Diesel sequel xXx: Return of Xander Cage for $20.1M.

Ghostface and Jenna Ortega in Paramount Pictures and Spyglass Media Group’s “ Scream .” Paramount

And so we settle for Sony’s Spider-Man: No Way Home rising to No. 1 in its 6th weekend with $14.1M putting its massive domestic total at $721.5M and Paramount/Spyglass Media’s Scream in second with a better-than-anticipated drop of -59% with $12.4M and a $51.3M ten-day total. That second weekend ease is a bit better than Scream 4 (-61%) and richer than the previous installment which did $7M in weekend 2. Among the franchise’s second weekends Scream 2022 ranks third behind Scream 3 ($16.3M) and Scream 2 ($13.9M).

Spider-Man‘s cume by Sunday keeps the blockbuster title in 4th place among all movies at the domestic box office. If the webslinger is going to beat Avatar and become the third-highest grossing movie of all-time in the US and Canada Spider-Man: No Way Home has to do another $40.1M+ in business.

Can it get there? It’s possible.

Avatar 20th Century Fox

Through six weekends No Way Home is 31% ahead of Avatar at the same point in time (which was at $551.7M by the end of the weekend following the MLK frame). However the difference between the movies is that Spidey is more front-loaded while Avatar continued to do meaty numbers into Presidents Day weekend (i.e. weekend 6 was $34.9M weekend 7 was $31.2M weekend 8 was $22.85M while the 4-day Presidents Day holiday pulled in $28.7M).

If No Way Home is going to beat Avatar than it needs to emulate a box office gross pattern that’s similar to 2015’s Star Wars: Force Awakens between this weekend and the end of President’s Day weekend which is where Spider-Man can see another boost. Here’s where there is hope: Spider-Man: No Way Home made a similar amount of cash as Force Awakens in its post MLK weekend 6 ($14M). In weekend 7 Episode 7 fell 21% to $11M; all in-between weekend 6 and Presidents Day Monday the Star Wars title did $37.1M. No Way Home needs to do a little more than that. By Presidents Day weekend Force Awakens was booked in 1800 theaters.

On a global basis Spider-Man: No Way Home is now the No. 6 highest-grossing movie worldwide passing Jurassic World ($1.67 billion) and The Lion King ($1.66 billion) with a worldwide haul of $1.69 billion including $970.1M from offshore territories.

Major studio moviegoing isn’t expected to come back until Feb. 4 with Lionsgate’s sci-fi Roland Emmerich title Moonfall and Paramount’s Jackass Forever. One wonders if there was a missed opportunity here by studios sitting on the sidelines this weekend. I get it best to spend your marketing money during a pandemic on the holiday frames when there’s more of the audience available.

However with the 18-34 demographic being the most confident to head to the movies it’s interesting to note that there were more colleges out on Friday at 15% and K-12 at 3% then there will be on Feb. 4 which is respectively 2% and 1%.

Go figure but in the wake of Sony moving Morbius the assumption was that Omicron would be worse by this point in time. The surge is flattening according to the Los Angeles Times even though California is averaging 100K new cases a day more than twice as high as last winter’s high of 46K. Los Angeles County Public Health Director Barbara Ferrer advised many to delay nonessential activities such as unmasked parties and dinners given the plateau.

‘The Batman’ Warner Bros. Japan via YouTube

There will come a time when studios return to a big event movie a week this year. Essentially that begins on March 25 with Paramount’s The Lost City and continues into summer. Until then there are dead zones on the calendar i.e. next weekend there aren’t any wide releases ditto for Feb. 25-27; and the weekend after Warner Bros. The Batman opens (March 4) and from March 11-13 there aren’t any wide releases programmed. That said analysts seem to debate whether the Matt Reeves DC title will be another $100M+ opener; news of the pic’s 2 hour and 55 minute running time casting a bit of doubt.

Universal

You may have noticed that Universal did open the faith-based period movie Redeeming Love based on the Francine Rivers novel in 1903 theaters to $1.49M on Friday set for a $3.7M weekend. But it’s not the studio’s movie. They’re just doing a distribution deal and I understand that they’re not even on the hook for marketing. The movie from Eagle Eye and Disturbia director D.J. Caruso was produced by Nthibah Pictures Pinnacle Peak Pictures and Mission Pictures International. Roma Downey is listed as an executive producer. Unlike other faith-based movies which typically win over their audiences with an A+ Redeeming Love received a B+. Comscore/Screen Engine PostTrak exits were at 85% positive and 72% recommend. Has anyone seen any ads for this film? I sure have not.

I hear there weren’t any NYC or LA cinemas in the top 100 runs for the movie over the weekend with the South reaping close to 60% of the pic’s gross versus the business average of 35% for a regular wide release. Females led at 79% with 80% over 25 with 51% over 35. The 25-34 year olds repped close to a third of ticket-buyers. Diversity demos were 64% Caucasian 17% Latino or Hispanic 12% Asian/other and 7% Black.

Shot in South Africa Redeeming Love is set against the 1850 California Gold Rush and follows Angel (Abigail Cowen) who was sold into prostitution as a child. She has survived through hatred and self-loathing until she meets Michael Hosea (Tom Lewis) and discovers there is no brokenness that love can’t heal. Critics turned their backs on this one at 11% on Rotten Tomatoes.

Gravitas

With the lack of competition on marquees Gravitas Ventures decided to make the Pierce Brosnan-William Hurt-Kaya Scodelario movie The King’s Daughter their widest release ever at 2170 locations. The movie’s weekend results made Redeeming Love‘s ticket sales look like a blockbuster with an estimated $750K.

The PG movie follows Brosnan as The Sun King Louis XIV. Obsessed with his own mortality and the future of France Louis turns to his spiritual advisor Père La Chaise (Hurt) and the royal physician to help him obtain the key to immortality. Believing a mermaid (Fan Bingbing) contains a force that grants everlasting life Louis commissions a young sea captain to search the seas and capture the mystical creature. Further complicating his plans is his orphaned daughter Marie-Josèphe (Scodelario) who returns to court with an abundance of elegance and an inherent defiance of authority.

Critics enjoyed The King’s Daughter just a little bit more than Redeeming Love at 26%. Really soft ticket sales here mostly in the West with PostTrak at 66% and a low 31% recommend. Those few who decided to see it were women at 54% 84% over 25 63% over 35 and 44% over 45 years old. Diversity demos were 62% Caucasian 19% Latino and Hispanic 11% Asian/other and 4% Black.

So what are they waiting for? People there keep telling me they need asset prices of merger partners to “normalize” aka fall enough so Goldman remains in control of the combined company.

Well we’re starting to see some “normal.”

A look at the asset prices of potential partners — PNC Bank US Bancorp State Street BNY Mellon some mid-sized asset managers and even potentially brokerage firm Charles Schwab & Co. — are starting to come back to earth as the Fed begins raising interest rates.

Another factor that might force CEO David Solomon’s hand are the obvious holes in Goldman’s business model. Goldman has a long and storied rep killing it in M&A and trading.

Tough competition

But it’s tough having only two horses in the race competing against banking behemoths like JPMorgan. Sure Goldman wasn’t the only bank to experience a hiccup because of trading volatility and higher expenses (the vaunted JPM did as well). But JPM has a big balance sheet far larger than the size of Goldman’s and JPM CEO Jamie Dimon can paper over surprises such as rapid and unexpected increases in compensation costs which bedeviled Solomon in the fourth quarter of 2021 and possibly into 2022.

That’s why Goldman’s earnings miss last week has the Wall Street rumor mill spinning again.

Solomon also knows that if you’re Goldman the merger has got to be the right one or else the CEO will go down in infamy as having evaporated one of the world’s greatest corporate brands.

And this is where it gets tricky. As for potential partners Schwab — the world’s most prestigious discount broker — would be an obvious choice. Schwab’s business involves registered investment advisers selling high-end financial products to rich people which complements Goldman’s own very high-end wealth-management business.

But Schwab’s price in Goldmanese hasn’t been normalized enough. The San Francisco-based Schwab has a market value of $168 billion compared to Goldman’s $115 billion. Charles Schwab’s ego — and yes the company’s 84-year-old founder namesake and chairman is still around — won’t let him sell out a bunch of traders in New York if he doesn’t have to.

Both PNC and US Bancorp have lower market caps than Goldman and they would be attractive particularly in a high-interest-rate environment the Fed has signaled; banks make a lot of money when rates rise.

But like Schwab neither has to do a deal. The monetary-policy environment favors their business model over Goldman’s.

Asset managers that might be available — think T. Rowe Price — would get Solly around $1.5 trillion in assets and entry into the lucrative mutual-fund business.

Ask yourself though: Why ­haven’t there been more marriages between fund companies and Wall Street? Answer: Combining those cultures is a little like trying to get Hillary Clinton to play nice with Donald Trump.

With all these variables to weigh the conventional wisdom among bankers is that Goldman isn’t rushing to do anything. Solomon is doing a great job; he’s beat earnings expectations seven times before the recent fourth-quarter 2021 miss. Some analysts say his stock looks cheap compared to competitors like Morgan Stanley but Goldman has the edge in market prowess.

That’s one way to look at it; another way is the reason why Morgan Stanley beat fourth-quarter expectations: It has a huge wealth-management business that stabilized and papered over a trading slowdown.

Again Solomon and his people are smart. They know they have to do a deal and the right one at the right time.

Sensible ‘Fink think’

Larry Fink’s annual letter to CEOs is always must-read material this year even more so because he added a fair amount of common sense to the relentless push by the Biden administration and corporate America to adopt green-energy policies.

Fink the CEO of BlackRock is no stranger to this effort. He’s used his clout as chief of the world’s largest money-management firm ($9 trillion in assets) to prod companies to adopt policies that he believes will transition the country and the world to what’s known as “net zero” carbon admissions.

With that came criticism from conservatives and this column since BlackRock alumni fill the Biden White House. Yes green energy sounds good in practice and Teslas are very popular in Beverly Hills but working-class Americans can’t afford electric cars. Higher oil and gas prices are tax increases on Middle America.

Fink didn’t back off his embrace of green energy. But in the letter he also pointed out how this movement is being hijacked by environmental zealots.

He advocated for a transition that takes into account that “any plan that focuses solely on limiting supply and fails to address demand for hydrocarbons will drive up energy prices for those who can least afford it resulting in greater polarization around climate change and eroding progress.”

Let’s hope his friends in the Biden administration are listening.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMijQFodHRwczovL3d3dy5jaXR5Yml6LmNvL2FydGljbGUvMTIyMTcwL2RhdmlkLW5ldmlucy1pbnRlcnZpZXdzLWhlYXRoZXItc2NoYWZlci1hZGtpbnMtcHJlc2lkZW50LW9mLXRoZS1oYXJmb3JkLWNvdW50eS1hc3NvY2lhdGlvbi1vZi1yZWFsdG9ycy_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,David Nevins Interviews Heather Schafer Adkins President of the Harford County Association of REALTORS,"Heather Schafer Adkins is a residential real estate professional and the president of the Harford County Association of REALTORS®.

7:28 Got an unexpected package? It could be part of a brushing scam

Meghan Atkinson's experience with a scam known as brushing started last summer with a dog pool.

Though she had not ordered the item it was delivered to her home by Amazon. Atkinson doesn't even have a dog.

She scoured her order history and credit card statements thinking maybe she accidentally added it to her online cart. But there was no trace of the product. Then the packages kept coming.

""We got a smartwatch which looks like an Apple Watch"" she told Day 6. ""I've had phone cords for Apple products but I don't have any Apple products.""

She added: ""I've had vacuum bags but it doesn't say what vacuum they would work with so they're just still sitting around.""

According to experts and the Better Business Bureau a consumer advocacy organization receiving unsolicited packages may be part of so-called brushing scams. Companies often operating overseas purchase items and have them shipped to random recipients so the seller can then write a favourable review on the product.

Meghan Atkinson has been receiving packages of items she never ordered including this pet nail trimmer. (Submitted by Meghan Atkinson)

The shipments typically include light-weight low-cost items. The aim is to boost a sellers' product rating on e-commerce shops such as Amazon.

""If you're like most consumers who use Amazon one of the very first things you do ... is you look for the product that has the most positive reviews"" Brian Kilcourse co-founder of Retail Systems Research said from San Francisco.

""This is one of the ways that they goose up the number of positive reviews that they have.""

Brushing scams became more common in 2020 when unsolicited seeds sent from China began appearing in mailboxes across Canada.

Potential privacy risk

Those who are targeted in a brushing scam aren't on the hook for anything that arrives at their door. That means they owe no money nor do they have to return the delivered item. In Atkinson's case she's given away a number of items from her mystery shopper.

But experts and consumer advocates warn that it could signal your personal information is in the hands of bad actors.

Atkinson has received various items from a dog pool to these fishing lures. Experts say that items sent as part of brushing scams are typically lightweight and low cost. (Submitted by Meghan Atkinson)

""They might get your information if you let's say clicked on a link that was [in] a phishing email"" said Jessie St-Cyr spokesperson for the Better Business Bureau in Ottawa. Details like your name address and phone number could also be floating around the dark web where they're sold.

""Nobody is immune to scams — to brushing scams either — and so it's our duty as consumers to protect our information and make sure we're not victims of identity theft or brushing scams in these cases"" she said.

Oftentimes people may not know the unexpected deliveries are a scam. Like Atkinson many assume they've received a package that's been delivered to the wrong address.

On its website Amazon says that customers who receive unsolicited packages should immediately report the delivery noting that third-party resellers on the platform are prohibited from the practice.

The company says that it ""takes action"" on retailers that participate in brushing which may include ""removing selling privileges withholding payments and working with law enforcement.""

Atkinson who lives in Waterdown Ont. part of Hamilton reached out to Amazon for help but she says it told her that once personal information is out there not much can be done.

""It's pretty pervasive and it's an insidious problem so it's not an easy thing for them to solve.""

Among the other items Atkinson has unexpectedly received are vacuum bags for an unspecified vacuum and charging cables for Apple devices which she does not own. (Submitted by Meghan Atkinson)

Stopping deliveries a challenge

Both St-Cyr and Kilcourse say that people can take action if they suspect they're receiving packages as part of a brushing scheme.

First make sure that you ""change all the passwords to anything related to payment processing that you have on the internet"" Kilcourse said. That means services like PayPal and Amazon as well as your online banking accounts should get a security checkup.

Consumers should also keep a close eye on their bank and credit statements to ensure they're not being charged for anything they didn't buy.

""Another thing is to get your credit report once a year especially if you've been a victim to a brushing scam"" St-Cyr said.

Experts say that unsolicited packages do not need to be returned to sender. (Charlie Riedel/The Associated Press)

But it can prove difficult to get the packages to stop.

""If there is a way to make it stop I haven't heard of it. Unfortunately once your name is out there being bandied about by these people it's pretty hard to get them to stop because you don't know who they are"" she said.

While Atkinson says the mystery of her surprise Amazon packages was entertaining at the beginning now she hopes to see the deliveries disappear — especially given concerns about access to her private information.

""It would also be good if it just stopped because it is all junk so none of it's really worth keeping.""

What makes Atlanta such a great place to earn an MBA? Since I last graduated from Emory every time I came back to visit Atlanta I noticed the city kept on growing. Personally the cultural diversity and laid-back feel matched my personality. Professionally Atlanta is developing its reputation as an East Coast tech hub with Google recently confirming office expansions Microsoft moving into a new office space and Airbnb making Atlanta its regional office. I cannot imagine another city providing better opportunities in the technology space.

Aside from your classmates and location what was the key part of Emory Goizueta’s MBA programming that led you to choose this business school and why was it so important to you? Goizueta’s relationships with the Atlanta startup and technology community really appealed to me. It is well known that Atlanta houses many Fortune 500 companies but the entrepreneurship and technology scene has gone from strength to strength. In the first half of 2021 Georgia companies have raised almost $2 billion of venture capital which is more than the total amount raised in 2020. I am excited to get involved with Atlanta’s entrepreneurship ecosystem collaborators and partners and love that Goizueta will provide me those opportunities.

What course club or activity excites you the most at Emory Goizueta? I am excited to launch a FinTech and Blockchain Club at Goizueta to take advantage of Atlanta’s burgeoning FinTech industry with companies such as Kabbage Greenlight and BitPay. There is a tremendous opportunity for the Goizueta FinTech and Blockchain Club to serve as the platform for all Goizueta students interested in FinTech and Blockchain through providing education connecting leading FinTech organizations with students and focusing on the latest research and industry trends.

Describe your biggest accomplishment in your career so far: I spearheaded project management for the firm’s largest engagement a year-long effort to transform compliance culture at a U.S. megabank with approximately $2 trillion in assets. I was managing six workstreams and an international team of 30 consultants which resulted in the improvement of the bank’s compliance operations and the client’s public image. This was my first time overseeing such a large and highly visible project. It was an incredibly rewarding time.

How did COVID-19 change your perspective on your career and your life in general? COVID allowed me to examine what kind of company I want to work for post-MBA and beyond. During such an exhausting time professionally when the lines between work and life were blurred I found the importance of finding joy and truly believing in a company’s mission. I asked myself ‘Is the company tackling problems that help move society forward?’ The pandemic helped me affirm that FinTech is truly the industry I want to make an impact in. During the pandemic FinTech has helped consumers and small businesses through various means such as direct cash payments to consumers loan assistance for small businesses and quicker launches of new product features.

What led you to pursue an MBA at this point and what do you hope to do after graduation? After consulting numerous clients across the financial services ranging from US megabanks to venture-backed digital assets firms I realized my interests lie squarely within FinTech. I learned a lot on the job but want to diversify my skill set and business acumen to amplify my impact in FinTech. Post-MBA I hope to take all my consulting experience along with an MBA to help promote financial inclusion at a FinTech or supporting FinTechs through venture capital.

What other MBA programs did you apply to? Fuqua Darden McCombs

What advice would you give to help potential applicants gain admission into Emory Goizueta’s MBA program? The application process can be an incredibly stressful time but take the opportunity to learn more about yourself your intrinsic motivations and craft your story. Applicants may come from similar backgrounds on paper such as consulting but everyone has a unique story and a diverse perspective. I firmly believe everything happens for a reason and you will end like myself at the school best for you.

Procter & Gamble on Friday reported mixed quarterly results as it struggles to bring back shoppers after two years of hiking prices across its portfolio from Tide detergent to Charmin toilet paper.

The company's prices were up 3% compared with the year-ago period although CFO Andre Schulten said on a media call that P&G didn't institute any nationwide price hikes during the quarter.

Despite its disappointing sales the consumer giant raised its full-year outlook for earnings growth.

Shares of the company fell more than 1% in morning trading.

Here's what P&G reported compared with what Wall Street was expecting based on a survey of analysts by LSEG:

Earnings per share: $1.52 vs. $1.41 expected

Revenue: $20.2 billion vs. $20.41 billion expected

P&G reported fiscal third-quarter net income attributable to the company of $3.75 billion or $1.52 per share up from $3.4 billion or $1.37 per share a year earlier.

Net sales rose 1% to $20.2 billion. Organic sales which strip out acquisitions divestitures and foreign currency increased 3% in the quarter.

But the company's quarterly volume was flat for the second consecutive quarter. In October executives said they anticipated returning to volume growth in fiscal 2024. Three quarters in the company hasn't yet lured back many of the customers it scared away with its price hikes over the last two years.

However three of P&G's divisions reported volume growth for the quarter. Its beauty segment which includes Olay and Pantene saw volume rise 1% fueled by innovation in personal care. The company's grooming business home to its Gillette and Venus razors reported volume growth of 2%. And fabric and home care which includes Febreze and Swiffer saw 1% volume growth.

But P&G's health care and baby feminine and family care divisions saw volume drop further. The company blamed its higher prices and a weaker cold and flu season for the declines.

Geography also played a role in the company's lackluster sales. China the company's second-largest market is still seeing softer demand for products like its pricey SK-II skin care. Schulten also said that some markets particularly in the Middle East have seen retailers pull back on promotions amid geopolitical tensions tied to the war in Gaza.

""The impact is visible but limited and we expect it to lessen obviously hopefully as these tensions ease over time"" he said.

In the U.S. P&G's largest market the company's volume grew 3%. Schulten said the U.S. consumer isn't trading down or changing shopping behavior.

""Consumers don't want to take a gamble when it comes to the type of performance ... they know ultimately the price for trading down"" he said.

For the full year P&G is now expecting core net earnings per share growth of 10% to 11% up from its prior range of 8% to 9%. The company also raised its projection for unadjusted earnings growth to a range of 1% to 2% up from its previous forecast of down 1% to flat. P&G maintained its outlook of 2% to 4% sales growth in 2024.

P&G also now expects a $900 million benefit from favorable commodity costs up from its previous outlook of $800 million. That's a reversal from the last two fiscal years when commodity costs weighed on the company leading to price hikes.

P&G although saying they are mainly cruelty-free now continues experimenting on animals.

Plenty of makeup is tested on animals like rodents — and dogs and cats — something state Rep. Sara Carruthers (R-Hamilton) wants to change.

""Some of this stuff is just inhumane sick and unnecessary"" Carruthers said. ""A lethal dose test involves forcing rats to swallow large amounts of chemicals until the subject dies so that you can determine the dose that causes death.""

She and state Rep. Bride Rose Sweeney (D-Cleveland) introduced House Bill 495 which would stop the majority of animal testing for cosmetics sold in Ohio.

Not only would this save animals but it would also help the economy — since consumers want cruelty-free products Carruthers said.

The vegan cosmetic market is growing exponentially in part because of Generation Z's interest in ""ethically sourced products"" according to UNiDAYS a popular student shopping app that conducts market research.

But Carruthers' background is what made her interested in animal rights.

""My great great grandfather did it — they did use animal testing"" she said.

Carruthers is a descendant of Cincinnati-based company Procter and Gamble and she wants companies like hers to stop animal experimentation. Although her family still has some influence they no longer have a vote in the company policies and have no position on the board. She says her family no longer owns any part of the corporate giant but their Procter-side of the family continues to be a fixture in the Cincinnati area.

I reached out to P&G whose spokesperson said in a statement that their PETA cruelty-free brands are not tested on animals. However that is a small percentage. They have 79 brands and only 13 are on the PETA-certified list.

""P&G has invested over $480 million in non-animal test method development over decades and is partnering with groups like PETA and the Humane Society International & US working closely with governments to end animal testing globally"" the company said.

Some countries still mandate testing on animals they added.

A significant portion of their products are made in China according to 2018 testimony given to the U.S. Trade Representative and Chinese regulations require testing on products like toothpaste hair treatments and anything with sunscreen in it like a moisturizer or foundation.

I asked for a multitude of clarifications on their ""cruelty-free"" policy including data backing up their statements of being anti-animal testing. They were not addressed in their short statement.

It isn't just the United States and China that they have plants. They have factories on all continents minus Antarctica. Some locations have rules against animal testing some require it and others have other types of restraints — such as Japan which holds each ""institution responsible for self-regulation"" according to researchers.

""Let's go for made in America right?"" Carruthers said. ""We have modern testing methods like human cell-based tests sophisticated computer models.""

But bioethics expert and law professor at Case Western Reserve University Sharona Hoffman says the change could be a huge blow to medical advancements.

""Computer modeling is not a substitute for all animal studies — and also you have to worry about the expense"" Hoffman said.

Carruthers responded that data has shown that animal alternatives are actually cheaper but Hoffman is doubtful.

""Growing tissue in labs is quite expensive"" the professor said.

The bill language is broad and it could seemingly impact research to help burn victims or patients who want reconstruction surgeries after cancer or trauma.

""If you're talking about lipstick or blush I would probably agree that you don't need to use animals"" Hoffman said acknowledging that makeup isn't the true concern of hers. ""But for other treatments we have to remember 'cosmetic' is very very broad.""

The National Association for Biomedical Research is also concerned stating that the bill may have a negative impact on ""new compounds and molecules that are being developed for dual — cosmetic and medical — application.""

NABR's full statement from spokesperson Eva Maciejewski:

""Measuring the safety and efficacy of a new molecule or compound usually involves preclinical testing with animals and adjunct methods and then phased human clinical trials. Scientists and regulators strive to reduce the number of animals used. They also prioritize the development and adoption of refinement methods. However scientists cannot observe the combined effects of a new molecule or compound on the body’s interconnected systems over time by relying exclusively on artificial intelligence organ chips and other non-animal methods. They also need to use animals to determine if the new molecule or compound is safe enough to begin human clinical trials. It is therefore unclear whether the proposed state bill HB 495 could have a negative impact on new compounds and molecules that are being developed for dual - cosmetic and medical - application.""

""Animal studies do not proceed without any oversight"" Hoffman added. ""This isn't just some scientist collecting rats in the garage and then experimenting on them.""

Carruthers argued there are exceptions such as when there is no non-animal method available.

""This is a no-brainer"" the lawmaker said.

This bill will likely be heard in the coming months. She also introduced another bipartisan bill to crack down and try to prevent puppy mills which she said she talked to P&G about.

IT’S THAT TIME of year when we gardeners are shopping shopping shopping often in hot pursuit of just the right plant that will make the design of a bed or the larger landscape hang together—that elusive missing ingredient. But what if the answer isn’t a plant sometimes but a pot or a sculpture or some other non-living elements strategically placed?

Stephen Procter a ceramist specializing in art for the garden has walked through many a landscape with prospective clients helping to figure out the roles such pieces could play.

Stephen who is Vermont-based has for about 20 years has created monumental stoneware vessels that live in the landscape all four seasons. His work has been displayed at public gardens such as Blithewold in Rhode Island and The Mount Edith Wharton’s home in the Berkshires of Massachusetts. He helped me think about what else besides plants can help the garden hang together and how.

sculptural pots in the garden with stephen procter

Margaret Roach: Hi Stephen. I first got to know of your work thanks to the Instagram algorithm [view his account].

Stephen Procter: Thank goodness for Instagram.

Margaret: I know whatever. Because many of my virtual colleagues or whatever friends and garden designer friends and other keen gardener friends follow you there. And so I kept getting shown your posts of your vessels your pots and then so I contacted you and we worked together on a “New York Times” garden column together recently. And since those conversations we had for that story I keep looking around my garden with a different eye I have to say thanks to you. So: thanks to you.

Stephen: [Laughter.] I’m so happy to hear that.

Margaret: Yeah. So your pots are not just flower pots neither in scale nor in purpose. Tell us how big they range and what the intention what their intention initially … [Laughter.] How did this happen? You started making these big pots for gardens didn’t you? About 20 years ago.

Stephen: I sometimes wonder that myself. So so many questions you asked all at once there. I’ll try to take them up one at a time. My zone is sort of 3 to 5-1/2 feet tall for finished pieces the upward limitation being my tolerance for risk and the height of my custom-built kiln. And it’s funny I’ve been to several pottery events recently and I don’t really feel like a potter even though I work in clay.

People say potter or pottery and their mind conjures something quite different from what I do. So I think of myself more as a sculptor who works in clay. My approach is essentially sculptural. When I sit down at the wheel I am thinking about a rough sense of scale and form and it unfolds over several days as I’m throwing. Once in a while I’m working with a jig if I want to replicate a form that I’ve loved before. And I wound up putting them in gardens because they’re too big for most homes.

Margaret: [Laughter.] Yeah they are. They are. So again I said they’re not flower pots. We don’t put soil and plants in them although they do have a hole a drainage hole in the bottom. But neither in scale nor purpose is that what they’re for. But they’re functional. And I know that when we did the “Times” story you were explaining to me that in the world of ceramics there is this sort of we’ll say discussion but it might be a little tenser than that at times [laughter] about functional ceramics functional pottery versus I don’t know what the other end of it is whether it’s art or not.

Stephen: Versus nonfunctional or decorative.

Margaret: Yeah decorative. So yours are decorative but it’s not that they’re not functional. Correct?

Stephen: I think of them as functional in that they inspire people they define spaces they announce significance. I think of them as functional on a quasi-spiritual level if you will. It that’s not too big a claim.

Margaret: Well but I think the garden is I mean to me what else are we doing out there? It’s not just outdoor decorating is it? I mean hopefully it elevates us and the space.

Stephen: Absolutely. And I feel like a piece like this can really focus and amplify that effect in a certain way. The way especially it in a certain sense reorganizes the energy around it in an interesting way and certainly reorganizes the visual field when something like this enters the garden.

Margaret: Yeah. Well when we did the “Times” story you cited a poem which by Wallace Stevens whose work I’d read but I didn’t know the poem “Anecdote of the Jar.” I don’t know if you want to tell us about it but it was beautiful.

Stephen: Sadly I can’t recite the poem. I haven’t read it that recently. But he talks about placing a jar on a hill and what that does to the surrounding landscape. The line I particularly love is “It made the slovenly wilderness surround that hill.” And he talks about how it reorganizes all the relationships of the things surrounding it.

Margaret: Right. And so from that I wrote down one line I remember “The wilderness rose up to it and sprawled around it no longer wild.”

Stephen: Oh I love that line.

Margaret: And so there’s that sort of there’s the thing that’s man-made in the wild space and the two of them are changed a little bit from the relationship yeah?

Stephen: I feel like they enter a conversation of sorts between the man-made and the natural. And one instance of that that’s maybe even a little more intense than the garden which is already cultivated is when clients choose to site a piece of mine in relation to a large stone or a large rock where there’s this huge sort of primal presence of the stone conversing with the tamed stone of the stoneware vessel. It becomes a very interesting conversation to my mind.

Margaret: Right. Now I said in the introduction that yours because they’re this very high-fired stoneware they can stay outside all four seasons. And clearly a lot of… We’re sort of trying to inspire people in this conversation we’re having today on the podcast just to consider sculptural elements in the garden that can do the jobs we’re going to talk about. But some of them aren’t going to be four-season because they’re not going to be weatherproof so to speak. And so that has to be taken into consideration not just the placement and the scale and so forth but also the durability. And yours can do that.

Stephen: Yes. I use what potters call high-fire stoneware for exactly that reason. It’s completely impervious to moisture. To help people understand the difference I sometimes use the comparison of think of the material your dinnerware is made of as opposed to the material a terracotta pot is made of. This is more like the dinnerware. And I often like to go on and joke that added advantage it’s also microwavable and dishwasher-safe.

Margaret: [Laughter.] Yeah if you can haul the 250 pounds of clay into the house and shove it in the microwave. But in other words what I’m trying to say is that this could be a sculptural element a non-plant element of another substance but you’d have to consider its durability and its being weatherproof (or lack of being weatherproof). So that’s just to be kept in mind. So besides the wilderness rising up to it and being changed and it changing the wilderness people kind of rise up to it too when they see one of these don’t they [laughter]?

Stephen: I love watching people interact with these pots. I think of the pots as creatures of sorts and apparently other people do too. They approach them and they stroke them or they pet them or they hug them. There’s a lot of physical interaction that’s very unselfconscious and I see that happening and I always feel like oh the pots work; whatever its mysterious work is is happening in this interaction.

Margaret: So let’s talk about some of the work and some of the roles that a sculptural element like one of your large vessels can play and how do we figure it out where to place such a statement.

So if someone contacts you and says so I’m thinking I want something but I don’t know what or where you sometimes go and go on a walk with them I guess or do it photographically or whatever. But I mean what’s the beginning of that process of that exploration process?

I mean I always say one of the most important things about garden design and I’m no garden designer I just only know some basic principles is don’t forget besides walking around outside don’t forget to go inside and look out the window. Because I also want to have the sense of the outdoors from indoors because I’m indoors a lot right? So I don’t know if you take that into consideration like the placement not just from the outdoor experience but from key views within the living space.

Stephen: Absolutely I do. And it can make a big impact oddly to an indoor room almost as much as to an outdoor space the way it’s framed by a window or beckons someone to go outdoors and be in its presence. It’s a wonderful thing. And particularly for people I just heard recently from a garden designer who lives up in Central Vermont Judith Irven who was talking about she and her husband in the winter sit in their sunroom that faces the hillside where they placed a pot of mine. So they enjoy it all year round from indoors in the winter and it’s a long winter in the mountains where they are and watch how it plays with the snow as it comes and goes and the wind.

Margaret: And I think some of this people may think oh right I’ve used sometimes a pair of well-placed chairs is that type of thing. Even in the winter I leave out certain things and I have one pair that’s way up on the hill at the edge of a meadow and especially in the snow there’s just something so it’s like “Ooh someday I’ll be going back up there and sitting there in the fairer days.” Do you know what I mean? There’s just that.

Stephen: Yes exactly.

Margaret: Yeah that come hither kind of but not right now kind of conversation that I’m having looking out the window at it [laughter]. So let’s talk about some of the things. So someone says I think I want something but I don’t know what and I need your advice. And so what are some of the roles you go wander around or whatever with people? What are some of the things that this type of a statement can do this kind of a vessel or sculpture can do in a garden?

Stephen: I’ll start with some of the more obvious things it can do. And that is to reinforce the structure of the garden that’s already there. The visual destination at the end of a straight path. Or the sort of I think of “greeter function” as you move from one room or area of the garden to another almost like some people might use a granite fence post or something like that. That is a very interesting way to announce that articulation of the structure.

At the inside bend of a path along a garden pathway is another interesting way to create of an arm to swing around [laughter] if you will as you’re moving down the path. So some of those ways that are I think of as classically reinforcing the bones of the garden already.

And then there are more interesting and I think more arguably subtle ways of using them. An organic form that’s partially occluded by a large bush or something like that and reveals only part of itself creates this sense of mystery and intrigue and what is that? And a different way of drawing somebody to it sort of by being coy as opposed to by being so fully present.

Margaret: So it’s not like in a formal garden like in a parterre or a boxwood four-square kind of planting where there’s a pad with a plinth in the middle and it’s this perfect geometry and this vessel is fully exposed in the midst of all this other formality and geometry. It’s not like that. You’re saying it could actually kind of be nestled in and not fully exposed and that’s almost more exciting in some ways.

Stephen: Well exciting in a different way. And both work beautifully. I just had a conversation yesterday with someone who has exactly that very highly structured it’s a very geometric herb garden and she’s looking for a tall vessel to sort of anchor the center of that and looking for a more organic form to put near an exotic Japanese maple which I think would be a really interesting … I mean it’s a very different mood that’s called for in the second place. And she’s talking about a very different kind of pot to enhance that.

Margaret: You were just mentioning two pots and you didn’t necessarily say that they’d be where they’d both be seen at the same time. But when we talked for the “Times” story you talked to me about how sometimes if there is more than one such element it’s almost like they’re having a conversation. That the two vessels almost are speaking to each other and that we connect them even if they’re not literally next to each other or anything.

Stephen: The mind and eye very strongly draw lines between them. It’s so interesting and it’s not just my own experience but people I work with and when we place pieces in the garden it creates this other level of structure. And in some cases this has been a surprising discovery for me a very relatively small piece say a globe of 24 inches tall maybe even a little shorter if it relates to a larger vessel it can hold its own in a large space because it somehow rides the larger energy of the big piece. So a piece that would by itself feel lost if it has a big brother [laughter] it can tag along.

Margaret: So as we’re looking around our gardens and I think this is a good time I don’t know rather than when it’s in full swing. I feel like right now it’s the bones that I’m looking out at and I feel like before I get distracted by oh those colorful flowers over there that are coming in six weeks or whatever. I feel like it’s a good time to think about things like that. And so it’s not just looking for that one moment always. It could be more than one spot and thinking about the relationship between them. And I love I guess because of the nature of the place where I live—and it’s not huge; it’s a couple of acres. But where the house is positioned and the fact that there are woods around it at the perimeter so it feels bigger than it is. And so I love that sort placing things at a distant view creating almost axial endpoints like “Ooh look up there.”

And I know that’s one of the more obvious things that such a sculpture could do but I also love that. I love the sense of not just right here in the immediate distance but let’s look out there too.

Stephen: Yes. And often one placed in the near and one placed far in a sense amplifies the sense of distance. It dramatizes the distance to the far view in a very interesting way.

Margaret: Well and it’s interesting that you say that because when garden-designer friends have come and tried to teach me [laughter] about garden design over the years one of the things they’ve told me when I was like “Oh well I think I want to put a gold-leaf shrub way way in the distance so that it screams to me from across the yard out the window from across the yard.” And they’re like “Yes that’s a great idea. But along the way maybe on the left and right of that sort of axis not a literal path but a visual path maybe you want to have one or a couple of other elements spots of gold to help you travel there.”

So that sort of duet again or it might be a trio [laughter] of pots or plants. So some of the same design ideas I guess is what I’m saying come into play with thinking about these sculptures as opposed just as they do with designing with plants.

Stephen: In a sense they become visual guideposts that take the eye from one point to another to another to another to a destination. In a certain way it reminds me of the way a skillful painter will choreograph how your eye moves over the painting. And I think you can use elements such as this or as you mentioned a particular palette of plant you’re using to accomplish a similar thing.

Margaret: You just said choreograph and you’re giving yourself away because you had a career in music before you became a ceramic artist. Yes?

Stephen: Yes I did. And I was not looking to get involved in clay. It was a sort of surprising midlife seduction. Not one I regret. And strangely I found the transition from music to clay at the meta level very seamless. It felt like working with many of the same elements and working with the same impulses. I sometimes say what I had been doing in sound and time I was now doing with material and space. The common thread being looking to find the line that’s revelatory.

Margaret: Hmmm. So you’re also teaching now. You’re teaching people to make these to create these large vessels. Yes? That’s another that you’ve sort of branched out into that and you’re teaching not only I think at your place but elsewhere including I think in Europe this year for the first time maybe?

Stephen: I am. I have a lovely invitation from two studios in Amsterdam and they’ve put together four days of teaching for me in early June which I’m really looking forward to.

I want to qualify slightly what you said there Margaret. I’m teaching people that technique that I use to build pieces sectionally and I’m hoping that people won’t be building my pots [laughter]. I have discovered over the years against my better judgment I sometimes allow my students to use tools that I have designed and developed specifically to achieve the curves that I’m after. And not surprisingly I discover “Oh my gosh your pot is just like mine. Give me back those tools.” [Laughter.]

Margaret: Right. But you’re teaching the method.

Stephen: I’m teaching the technique that I’ve developed. It’s a little bit distinctive. It’s drawing on bits and pieces from here and there and putting them together in a way that suits my personality and my physique and the way I like to do things. And it’s also very accessible for people. As someone who is in clay self-taught and I’ll say that with an asterisk because we all rely on millennia of experimentation by previous potters. But as someone who’s not formally trained in pottery and just figured out how to do this stuff I feel like what I do and the way I do it is going to be accessible to an intermediate-level potter.

Margaret: I didn’t ask you yet but I have to ask you: your own home garden. Now I know that it’s smallish and I think you told me that your wife maybe had issued a proclamation [laughter] about some changes this spring summer. She said there are going to be some redos of some areas or is there so updates ahead?

Stephen: Instead of being a repository for my firing disasters [laughter] she’d like to get a first. We have the shoemaker’s children phenomenon going on here. So yeah I’ll be bringing home a perfect pot to grace our little postage-stamp garden soon.

Margaret: And is there any new planting going to go on or what all … Is it ornamental stuff or vegetables or both or what?

Stephen: It’s ornamental. We have this tiny little lot that we share with our duplex neighbors and it’s ornamental. My sister had a very brief flirtation with trying to start a garden-design business after she retired from a career as an educator. And she has a talent for it and put in a garden for us. And our main specifications were color all season long and low maintenance. Because the studio consumes me 120 percent and my wife is also involved in clay and runs her own community clay studio. So sadly we don’t have a lot of time to spend in the garden ourselves. So those two requirements suit us well.

Margaret: And now a third requirement which is a pot that isn’t second-handed. No cracks please. No cracks. O.K. [Laughter.]

Well I’m so glad to talk to you again and as I said I hope that this will just some of these thoughts from your experience working with your type of vessels with clients and so forth will be inspirational for people as they think about enhancements to their own garden this year whatever material or vessels or whatever they plan to use. Because I think it’s an important part of the overall design hanging together. And I was so glad to meet you and talk to you. So thank you Stephen.

Stephen: Thank you so much. It’s been a pleasure.

The redesign is focused on creating a sense of belonging and community as well as spotlighting the character's ""personalities rather than their gender.""

The most notable changes include the green M&M's redesign which will exchange the white heeled go-go boots she was given in 1997 for ""cool laid-back sneakers to reflect her effortless confidence."" Mars had received criticism for the green M&M's sexy characterization. The green M&M will also be ""better represented to reflect confidence and empowerment as a strong female and known for much more than her boots.""

The green M&M and the brown M&M will have a more friendly relationship showcasing a ""force supporting women."" The two characters' dynamic will have them ""together throwing shine and not shade"" the company said. The two characters have sometimes been at odds in advertisements but they have also been seen as friends — or more than friends in others like this viral tweet from 2015 showing the two holding hands on a beach.

It’s rare Ms. Brown and I get to spend time together without some colorful characters barging in. – Ms. Green pic.twitter.com/hnoktsAgAW — M&M'S (@mmschocolate) June 28 2015

Mars also added that the brown M&M's heels will be lowered to a professional heel height.

The orange M&M who has an anxious personality will ""embrace his true self worries and all."" But the orange M&M's shoe laces will now be tied to represent his cautious nature. According to Mars the orange M&M is ""one of the most relatable characters with Gen-Z"" which is the ""most anxious generation.""

The red M&M who has shown bully tendencies in the past will be more kind to his co-characters.

By explor­ing and retelling Boeing’s his­to­ry Robi­son offers a pro­file of a com­pa­ny devot­ed to laud­able achieve­ments in aero­space engi­neer­ing — a com­pa­ny will­ing to sac­ri­fice mil­lions to ensure its air­craft were the safest available.

Lead­ers and engi­neers are intro­duced as proud of the com­pa­ny they work for one that is renowned for inno­va­tion as well as transparency.

Boe­ing’s rep­u­ta­tion for trans­paren­cy was well main­tained lead­ing the com­pa­ny to take full respon­si­bil­i­ty for the 1985 747 crash that killed five hun­dred and twen­ty peo­ple in Japan. Robi­son con­trasts that ster­ling rep­u­ta­tion with Boe­ing’s woe­ful pub­lic image today. By exam­in­ing Boeing’s high­est achieve­ments as well as its most dis­tress­ing fail­ures Robi­son empow­ers read­ers to bet­ter under­stand the sequence of ill-fat­ed deci­sions that have brought Boe­ing where it is today.

The first sec­tion of the book estab­lish­es Boe­ing’s rise to promi­nence start­ing with the devel­op­ment of planes like the B‑29 Super­fortress a long-range bomber air­craft flown in the lat­ter phas­es of World War II. (The Super­fortress was built in Puget Sound and gets its name from its small­er pre­de­ces­sor the B‑17 Fly­ing Fortress which was already in use at the time the war broke out.)

A major vic­to­ry for Boe­ing com­ing out of the war was the exten­sive data col­lect­ed from an Aero­nau­ti­cal Research Insti­tute in Germany.

Boe­ing engi­neers were able to dras­ti­cal­ly improve designs for their upcom­ing jet-pow­ered bomber allow­ing them to keep up with much larg­er competitors.

Robison’s first chap­ters describe Boeing’s ear­ly engi­neer­ing vic­to­ries in the pro­duc­tion of planes for the Unit­ed States mil­i­tary in lan­guage that is easy for those out­side of the engi­neer­ing field to understand.

Boeing’s most promi­nent ear­ly fig­ures whose per­son­al­i­ties are well estab­lished give the book a more per­son­al and enter­tain­ing feel.

One of Boeing’s pres­i­dents William Allen is described as “nev­er travel[ing] with­out Triscuits and a pair of eye­glass­es.” The pres­i­den­t’s res­o­lu­tions for the com­pa­ny from his per­son­al jour­nal are also dis­cussed: Be con­sid­er­ate of my asso­ciates’ views don’t talk too much let oth­ers talk make sin­cere efforts to under­stand labor’s view­point and devel­op a post­war future for Boe­ing.

The com­pa­ny’s engi­neers give life to the sto­ry illus­trat­ing a hard work­ing team from hum­ble begin­nings ded­i­cat­ed to and inspired by Boeing’s achievements.

This team called itself The Incredibles.

It includ­ed Alvin “Tex” John­ston who is described as always wear­ing cow­boy boots and once exe­cut­ed a bar­rel roll over Lake Wash­ing­ton in front of three hun­dred peo­ple all with­out telling any­one he was plan­ning to try it.

This team of engi­neers com­bined these the­atrics with a rig­or­ous devo­tion to their jobs com­ing from all across the coun­try because they believed in Boeing’s vision.

The next few chap­ters con­tin­ue through Boeing’s his­to­ry includ­ing the pro­duc­tion of the 737 and 747 reach­ing a turn­ing point and dis­tinc­tive tone shift around the ear­ly 1990s. Robi­son explains the cul­tur­al shifts through cor­po­rate Amer­i­ca that were gal­va­nized by Ronald Reagan’s approach to the economy.

This includ­ed the idea that prof­its and share­hold­ers should be the main priority.

For Boe­ing the 1990s proved to be an extreme­ly suc­cess­ful era allow­ing them to buy one of their old­est exist­ing com­peti­tors but also demon­strat­ed Boeing’s will­ing­ness to aban­don its found­ing principles.

The lega­cy of the res­o­lu­tions of for­mer pres­i­dent William Allen was replaced by a ded­i­ca­tion to max­i­miz­ing prof­its at seem­ing­ly any cost.

The board saw com­pa­ny-alter­ing turnover includ­ing the addi­tion of Gen­er­al Elec­tric’s Jack Welch who cham­pi­oned a cul­ture change at Boe­ing that de-empha­sized the impor­tance and val­ue of sound engineering.

As a con­se­quence Boe­ing engi­neers found them­selves in a dis­tinct­ly dif­fer­ent envi­ron­ment than what they had expect­ed. Peo­ple who had stud­ied and aspired for the oppor­tu­ni­ty to be like The Incred­i­bles were left very disappointed.

One unnamed man­ag­er report­ed­ly said: “I hate this new cul­ture… I don’t want to be anybody’s facil­i­ta­tor I want to come to work and kick some ass.”

The board became increas­ing­ly obsessed with push­ing Boe­ing’s stock price high­er a far cry from its past ded­i­ca­tion to aero­space innovation.

The 2010s would reveal the con­se­quences of this men­tal­i­ty for Boeing.

With air­lines demand­ing bet­ter more fuel effi­cient planes Boe­ing faced the choice of either upgrad­ing the best­selling nar­row-body 737 which was bring­ing in a third of their rev­enue or design­ing an entire­ly new plane.

The 737 MAX became the result of pick­ing the cheap­er option rather than sac­ri­fic­ing prof­its to design and con­struct some­thing new.

Addi­tions to the more expen­sive mod­el includ­ed sen­sors that could make cor­rec­tions for pilots. These cor­rec­tions could be over­rid­den in case of an error but pilots need­ed to be thor­ough­ly trained on how to do so.

Not only was Boe­ing able to receive gov­ern­ment approval to allow the MAX to go into ser­vice with­out required train­ing the com­pa­ny even reject­ed requests from air­lines for pilot train­ing. This includ­ed Lion Air whose request for pilot train­ing was denied pre­cip­i­tat­ing the 737 MAX crash that sub­se­quent­ly killed 189 people.

Robi­son focus­es his con­clud­ing chap­ters on this dev­as­tat­ing 737 MAX crash detail­ing Boeing’s respons­es and com­par­ing them to crash respons­es in the past.

Robi­son pro­vides a thor­ough account of Boeing’s cur­rent stand­ing and rep­u­ta­tion detail­ing where it all went wrong and high­light­ing some of the key vil­lains in Boeing’s sto­ry. The final chap­ters are fast paced and gripping.

Fly­ing Blind was high­ly engag­ing and espe­cial­ly thor­ough. The bio­graph­i­cal por­traits were well devel­oped and the inter­views were very illuminating.

The book’s dis­cus­sion of eco­nom­ic shifts in cor­po­rate Amer­i­ca is par­tic­u­lar­ly com­pelling. Read­ers from the Seat­tle area will like­ly enjoy read­ing sto­ries about key moments and events that took place in the Pacif­ic Northwest.

Fly­ing Blind is well worth read­ing and its nar­ra­tive style makes it eas­i­ly man­age­able for any­one who strug­gles with nonfiction.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVWh0dHBzOi8vamFjb2Jpbi5jb20vMjAyMi8wMS9wcmVzaWRlbnQtam9lLWJpZGVuLW9uZS15ZWFyLXJldmlldy1wcm9taXNlcy10cnVtcC1wb2xpY3nSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Joe Biden Promised Change. He Hasn't Delivered.,"What was the point of Joe Biden’s presidency? When he was running for president there was a platter of rationales. Progressive groups insisted Biden really was planning a transformational program to fix the country’s many long-simmering ills. Television talking heads told us he would turn around the deadly pandemic with a science- and expert-based approach quite unlike Donald Trump’s. For many just getting rid of Trump was enough with the added hope of simply erasing the last four years of policy and continuing on as before. Biden himself pitched his presidency in quasi-mystical terms as if electing him alone would serve as a kind of nationwide exorcism of all the cruelty and bigotry of the Trump years. Well none of that happened. One year in the most striking thing about Biden’s presidency given the various threads of anti-Trumpism that powered his win is the fundamental continuity between the two administrations in nearly every field of policy. Just as striking is how few are aware of this with both die-hard blue and red voters convinced Biden’s White House is the antithesis of Trump’s and an almost radical experiment in left-wing governance. After a year Biden can take credit for a resounding economic recovery. But just as under both Trump and Biden’s former boss Barack Obama the spoils of that economy remain unevenly shared with the underlying conditions that fed Trump’s rise fundamentally unchanged true to the pledge Biden made to his core constituency of elite donors more than two years ago. Having entered the White House well-placed to make the kind of transformational change the country is desperate for the president quickly fell sway to his most self-defeating impulses with his conservatism squandering the opportunity in front of him.

American Carnage Maybe nothing was more important to Biden’s victory than the pandemic and Trump’s disastrous handling of it with his own advisor calling it “the best thing that ever happened to him.” So it’s here the vanishingly small gap between the two administrations has been especially marked. After resting his campaign on rejecting Trump’s disastrous vaccine-only pandemic response Biden turned around and adopted what was in some ways an even more aggressive version of it. Some laudatory politically risky measures like vaccine mandates aside the administration has comprehensively failed to fulfill the very pandemic strategy it campaigned on. While a short-term stay-at-home order is still the most effective proven way to halt the spread of the virus there were many ways short of it the administration could have mustered to mitigate the effects. Yet on basics like data collection contact tracing testing protective equipment worker protection and school resourcing the United States continues to woefully lag behind other developed countries making a mockery of Biden’s often deployed clichés about the limitlessness of American possibility. After resting his campaign on rejecting Trump’s disastrous vaccine-only pandemic response Biden turned around and adopted an even more aggressive version of it. The administration has been single-mindedly devoted to vaccines as a silver bullet at the expense of a proactive comprehensive mitigation plan. After criticizing Trump for being stingy with the Defense Production Act (DPA) a Government Accountability Office assessment this year found Biden neither developed a plan to use the law for medical supplies (masks ventilators and the like) in the future nor placed a single priority-rated contract for such medical supplies — and placed fewer of them for testing than Trump. As late as December when more than a thousand Americans were dying a day Biden’s chief medical advisor Anthony Fauci explicitly ruled out invoking the DPA to make more tests. Worried it would undermine the impetus for vaccines and create a mask shortage Biden officials rejected an expert proposal in October for a “testing surge” to cope with the coming winter and resisted calls to supply Americans with N95 masks. In the ensuing predictable holiday shortages that left Americans even in large wealthy cities unable to find tests administration officials resorted to actions that read like a parody of ineffectual do-nothing neoliberalism. The vice president instructed people to simply “Google ‘COVID test near me’” to access them a practical impossibility in vast largely poor swaths of the country. It ordered insurers not to provide but reimburse people for tests and in a country where nearly 30 million are uninsured. As the nation prepared to enter another death-filled winter Zients scolded the unvaccinated and told them they’d be rewarded with death and sickness — unconscionable and particularly so given their ranks are made up of millions of people of color whom Biden’s team spent two years treating as a political prop when it suited its interests. All the while the administration has spread exactly the kind of misinformation and politicized health advice that was once the cornerstone of liberal critiques of Trump’s pandemic response. Early on to widespread media applause Biden falsely told millions of CNN viewers that kids rarely contracted the virus and couldn’t pass it on to their parents. He declared “independence” from the virus just as a new more virulent strain began taking hold and rolled out sudden confusing changes in public health guidance with little consultation with leaders. He kept Fauci in place as the face and voice of the federal response despite the fact that he’d discredited himself in the eyes of all but the most ardent Democratic partisans. But what might be Biden’s greatest pandemic failure is his steadfast refusal to put public health ahead of corporate profits. In a move typical of this administration Biden’s highly publicized May decision to back an intellectual property waiver on the vaccines — and so allow largely unvaccinated poor countries to make their own versions of the vaccines on the cheap — has in practice meant nothing with the administration declining to actually push for the measure behind closed doors. The resulting massive pool of the world’s unvaccinated produced the Omicron variant that’s currently tearing through the United States and the world. In practice this has meant a staggering scale of suffering virtually unknown elsewhere in the developed world. The administration’s inaction has pushed an already severely strained health sector to the brink with record-high COVID hospitalizations putting at least three-quarters of states’ hospitals to 80 percent ICU capacity or beyond. Basic services like garbage collection schools and various emergency services have broken down around the country under the weight of mass infection. Businesses too are facing staff shortages and uncertainty nationwide — ironic given this hands-off approach is supposed to be for their benefit. More people have now died from the virus under Biden than under Trump and double the total Biden said last year was grounds for the resignation of a sitting president."

What Exactly Is the Technology Industry?

The technology sector includes stocks involved in the development production or distribution of technologically related goods and services. Businesses in this area are involved in the production of electronics the development of software computers or information technology-related products and services.

Customers and other businesses can find a wide selection of products and services in the technology industry. Personal computers mobile devices wearable technology household appliances televisions and other consumer items constantly improve and market to consumers with new features.

On the business side firms rely on technological breakthroughs to develop enterprise software manage logistics systems protect databases and deliver crucial information and services that allow them to make strategic business decisions. The word “technology sector” is sometimes interchangeably used with “technology industry.”

TAKEAWAYS IMPORTANT:

The technology sector includes businesses that sell goods and services in electronics software computers artificial intelligence and other fields connected to information technology (IT).

Tech corporations spend a lot of money on research and development to take on more risky ventures with better long-term prospects.

Facebook Twitter and Instagram are all social networking networks run by tech businesses.

Businesses rely on the technology industry to help them develop and prosper.

Technology is frequently one of the most appealing growth assets in a country’s economy.

Recognising the Industry:

In many economies the technology industry is the most attractive investment location. Apple Google Amazon Meta (previously Facebook) Netflix IBM and Microsoft are all part of the US technological sector. These firms drive the IT industry’s development. The excitement surrounding their long-term potential has them trading at ludicrous price-to-earnings multiples compared to practically every other industry.

A big part of this expansion can be attributed to the hype that technology companies generate by creating entirely new business lines.

Growth in the Technology Sector:

Many times the term “technology sector” has been widened to encompass enterprises that a more narrow group would better serve. At first semiconductors computing hardware and communications equipment were the foundations of the sector. Furthermore employment creation is part of growth. According to the US Bureau of Labour Statistics jobs in computer and IT are expected to expand 13% between 2020 and 2030.

The advent of software businesses broadened the definition of technology to include everything that involves coding. Shortly more space was required to accommodate the influx of online enterprises during the Internet boom. These internet businesses were media and content businesses that worked with code as their medium. Others were busy releasing rich features that eventually evolved into e-commerce social media the sharing economy and even cloud computing.

The technology industry currently has a varied range of businesses that the subsectors are significantly more relevant than the overall sector. Although there is no general agreement—some pundits demand a new industry for each innovation—the key buckets include semiconductors software networking and the Internet and hardware.

All of the subsectors can then be further divided down. Wearables peripherals laptops desktops and so on are all examples of hardware. Although some may object that calling a cloud computing company a software company makes no sense the arbitrary distinctions are more manageable than the massive “tech sector” title for every organisation.

TOP 5 REASONS WHY BUSINESS TECHNOLOGY IS IMPORTANT:

Take a look around you. The world we now live in is not the world in which we were born. In recent years technology has changed the way we socialise conduct business shop live and work. It has become engrained in our daily lives and is now an unavoidable part of our existence.

The necessity of technology in business cannot be emphasised. Emerging trends are being used by businesses all over the world to help them gain a competitive advantage and drive strategy and growth. We can’t image conducting business without the Internet video conferencing project management software and other technical advancements. In reality technology’s influence in the workplace will only increase. If you haven’t already this fact necessitates introducing technology into your procedures.

Here are some of the reasons why technology is so crucial for businesses:

Communication

Technology allows for more efficient faster and broader communication. Interactions inside your team and with clients potential consumers investors and the general public fall under this category. Video conferencing through Skype and Zoom enables meetings across geographical boundaries. Software like Slack or Asana can help you streamline communication among your employees within your company. One can use it to keep track of projects task specifics deadlines and so on whether they operate from the same office or remotely. Email newsletters social media and other platforms are essential communication tools.

Safety and security:

With the rise of cyber-crime and data breaches all firms must maintain a high level of security. Most of today’s corporate assets are stored in the cloud or on endpoints. As a result businesses must take stringent measures to protect their data and that of their consumers.

Efficiency:

Technology aids in the improvement of the system product and service efficiency. It aids in tracking and streamlining operations maintaining data flow and managing contacts and staff records. Increasing operational efficiency helps the company save money while also expanding quickly.

Employee assistance:

Most employees believe that using the most up-to-date technologies when performing their jobs will help them achieve the greatest results. Companies must analyse the cost-output ratio and deploy appropriate measures to improve outcomes.

Time and money

There’s no denying that technology allows organisations to accomplish more in less time without sacrificing product or service quality. In reality it is already taking over duties formerly undertaken by humans. This helps by lowering personnel costs or directing them to areas most required.

To get the most out of technical tools businesses must thoroughly understand them. Management information systems go a long way toward assisting businesses in keeping track of data sales production and expenses. Data can be tilized to identify areas where there is room for improvement and expansion. Businesses that can effectively manage information systems will streamline administrative procedures cut operating expenses innovate expand into new areas improve customer service and gain a competitive advantage in the market.

What exactly is it? Consumer service is an intangible product provided to individuals rather than corporations. Service providers such as firm employees; equipment such as vehicles cash registers and electronic devices; physical facilities such as buildings; consumer connections; and individual service users are all involved in service delivery.

There are several examples of consumer service all around you. Hotel services personal insurance rail travel education health care recreation catering tourism finance entertainment and home maintenance are just a few examples.

It differs from consumer goods and other components of consumer products. We use the term “consumer goods” to describe tangible items like shoes laptops and smartphones. To summarise consumer products encompass both consumer goods and consumer services. Consumer services marketing must be approached differently in both cases.

Furthermore we distinguish between consumer and customer service. It is the company’s assistance and guidance to consumers who purchase or use its products. After-sales service is an example.

Difference between consumer goods and consumer services:

Consumer goods and services differ in many ways not just physical content. Let’s have a look at them one by one.

Consumer goods are physical items. You can see or touch them because they have a material substance.

It has nothing to do with consumer service. You can’t see or feel it since it’s intangible. As a result businesses must deliver the finest service possible for each service provided avoiding errors and consumer discontent.

These features are distinct from those of commodities. Goods can be replaced with identical goods of comparable quality. And customers will be equally pleased. They provide a way for customers to swap damaged items for new ones.

The quality of human resources has a significant impact on the services provided. Furthermore resources like computers and information technology can aid in delivering high-quality services. They are however all ultimately reliant on the personnel who provide the service.

Time is spent on service. Customers must be interacted with for services to be delivered. And once the team has assisted it vanishes forever.

It is not the same as consumer products. Once the buyer has purchased and paid for them there is no need to contact them again.

Even for the same people the same service cannot be delivered differently. It is one of a kind. For each service supplied the organisation must put forth its utmost effort. Consumers have a high level of confidence in a company if they are satisfied with its services every time they utilise it.

Consumers appreciate the service but they cannot resell it to others. Put another way; you can’t give the services you get to someone else. You can resale it to someone else if you buy anything such as a buddy.

Importance of Customer Service:

Brand Image Representation

Your brand image objective and vision as well as what and who you represent are constantly apparent to the owner and personnel. As a business owner you like your employees know what you want to offer and achieve. Even so your customer care team is in charge of communicating your brand and what it means to your customers and the general public.

Customer service is crucial since it interacts directly with customers and portrays and promotes the brand image. “73 per cent of customers stated they are devoted to a company thanks to nice customer care agents” according to a Harris Interactive survey.

Competitive Advantage

The competitive edge that customer service provides you over other brands is one of the most critical aspects of customer service. Irrespective of the business or climate in which you operate there will undoubtedly be competitors that provide the same product and services as you. To stand out you must concentrate on your customers and make them feel valued.

Customers will look for a better option if they are dissatisfied with your brand’s service or are treated with disrespect. Similarly good customer service must attract customers away from competitors and keep them coming back for more products and services.

Referral

Every company strives to grow expand and reach a broader audience daily. Another benefit of excellent customer service is that satisfied customers are more inclined to tell their friends relatives acquaintances and even strangers about your company and how well they were treated.

A reference is critical to a company’s growth and success; it’s a chain reaction: when customers are happy with your brand they instantly advertise for you and refer others and the customer base grows.

Improvement Through Feedbacks and Responses

As a business owner you must be adaptable and flexible to provide better service and please your clients. Another benefit of customer service is that it assists you in gathering feedback and replies from your customers and the general public which helps you improve the products and services you provide.

A good customer service staff enquires from customers on how to enhance service delivery and these responses are collated and worked on to improve customer service delivery.

Customers also create a sense of belonging and devotion to the company when they see incorporated their suggestions.

Profit and revenue increase

Profit and total revenue are used to determine whether or not a company or business organisation is successful. Every company’s primary goal is to create a profit. Prioritising your customer’s welfare and demand boosts patronage and revenue which is why customer service is so important.

Customer service and profit do not have a direct relationship but the former multiplies the latter. Customers that receive poor customer service are more likely to go elsewhere resulting in a loss. Similarly excellent customer service endears your brand to your customers and encourages patronage which leads to increased profit.

Customer Lifetime Value (CLV)

Customer lifetime value is determined by the amount of money and investments a customer provides to a firm throughout their relationship. Customer service is essential in this industry especially regarding investment programmes and partnerships.

No one wants to put money into a company that mistreats its partners and customers. For these potential investors customer service is the first point of contact. Clients aid in the positive portrayal of the company’s image which woos customers and eventually commits their dollars to the brand.

Business Longevity

Excellent customer service is the surest method for any organisation to maintain momentum and prevent failure. “20 per cent of businesses fail in their first year and 50% fail by their fifth year as a result of challenges related with bad customer service” according to Fundera.

Clients and patrons are a company’s lifeblood; they are always accurate. To avoid going out of business you should pay attention to your customers’ needs. Customers treated like kings keep coming back and referring others which demonstrates the value of customer service. You will earn more consumers the longer you stay in the market with good customer service. The lifetime of your brand is a competitive advantage in and of itself.8. Company Culture and Practices

A corporation that places a premium on its customers will also place a premium on its employees’ well-being. The general methods of doing things and carrying out tasks are called company culture.

When your staff work hard to provide exceptional consumer service they also increase productivity. You develop an efficient working culture in firms that focus on consumer service delivery as you find ways to improve service delivery. Your staff are content and happy with their jobs when your consumers are delighted with their treatment.

It’s no surprise that businesses that don’t care about their consumers don’t care about their employees.

It changed with the release of the Google Pixel 2 and the iPhone XS that brought the eSIM functionality allowing users to enjoy telecom services without needing to insert a physical SIM card into their devices. However Qualcomm along with other industry giants recently took the concept to its next stage by showcasing a smartphone that comes with SIM card functionalities directly integrated into the mobile chipset.

Qualcomm Unveils World’s First Smartphone with iSIM Support

Qualcomm recently partnered with Samsung Vodafone and Thales to demonstrate the new SIM technology which has been dubbed iSIM. While the “e” in eSIM stands for “embedded” as the system uses a dedicated chipset for connecting to network operators the “i” in iSIM stands for “integrated” as Qualcomm was able to successfully integrate SIM functionalities directly into the smartphone’s chipset along with the CPU GPU and the modem.

So unlike the eSIM technology the iSIM system brings improved system integration of networking services for smartphones. It complies with GSMA specifications (based on the ieUICC[1] GSMA specification) delivers higher performance and increases the memory capacity of smartphones.

In fact Qualcomm listed the various benefits that the iSIM technology could bring for consumers and telecom operators in the future. The American chipmaker says that the new SIM tech simplifies and enhances device design by eliminating the need for a dedicated SIM slot. It can also enable telcos to provide remote SIM provisioning by leveraging existing eSIM infrastructure. Furthermore it opens up the scope of integrating SIM functionalities into other devices like laptops tablets and IoT devices that previously could not pack SIM features.

Qualcomm recently conducted a demo for a proof-of-concept device in Samsung’s R&D labs in Europe. The company used the Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 3 backed by a Snapdragon 888 5G SoC with a built-in Secure Processing Unit running the Thales iSIM OS to demonstrate the concept and illustrate its commercial readiness. The device used Vodafone’s advanced networking capabilities based on existing infrastructure and its remote networking platform for the demonstration.

Now we already know that smartphone companies like Apple are aiming to get rid of the dedicated SIM slot on their devices. While the eSIM technology could be useful for this it comes with its flaws and limited functionalities. So Qualcomm’s new iSIM technology could pave the way for smartphones without a dedicated SIM slot.

So what do you think about the new iSIM technology? Let us know your thoughts in the comments below.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMigQFodHRwczovL3d3dy50ZWNodGltZXMuY29tL2FydGljbGVzLzI3MDkyNS8yMDIyMDEyMy9xdWFsY29tbS1jYXItY2hpcHMtZGV2ZWxvcGluZy1uZXctcHJvY2Vzc29ycy12ZWhpY2xlcy12ZW50dXJlcy12b2x2by1ob25kYS5odG3SAYUBaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cudGVjaHRpbWVzLmNvbS9hbXAvYXJ0aWNsZXMvMjcwOTI1LzIwMjIwMTIzL3F1YWxjb21tLWNhci1jaGlwcy1kZXZlbG9waW5nLW5ldy1wcm9jZXNzb3JzLXZlaGljbGVzLXZlbnR1cmVzLXZvbHZvLWhvbmRhLmh0bQ?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Qualcomm Car Chips: Developing New Processors for Vehicles; Ventures with Volvo Honda and Renault Soon,"Qualcomm is getting into the car chip ventures with Volvo Honda and Renault soon supplying the companies with new processors for its vehicles. The new venture of Qualcomm will focus on producing its focus on cars particularly as it needs more of the modern features like computer chips to manage its controls and other features it aims to bring.

Qualcomm Car Chips: Ventures with Volvo Honda and Renault

Qualcomm and Volvo recently announced their ventures together focusing on a new collaboration that would bring a Snapdragon-powered car infotainment system for a more accessible feature. However that is not all that Qualcomm will be doing for cars especially with the deals it secured with Honda and Renault.

Snapdragon's Automotive Cockpit for Renault's Megane is another focus of the company that would specialize in bringing a service to improve an aspect of the vehicle. Not to mention its ventures with Honda that will focus on getting a better overall experience for the car.

Qualcomm's focus on cars and their needs is a massive step for the company especially now as vehicles become more innovative and advanced than their mechanical age.

Qualcomm's Digital Chassis: CES 2022 Showcase

Qualcomm is not only focusing its chips on vehicles' infotainment systems especially with a Digital Chassis feature that the company announced last CES 2022. The San Diego chipmaker aims to bring an intelligent and customizable experience with its car chips focusing on technology as its primary seller to integrate into a car.

Smart cars are the future and Qualcomm aims to be a game-changer for the industry.

Qualcomm's Focus on Chips for Cars

Qualcomm will focus on a new venture and it will not be limited or constricted to one industry only which is the development of chips for smart and portable devices. The chip-making company is bringing its 2022 flagship smartphone processor known as the Snapdragon 8 Gen 1 to get the latest version of its functions including 5G.

A lot is coming from Qualcomm for 2022 including a handheld gaming development kit something that the company guarantees for a different experience with the device. However those are not all the focuses of Qualcomm especially now that it ventures into the car business which was not available before for the industry.

To think that the industry is facing a chip shortage problem that limits the production to less than its projected availability.

Nevertheless it will add to the current burden of the chip-making industry as resources will see another allocation that would focus on cars and their needs. Qualcomm's deals may indicate that the company is significantly getting a good supply for its chips as it adds a new focus apart from handheld tech devices.

Chinese EV companies rely on one of many selling points to stay competitive; like lower pricing longer range and most importantly better tech. It’s not uncommon to see processor specs on car brochures boasting the processing speed of the infotainment system for example.

- Advertisement -

Like its peers ORA reserved a section in their brochure and website about the Good Cat’s Cafe OS infotainment system; how it uses a Qualcomm 8 core processor to seamlessly provide a smooth user experience and smart self-driving features. Unfortunately customers found out their vehicles didn’t have the Qualcomm 8 core processor instead they came with a quad-core Intel Atom chip from 2016.

Naturally ORA removed all traces of the Qualcomm chip from their literature; thankfully customers were one step ahead with screenshots and old brochures.

The shady moves landed ORA in CCTV’s spotlight; this led the CEO of ORA to make a public apology promising to conduct an internal investigation. Meanwhile owners received a letter stating that the Qualcomm chip was a preview of future Good Cats (huh?). Note: All export Good Cats got the Qualcomm chip as promised.

Recently ORA is handing out 10000RMB (~ 1500USD) to each Good Cat customer hoping to make the situation go away; if everyone agrees then ORA would have to pay out 4 billion CNY (~63 million USD).

10000 RMB= happy customer?

Customers aren’t giving in- Chinese law protects consumers from fraudulent practices like this; companies are required to not only refund the cost of the vehicle but also reimburse the customer with three times the cost of the car.

Will Ora get away with fraud? Or will this be the end of the brand? Stay tuned to Car News China to find out!

Less than a year after Tom Brady and the Tampa Bay Buccaneers became the first team in NFL history to win the Super Bowl on their home soil the Rams seek a similar destiny in 2022.

On an overcast and muggy winter day the Rams held on to defeat the aforementioned Buccaneers 30-27 in the NFC divisional round denying them the opportunity to defend their title while simultaneously advancing to the NFC Championship game next week.

The Rams victory seemed inevitable for most of the game but nearly never came to fruition following a furious fourth quarter comeback by Brady and the Bucs. Leading 27-3 Tampa Bay scored 24 unanswered points to tie the game with less than a minute left on the clock. Thanks to the NFL's receiving triple-crown winner Cooper Kupp Los Angles was able to march down the field and kick the game-winning field goal as time expired.

Los Angeles defeated Tampa Bay for the second time this season sending Brady and the Bucs home for what could be the final game of the seven-time champion's storied NFL career.

Mike Ehrmann

""I haven't put a lot of thought into it. I'll just take it day by day and see where we're at"" said Brady when asked if he was going to retire. ""Truthfully guys I'm thinking about this game and I'm not thinking about the future right now.""

As plenty of questions surrounded Brady's future after the game there were plenty of questions about Rams' quarterback Matthew Stafford before the postseason even began. Despite being ranked alongside Brady statistically among the greatest quarterbacks of his generation Stafford had yet to win a playoff game in his 13-year NFL career.

Despite exorcising some of those demons in the Rams 34-11 victory over the Arizona Cardinals in the NFC Wild Card Game Stafford doubters did not believe he could vanquish the greatest quarterback of all time in Brady.

But Stafford prevailed in the highly anticipated quarterback duel of aging veterans. The 33-year-old threw for 366 yards and two touchdowns even rushing for a score in his battle with Brady.

The 44-year-old Brady threw for 329 and a touchdown in the loss.

The Rams will now host the No. 6 seed San Francisco 49ers for the third time this season at SoFi Stadium on Sunday. The rival 49ers have defeated the Rams six consecutive times with their last win coming on Dec. 30 2018.

""It's a big challenge"" said Stafford on facing the Niners. ""Hopefully it's one of those games where it's heavy blue and yellow and we have a nice loud crowd that makes it tough on them. I'm excited for the opportunity.""

The Rams jumped out to an early 10-point lead after Stafford found backup tight end Kendall Blanton on the play-action for a a seven-yard pass for the game's first score.

Los Angeles then broke the game open at the start of the second quarter when Stafford found Cooper Kupp wide open for a 70-yard touchdown pass that put the Rams ahead 17-3.

""Coach got us in a great call. We got the coverage that we wanted"" said Kupp of the touchdown. ""We got a two-on-one on the front side safety. Matthew [Stafford] did a good job hanging in there giving me an opportunity for the run after the catch. I felt like my best opportunity to was to cut back there and I was able to get in the end zone. My legs felt a little heavy on that one though.""

The Rams kept the Bucs out of the end zone in the first half but missed an opportunity to go up 27-3 when Cam Akers fumbled the ball on the one-yard line killing all momentum heading into the locker room.

But the Rams got the ball back to start the second half and marched down the field capping off a six-play 28-yard drive with a QB sneak for the score and a 27-3 lead.

The lead was eerily reminiscent of Super Bowl LI when the Atlanta Falcons led Brady and the New England Patriots 28-3. Brady rallied for the biggest comeback in Super Bowl history and nearly did it again on Sunday.

Leading 27-6 Kupp fumbled and gave Brady and the Bucs the ball back in their own territory midway through the third quarter.

""It's obviously tough"" Kupp said of the fumble. ""You obviously try and to limit them as much as you can and to be in that moment obviously you feel like you let your team down and put the defense out there in a terrible spot you never want to do that. Literally before that drive we were preaching 'ball security ball security' and that's something I can't do.""

Seven plays later Leonard Fournette who was activated off the IR before the game ran the ball into the end zone and suddenly Brady and the Bucs were down just 27-13.

That's why they call him Playoff Lenny.

""I came in at halftime and told them 'We've been down before'"" said Fournette of the 27-3 deficit. ""You have to take whatever you want especially in this game. Nothing is given.""

The fourth quarter was packed with plenty of action as both teams fumbled on back-to-back plays. First it was Brady who fumbled after a strip sack by Von Miller.

Then a botched snap flew over the head of Stafford and was recovered by the Bucs.

The Rams became the first team in NFL history to lose four fumbles in a game they were leading by 20 or more points yet still managed to win the game. It was also the first time a team committed four turnovers and still was able to defeat a Tom Brady-led team.

""Having four turnovers is absolutely something we have to clean up"" said Rams' head coach Sean McVay. ""But my favorite part is guys stayed together. Nobody flinched nobody blinked.""

Brady showed why he's the G.O.A.T when he delivered a dime to Mike Evans down the sidelines for a 55-yard touchdown pass that cut the game to 27-20 with just over three minutes left in the contest.

""After I hit Mike [Evans] on that deep one that was a pretty good feeling"" said Brady of the touchdown. ""We were right in it at that point.""

The Bucs completed the comeback after Akers second fumble of the game gave Tampa Bay the ball back in their own territory. Fournette ran to the corner of the end zone to tie the game at 27-27. The Bucs ran off 24 unanswered points in the second half.

""I just tried to make a play to help the team"" said Fournette of the game-tying touchdown. ""This whole week has been a very difficult week for me. Two days prior to the game my cousin got killed. I was just trying to keep everything together. I'm just happy I had a chance to go out there and fight with those guys.""

With just 40 seconds left in the game the Bucs were preparing to go to overtime but the Rams would have the last word. Stafford completed two deep passes to Kupp to get them into field goal range. That's when Pro Bowl kicker Matt Gay who was cut by the Bucs in 2019 drilled the game-winner as time expired.

The 2021 campaign hasn't exactly been smooth sailing for the Rams. After a 7-1 start to the season the Rams acquired Miller and receiver Odell Beckham Jr. for the second half of the season. Instead they dropped three consecutive games to the Titans Niners and Packers appearing too look more like a pretender than a contender. But then they ran off five consecutive victories to right the ship down the stretch.

Now after two straight wins against worthy opponents in the postseason the Rams have their foot on the gas and could become the second straight team to play a Super Bowl on their home field with Super Bowl LVI scheduled for February 13 at SoFi Stadium.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZveGJ1c2luZXNzLmNvbS9zcG9ydHMvdG9tLWJyYWR5LWNvbXBhbnktYW5vdGhlci1zZWFzb24tbGVmdC1zdXBlcnN0YXItcWLSAVlodHRwczovL3d3dy5mb3hidXNpbmVzcy5jb20vc3BvcnRzL3RvbS1icmFkeS1jb21wYW55LWFub3RoZXItc2Vhc29uLWxlZnQtc3VwZXJzdGFyLXFiLmFtcA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Tom Brady's company suggests there may be another season left in superstar QB,"Tom Brady’s future with the Tampa Bay Buccaneers and in the NFL in general appeared to be cloudy as the team lost to the Los Angeles Rams in the NFC playoffs on Sunday evening.

TOM BRADY LAUNCHES NEW ATHLETIC CLOTHING BRAND

Brady helped the Buccaneers come back against the Rams. He had a 55-yard touchdown pass to Mike Evans to help cut a 24-point deficit to just seven. Leonard Fournette would tie the game on a touchdown run but a home-run swing from Los Angeles set up the eventual game-winning field goal.

During the NBC broadcast Brady was said to have told the production crew what he thought would be the ""perfect ending"" to his career.

""Winning the Super Bowl but I don’t know that’s this year. I’d love to end on a Super Bowl. … But I think I’ll know when I know. … But there’s a lot that’s inconclusive"" he said.

This is based on a survey that was decidedly unscientific: I spoke with a bunch of Pats fans who wanted to see Brady win and I spoke to a bunch of Pats fans who wanted to see him lose — and to lose horribly and embarrassingly with a slight limp and a pained expression as he left the field.

But what are Pats fans to make of what happened Sunday night at Raymond James Stadium with the Bucs suffering an excruciating 30-27 divisional-round loss to the Los Angeles Rams just seconds after Brady & Co. had tied it up? While it’s true the Rams did plenty wrong to allow the Bucs back into the game the choice narrative is to go with Brady turning a 27-3 deficit into a 27-27 tie right?

If you’re a Patriots fan 27-3 is too close to 28-3 not to see the similarities. Even if you’re just a casual Patriots fan even if you’re merely the friend of a casual Patriots fan even if the closest you’ve ever been to the Patriots is that you once drove past Gillette Stadium while dropping off fresh linen at the Gaard Motel on Route 1 you’re familiar with 28-3.

This is because the Patriots’ second-half demolition of the Atlanta Falcons five years ago in Super Bowl LI wasn’t just the biggest comeback victory in Boston sports history. It was the biggest comeback victory in all of sports history at least in North America.

And any rational Pats fan or casual fan or friend of that casual fan or the person who dropped off linen at the Gaard Motel will forever be happy to revisit that magical day.

That’s why all Pats fans and I mean all Pats fans … wait what’s that line from “A Few Good Men” spoken by Jack Nicholson’s Col. Jessup? Yes here it is: “You don’t want the truth because deep down in places you don’t talk about at parties …”

Yes all Pats fans deep down whether they’d admit it not were rooting for Brady to lead Bucs to victory if only because 27-3 allowed them to live 28-3 all over again. And 28-3 was such a thrilling heart-pounding comeback that the only real bummer for those who enjoyed the outcome is that they went to bed that night knowing they’d never see anything like it again. Not even close.

Well maybe a little bit close. For a couple of seconds anyway. True a divisional-round playoff game isn’t the same as the Super Bowl. And true at the end of the day Brady is a Buccaneer.

Had it been the Falcons who prevailed in overtime in Super Bowl LI this after New England had turned a 28-3 deficit into a 28-28 deadlock it would have been a crushing blow for Pats fans. (And please hold off with the boohooing about Pats fans being spoiled their team had already won four Super Bowls this century up to that point etc.)

For an hour or two Sunday against the Rams Brady looked like he was re-creating his Super Bowl LI miracle comeback against the Falcons. (Focus on Sport / Getty Images)

That the Buccaneers were unable to hopscotch from a 27-3 deficit to a 27-27 tie to a 33-27 or 30-27 victory is truly crushing only if you’re a Bucs fan. To Pats fans it’s now just a talking point to discuss with friends.

But in real time as it was playing out … woahhhhhhh.

The Rams were ahead 27-3 when a 31-yard field goal by the Bucs’ Ryan Succop made it 27-6. Rams receiver Cooper Kupp of all people then fumbled on the next Los Angeles possession. And Brady being Brady led the Bucs on a scoring drive that included a 16-yard completion to Scotty Miller on fourth-and-9 and a 1-yard touchdown run by Leonard Fournette.

The kick made it 27-13 a two-possession game.

Rams kicker Matt Gay came up short on a 47-yard field-goal attempt that would have made it 30-13 with 6:31 left. Two possessions later Brady went to the air on second-and-7 from the Tampa Bay 45 and threw a bomb to Mike Evans who made the catch outside the 10 and beat Jalen Ramsey into the end zone.

Now it was 27-20 with 3:20 left.

Next we had the Rams quickly — very quickly — returning the ball to the Bucs on a Cam Akers fumble at the Los Angeles 30. There was 2:25 remaining …

The Bucs lost out on a first down when Cameron Brate caught a Brady pass and was ruled down at the 9 1 yard shy of a first down. But on fourth down the Bucs went for the end zone instead of a first down Fournette doing the honors going to his right.

With the PAT what once was 27-3 was now 27-27 as the game headed for overtime.

But in memory of the late great Meat Loaf: Stop right there!

Rams quarterback Matthew Stafford chosen to play the role of 2001 Tom Brady in the presence of 2021 Tom Brady which is to say that with 42 seconds remaining the Rams decided not to take a knee and let matters be decided in overtime. Stafford connected with Kupp for 20 yards then reared back and threw the ball straight down the field also to Kupp for a 44-yard completion.

Instead of overtime instead of Brady affixing a stamp to his second-half heroics by leading the Bucs on a thrilling overtime drive instead of the Bucs winning instead of this game being the send-off to a week’s worth of Bucs-vs.-49ers Brady-vs.-Jimmy Garoppolo analyses it ended with the Rams winning on Gay’s 30-yard field goal.

Watching 27-3 turn into 27-27 was fun while it lasted. Now it’s just another partial score buried inside the scoring summary. There will be no 27-3 documentaries no 27-3 memes no 27-3 T-shirts.

Instead Bucs fans Pats fans — everybody really — will wait around to see if Brady will return for the 2022 season or retire. If there is to be a Ted Williams-like last-at-bat home run by Tom Brady it’s not going to happen this year.

NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3050 Performance Numbers Show It's Base For Crypto Miners Great For Gamers

In multiple leaks by Videocardz the news outlet has shown performance numbers for the GeForce RTX 3050 in both gaming and mining. The graphics card features the Lite Hash Rate algorithm or LHR which drops as low as 12.5 MH/s in only a few seconds. The graphics card also has a power consumption of 73 watts. Another leaker also verifies this information on Twitter (@wxnod) who publishes comparable results using different software for mining crypto. The leaker reports that the GeForce RTX 3050 by NVIDIA is capable of 13.66 MH/s with a power consumption level of 57W achieved through tuning the power limit of the card and optimizations to the memory/core clocks.

With NVIDIA's choice of pricing and the cost of Ethereum presently a crypto miner would only see a return investment of the GeForce RTX 3050 upwards of 500 days at a retail price of $250. If the card retails for $100 more ($350) then the period for the return on investment would be closer to 700 days.

Since the value of digital currencies is currently dropping & with Ethereum is transitioning to a proof of stake standard starting June 2022 it has been concluded that NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3050 graphic cards is a terrible choice to utilize for crypto mining. This new information should free up the market for gamers looking for affordable graphics cards in 2022.

Besides mining performance the 3DMark TimeSpy and Firestrike benchmarks have also been leaked by the source. According to the numbers the NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3050 offers up to 19% boost compared to the Radeon RX 6500 XT in TimeSpy whereas in Firestrike the difference is only 4%. The graphics card is also on par with the GeForce GTX 1660 Ti but the RTX 3060 which utilizes the same GA106 GPU (with 40% higher cores & 60% higher bandwidth) offers up to a 47% increase in performance.

Hasee's ZX9 Gaming Notebook Features The Most Bizzare Laptop Config Pairs an NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3070 With An Intel Dual-Core Celeron G6900 CPU

If you look at the general specifications that the Hasee ZX9 'Ares ZX9-DA5DP' has to offer it doesn't look that bad. It comes with a socket platform featuring an LGA 1700 socket that can house various CPUs & up to the Core i7-12700 (14 Cores).

The laptop comes with 16 GB of DDR4-3200 memory which can be expanded up to 64 GB it rocks 512 GB of SSD that is also upgradable. As for the design itself the ZX9 from Hasee features dimensions of 361×256×32.5mm and weighs in at 2.7 Kgs. The screen is a 165 Hz (15.6"") panel with 100% sRGB coverage and 1080p resolution. It rocks a full-sized RGB backlit keyboard. The internals includes dual-fan cooling and five copper heatsinks that rest on top of the vital components such as the CPU and GPU.

Talking about graphics the Hasee ZX9 comes with the NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3070 8 GB mobility graphics card as standard. That cannot be upgraded as is featured on all variants. So you are looking at some really good performance from the GPU. Power is provided through a 5500mAh battery. I/O on the laptop includes 2 USB Type-A 3.2 GEn 2 1 USB Type-A 2.0 1 USB Type-C with DP1.4 & USB 3.2 Gen 2 support a single Micro SD card reader an HDMI & mini DP 1.4 output for display and a single RJ45 LAN port.

Now coming to the bizarre part the Hasee ZX9's CPU can be configured with three options. We have already mentioned the top Core i7-12700 SKU but it could also be configured with the Core i5-12400 6 core chip or an entry-level Celeron G6900. I don't know who in their right mind would have decided to offer the Celeron G6900 configuration as not only is this the most entry-level Alder Lake CPU but the dual-core design paired with the GeForce RTX 3070 would mean severe bottlenecks in gaming performance due to the low core/thread count.

The pricing at which the Celeron is being offered may look attractive to some people considering it's just $1300 US for the whole system with an RTX 3070 GPU plus it could easily be upgraded later due to the LGA 1700 socket being on-board instead of the BGA soldered mobility chips. But then again the Core i5-12400 variant costs $200 US more and seems like a better overall product. The top configuration with the Core i7-12700 costs 10499 Yuan or $1650 US. Following are the listed prices for the Hasee ZX9 laptop:

Intel Core i7-12700 + RTX 3070 + 16 GB DDR4-3200 + 512 GB NVMe SSD - 10499 Yuan / $1650

Intel Core i5-12400 + RTX 3070 + 16 GB DDR4-3200 + 512 GB NVMe SSD - 9499 Yuan / $1500

Intel Celeron G6900 + RTX 3070 + 16 GB DDR4-3200 + 512 GB NVMe SSD - 8399 Yuan / $1300

The Hasee ZX9 laptop launches tomorrow (in a few hours) but considering its attractive price point it's almost entirely sold out in pre-sales.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiN2h0dHBzOi8vYXUucGNtYWcuY29tL2xhcHRvcHMvOTIwMzMvYWNlci1uaXRyby01LTE3LWluY2jSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Acer Nitro 5 (17-Inch) - Review 2022,"Acer's Nitro line of gaming laptops spans a range of sizes and prices. Most of the Nitros we've tested have been relatively affordable while this new 17.3-inch Nitro 5 is on the high side at $2099 (the updated 15-inch version starts at $1599). Fortunately the system justifies its price with an Nvidia GeForce RTX 3080 GPU AMD Ryzen 7 processor and a 360Hz display for a powerful gaming experience. Less fortunately the build is unremarkable the chassis has some flex that premium competitors lack and the screen is a little on the dull side. This Nitro 5 delivers the good value the line is known for so you shouldn't overlook it but it lacks the build quality and appeal of high-end rivals that can be similarly configured such as the Razer Blade 15 and Lenovo Legion 7 Gen 6.

An Unassuming Style

The latest Nitro is not a major departure from previous designs. The styling is simple entirely black accented only by the white edges of the keycaps. There are a couple of muscle lines on the lid to add a bit of personality but it's otherwise a wide black slab.

How wide you ask? As you'd expect from a 17-inch gaming rig the Nitro 5 is no shrinking violet at 0.98 by 15.9 by 11 inches (HWD). It'll take up a fair amount of desk space so don't count on it for a tight work area or small cafe table if you take it on the road. At 5.95 pounds it's hardly the most portable PC so you may not carry it often but compared to the Alienware x17—which is slimmer but weighs a ponderous 7.05 pounds—the Acer looks ready to roll.

The construction quality as I said is just okay which may be why the Nitro is relatively lightweight. You'll notice some flex in the keyboard deck with even light pressure and the same goes for the lid. The all-plastic build doesn't have the premium feel of the all-metal Razer Blade 15 and isn't as sturdy as the x17.

I have generally more positive things to say about the keyboard. The keys have a nice bounce to them with plenty of travel but little or no mushy feeling at the bottom of the press. There's a full numeric keypad at right for those taking a break from gaming to fill in a spreadsheet.

The touchpad is less remarkable a simple and serviceable plastic surface. It's offset to the left centered under the main area of the keyboard rather than both the keyboard and number pad. There's no real benefit to having more empty space on the right side; if you're using the WASD keys to play your palm will partially rest on the touchpad. You can of course disable the pad but it's a small annoyance when there's plenty of room to spare.

Our Nitro 5 features a 17.3-inch display with full HD (1920-by-1080-pixel) resolution and a blisteringly fast 360Hz refresh rate. The screen quality is decent—1080p is sharp enough and colors are well saturated—though it's not especially bright with our testing confirming its rated 300 nits. The combination is solid for gaming as we'll see in the test results below and you can argue that the top-of-the-line Nvidia GPU should be teamed with an even higher resolution.

Rounding out the build is a moderate selection of ports. The left flank holds two USB 3.1 Type-A ports and an Ethernet jack (with Killer networking) a nice addition for gamers who frequently play competitive online titles. The right side offers another USB-A 3.1 port a USB-C port and an HDMI video output.

Components and Testing

Acer applies the Nitro 5 name to both 15.6- and 17.3-inch versions of this laptop with model numbers clarifying which unit you're looking at. For $2099 our test unit is outfitted with some pretty impressive parts including an eight-core 3.2GHz AMD Ryzen 7 5800H processor 16GB of RAM a 1TB solid-state drive and the GeForce RTX 3080 GPU. The price is a fair deal for these high-end components and maybe even a bit less than most competitors (though the latter again win in build quality).

A quick word is needed about the graphics adapter. As we've discussed elsewhere Nvidia's RTX 30 series mobile GPUs can be configured with a wide range of wattages or power output for varying laptop designs and thermal limitations yielding considerably different performance from the same part number in different notebooks (for instance an RTX 3070 delivering faster frame rates than an RTX 3080). Your best bet is to keep a close eye on gaming laptops' listed wattages and our real-world test results which make more of a difference for the end user than the GPU name alone. The GeForce RTX 3080 in this Nitro 5 tops out at 95 watts.

To see how the Acer's components perform together we matched it against four other gaming laptops—the Lenovo Alienware and Razer already mentioned plus the MSI GE76 Raider. You can see their basic specs in the table below.

The Acer is the least expensive machine here so hanging close in or winning any benchmarks will be an impressive price/performance showing. As always some system cost (or cost saving) goes toward build quality or features that don't necessarily impact performance so it's not as simple as assuming the Nitro 5 will be the slowest laptop because it has the lowest price. The Core i9 and Ryzen 9 systems have an edge but generally speaking the Acer's RTX 3080 and eight-core CPU should keep it competitive.

Productivity Tests

The main benchmark of UL's PCMark 10 simulates a variety of real-world productivity and content-creation workflows to measure overall performance for office-centric tasks such as word processing spreadsheeting web browsing and videoconferencing. We also run PCMark 10's Full System Drive test to assess the load time and throughput of a laptop's storage.

Three benchmarks focus on the CPU using all available cores and threads to rate a PC's suitability for processor-intensive workloads. Maxon's Cinebench R23 uses that company's Cinema 4D engine to render a complex scene while Primate Labs' Geekbench 5.4 Pro simulates popular apps ranging from PDF rendering and speech recognition to machine learning. Finally we use the open-source video transcoder HandBrake 1.4 to convert a 12-minute video clip from 4K to 1080p resolution (lower times are better).

Our final productivity test is workstation maker Puget Systems' PugetBench for Photoshop which uses the Creative Cloud version 22 of Adobe's famous image editor to rate a PC's performance for content creation and multimedia applications. It's an automated extension that executes a variety of general and GPU-accelerated Photoshop tasks ranging from opening rotating resizing and saving an image to applying masks gradient fills and filters.

The Nitro 5 never quite led in this suite of tests but it never lagged far behind. Its storage speed (like the Lenovo's and Alienware's) didn't impress but most of its scores were near the top or middle of this powerful bunch proving the Acer to be a thoroughly capable media machine. If you're specifically looking for a gaming rig that you'll also use often for media editing or content creation you'll probably prefer a Ryzen 9 or Core i9 system with 32GB of memory but for occasional jobs or hobbyist sessions the Nitro 5 has the processing chops.

Graphics and Gaming Tests

We test Windows PCs' graphics with two DirectX 12 gaming simulations from UL's 3DMark: Night Raid (more modest suitable for laptops with integrated graphics) and Time Spy (more demanding suitable for gaming rigs with discrete GPUs).

We also run two tests from the cross-platform GPU benchmark GFXBench 5 which stresses both low-level routines like texturing and high-level game-like image rendering. The 1440p Aztec Ruins and 1080p Car Chase tests rendered offscreen to accommodate different display resolutions exercise graphics and compute shaders using the OpenGL programming interface and hardware tessellation respectively. In GFXBench the more frames per second (fps) the better.

In addition we run three real-world game tests using the built-in benchmarks of F1 2021 Assassin's Creed Valhalla and Rainbow Six Siege. These represent simulation open-world action-adventure and competitive esports shooter games respectively. Valhalla and Siege are run twice (Valhalla at its Medium and Ultra quality presets Siege at Low and Ultra quality) while we run F1 2021 twice at maximum settings once with Nvidia's performance-boosting DLSS anti-aliasing turned on.

You can see what several hundred more dollars can do here—the powerhouse systems had a definite edge across these titles. That said the Nitro 5 held its own matching or beating the pricier Razer. A beefier system will get you extra frames per second but won't make a world of difference: In a practical sense 64fps versus 78fps in Assassin's Creed Valhalla at max settings doesn't mean the slowest system is unplayable especially considering that the faster one costs $1200 more and is markedly less portable.

Judged on the merits the Acer delivered fine performance in the most strenuous games clearing the desired 60fps hurdle even in demanding titles like Valhalla. Among the other concerns about Nvidia's mobile RTX 30 GPUs is the fact that they represent a steep drop-off compared to their desktop counterparts; for now you simply aren't going to soar over 100fps in these types of games.

Battery and Display Tests

We test laptops' battery life by playing a locally stored 720p video file (the open-source Blender movie Tears of Steel) with display brightness at 50% and audio volume at 100% until the system quits. We make sure the battery is fully charged before the test with Wi-Fi and keyboard backlighting turned off.

We also use a Datacolor SpyderX Elite monitor calibration sensor and its software to measure a laptop screen's color saturation—what percentage of the sRGB Adobe RGB and DCI-P3 color gamuts or palettes the display can show—and its brightness in nits (candelas per square meter) at the screen's 50% and peak settings.

The Nitro 5 showed good stamina lasting nearly seven hours in our battery rundown test. As you can see that's a couple of hours more than some rivals and about the best you can expect from a 17-inch gaming laptop. Even most 15-inch gaming rigs don't last drastically longer. The bottom line is even though the Acer's not the most portable machine you can take it with you without it dying as soon as you're out of reach of a wall outlet.

As in our subjective eye test earlier the Nitro's display proved just so-so in our hardware measurements. Its color gamut coverage is average and its brightness (while fulfilling its promised 300 nits) is subpar. It's not bad enough to be a deal-breaker but does look duller than some standout displays.

A Fair Value for High-End Gaming

The latest 17.3-inch Acer Nitro 5 has the performance chops you'd want in a high-end laptop even offering a better deal than most $2000-plus gaming rigs. That plus sufficient storage and a fast display panel are its biggest upsides. Beyond those points it's a fairly unremarkable system—the design is plain the build has some flex and its display quality is a bit below average.

Also while it's largely an esthetic and consumer satisfaction issue the Nitro 5 lacks some of the style build quality and premium experience that you might expect from a laptop in its price range. You can bring the abovementioned competitors' prices down with lesser configurations and get a nicer build without sacrificing much power. To be sure the Acer is a fair deal for what it offers but we have tested more appealing options in this price tier with our pick probably going to the Lenovo Legion 7 Gen 6.",,,,,,

Alexander was King’s only child from her marriage to record producer Ian Alexander Sr. The two divorced in 2007 after 10 years of marriage.

The actress and her son shared a close relationship. They shared matching tattoos that read “unconditional love” in Aramaic King revealed as a guest on The View in 2017. The Academy Award-winning actress frequently brought her son along with her to red carpet events.

On her 50th birthday Alexander wrote on Instagram “To be able to watch you take this lifetime by its neck and make it yours is something i will forever be grateful for. But to have you as my mother is the greatest gift I could ask for.”

The 26-year-old performed as a musician and DJ under the stage name Desduné. On Jan. 7 he released a new single “Green Eyes” and had performances scheduled at Breaking Sound Los Angeles during the end of the month.

“I get emotional because my son is an amazing young man” expressed King during a 2011 interview on CNN Red Chair Interview. “You don’t know what unconditional love is. You may say you do but if you don’t have a child you don’t know what that is. But when you experience it it is the most fulfilling ever. So that is the greatest part about me. Being a mom to Ian.”

Having said that SPX is definitely oversold with climatic down move and wide price spread which is likely to experience a selling climax soon before an automatic rally kicks in.

Detailed price action analysis with the Wyckoff method on S&P 500 Futures will be shown later. First take a look at the relationship between SPX and the market breadth below to derive some useful market insights.

Using Stock Market Breadth to Spot Market Bottom

The market breadth as shown in the bottom pane of the chart is the percent of stocks above 200-Day average. There is a clear divergence between the market breadth and the SPX since January 2021 where the SPX forms a higher high while the market breadth forms a lower low.

This divergence means less stocks are participating the uptrend which is not a healthy sign for a bull market. The divergence serves as a red flag and not a signal or confirmation for a reversal of the uptrend because the price action is still the final confirmation.

The market breadth chart is divided by 3 orange lines at 70% 50% and 30%. The key is to pay attention to the 50% level. When the market breadth comes down and fails to bounce at the 50% level there has been a strong pullback or correction in SPX as seen in 2014 2015 2018 and 2020. The level at 50% acts as a support. When there are less than 50% of the stocks above 200-Day average for some time the uptrend of SPX is unlikely to hold hence a pullback or correction happens.

The first time the market breadth dipped below 50% support level in September 2021 it managed to climbed above in October 2021. The second time it dipped below the support level in November 2021 there were 3 attempts to rally above but none of them able to even test the 50% level. The inability to reclaim above the support level spells trouble ahead for SPX.

Based on the past data once the market breadth failed to reclaim the support level at 50% it dipped below the 30% level which is considered as an oversold level. A dip below the 30% level followed by a reclaim above (annotate in green) marks the market bottom except in 2018.

Even in 2018 it also marked a temporary bottom with an upswing followed in SPX despite there was a final capitulation in December 2018.

Now the market breadth is at 31.3 which is yet to dip below the 30% level could suggest more weakness ahead in SPX until a selling climax occurs followed by a technical rally. During this transition period likely there will be sector rotation in the stock market where the money managers take the opportunity to re-balance and re-position their portfolios and rotate the funds to the outperforming stocks.

S&P 500 Price Prediction with Wyckoff Method

Based on the characteristics of the S&P 500 E-mini Futures (ES) a sign of weakness (SOW) broke below the up-sloping trading range with increasing supply since 13 January 2022. The down wave comes with increasing price spread and climatic move which are part of the characteristics before a selling climax and a technical rally show up. Refer to the chart below for the potential bearish scenario.

An estimation of the price targets of S&P 500 based on the Point and Figure (P&F) chart is shown below:

A first segment (annotated in orange) is used for the estimation and the projected price target is 4020-4240. This means there is “enough fuel in the tank” for the distribution based on the Wyckoff’s law – Cause and Effect. It does not mean the price must come down to the price target.

Ultimately it is essential to refer back to the price action of S&P 500 and its characteristics to confirm the price movement. Based on the market breadth data price volume analysis and the Point and Figure price target prediction for S&P 500 it seems like the sell-off is not over yet. The odds are still in favour of the bear. Visit TradePrecise.com to get more market insights in email for free.

India’s largest mortgage lender HDFC's wholly-owned subsidiary HDFC Capital is planning to invest around $2 billion in affordable housing through its third fund focused on this segment.The fund HDFC Capital Affordable Real Estate Fund - 3 (H-CARE-3) is one of the largest funds raised to invest in the residential real estate sector anywhere in the world. The fund has achieved its first close with investors already committing over $1.22 billion.The primary investor of the fund is a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Abu Dhabi Investment Authority (ADIA). The total corpus of the H-CARE-3 will be around $2 billion including the potential reinvestments by the fund.“In India housing will play an even more important role as a catalyst for growth with increased demand for affordable and mid-income housing. Combined with India’s growth prospects I have never been as optimistic about the housing sector as I am today” said Deepak Parekh Chairman HDFC.According to him while the demand for affordable and mid-income housing continues to be robust the lack of flexible long-term capital is one of the key challenges facing developers of affordable and mid income housing in India.HDFC Capital’s funds focus on providing developers access to financing on flexible terms and have supported the development of over 78 residential projects and 180000 houses across India over the last six years.HDFC Capital set up in 2016 is aligned with the government of India’s goal to increase housing supply and support the Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana – ‘Housing for All’ initiative.“With this new fund we are becoming a platform for the entire affordable housing ecosystem by supporting not only realty projects through equity and mezzanine financing but also to vendors and technology companies that help push the efficiency of such projects higher” Vipul Roongta MD & CEO HDFC Capital told ET. “Our earlier two funds have invested over $1.1 billion across 78 affordable and mid-income projects of 25 developers. While these two funds have a total tenure of 12 years we have managed to exit 25% of investments with robust returns in four years.”Through these funds it has formed joint ventures and alliances with established developers including Runwal Group Rustomjee Group Shapoorji Pallonji Real Estate Prestige Group Arvind Smart Spaces and Ambuja Neotia.H-CARE 3 combines with the HDFC Capital Affordable Real Estate Funds - 1 and 2 raised in 2016 and 2017 respectively to create a $3 billion funding platform as one of the world’s largest private finance platforms focused on development of affordable housing.“H-CARE 3 presents the opportunity to grow our existing relationship with HDFC while continuing to address the significant demand for affordable housing in India. This builds on the success of previous H-CARE funds which have supported the development of new mid-market housing projects across the country in alignment with Indian government priorities” said Khadem Al Remeithi Executive Director of the Real Estate & Infrastructure Department ADIA.The fund will provide long-term flexible funding across the lifecycle of affordable and mid-income housing projects including early-stage funding. In addition H-CARE 3 will also invest in technology companies including construction technology fin-tech clean-tech etc. engaged in the affordable housing ecosystem.Primary focus of the fund will be to provide long-term flexible debt across the lifecycle of real estate projects including land approval and last mile funding for the development of affordable and mid-income housing across India.HDFC Capital’s target is to finance the development of one million affordable homes in India through a combination of innovative financing partnerships and technology whilst focusing on sustainability.In order to achieve this objective the company is in active discussions with leading global investors to raise additional funds to be invested in affordable housing in India.HDFC will be the sponsor and HDFC Capital will be the investment manager for H-CARE3 which will have a tenure of 12 years with a provision of two extensions of one year each.The fund will have flexibility to provide equity funding for real estate projects too. The fund is expected to be committed towards investments over the next 4-5 years. Its projected development foot-print is estimated to be 280 million sq ft across affordable and mid-income residential projects in India’s leading cities.The need for affordable housing is growing across the urban sprawls of India and has caught the attention of many developers and financial institutions. More than half of all Indian residential launches in the top eight cities in the last five years have been in the sub-Rs 50 lakh segment.In recent years the government has also introduced several schemes for affordable housing including interest subsidies for low and economically disadvantaged sections additional tax benefits for both developers and homebuyers and has also granted infrastructure status to affordable housing to ease fund availability.",,,

Technion team remove ‘forever chemicals’ from water

Researchers from the Technion–Israel Institute of Technology have developed innovative technology to remove dangerous pollutants from drinking water.

The technology efficiently removes and destroys synthetic organofluorine chemical compounds (PFAS). PFAS is a family of problematic pollutants also known as “forever chemicals” because of their chemical stability and environmental persistence.

There are thousands of PFAS chemicals and they are found in many different consumer commercial and industrial products. This makes it challenging to study and assess the potential human health and environmental risks. These substances can be found in air water soil and food as well as a large range of products including Teflon pan coating fire-fighting foam flame retardants and water-repellent additives. They reach the groundwater in various ways including agricultural irrigation using treated wastewater and fire-fighting substances seeping into the soil. As a result of their chemical stability they remain intact in the ground for a long time leading to extensive contamination of drinking sources which in turn significantly increases human exposure.

“Lately it has become clear that these chemicals are of severe health and ecological hazard – thus finding ways to remove and destroy them is of great importance” said Technion Asst. Prof. Dr. Adi Radian.

Radian head of the Soil and Environmental Chemistry Lab in the Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering headed the study with her post-doctoral student Dr. Samapti Kundu. Their findings were published in the Chemical Engineering Journal.

Federal regulators are considering limiting the authorization of certain monoclonal antibody treatments that have not proved effective against the Omicron variant of the coronavirus a source familiar with the decision-making told CNN.

The US Food and Drug Administration could decide in the coming days to take steps to curb the use of antibody treatments produced by Eli Lilly and Regeneron the source said pointing to the growing body of evidence that shows their monoclonal therapies don’t effectively neutralize the virus’ Omicron variant.

The National Institutes of Health had recently updated its guidelines to advise clinics against using these treatments on patients with mild to moderate Covid-19 due to their diminished effectiveness against the Omicron variant.

This past week senior health officials in the administration including Dr. David Kessler chief science officer of the White House’s COVID Response Team and assistant secretary for Health Dr. Rachel Levine called the offices of governors and state health officials. They urged against using these treatments with Omicron now accounting for nearly all positive cases a source familiar with the calls said.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates more than 99% of cases nationwide have the Omicron variant.

The treatments have remained popular among some governors who continue to push them despite the recent data. Over the last two weeks states have distributed nearly 110000 doses of the Lily and Regeneron treatments according to a federal database maintained by the Department of Health and Human Services.

Earlier this month amid a record-breaking surge of new coronavirus cases in Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis assailed the Biden administration for pausing shipments of the monoclonal antibodies and has pushed for the treatment to remain widely available.

During a January 3 press conference DeSantis contended his administration had seen the treatments work on Omicron patients though he didn’t provide further evidence.

“Omicron is not the only variant that’s out there” DeSantis said. “And it’s something that we actually have seen applied with Omicron patients and we have seen symptoms resolved.”

Omicron has accounted for more than 95% of cases in the Southern region of the US since the week of December 19 according to the CDC. Regeneron has publicly stated its monoclonal antibody treatment is not effective against the Omicron variant.

Nearly 13000 doses of Regeneron were used in Florida over the past two weeks more than any three other states combined. DeSantis’ office did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Saturday.

DeSantis has made monoclonal antibodies a cornerstone of his response to surges of coronavirus cases in his state often pushing the treatment more vigorously than vaccines. Last summer he introduced new clinics where individuals could receive the treatment at the onset of symptoms or exposure to someone with Covid-19. His news conferences often feature first-hand accounts of people who have recovered from coronavirus after receiving treatment.

Other states followed DeSantis’ lead. Texas Gov. Greg Abbott last year opened state-sponsored “infusion centers” where Covid-positive patients could receive monoclonal antibody treatment. Abbott himself received Regeneron’s monoclonal antibody therapy treatment when he tested positive for coronavirus in August when its Delta variant was predominant.

The fast-spreading Omicron variant was first detected in the US on December 1 and quickly became the predominant variant.

The Biden administration agreed to provide shipments of the Regeneron and Lily treatments in the weeks to follow while Delta remained a prevalent albeit diminishing variant. The potential for a positive outcome in the small percentage of Delta patients was a calculated trade-off to potentially giving an Omicron patient ineffective treatment a senior official said. The vast majority of coronavirus cases are not sequenced to determine the variant and doctors often make treatment decisions without knowing which strand of the virus the patient is infected with.

But with Delta now accounting for a very small share of cases in most regions the Biden administration had hoped most states would have moved away from the monoclonal antibody treatments a senior official said.

There are also concerns widespread use of the treatments could put people at unnecessary risk for the adverse effects from receiving monoclonal antibodies. According to the National Institutes of Health some patients have reported rashes diarrhea nausea and dizziness after treatment. A small percentage of patients had severe allergic reactions.

The Biden administration has pushed for states to pivot to other treatments that have demonstrated greater effectiveness against the Omicron variant including the Merck and Pfizer antiviral pills GlaxoSmithKline’s monoclonal antibody AstraZeneca’s pre-exposure prophylaxis and commercially available remdesivir.

On Friday the US Food and Drug Administration expanded the use of the antiviral remdesivir for treatment of mild to moderate Covid-19 to children and people who aren’t hospitalized.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiqwFodHRwczovL3d3dy5nYWluZXN2aWxsZS5jb20vc3RvcnkvZW50ZXJ0YWlubWVudC8yMDIyLzAxLzIzL3R3by15b3VuZy13b21lbi13aG8tbWFraW5nLWRpZmZlcmVuY2UtcGVvcGxlcy1saXZlcy1oYXZlLWJlZW4tc2VsZWN0ZWQtaGlnaC1ob25vcnMtcmVjb2duaXRpb24tdGhlaXIvNjYyNTYwMDAwMS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Gainesville's Anjana Balachandar and Cassidy Klein earn recognition,"The Regeneron Science Talent Search the nation’s oldest and most prestigious science and math competition for high school seniors has named Buchholz High School's Anjana Balachandar as one of 300 scholars.

The Workplace Relations Commission (WRC) adjudicator Peter O’Brien found the main Irish arm of US firm Regeneron unfairly dismissed Robert Libera for gross misconduct on March 20 2019.

Regeneron has its manufacturing base at the former Dell site in Limerick. Mr Libera worked as a manufacturing support lead with the company.

Regeneron Ireland DAC dismissed Mr Libera after a 22-year-old woman employed by a third-party supplier on site made a complaint concerning a Facebook messenger exchange between the two on January 18 2019.

In her initial complaint the woman said that after Mr Libera had given her a fruit juice he hinted it may have contained a biological fluid or otherwise and messaged her about “part of him” being “inside of her” and “if she felt part of him inside her”.

Possible sexual innuendo

In his findings Mr O’Brien determined the text message may have been intended to be humorous but could be considered in isolation “as inappropriate offensive and contain possible sexual innuendo”.

Mr O’Brien said whatever Mr Libera intended “the message was seriously ill-advised and contained inappropriate language of a possible sexual innuendo nature”.

Mr O’Brien said Mr Libera’s case “is very weak on the substantive issue” but primarily succeeds on procedural grounds.

In making the award Mr O’Brien weighed Mr Libera’s contribution to his loss at 40%.

Mr O’Brien said: “Sending a message like he did to a female work colleague no matter how the complainant [Mr Libera] deemed it to be trivial or funny was inappropriate ill-judged and resulted in serious consequences for Mr Libera.”

The woman made a complaint concerning the message and met with Regeneron investigators where she initially described the exchange as having “a big impact on her that weekend and was the worst weekend of her life”.

The woman initially said she was terrified and felt physically ill as a result of the exchange with Mr Libera.

'Family Guy' cartoon clip

However Mr Libera told the WRC that he accompanied the text with a clip from US cartoon Family Guy which almost exactly states what Mr Libera said in the text exchange.

Documents provided to Mr Libera show the woman had not seen the Family Guy clip before making her complaint while all three Regeneron decision makers who dismissed Mr Libera confirmed they did not see the YouTube clip.

Legal representatives for Mr Libera say the Family Guy clip “proves that no bad intentions existed in the communications and was intended as a joke”.

Describing himself as a “big Family Guy fan” Mr Libera expected the woman would know the context of his comments as they were well-known and common phrases in Family Guy.

Two days later on January 20 the woman emailed Regeneron to say she was withdrawing her complaint and that she now had a different view of the messages.

Mr O’Brien said that nearly all of the woman’s comments in the January 20 email favoured Mr Libera and that the woman did not want the investigation to proceed.

However Mr O’Brien said the email was never made available to Mr Libera during the investigation of the initial complaint and not made available to the Regeneron decision-makers who decided Mr Libera should be dismissed.

It is important to note that had this email been available to either Mr Libera or the decision-makers in this case a very different outcome than dismissal could possibly have been an outcome.

Mr O'Brien said it was indeed questionable if any investigation at all should have commenced into the allegation based on the clarifying comments by the woman who made the initial complaint.

Mr O’Brien said the failure to provide the January 20 email to Mr Libera was a serious natural justice omission which put him at a serious disadvantage in defending his position.

He said it was a very serious flaw in Regeneron’s case as the woman who received the text had subsequently significantly amended her views on the issue and did not want an investigation to proceed.

The January 20 email was only made available to Mr Libera’s solicitors Keating Connolly Sellors Solicitors after they had made a GDPR data application following his dismissal.

The legal representatives said the actions of Mr Libera with his good prior record should have resulted in a much lesser sanction than dismissal.

After working in finance in Geneva for 15 years Olivier Santi moved to Dakar in 2017 to head a new bank founded by one of Senegal’s richest businessmen. His career to date demonstrates both the central role Switzerland plays in the finance and raw materials sectors and the vitality of West Africa’s banking sector

6 minutes

Senegal’s new Outarde BankExternal link (LBO) takes its name and logo from the bustard (outarde in French) a bird that is on the verge of extinction.

“The bustard is a very rare bird” explains Olivier Santi managing director of Outarde Bank. “Legend has it that if you see one in flight you will become rich.”

The metaphor was not a random choice. Founded four years ago in Dakar’s bustling Plateau business district the bank was the dream of Senegalese businessman Abdoulaye Diao — a man renowned for his discretion. Educated in France Diao made his fortune in commodities. Today he acts as special counsel to Senegal’s president Macky Sall with Outarde Bank’s head office located a stone’s throw from the presidential palace.

Diao had long aspired to creating Senegal’s first national private capital bank. Prior to Outarde Bank’s founding Senegal’s banking landscape consisted almost exclusively of public institutions and foreign banks hailing mostly from the northwest region of Africa or France.

Today Santi a 44 year-old Paris native and naturalised Swiss citizen describes himself as “Senegalese by adoption” and clearly takes pleasure in saying that he runs “one of the rare Senegalese banks in Senegal”.

Oliver Santi’s office is decorated with a statue of the bustard several photographs with Abdoulaye Diao and a Mondaine clock the Swiss brand which also makes clocks for the Swiss Federal Railways. The banker continues to hold strong ties to Switzerland. ©SWI/Pauline Turuban

Starting out in Geneva

As a young man Santi studied economics and finance at the prestigious Paris Institute of Political Studies (Sciences Po) and the ESCP Business School also in Paris. After his studies a “thirst for independence” took him to Geneva where his grandfather Paul Santi was French consul. Santi also had an uncle who managed a large hedge fund in Geneva and that is where he obtained his first professional experience in finance.

Santi’s French education and linguistic abilities — especially in Arabic which he studied in Paris — quickly caught the attention of the Swiss branch of international banking behemoth BNP Paribas which he joined in 2004 as director for the Middle East and Africa regions based in Geneva.

“My clients were the heads of business wealthy families and I also managed the accounts of businesses and investment funds active in the region” says Santi.

A “pure product of Genevan finance” Santi spent nine years at BNP Paribas during which time he encountered Abdoulaye Diao.

Diao founder of the Senegalese oil gas and jet fuel trading company International Trading Oil and Commodities Corporation (ITOC) is close to certain large Swiss companies top traders and other international firms. That is where the destinies of the two men meet.

Building a bank from scratch

In 2013 Santi left BNP Parisbas to set up his own financial management company in Geneva. One of clients was Diao. He began to supervise the team in charge of Diao’s project.

“Abdoulaye Diao reached out to me to help him set up a bank to accompany the development of Senegal’s private sector” says Santi. “It was an opportunity; I jumped on it.”

Setting up the bank took “a lot of patience” because “creating a bank from zero is complex both from a financial and technical point of view” explains Santi. Outarde Bank was accreditedExternal link by the Central Bank of West African States (BCEAO) in 2017 becoming the 25th banking establishmentExternal link in Dakar’s financial centre

The bank began activities in January 2018 with a private Senegalese shareholding of 84.5% of which Diao who chairs the board of directors owns 59%. Although Outarde Bank is yet to generate a profit Santi says its balance sheet is growing 25-30% every six months and it has nearly 1000 clients.

To date 80% of Outarde Bank’s clients are businesses.

“These can be micro-business through to large businesses but we specialise in specific economic segments such as energy and agriculture” says Santi. He says the bank’s values mirror those of its founder.

“Abdoulaye Diao believes strongly that Senegal’s development will be driven by the development of local production which creates local jobs” he says.

But economic patriotism and philanthropy are not the only drivers of growth. The strong growth potential of West Africa’s economy and banking sector driven by the growing middle class is whetting appetites. Shortly after Outarde Bank was launched in early 2018 Jeune AfriqueExternal link weekly news magazine published a report detailing the enthusiasm among African entrepreneurs — especially Senegalese entrepreneurs — for this growing and “very profitable sector”. The report noted that many had invested in the sector in recent years.

The Jeune Afrique article says the interest can be explained by the influence that owning a bank confers along with the ambition of “find[ing] new sources of growth”. In a region where the difficulty in obtaining financingExternal link is one of the principal obstacles to the development of small and medium enterprises (SME) and where 80% of householdsExternal link do not yet have a bank account the development potential of the sector is huge.

Swiss touch

Santi believes that his Swiss training can tip the balance and that his background is his added-value as director.

“I am convinced that Switzerland is one of the best countries in the world in terms of banking regulation” says Santi. “I was trained according to the precepts of the Swiss Financial Market Supervisory Authority (FINMA) and I have tried to instil this technique [in the bank’s activities]. With us the customer journey is typical of that of a Swiss bank; that is discreet efficient and transparent.”

India will hold its first summit dialogue virtually with the Presidents of the five Central Asian countries – Kazakhstan Kyrgyzstan Tajikistan Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan – on 27 January 2022. This is a significant outreach to Central Asia by India with which it shares significant cultural civilizational and historic linkages. There were initial indications of their possible collective participation as chief guests at the Republic Day parade on 26th January but obviously the global Covid situation did not render itself conducive to such in person engagement. An India-Central Asia dialogue mechanism exists at the Foreign Ministers level that last met in New Delhi for the Third Dialogue on 18-19th December 2021.

India has enjoyed historical and civilizational linkages with Central Asia through the Silk Route from 3rd century BC to 15th century AD when the sea route from Europe to India was discovered. The Silk route connected the two regions not only for transportation of goods like silk textiles spices etc. but also served as an effective channel for exchange of thoughts ideas religion and philosophy. Buddhism spread through this route from India to Central Asia and from there to West China in the contemporary Xinjiang region. In medieval times Babar came from Fergana Valley after losing his kingdom to try his fortune in India and laid the foundations of the great Mughal Empire. Post independent India’s linkages with the Soviet period through culture music dance movies and literature sustained close relations with the Soviet Republics.

In the 1990s when the five central Asian republics gained independence India faced the twin challenges of adjusting to the emerging post-cold war order and domestic economic reform. In time India’s foreign policy evolved to include a greater emphasis on engagement with India’s extended neighborhood which included Central Asia.

As newly independent states these five republics were not very confident of their financial and economic viability. They are all landlocked but some have translated this faultline into an asset like Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan have done by constructing a web of roads railways highways oil and gas pipelines crisscrossing from East to West and North to South to connect industrial hubs with consumer markets. Last few years have seen highways and railroads traversing from the East in China through Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan to Europe Russia Iran and the Middle East. Similarly oil from Caspian Sea offshore facilities in Kazakhstan and gas from Turkmenistan is being shipped by pipelines to the western region of China.

All these states are rich in minerals and well-endowed with hydroelectric resources. Kazakhstan has the world’s second largest reserves of uranium and is the world’s largest producer; Uzbekistan has large reserves of gas uranium and gold; Turkmenistan has fourth largest reserves of natural gas; Tajikistan has huge hydroelectric potential; Kyrgyzstan is rich in gold and hydroelectric power. Kazakhstan is more progressive than others; Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan have lagged; Uzbekistan and Turkmenistan remain closed and controlled societies. Uzbekistan is a potential leader but has difficult relations with neighbors Tajikistan and Kyrgyzstan on water issues and Kazakhstan in the race to become a pre-eminent power in the region.

Religious extremism fundamentalism drug trafficking pose challenges to these societies and to regional stability. Issues relating to water security environment migration have become acute. The region faces newer threats of narco-terrorism emanating from Afghanistan. The region is said to be an ‘arena of great game’ being played out between Russia China US Turkey Iran Europe EU Japan Pakistan India and Afghanistan all of whom have substantial security and economic stakes in the region.

That India does not share a common land border with any of these states has been a major bottleneck in promoting and expanding ties. Pakistan does not allow direct routes to either Afghanistan or to Central Asia. China is therefore the transit land route for trade which is time consuming and costly. To improve connectivity India has registered considerable progress in concluding a trilateral agreement for renovation of Chabahar port development of the International North South Transport Corridor (INSTC) and becoming a member of the Ashgabat Agreement. India’s membership of Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO) as also the Eurasian Economic Union (EEU) promises to bridge this gap.

India’s Connect Central Asia (CAA) policy of 2012 is a broad-based framework involving political economic security and cultural connections. Following the announcement of the Connect Asia policy in 2012 the Indian PM visited all the five countries. India uses its considerable soft power through dance music Bollywood films yoga literature etc. India’s international Technical and Economic Cooperation (ITEC) programme attracts young professionals for capacity building. There is considerable scope of participation in trade fairs and in building infrastructure projects as in rail road highways power transmission lines nuclear power etc. In addition to oil and gas IT pharma and textiles higher education space SME power generation food processing and agriculture present rich potential for deeper engagement. SCO may serve as a guarantor for the projects. At the Third Dialogue India urged focus on 4Cs: Commerce Capacity Development Connectivity and Contacts.

Greater engagement is expected to help improve mutual security and regional economic prosperity. Economically Central Asia provides a ‘near abroad’ market for India’s industry overland routes to rich resources of Russia and Middle East and significant energy supplies at relatively short distances. The INSTC corridor route is shorter than Suez and the Mediterranean Sea. As competition for resources with China intensifies this region is likely to assume greater significance. The Third Dialogue emphasized the accountability and transparency of projects in a veiled reference to the debt trap that China’s BRI is. The $1b Line of Credit already announced by India is aimed at High Impact Development Projects (HICDPS) for socio-economic development of the region. The Third Dialogue brought in the additional element of connectivity between Indian states and Central Asia. The India-Central Asia Business Council (ICABC) established in 2020 was urged to encourage these activities.

From the security perspective this region potentially acts as a buffer to contain the fallout of fundamentalism to forestall encirclement by any regional or outside power and finally to insulate India from narco-terrorism. India’s presence may well serve to neutralise the region’s anti-West bias and reassure US and EU. India may yet have to balance geopolitical ambitions of China and Russia to evolve a mutually beneficial framework. Though active partners in the BRI the disenchantment of the Central Asian countries has increased not only with the growing Chinese footprint in their economic and political systems but also because of repression of several Kazakh and Kyrgyz Muslims along with Uighurs in the Xinjiang region resulting in many anti-Chinese protests.

The region’s importance has been accentuated with the Taliban takeover of Afghanistan and the threats of narco-terrorism spilling over to Central Asia and on to Russia and China. India and Central Asian Republics have deep rooted ties with Afghanistan – three of these countries Turkmenistan Uzbekistan and Tajikistan-share borders with Afghanistan – all agreed on the need for an inclusive government unhindered humanitarian aid and preservation of rights of women children and minorities in Afghanistan. In a veiled reference to Pakistan the Third Dialogue emphasized non-interference in internal affairs of Afghanistan and respect for its territorial integrity and sovereignty as brought out in UNSC Resolution of 2593 (2021) as also the importance of counter terrorism and early adoption of the UN Comprehensive Convention on International Terrorism (CCIT). Significantly the foreign ministers of the five republics skipped the OIC meeting in Islamabad to attend the Dialogue in New Delhi. Cognizant of the rapidly changing scenario the National Security Advisors of all these five countries attended the regional meeting on the situation in Afghanistan that India hosted in November 2021.

Apart from the centrality of the Afghanistan issue the other elephant in the room is China which has come to pose an even greater geo-political threat to India. This apart compared to $100b trade turnover with China the region’s trade with India is only $2b. Though India is part of the Turkmenistan-Afghanistan-Pakistan-India (TAPI) pipeline progress is slow. Uzbekistan has also pushed ahead for a joint plan with India and Iran to enhance connectivity through the Chabahar Port but it is expected to take time.

In sum Central Asia’s location its geographical proximity to India ancient linkages render the region highly relevant to India’s strategic interests. India has a huge goodwill in Central Asia. The forthcoming first Summit dialogue is overdue.

The Constitution assures justice equality and liberty to its citizens and promotes fraternity. In an attempt to increase awareness and enable a citizen of India to live life as envisaged by the Constitution we checked with three young lawyers — Anshul Narayan Abhinav Garg and Ayush Anand — to understand the not-so-commonly known aspects of the law. The trio came up with a long list of interesting uncommon and lesser-known ones. Here’s a select list of a few important laws. It is as simple as your right to use the restroom at any hotel and as complicated as filing a Zero FIR or the right to take action against the traffic cop or the right to take action against your employer for non-payment of dues. Know your rights because it is right!

Right to use the restroom at any hotel

According to the Indian Sarais Act of 1867 anyone can request free water and can use the washroom at any hotel even a five-star hotel.

Right to not being called to the police station

No male person under the age of 15 years or above the age of 65 years or women or a mentally or physically disabled person shall be required to attend at any place other than where such male person or women resides. The Investigation Officer interrogates the women in the presence of a female police officer and family/ friends only under section 160 of the Criminal Procedure Code.

Right to privacy of a women victim

A woman who has been sexually assaulted can record her statement anonymously before the magistrate. No one can print and publish the victim's name related to a sexual offence without the court's prior permission while the case is under trial. This protection is given under section 228A of the Indian Penal Code1860.

Right to know why you're being detained

Under Section 50 of the Criminal Procedure Code 1973 it is the responsibility of every police officer or other person authorised to arrest without a warrant to inform the person being detained of the reason for the arrest as soon as possible. The arrest becomes illegal if this clause is not followed.

Right to arrest

According to the Motor Vehicle Act 1988 section 185 202 at the time of driving if your 100 ml blood contains more than 30 mg of alcohol then the police can arrest you without a warrant.

Right of women to protect from arrest at night

Clause (4) of Section 46 of the Code of Criminal Procedure 1973 mandates that a woman cannot be arrested after sunset (6 pm) and before sunrise (6 am) unless there is an exceptional case.

Zero FIR means FIR that can be lodged or filed at any Police Station irrespective of where the incident occurred or a specific jurisdiction to which the matter belongs. The concept of Zero FIR has been adopted to ensure that justice is not delayed or denied and the offender cannot get away scot-free. In the case of Zero FIR the FIR is registered in a police station other than the jurisdictional police station without a serial number or with the serial number ‘0’. This unnumbered FIR is later handed over to the concerned police station where it gets numbered and action is taken.

Right against domestic violence

People continue to work from home in the midst of renewed lockdowns and offices being shut. With increased concern and anxiety induced by the pandemic coupled with lack of proper physical activity this has a detrimental effect on not just our mental health but also our sleep quality. However women particularly working mothers are the most affected as according to experts women require more sleep than males.

A 2014 study published in the National Library of Medicine titled Exploring Sex and Gender Differences in Sleep Health: A Society for Women’s Health Research Report found that men and women have different ideal sleep hours. It further stated that “women are 40% more likely than men to suffer from insomnia and restless leg syndrome” and that men sleep deeper than women.

Dr. Sibasish Dey ResMed’s head of medical affairs for Asia and Latin America agrees with the study’s conclusions. In a talk with IndianExpress.com he explains why women require more sleep than males the consequences of sleep deprivation and offers advice on how women can better manage their sleep cycles.

Why do women need more sleep than men?

“Several studies have shown that due to biological differences men and women’s sleep requirements may differ slightly. How both women and men spend their days is a big factor. Women and men devote different amounts of time to paid and unpaid labor work and social duties and family caregiving according to research” Dr Dey said. He went on to say that women get somewhat more sleep than males about 11-13 minutes more but men sleep far deeper. Women are more likely than men to get up in the middle of the night to care for family members. Sleep is most effective when it is not interrupted.

“Additionally women are more likely to take a nap during the day suggesting that their total sleep time may be misleading. Napping during the day adds to the sleep time (number of hours spent sleeping) and makes night-time sleep less restful” he added.

Repercussions of sleep deprivation in women

Women on average require more sleep than males. The implications of a bad sleep cycle are likewise significantly more severe in women than in men. Sleep-deprived women had a higher risk of hypertension type 2 diabetes heart attacks stress and mental health difficulties than sleep-deprived males according to several research. It can cause confusion exhaustion and a lack of enthusiasm all of which have a negative impact on productivity. Women may also find it more difficult to concentrate than men.

How much more sleep do women need compared to men?

While sleep needs differ from person to person studies show that women require 20–30 minutes more sleep than males to compensate for sleep loss owing to their lifestyle fitness and health needs tasks handled and hormonal changes at every stage.

Shields on Robert Nemiroff Lorraine Hansberry's Other Half,"﻿I like to imagine Lorraine Hansberry and Robert Nemiroff in Greenwich Village’s Washington Square Park while they were dating. She was the associate editor of Paul Robeson’s newspaper Freedom in Harlem; he was finishing up a graduate degree in English literature at New York University. He would lie back on the grass and listen to Lorraine reading poetry aloud.

But after examining the 109 boxes of her papers that Nemiroff and his third wife Jewell Gresham-Nemiroff—a Black activist and playwright —curated for the Schomburg Center for Research in Black Culture in Harlem I was surprised to discover how important he was in Hansberry’s life.

They were a pair of social reformers Bob and Lorraine—anti-nuke anti-racism anti-war Marxists. They met in 1952 at a demonstration in Washington Square. Nemiroff and his wife at the time Elma Lopez a Puerto Rican–American dancer were picketing for the N.A.A.C.P. Hansberry interviewed them for Freedom. Afterward Nemiroff invited her to join the couple and a few others at Ratner’s a kosher deli on Second Avenue known for its cheese blintzes. Six months later the day after Nemiroff and Lopez’s divorce came through Nemiroff called Hansberry for a date.

Hansberry and her husband-cum-manager Robert Nemiroff a week before the Broadway premiere of A Raisin in the Sun at the Barrymore Theatre in New York 1959.

And they fell in love. Well not a romantic kind of love. More of an understanding that left room for Hansberry’s bisexual affairs later. As she would tell him about why she was going outside their marriage: “I suppose I really need you. But you don’t really need me. Then too to be honest I want one or two things which you simply cannot give.” What kept them together after they married in 1953 was work—Hansberry’s work—A Raisin in the Sun The Sign in Sidney Brustein’s Window Les Blancs.

Nemiroff became her manager. And her plays became their children. They talked about them all the time. Hansberry would sit in the bathroom having a cigarette while Nemiroff showered so they could continue their conversations.

He chided her about not using her time productively knowing it was her weak point. Once she threw an early draft of A Raisin in the Sun on the floor and went to get a broom to sweep it into the fireplace. He knelt down and picked up the pages putting them away until she calmed down. A few days later while she was moping around the apartment he put the script on her desk again. She went back to work.

Hansberry and the crew of A Raisin in the Sun—from left co-producer David J. Cogan director Lloyd Richards co-producer Philip Rose and star Sidney Poitier.

Nemiroff was used to handling artistic temperaments. He was a talent scout a deal-maker and an impresario for the pop-music scene. I found a photo of him in a recording studio in the Brill Building on Broadway. In it he’s listening to the playback of a song by two nervous teenagers standing beside him: Carole King and Paul Simon. He was good at discovering talent bringing it along and making money. (Nemiroff discovered Oscar Brown whose album Sin and Soul became a hit. With Burt D’Lugoff Nemiroff also co-wrote the 1956 song “Cindy Oh Cindy” which sold in the millions and “Fifteen” the theme song for the 1959 film The World the Flesh and the Devil starring Harry Belafonte.)

His program for Hansberry began early. They had only been married a few weeks when he packed her off to a leftist summer camp in upstate New York to fine-tune her social consciousness. Later when she got bogged down in the middle of writing A Raisin in the Sun he sent her to Provincetown with instructions to finish the play.

They fell in love. Well not a romantic kind of love. More of an understanding that left room for Hansberry’s bisexual affairs.

After A Raisin in the Sun’s success Hansberry moved out of their apartment and purchased a place of her own—if only around the corner from Nemiroff. However left to her own devices she wasted too much time and he was eager to get her next play The Sign in Sidney Brustein’s Window to Broadway. So he steered her into a split-level house in suburban Croton-on-Hudson. It was supposed to be her writing retreat. She knew practically no one in Croton. He had a key to the house and had his own bedroom. (Hansberry divorced Nemiroff in 1964.)

Nemiroff with Carole King Gerry Goffin (King’s writing partner and eventual husband) and Paul Simon in a recording studio in New York circa 1959.

Even when Hansberry became seriously ill with pancreatic cancer he brought script revisions for the play during hospital visiting hours. She was dying but Nemiroff had an arrangement with her doctor not to tell her. “This enabled her to go on with considerable reality but it’s still not total hopelessness” he said. “She wrote right up to the end.” Hansberry died on January 12 1965 at just 34. That night The Sign in Sidney Brustein’s Window closed on Broadway after 101 performances.

As Hansberry’s literary executor Nemiroff produced several shows from her materials including the Tony-winning Broadway musical Raisin. He adapted her unfinished play Les Blancs slashing through entire pages with a pencil and re-writing dialogue. And from her notes diaries datebooks and correspondence he assembled an “informal autobiography” To Be Young Gifted and Black “adapted by Robert Nemiroff” and with an introduction written by James Baldwin which became a classic in American high schools.

Hansberry with Richards photographed by Gordon Parks at Sardi’s restaurant in New York’s Theater District during a party in honor of the premiere of A Raisin in the Sun.

The depth of Nemiroff’s devotion was beginning to trouble me when I came across an exchange of letters between him and the Black poet June Jordan. She challenged Nemiroff to acknowledge the extent to which he was the co-author of The Sign in Sidney Brustein’s Window and of the posthumous Les Blancs.

“I am not—as you seem to be saying” he replied to Jordan “perhaps without meaning to—Lorraine.”

He had been instead in a manner of speaking Mr. Lorraine Hansberry. That was what mattered to him; that was his role—to be as important to her as he could make himself. Right up until the end of her life and for the rest of his as well.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMia2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWd1YXJkaWFuLmNvbS9idXNpbmVzcy8yMDIyL2phbi8yMy9pdHMtdGltZS1mb3Itc21hbGwtYnVzaW5lc3Nlcy10by1vZmZlci1hLWZvdXItZGF5LXdvcmt3ZWVr0gFraHR0cHM6Ly9hbXAudGhlZ3VhcmRpYW4uY29tL2J1c2luZXNzLzIwMjIvamFuLzIzL2l0cy10aW1lLWZvci1zbWFsbC1idXNpbmVzc2VzLXRvLW9mZmVyLWEtZm91ci1kYXktd29ya3dlZWs?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,It’s time for US small businesses to offer a four-day workweek,"Every small business owner I talk to has the same problem: we can’t find enough people to do the work we need. Well I have an answer: perhaps we should be offering a four-day workweek.

“What? A four-day workweek?” I’ll often hear when I propose this. “I need my people to work more not less!”

Sure it sounds a little crazy particularly for the typical small business owner – who according to the Small Business Administration – is generally over the age of 55. But to those people – many of whom are my clients – I say keep an open mind. The reality is that a four-day workweek is steadily becoming a workplace reality. And leveraging it could be a huge benefit for a small business owner.

The four-day workweek concept is already growing in acceptance. A test of this model from 2015 to 2019 in Iceland of more than 2500 workers (which represents more than 1% of the country’s working population or the equivalent of more than 16 million workers in the US) proved to be an “overwhelming success”. Iceland’s experiment has motivated governments in New Zealand Singapore and Spain to consider four-day workweek models in their countries.

The Icelandic test is also behind a group of more than 100 progressives in Congress – led by Congressman Mark Takano – to introduce legislation requiring US companies to limit their workweeks to 32 hours. And although it’s unlikely that this legislation will see the light of day here in the near term many US companies are already taking it upon themselves to try out their own versions of the four-day workweek. And for good reasons.

For example a San Francisco-based e-commerce company called Bolt started the policy for its 550 employees this year. “It’s actually not about trying to cram five days into four days” the company’s chief people officer told a local news outlet. “The way we think about it is actually changing the way we work and being more effective and efficient during those four days.”

Panasonic is also offering a four-day workweek as an option to its employees. Microsoft did the same in Japan and claims a 40% increase in productivity as a result. Kickstarter is testing the concept this year. Thirty companies in the United Kingdom are participating in a pilot program to test its effectiveness.

This is clearly a trend and like all trends it has early adopters and naysayers. But is this something that only big brands should consider? Absolutely not. A four-day workweek should be seriously considered by smaller businesses and for one big reason: it would help to solve our current labor woes.

Just think about it: if you’re a small business owner you’re having a very difficult time finding people and keeping your best people around. It’s the Great Resignation right? You’re competing against bigger companies with more resources. And yet here’s a benefit that more than two-thirds of workers want and yet only 17% of employers are offering according to a recent study from employment recruiter Robert Half. And some studies have shown that these types of working arrangements also increase productivity effectiveness and morale.

Small businesses are particularly well-suited to offer a four-day workweek because as a small business owner we simply have more flexibility than our larger counterparts.

We can tailor our four-day workweek program to whatever we want it to be. Those “four days” could be four 10-hour days. Or it could be four eight-hour days as long as employees meet their agreed-upon deliverables rather than just logging in time. It can be implemented during certain less-busy times of the year. We can eliminate – or curtail – our current vacation plans. We can make the program available in lieu of a work from home arrangement – or to complement it. Within reason we can offer it to some employees but not to others based on their job requirements. If it’s not working out for certain people you can change the rules.

The biggest attraction? Unlike most other employee benefits it doesn’t have to cost us anything.

Because in the end if we’re getting the work we need out of our people then what do we care whether they do it in four days or two days? This is just compensation for a job performed. And smaller companies have much more flexibility in how we can apply these rules compared with our larger competitors. And let’s not forget: being the first small business in your town to offer a four-day workweek is going to generate quite a lot of positive PR too.

The four-day workweek is trending. It’s an attractive no-cost benefit to offer (if done correctly). It’s a great recruiting tool for a small business. And it’s a great way for that same small business to retain its best workers in these times of tight labor supply.

Far from front-loading mercy as Ted Kennedy testified his slain brother would have done Democrats in the 1990s went out of their way to indulge in tough-on-crime playacting. Even before the notorious 1994 crime bill that laid key groundwork for mass incarceration presidential candidate Bill Clinton famously attended the execution of the lobotomized Ricky Rector to outflank his primary opponents on punitive ruthlessness.

That Clinton’s death-row mise-en-scène is remembered as a savvy campaign strategy and not as a hideous display of raw political cynicism does much to explain Newsom’s refusal to offer parole to a man who’s served a half-century for his crime and has little left to do on this earth besides die. The casual condemnation of Sirhan to even more prison is a political play for older voters who happen to be both more conservative and more inclined toward the carceral state. By parlaying Kennedy hagiography (and cherished memories of being 22) into cheap accolades that cost him precisely nothing to grab Newsom will bank some political capital. Meanwhile a near-octogenerian will languish in prison for no good reason instead of living out the remainder of his infirm years at his brother’s home in Pasadena. Exactly zero Californians have been made safer as a result: Study after study shows that people nearly always age out of committing violent crimes particularly by their late thirties—only half the age that Sirhan is now.

Whatever prison is for if it can’t be accomplished in 53 years then it can’t be accomplished at all. It’s hard to understand how those who might vehemently disagree with this can square that belief with a fealty to Bobby Kennedy’s espoused ideals. His public commitments to expanding civil rights fighting poverty and ending state violence were simply not compatible with Gavin Newsom’s idea of justice which seems mired in the nostalgic notion that Sirhan single-handedly decimated the only off ramp from an ultimately doomed road in American life. He didn’t fatally shoot just one man he shot an alternate reality in which the Trump presidency among other things never happened. As Tribe put it “But for his vicious act the rest of U.S. history would’ve been different.”

Royal Caribbean announced it has extended its stricter mask rules once again.

Due to the Omicron variant anyone sailing on a Royal Caribbean cruise between now and February 14 2022 can expect to wear their face mask while indoors even in vaccinated-only areas of the ship.

In addition to the stricter mask rules smoking in the casino will also remain prohibited through February 14 2022.

The Mason Jar is the name of a new Southern American food restaurant that will be launched on Wonder of the Seas.

The menu will feature Low Country classics Bayou staples and BBQ. Not only that but there will be a brunch menu available.

What are you most concerned about going on a cruise right now?

Going on a cruise ship definitely has some changes to the experience and I wanted to know what our readers are thinking about the most before they get onboard.

I polled Royal Caribbean cruisers on Facebook to see which issues cruise fans thought about and which concerns were less important.

In less than 24 hours 2893 people participated in this unscientific poll and the results were a bit surprising in some cases.

But when ""roast master"" Jeff Ross said a joke about New England Patriots owner Robert Kraft Brady seemed quick to shut it down.

During Ross’s joke presentation he mentioned Brady being taken 199th overall in the NFL Draft and he said he walked into Kraft’s office to tell him something.

PATRIOTS' JEROD MAYO DOUBTS TOM BRADY WANTS TO PLAY QUARTERBACK FOR HIS OLD TEAM

WARNING: VIDEO BELOW CONTAINS EXPLICIT LANGUAGE

The Los Angeles Forum was a mixture of laughs and groans as Ross poked fun at a serious charge that Kraft had faced in early 2019.

In February 2019 Kraft was charged in a multicounty investigation of massage parlors that included a secret video recording in the spas’ lobbies and rooms. Police said the recordings showed Kraft and other men engaging in sex acts with women and paying them.

Kraft would plead not guilty to the charge issued a public apology in March 2019 and would be cleared of a soliciting sex charge in 2020.

Brady turned toward Ross once the joke was said and as Ross looked over at Kraft in the crowd Brady came into frame and tried to whisper something to Ross. But it was caught by a microphone.

""Don’t say that s--- again"" he said quickly to Ross who acknowledged it with a laugh.

“I made a boo-boo” Jeffrey S. McConney admitted when describing the erroneous math he scribbled on “TRUMP” corporate letterhead.

The former Trump Organization controller testified about the notes he took during a January 2017 meeting that laid out how the family real estate company was going to surreptitiously reimburse attorney Michael Cohen for fronting the $130000 that silenced the porn star Stormy Daniels. That payment kept her from going public about her decade-old one-night stand with Trump in the days before the 2016 presidential election.

The farce was laid out in black and white with handwritten notes explaining the fuzzy math at play.

Cohen would be paid $180000 which was doubled on paper so that it would make up for the roughly 50 percent taxes the Midtown Manhattan resident would have to pay in federal state and city taxes. McConney wrote “180000 x 2 for taxes” in black pen on the bright white paper. On the witness stand he admitted the company was fine having it “grossed up” to ensure Cohen got his proper share.

The sham continued when tallying up Cohen’s bonus. Initially $50000 was marked as “paid to Red Finch for tech services” but that seemed to morph instead to mean $60000 for Cohen himself.

“Michael was complaining that his bonus wasn’t large enough. This was to make up for whatever he thought he was owed” McConney testified.

The total $420000 was then divided by 12 so that Cohen would get $35000 each month for a year. McConney’s notes of that meeting included a mention that stated “Mike to invoice us” the genesis of what prosecutors say would later be Cohen invoices for fake legal work that Trump gladly paid to keep the hush money deal under wraps.

Monday’s testimony also connected Trump directly to the process a major step forward in the case. Prosecutors showed jurors a copy of a March 28 2017 email in which McConney wrote “I’ll check status tomorrow. DJT needs to sign check.”

On the stand McConney explained that authorizing the money transfers would require having someone actually go to the White House have the then-president of the United States approve the payment himself—while he was president.

But in an instance that exemplifies the lack of intellectual rigor involved in this operation at least one of those checks disappeared on its way back north from Washington to New York City.

After three monthly payments to Cohen in January February and March McConney asked an employee in the Trump Organization accounting department Deborah Tarasoff to cancel a check cut in April that didn’t return.

“It looks like we never got a check back from the White House. It got lost somebody couldn’t find it. I guess it’s the same as lost” he testified.

Paperwork showed that after $105000 was paid by The Donald J. Trump Revocable Trust the bean counters back in Manhattan realized it would be easier to run the next $315000 in payments through Trump’s personal accounts for the rest of the year.

Matt Colangelo a prosecutor with the Manhattan District Attorney’s Office meticulously went through each of Cohen’s 12 invoices. Every month in 2017 Cohen would email Allen Weisselberg a disgraced accountant who was then the Trump Organization’s chief financial officer but has since been convicted of tax fraud and spent three months at New York’s dreaded Rikers Island jail. Cohen would deliver a curt greeting—mentioning some summer fun a hurricane hitting Weisselberg’s Florida home Thanksgiving the winter holidays—then get right down to business.

“Pursuant to the retainer agreement kindly remit payment for services rendered” Cohen would email Weisselberg each time proudly signing his emails: “Michael D. Cohen Esq. Personal Attorney to President Donald J. Trump.”

One by one Colangelo went over every monthly email attached invoice forwarded Weisselberg email and McConney’s copy over to Tarasoff. By the time they got to September McConney was starting to wear down.

“$35000” he said sounding increasingly tired of answering why he knew how much to pay despite there not being any dollar figure on the invoice for supposed legal work. The answer was always the same: that first meeting in January 2017.

“It’s an invoice from Michael Cohen” he groaned when discussing the October paperwork.

When Colangelo asked him to read the email McConney let out a mild whine. “The whole thing?” he asked.

“Why don’t we just do the body this time” Colangelo acquiesced.

The internal Trump corporate emails showed how invoices made their way from Cohen to Weisselberg to McConney to Tarasoff. And the chain would generally end the same way.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm55dGltZXMuY29tLzIwMjQvMDUvMDYvYXJ0cy9kZXNpZ24vaGFtbWVyLW11c2V1bS1hbm4tcGhpbGJpbi5odG1s0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,A Who's Who of L.A.'s Art World Bids Farewell to a Champion,"The actor Owen Wilson chatted with the artist Ed Ruscha.

Peyton Woodyard a four-star safety who committed to Alabama as part of its 2024 recruiting class in December and enrolled in the school for the spring semester entered the transfer portal in late April. He committed to the Ducks on Sunday. Woodyard is the second win for the Ducks this weekend as Michigan State transfer defensive tackle Derrick Harmon committed to the Ducks on Friday.

247Sports' recruiting analyst Greg Biggins describes Woodyard as ""a smart heady safety with an extremely high football IQ.""

Woodyard and Harmon are two massive additions for Oregon which now ranks second in the 247Sports transfer portal team rankings trailing only Ole Miss. The Ducks have added 14 players via the portal this offseason as they prepare for their first season in the Big Ten.

The biggest additions have been quarterback Dillon Gabriel from Oklahoma former five-star receiver Evan Stewart from Texas A&M and cornerback Jabbar Muhammad who helped rival Washington win the Pac-12 and reach the College Football Playoff title game last year. Then there's former five-star quarterback Dante Moore who comes to Oregon from UCLA. The Ducks are not just landing talent in the portal but plucking players from other top programs.

Ohio State is the favorite to win the Big Ten this season but even with Michigan coming off a national title many view the Ducks as the biggest threat to the Buckeyes in 2024. It would be a remarkable story for the Ducks to compete for a conference title in their first year in the league. It would certainly buck the trend of what normally happens when new schools enter one of the Power Four leagues but with the way Oregon has recruited at both the high school level as well as in the portal there may not be a team that's ever been in such a strong position to do so."

The suit claimed that a group of 50 plaintiffs identified as “Jane Does” were victims of sex trafficking facilitated by website Backpage including women who were allegedly sold for sex as minors via the site.

Backpage has been shut down by federal authorities and ex-CEO Carl Ferrer in 2018 pleaded guilty to conspiracy to facilitate prostitution; several Backpage-related corporate entities pleaded guilty to conspiracy to engage in money laundering. Backpage co-founders Michael Lacey and James Larkin and four former Backpage employees are charged with facilitating prostitution and money laundering in a federal case in Arizona that resulted in a mistrial in September over the prosecution’s conduct.

The lawsuit against Salesforce was first dismissed in March 2020 in San Francisco County Superior Court on the basis that Section 230 of the federal Communications Decency Act protects websites from liability for third-party conduct. The recent ruling in the California Court of Appeal’s First Appellate District dismissed the plaintiff’s appeal on the same basis.

Salesforce and Benioff did not respond to a request for comment.

“It’s the right conclusion” said Eric Goldman a Santa Clara University law professor who studies Section 230 issues. “The plaintiffs in this case are alleging that pimps engage in sex trafficking and that they were helped in doing so by running ads on Backpage and that Backpage was helped in its operations by Salesforce — the victims are three steps away from Salesforce.”

Courts are struggling to apply Section 230 and a Texas court recently ruled in a different lawsuit against Salesforce saying that Section 230 may not fully shield the company from legal liability Goldman said. “It’s a really murky area” Goldman said. “No single ruling is going to clean it up unless it’s from the Supreme Court.”

A lawyer for the plaintiffs whose firm sued Salesforce in the Texas case said they have not decided yet whether to appeal the ruling.

Jurgen Klopp has admitted Liverpool’s players took a little while to get back to their best after suffering with Covid-19.

The Reds were forced to close down the AXA Training Centre and cancel training earlier this month after a suspected outbreak.

And Virgil van Dijk Fabinho Curtis Jones Thiago Alcantara Alisson Roberto Firmino Joel Matip Kaide Gordon and Trent Alexander-Arnold have all had positive tests at some point in the past six weeks.

Klopp and his assistant manager Pep Lijnders also both tested positive over the festive period as Liverpool ended up having to postpone their Carabao Cup semi-final first-leg clash with Arsenal and field a number of youngsters against Shrewsbury Town in the FA Cup as a result.

Also losing Mohamed Salah Sadio Mane and Naby Keita to the Africa Cup of Nations performances have understandably been a little inconsistent in the past month.

But Klopp is hopeful his side are now over such a setback as he praised the work of Dr. Andreas Schlumberger the club's head of recovery and performance behind the scenes for ensuring the players are back to their best.

“The biggest difference was after Covid” the Reds boss told reporters. “That’s why I mention it. We still don’t understand it 100%.

“The boys weren’t always... I see when they can’t. It was the case in one or two games but it looks now like we’re over that as well.

“I’m really pleased with all the development especially with long-term injuries we now deal with them really well.

“Dr. Andreas Schlumberger is a massive help there. The structure he implemented is incredibly helpful. It’s good.”

Klopp then highlighted Van Dijk’s performances following his return from an ACL injury to demonstrate how Liverpool have benefitted from Schlumberger who joined the club at the end of 2020.

“I’m not surprised (by his performances) no” the German said. “It wasn’t a curve always going up there were little bumps in that. That’s normal.

“Virg had to learn to deal with a lot of things. Some physical things are just not available like they were before but they will come and came back. But it’s not from the first day so you have to adapt to these things.

“There are worries I had bad injuries myself and you cannot ignore that when you are an intelligent person. Virg obviously is and you cannot ignore everything and just say 'who cares?'

“The way back to your best is a bumpy one and he did exceptionally well.”",,,,,,,,,,,,

Citing three sources familiar with the matter Reuters said that Sycamore has reached out to inquire about buying Kohl’s in a bid to value it at around $9 billion.

The company is reportedly willing to pay at least $65 per share. However there’s currently no guarantee that Sycamore will make a bid or that there will be any deal to buy Kohl’s from either group.

Reuters writes that Sycamore’s interest in Kohl’s shows that there is ongoing interest in retailers. Brick-and-mortar stores have faced problems in the pandemic and seen power shifting to those who deal in eCommerce.

Additionally Kohl’s has seen pressure recently because of its share price troubles which only climbed 5% in the past year.

Macellum Advisors which owns 5% of Kohl’s stock said last week that the retailer should look at possibly selling or other strategic options. Macellum said it planned to nominate directors to its board. In December Engine Capital which owns 1% of Kohl’s stock said that it also wanted the company to consider a sale.

Kohl’s added three new directors to its board as of last year because of a settlement with Macellum and other activist investors.

PYMNTS recently reported about a $9 billion offer from Starboard-led Acacia Research who reportedly said it would be able to get financing from bankers for the bid — though again there wasn’t any assurance yet as to whether this would happen or whether Kohl’s would go for the deal.

Acacia is not terribly well known and has a market value of $215 million but the group told Kohl’s it had high confidence about being able to get a debt financing package for parts of the bid.

The group could also end up selling the company’s real estate to another party as a way to ease the transaction overall.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMinAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5ib3N0b24yNW5ld3MuY29tL25ld3MvbG9jYWwvYnJhaW50cmVlLXBvbGljZS1zb3V0aC1zaG9yZS1wbGF6YS1yZW9wZW4tc3VuZGF5LXNlYXJjaC1zdXNwZWN0LWNvbnRpbnVlcy1hZnRlci1zaG9vdGluZy9HTVdOQ1FDWVFCQklCQlBYVDRPNzZMQjJTQS_SAasBaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYm9zdG9uMjVuZXdzLmNvbS9uZXdzL2xvY2FsL2JyYWludHJlZS1wb2xpY2Utc291dGgtc2hvcmUtcGxhemEtcmVvcGVuLXN1bmRheS1zZWFyY2gtc3VzcGVjdC1jb250aW51ZXMtYWZ0ZXItc2hvb3RpbmcvR01XTkNRQ1lRQkJJQkJQWFQ0Tzc2TEIyU0EvP291dHB1dFR5cGU9YW1w?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Braintree Police: South Shore Plaza to reopen Sunday search for suspect continues after shooting,"We’re Sorry!

Hermon ski resort to close after busy weekend,"The Mount Hermon ski resort in the Golan Heights announced it will be closed on Sunday and Monday due to “weather conditions” following a busy weekend at the site.

There was heavy traffic on the roads leading to the resort Saturday which the site’s management blamed on visitors who wanted to ski without booking a pass in advance.

Thousands visited the site Saturday before management shuttered the gates at the usual 4 p.m. closing time.

Heavy snowfall is expected in the Golan Heights on Sunday and Monday according to the Israel Meteorological Service which also said light snow was possible on the high peaks of northern Israel.

The ski resort said it would update the public on when it expects to reopen in the coming days.

The authority said national parks at Yarkon Tel Afek Caesarea Beit Guvrin Migdal Tsedek along with the Banias Mount Arbel Ayun nature reserves were especially crowded.

A spokesperson for Urgences Santé says the ambulance service received a 911 call for a woman in her 60s lying outdoors near Berri-UQAM Metro station. Medics found the woman in cardiopulmonary arrest and she was pronounced dead shortly after.

It's still not clear whether the woman who has been identified as Stella Stosik by Sam Watts the CEO of Welcome Hall Mission died of the frigid temperatures or another health reason. Temperatures in the city dropped to –24 C early Thursday morning and felt colder with the wind.

Watts says Stosik used to stay at the hotel next to Place Émilie-Gamelin. It had been turned into a shelter last winter. But the shelter closed in July and he does not know where she went then.

WATCH | Mayor says there are better solutions:

Shelters are better options than letting homeless people sleep in metro stations says Montreal's mayor Duration 0:59 Valérie Plante says the city and various resources are trying their best to get homeless people out of the cold and into shelters as she opened a new shelter for Indigenous people at the former Hôtel des Arts in Montreal.

This is the second person without housing to die in 10 days. A 74-year-old man died in hospital after being found in a makeshift camp near an overpass in the Notre-Dame-de-Grâce neighbourhood during an extreme cold snap on Jan. 10.

The coroner's office will investigate both of the deaths.

A group advocating on behalf of people living on the street the Réseau d'aide aux personnes seules et itinérantes de Montréal (RAPSIM) asked the city on Friday to keep doors to Metro stations open overnight until the cold snap ends to allow people to seek shelter from the freezing temperatures.

'She was a beautiful lady'

Ann-Gaël Whiteman a coordinator at La rue des femmes fondly recalls the ""very tall slim"" Stosik telling stories of her childhood days as a ballerina.

""You could tell"" she said. ""She was a beautiful lady.""

Stosik had been taking refuge on emergency beds for the past 16 years and anchored herself at La rue des femmes a non-profit organization that helps women facing or experiencing homelessness.

""We were a family that was her home and she was in the process of healing"" said Whiteman.

Like many other women who frequent the two women's shelters run by the organization Stosik experienced trauma in her youth and found herself on the streets.

""It was quite a shock...to find out how she died"" said Whiteman.

The City of Montreal says there are 1900 places available for people experiencing homelessness but Whiteman says many of them aren't available due to severe staffing shortages and COVID-19 restrictions.

Whiteman is not sure if Stosik tried to get a bed at one of the shelters the night before she died but even if she had none were available.

""It's sad that we're becoming part of the problem when we're supposed to be there as a solution"" she said. ""It's on the backs of the shelters to decide who lives and who dies outside and it shouldn't be like that.""

Whiteman fears more people experiencing homelessness could die as temperatures continue to plummet and she hopes Stosik's death prompts the government to get people out of the cold once and for all.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMieGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRhaWx5bWFpbC5jby51ay90dnNob3diaXovYXJ0aWNsZS0xMDQzMDQ0My9Eci1BbGV4LUdlb3JnZS1kZWZpZXMtZmF0LXNoYW1lcnMtY2VsZWJyYXRvcnktc2hpcnRsZXNzLXNuYXAuaHRtbNIBfGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRhaWx5bWFpbC5jby51ay90dnNob3diaXovYXJ0aWNsZS0xMDQzMDQ0My9hbXAvRHItQWxleC1HZW9yZ2UtZGVmaWVzLWZhdC1zaGFtZXJzLWNlbGVicmF0b3J5LXNoaXJ0bGVzcy1zbmFwLmh0bWw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Dr. Alex George defies 'fat shamers' with a celebratory shirtless snap,"He's known to champion body positivity and mental well-being.

And Dr Alex George 30 defied his 'fat shaming' critics as he hit the gym and shared a celebratory shirtless snap on Saturday.

The former Love Island star declared that he was 'not ashamed anymore' after feeling embarrassed to exercise due to losing the six-pack he displayed on the ITV2 show.

'I am not ashamed anymore': Dr. Alex George 30 defied 'fat shaming' critics and hit the gym with a celebratory shirtless snap on Saturday

Posing in the mirror for a shirtless selfie he draped his shirt over his shoulder and smiled in the gym changing rooms.

Alongside the candid photo he penned: 'MOVEMENT IS FOR EVERY BODY. Fat shaming and weight stigma can be such a barrier to exercise. Over the years I have felt embarrassed and nervous to train in the gym when I'm bigger.

'I AM NOT ASHAMED ANYMORE. Don't forget that you deserve to be in that gym as much as anyone else. If people judge you for how you look that says far more about them than you. I know who I would rather be friends with.'

He later added another post to his Stories to thank his followers for their support and encouraging words.

The frontline medic found fame on Love Island back in 2018 a show that has been criticised for its lack of size diversity.

Dr. Alex was appointed as the Youth Mental Health Ambassador within the Department for Education in last year after his work to prioritise mental health.

Inspirational: Alongside the candid photo he penned: 'MOVEMENT IS FOR EVERY BODY. Fat shaming and weight stigma can be such a barrier to exercise'

Support: He later added another post to his Stories to thank his followers for their support and encouraging words

In an exclusive interview with MailOnline in November Alex remarked: 'If it's someone you wouldn't ask an opinion of why would you take the criticism?'

He explained how he harnesses social media in his fight to end the stigmas surrounding mental health and weight.

Alex added: 'Social media can be really powerful but you need to use it in the right way. I came off Twitter because I found it not to be helpful. It wasn't producing positive mental health.

'I use Instagram as my primary social media and of course Tik Tok and YouTube' he said.

Medication: Alex revealed that he is taking anxiety medication following the tragic death of his teenage brother last year

Following the tragic loss of his youngest brother Llŷr last July to suicide Alex admitted that he has been taking anxiety medication and has urged others to 'post their pills' in a bid to end the stigma.

Detailing his own mental health routine the Welshman explained: 'I focus on trying to do the little things. This morning I didn't get a chance to [go outside]. I noticed it doesn't get my day in the right rhythm and I didn't feel as good. I don't feel as clear or as calm.'

His evening regime often includes finding time to put down his phone and have a bath a luxury which Alex wallows in.

'If I didn't invest in myself I would feel so much worse' he added.

This comes as he previously shared a shirtless snap whilst on holiday in Mauritius in November in another empowering social media post.

Sharing a shirtless snap in his swimming trunks he penned: 'Define a BEACH BODY? Beach ✅ Body ✅ Be proud of the skin you live in.'

He went on to add: 'Zero shame x before playfully declaring: 'And yes I have factor 50 on'.

And when the company opens a Denver location later this year it will somehow be even bigger – literally.

According to an announcement this week Yardbird is slated to open this fall in the River North Arts District — at 26th and Blake in the Lot Twenty-Eight development — in a space that’s a whopping 13800 square feet inside with an additional 20000 square feet of outdoor space. The outside – lauded in a statement as the area’s “largest urban patio” – will feature a stage for live entertainment a full bar and a smoker.

The restaurant will be able to hold more than 500 patrons between its seats inside and out the announcement said.

“I instantly fell in love with Denver’s RiNo District and knew Yardbird with its combination of locally-sourced food in a warm and inviting industrial atmosphere was the perfect addition to the continually developing neighborhood” said John Kunkel CEO of owner/operator 50 Eggs Hospitality Group which also opened CHICA in Aspen in December.

Yardbird is known for serving upscale Southern food with an emphasis on fried chicken paired with a sizable menu of whiskey beer wine and other spirits. Bourbon fittingly is a staple of the beverage menu.

The Denver menu will feature some unique dishes that are still in development a spokesperson said but specialties like the St. Louis ribs ($36) and the lobster mac & cheese (market price) will make their way to the Mile High City. Another staple across the restaurant’s many locations is chicken and waffles which run $36 to $38 depending on the city where you dine. Upgrade to The Whole Bird a larger portion of the chicken and waffles and the price increases to $62-$68.

Denver will mark the eighth location when it opens this fall behind locations in Miami Las Vegas Dallas Washington D.C. Los Angeles Singapore and its newest restaurant in Chicago which is scheduled to open this summer.

After another few weeks to move into the building the store hopes to be ready for the public soon after that.

Frankoma Pottery Company is also looking for employees to work in the new factory. Anyone interested should contact Dennis Glascock at .

As EV sales grow year-over-year in the US and the rest of the world charging infrastructure is growing with it. In the US specifically certain states are far better equipped than others to support the rising number of EV drivers on their roads. Below is a breakdown of some of the best states for EV charging along with some of the… less than best.

Breaking down the US by EV charging

Anyone who has visited the US can attest that it’s a rather large country with 50+ cultural and economic identities. United federally but still independent locally these states are responsible for much of their own governing and decisions as it pertains to that specific state. This includes charging infrastructure.

As the number of electric vehicles on roads grows many states are not equipped with the charging network this zero-emission shift requires. On the flip side others are much better off to start. Factors such as size geography weather conditions and even culture have all had their affect on how quickly or slowly electrification has been adapted.

Some states are working tirelessly to keep up and others are not as focused since the number of EV sales remains a small percentage in comparison to ICE vehicles.

Additionally other states have the foresight to recognize this impending demand and have already begun implementing charging infrastructure in anticipation of an EV boom.

As you will see below there is more to this equation than simply how many EVs are on roads in a given state versus how many chargers are available (although we do share that data as well). Let’s break it down.

How data for best states for EV charging was found

To determine which states are truly the best for EV charging Zutobi released a detailed report using data from US government sites. We then took this same strategy and updated it using the most up-to-date stats.

For example the number of public charging outlets in each state is sourced from the US Department of Energy’s (DOE) Alternative Fuel Station Counts by State report. This report was last updated on November 8 2021. This number was based on the total number of charging outlets regardless of charging type (level 1 2 DC fast charge).

To best determine the number of EVs charging in each state the DOE’s Electric Vehicle Registrations by State was used. The data refers to the number of registered electric vehicles as of June 2021.

To calculate the total number of vehicles registered in each state we sourced data from the US Department of Transportation’s State Motor-Vehicle Registrations 2019. The data used was the number of private and commercially owned automobiles.

Lastly the number of EVs per mile in each state was calculated using US road data from 2019 gathered by the Institute for Policy & Social Research at University of Kansas. The total length of road (in miles) was divided by the number of EV charger outlets in each state to determine how far apart chargers theoretically are on average.

This is the most up-to-date data from the US government as of the time of this article’s publishing. We will update this information from time to time.

States with the most and least EV charging points

As you can see from the data below the number of registered EVs still pales in comparison compared to the overall number of registered vehicles for each state.

Based on sheer number of charging outlets alone the top three states in the US are California New York and Florida respectively.

This make sense given all three states’ geographical size and large populations in comparison to other states. Additionally California and Florida are also the top two states with both the most registered EVs and total vehicles overall. Texas comes in at third.

Conversely Alaska has the fewest total number of EV charging outlets followed by the Dakotas. We will give Alaska a pass since nearly 50% of the state remains uninhabited but North and South Dakota have some catching up to do. Wyoming and Montana do too.

If it wasn’t already clear by now California is leading the pack in nearly every category. But as you will see below that doesn’t necessarily make The Golden State the best to charge your EV in the future.

States with the most electric vehicles per public charger port

As previously stated the best states for charging your EV are determined by more than simply the number of charging outlets. Instead we have compared the number of available charging outlets against the number of registered EVs per state to analyze those ratios and see how they stack up.

This method showcases how equipped (or not) a given state is for EV charging based on how many EVs are theoretically fighting for a charger outlet.

1. New Jersey

New Jersey tops our list by nearly four more EVs per charger compared to second place. The Garden State has an impressive 30420 registered EVs chasing its neighbor New York which only leads by 2000 more. Despite its robust EV numbers the lack of charging is apparent – just 1638 chargers averaging over 18 EVs per charger in the state. Luckily New Jersey is in a great location in the Northeast. Try Pennsylvania or Delaware as backups.

2. Arizona

If you’re one of the 28k+ EV drivers in The Grand Canyon State you may have already noticed some infrastructural issues when trying to charge. The number of registered EVs in the state puts AZ in the top half of its US class but with less than 2000 charging ports available you may find yourself waiting to get a charge more often than in other states. Mathematically there are more than 14 EVs in the state per charger..

3. Hawaii

The scarcity of EV chargers at least in comparison to the number of EVs on the islands makes sense given the Aloha State’s geographical limitations. Despite being 2000 miles from the contiguous United States Hawaii still has more registered EVs (10670) than several other states combined. However with only 743 chargers available Hawaii residents also (theoretically) face over 14 EVs per charger. Not to mention that those 743 chargers exist across multiple islands.

States with the least EVs per charge port

Using the same method there are several states have a much better ratio of chargers to EVs. That being said many of the lower ratios are the result of both low EV registrations and limited chargers.

North Dakota offers the smallest ratio of EVs per charger at 1.67 which sounds pretty ideal for EV drivers in The Peace Garden State. The issue however is that there are only 220 of them.

South Dakota tells a similar tale with 410 registered EVs and only 148 chargers. That’s 2.77 EVs per.

Vermont touts higher registered EVs with 2230 and also has 834 charging ports. That equals a ratio of around 2.67 EVs per charger and a viable state to find an open port.

The best states for public charging points based on mileage

To keep things theoretical but expose how much charging infrastructure is lacking in most states we broke things down by mileage. We accomplished this by comparing the number of charging outlets available against how many miles of road exist in each state.

From here you can see the theoretical distance between each EV charger if you were to distribute them out equidistant across each state’s roads. Many distances are manageable but other states might require over 600 miles of range just to get you to your next charge.

1. Washington DC

Alright it’s technically not a state but it probably should be. DC is the home to the federal government and so much more. This includes 684 public charging ports across the district one every 2.2 miles. The data may be slightly skewed since DC only has about 1500 miles of roads. Even so DC has over 2300 registered EVs – that’s over 10x more than North Dakota.

2. California

The largest state on the left coast comes in at second on our list with an impressive ration given its sheer numbers. California remains years ahead of all states in current EV infrastructure having 180x more registered vehicles and 50x more charging outlets than DC. Its mileage ratio is simply more evidence of such as well. While The Golden State contains over 175000 miles of roadways one of its 34k+ EV chargers is theoretically available every 5.05 miles.

3. Hawaii

Entering the top three again is Hawaii. With such limited space (you know because of mountains and volcanoes) Hawaii only offers about 4500 miles of roads. Given its 743 chargers outlined above however EV drivers should theoretically find a charging port every 6.06 miles.

States with the most spread-out charging points

While the states listed above may still have some work to do for future charging infrastructure their current ratio has them on the right path to support more electric vehicle transitions at least in manageable proximity. The following states are not so well equipped.

Montana has the third-largest distance between EV chargers – about 359 miles between each of the 205 charging ports in the state spread out evenly across the 73647 miles of Big Sky Country.

South Dakota blows that distance out of the water. With only 148 public chargers and nearly 82000 miles of roadways The Mount Rushmore State theoretically has nearly 554 miles between each charging pile.

Last and opposite of least is Dakota’s top half. North Dakota offers slightly more roads (~89000 miles) compared to South Dakota but only has 132 public chargers within its state lines. That’s a distance of 668 miles between chargers. Unfortunately there is not an EV in existence that can travel that distance on a single charge… at least not yet.

What are the best states to charge your EV?

If you take all the ratios out of the equation the best place to currently charge your electric vehicle is California by a long shot. That’s based on the mere fact that the state is currently home to nearly 35000 chargers and growing by the day.

That being said it also has the highest number of EVs in the country so there will be more people looking to charge up too. Thanks to idle fees and DC supercharging your chances of finding an open charger nearby are still pretty good.

North Dakota has the best ratio of chargers to EVs but those numbers don’t hold much water since US EV adoption is its most anemic in Roughrider Country.

Washington DC seems well equipped to handle growing EV drivers and currently has the closest ratio of EV chargers per capita albeit a tiny sample map compared to any actual state. Vermont and Massachusetts have some decent averages across the board although neither were in the top (or bottom) three states in any category.

Other sites have done similar comparisons and have used their data to create a scoring system. This report from Bumper has some of the same data plus a lot more. Check it out to see how your state stacks up in their scoring system.

Charging infrastructure in the US looking forward

President Joe Biden has been busy during his first year in office. First he vowed to make the nation’s entire federal fleet all electric. That hasn’t quite gone to plan yet. However the White House has already introduced two bills to reform the federal tax credit for EVs.

This will expand thresholds on the number of EVs manufacturers like Tesla and GM have surpassed to once again qualify for federal tax credits.

The recently passed 1.2 trillion infrastructure bill promises $7.5 billion to help establish a nationwide network of EV charging stations plus an additional $65 billion to be invested in clean energy and renewables for the US electricity grid.

As the number of electric vehicles undoubtedly grows in each state some will be better prepared than others. States like California and Florida for example are implementing charging outlets step for step with the growing number of EV sales.

Other states like Vermont and Massachusetts may not have the largest number of EVs within their state lines but if they were to continue installing chargers at the same pace they would easily stay ahead of the game on infrastructure.

Other states like the Dakotas are not so well prepared. Sure they don’t have as many EVs to worry about charging just yet but the next decade will transform our vehicle landscape and there will need to be resources in place to keep these vessels charged.

Including DC the US alone has over 1 million EVs registered and over 110000 public chargers. Not bad but there’s certainly room for growth. Especially since EVs still only account for roughly 1% of vehicles on US roads.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiaWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lmxvc2NlcnJpdG9zbmV3cy5uZXQvMjAyMi8wMS8yMy9jb21wYW55LXdpbGwtb2ZmZXItd2VpZ2h0bGVzcy1mbGlnaHRzLWZyb20tbG9uZy1iZWFjaC1haXJwb3J0L9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Company Will Offer Weightless Flights From Long Beach Airport,"Company Will Offer Weightless Flights From Long Beach Airport

G-FORCE ONE a specially modified Boeing 727 offers the experience of weightlessness to the public.

January 23 2022

By Laurie Hanson

Weightlessness is not only for astronauts in space but can now be experienced by the public at Long Beach Airport with the Zero-G Experience® coming on Feb. 11.

“The experience offered by Zero-Gravity Corporation is the only commercial opportunity on earth for individuals to experience true ‘weightlessness’ without going to space” said CEO Matt Gohd. “The Zero-G Experience® and The Big Game have teamed up for a one-of-a-kind opportunity to experience true weightlessness.” This happens over a period of 5 hours onboard G-FORCE ONE a specially modified Boeing 727-200 as it makes 15 parabolic maneuvers.

As a modified Boeing 727-200 the G-FORCE ONE’s upgraded hydraulic system allows for continuous hydraulic pressure during parabolic performance. This modification along with the addition of accelerometers in the cockpit were evaluated and approved by the FAA. No structural modifications were made to the aircraft’s interior or exterior according to Gohd.

“What excites me the most is creating history the history that family who took this [flight] together and will remember it forever the history the company has made by flying Stephen Hawking taking 12 exceptional individuals that were severely disabled and giving them the dream of space” he said. “[A] history in the research we enable and [how] it is accessible at a fraction of the cost of others.”

Gohd went to work for the corporation two years and two months ago and was attracted to the Zero-Gravity Corporation’s attention to detail excellent service and quality of experience they provide.

“Combined with the exciting history behind it it has set the foundation for exhilarating adventure-based tourism” he added.

As a child Gohd was a self-described science and space nerd who built big telescopes and loved the stars and Star Trek. He said he began in the business of flight and space travel with a “wonderful team and amazing people” while asking many questions every day.

“My career was in finance where I helped small companies become bigger and with age accumulated wisdom which made me a good problem-solver” he added. Though the company was in significant distress and about to close its doors when Gohd brought onboard Zero-G he was not discouraged.

“What motivates me is a company that impacts those with dreams the ability to further research critical to the pursuit of space and creating value for my dedicated employees who are all stakeholders as well as investors who have entrusted me with their capital” explained Gohd.

The company had already survived 11 years of FAA safety regulation and procedural scrutiny. But finally Zero-G’s three co-founders Dr. Peter H. Diamandis Dr. Byron K. Lichtenberg (a veteran astronaut) and Ray Cronise (a NASA engineer) got approval for G-FORCE ONE to take passengers on commercial parabolic flights.

By August 2004 Zero-G flew its first commercial flight operating under the same safety standards of all major air carriers. It established its own place in the extreme tourism industry as the first and only commercial zero-gravity flight for the public. As of April 2006 Zero-G became the first commercial company to gain permission from the Kennedy Space Center to use the shuttle runway and landing facilities to operate its weightless flights.

“We started flying out of Long Beach a few years ago but have had a presence on the West Coast since our inception” Gohd said. “We will be flying out of Long Beach and Oakland Las Vegas Austin and Houston TX the Kennedy Space Center Miami FL and New York NY. We anticipate flying 2-3 times per week in 2022.”

“Zero-G has provided thousands of individuals the opportunity to experience weightlessness including Stephen Hawking Martha Stewart and Buzz Aldrin” he added. “Zero-G not only caters to private clients but various organizations as well. The National Geographic Nick News and Discovery Channel have all flown on G-FORCE ONE. We’ve also been featured on NBC’s The Today Show Biggest Loser and The Apprentice.”

“The interior of G-FORCE ONE has been altered to allow for maximum floating space” he said. “Seats are in the rear of the plane. The floating area is divided into sections and padded from floor to ceiling with one rope running down each side of the plane. To board G-FORCE ONE stairs open from the tail of the aircraft into the seating area.”

ZERO-GRAVITY CORPORATION brings the astronaut experience of weightlessness to the masses at Long Beach and other cities in the U.S. Clients can experience 15 parabolic flight maneuvers which catapult them floating 30 seconds at a time in mid-air

Pilots are specially trained to fly the Boeing 727 in a parabolic maneuver according to Gohd.

During a parabolic flight the aircraft is brought into an angle that allows the suppression of lift and fall into free fall such as how satellites stay in position. Parabola flights otherwise known as “Vomit Comets” were used to train astronauts in how to move in weightlessness before going to space. Swimming pools helped complete their training prior to missions aboard the International Space Station.

Typically astronauts experienced weightlessness through plunging arcs with about 30 or 40 chances to float while the airplane drops to a lower altitude according to www.spacelegalissues.com/a-history -of-vomit-comets/.

NASA has also historically used parabolic flights to run experiments in weightlessness. In 1959 their “Reduced Gravity” research program flew several aircraft over the years including the now famous and retired KC-135A aircraft. The agency currently offers flight opportunities with the Zero-G Corporation who provides research and educational flights besides commercial flights.

“Each of Zero-G’s recreational flights consists of around 15 parabolas including simulations of the gravity levels of the Moon and Mars as well as complete weightlessness. This profile allows clients to enjoy weightlessness with minimal motion discomfort” according to www.gozerog.com

Microgravity flights have also been used in the film industry. Actors of the movie “Apollo 13” (Tom Hanks Kevin Bacon and Bill Paxton) were on the KC-135A parabola flights in the 1990s. The set was created from the inside of the airplane to look like a spacecraft interior. Within seconds of scenes being portrayed cameras captured shots of weightlessness on film. For “Apollo 13” Director Ron Howard for months leased the aircraft to capture all the zero-gravity shots.

Zero-Gravity Corporation is a privately held space entertainment and tourism company whose mission is to make the excitement and adventure of space accessible to the public. Anyone can fly onboard a Zero-G flight. If anyone has any health concerns it’ recommended that they contact their doctor for guidance.

For the price of $8200 per person clients can expect to be weightless for 30 seconds at time 15 times for a total of 6-7 minutes of total weightless time.

“We can fly 28 passengers at a time and there are exclusive group prices” Gohd said. “Take a look at our upcoming cities and see where you can float with us!”

“The interior of G-FORCE ONE has been altered to allow for maximum floating space” he said. “Seats are in the rear of the plane. The floating area is divided into sections and padded from floor to ceiling with one rope running down each side of the plane. To board G-FORCE ONE stairs open from the tail of the aircraft into the seating area.”

ZERO-GRAVITY CORPORATION brings the astronaut experience of weightlessness to the masses at Long Beach and other cities in the U.S. Clients can experience 15 parabolic flight maneuvers which catapult them floating 30 seconds at a time in mid-air

Pilots are specially trained to fly the Boeing 727 in a parabolic maneuver according to Gohd.

During a parabolic flight the aircraft is brought into an angle that allows the suppression of lift and fall into free fall such as how satellites stay in position. Parabola flights otherwise known as “Vomit Comets” were used to train astronauts in how to move in weightlessness before going to space. Swimming pools helped complete their training prior to missions aboard the International Space Station.

Typically astronauts experienced weightlessness through plunging arcs with about 30 or 40 chances to float while the airplane drops to a lower altitude according to www.spacelegalissues.com/a-history -of-vomit-comets/.

NASA has also historically used parabolic flights to run experiments in weightlessness. In 1959 their “Reduced Gravity” research program flew several aircraft over the years including the now famous and retired KC-135A aircraft. The agency currently offers flight opportunities with the Zero-G Corporation who provides research and educational flights besides commercial flights.

“Each of Zero-G’s recreational flights consists of around 15 parabolas including simulations of the gravity levels of the Moon and Mars as well as complete weightlessness. This profile allows clients to enjoy weightlessness with minimal motion discomfort” according to www.gozerog.com

Microgravity flights have also been used in the film industry. Actors of the movie “Apollo 13” (Tom Hanks Kevin Bacon and Bill Paxton) were on the KC-135A parabola flights in the 1990s. The set was created from the inside of the airplane to look like a spacecraft interior. Within seconds of scenes being portrayed cameras captured shots of weightlessness on film. For “Apollo 13” Director Ron Howard for months leased the aircraft to capture all the zero-gravity shots.

Zero-Gravity Corporation is a privately held space entertainment and tourism company whose mission is to make the excitement and adventure of space accessible to the public. Anyone can fly onboard a Zero-G flight. If anyone has any health concerns it’ recommended that they contact their doctor for guidance.

For the price of $8200 per person clients can expect to be weightless for 30 seconds at time 15 times for a total of 6-7 minutes of total weightless time.

“We can fly 28 passengers at a time and there are exclusive group prices” Gohd said. “Take a look at our upcoming cities and see where you can float with us!”

Stanley Black & Decker (SWK 1.41%) a leader in tools and storage solutions released its first-quarter earnings on May 2 showcasing resilience amid economic fluctuations. The company reported an adjusted earnings per share (EPS) of $0.56 slightly above the expected $0.55. Despite a 1.5% drop in revenue from the previous year total revenue of $3.87 billion was likewise better than the consensus forecast for $3.83 billion.

Metric Q1 2024 Q1 2024 Analysts Estimate Q1 2023 % Change Adjusted EPS $0.56 $0.55 ($0.41) N/A Revenue $3.87 billion $3.83 billion $3.93 billion (1.5%) Gross margin 28.6% N/A 21.2% 7.4 percentage points

The core of the operation

Stanley Black & Decker has cemented its place as a cornerstone in the tools and outdoor equipment industry. With renowned brands like DeWalt and Craftsman as well as its namesake marques the company thrives on innovation quality and operational excellence. Its focus has sharply turned toward optimizing supply chains reducing costs and innovating on the product front as key strategies for sustainable growth.

In the earnings release the company described consumer demand for its products in Q1 as ""muted"" and noted that volumes also fell on the infrastructure side of the business.

However the company's adept maneuvering through cost-reduction initiatives and strategic portfolio adjustments speaks to its resilience. That cost-cutting program which saved it $145 million in the quarter is expected to yield $1.5 billion in savings by the end of 2024 and $2 billion by the end of 2025.

Quarterly highlights

Despite a sales dip in its tools and outdoor segment brand strength in DeWalt partially offset sluggish demand. The smaller industrial segment faced steeper sales declines with volumes falling even as it raised prices. Meanwhile gross margin improved thanks to reduced shipping costs and inventory destocking efforts.

Looking ahead

Management's reiteration of its 2024 guidance implies confidence in the company's strategic direction with expectations of sustained operational and margin improvements. Adjusted EPS is forecast to land between $3.50 and $4.50 with free cash flow of $600 million to $800 million.

Investors are encouraged to monitor the company's progress in its global cost reduction program and its investments in innovation and growth initiatives. These areas crucial for long-term value creation embody Stanley Black & Decker's strategic pillars for navigating future market dynamics.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiT2h0dHBzOi8vZmluYW5jZS55YWhvby5jb20vbmV3cy9kZWNvZGluZy1zdGFubGV5LWJsYWNrLWRlY2tlci1pbmMtMDUxNDExOTgyLmh0bWzSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Decoding Stanley Black & Decker Inc (SWK): A Strategic SWOT Insight,"Comprehensive SWOT analysis based on Stanley Black & Decker Inc's latest SEC 10-Q filing.

Detailed financial overview and strategic insights into the company's operations and market positioning.

Expert assessment of potential challenges and growth prospects for Stanley Black & Decker Inc.

On May 2 2024 Stanley Black & Decker Inc (NYSE:SWK) filed its 10-Q report with the SEC providing a snapshot of the company's financial health and strategic direction. As a leading manufacturer of hand and power tools SWK operates primarily in two segments: Tools and Outdoor and Industrial. The company has shown resilience in a competitive market with a strong brand portfolio that includes DEWALT CRAFTSMAN and BLACK+DECKER. The financial overview from the filing reveals a year-to-date cost of sales totaling $2761.0 million a decrease from the previous year's $3096.3 million indicating improved cost management. Interest expenses have slightly increased to $131.5 million from $130.9 million. The company has also reported a net gain on cash flow hedges albeit minimal and continues to manage its defined benefit pension items with a net of tax amortization of $(2.1) million. These figures set the stage for a deeper dive into SWK's SWOT analysis providing investors with a clearer picture of the company's internal dynamics and external environment.

Decoding Stanley Black & Decker Inc (SWK): A Strategic SWOT Insight

Strengths

Brand Power: Stanley Black & Decker Inc's brand strength is a significant asset. The company's portfolio includes some of the most recognized names in the tool industry such as DEWALT CRAFTSMAN and BLACK+DECKER. These brands are synonymous with quality and reliability which has helped SWK maintain a loyal customer base and command premium pricing. The brand power is further evidenced by the company's ability to sustain revenue generation with the Tools & Outdoor segment contributing the lion's share of total revenues amounting to $13.4 billion in 2023.

Operational Efficiency: SWK's commitment to operational excellence is evident in its supply chain transformation initiatives. The company has generated approximately $145 million in pre-tax run-rate savings during the first three months of 2024 driven by lower headcount indirect spend reductions and supply chain efficiencies. This focus on cost control and operational streamlining positions SWK to improve its gross margins and enhance profitability in the long term.

Weaknesses

Market Demand Sensitivity: The company's performance is closely tied to market demand which can be volatile. In the first quarter of 2024 SWK experienced a 1% decline in volume in the Tools & Outdoor segment attributed to a muted market demand backdrop. This sensitivity to economic cycles and consumer spending patterns can lead to fluctuations in revenue and profitability making it challenging to maintain consistent growth.

Story continues

Legal and Compliance Risks: Stanley Black & Decker Inc faces ongoing legal and compliance risks as highlighted by the potential $32 million civil penalty for alleged untimely reporting related to product recalls. Additionally the company is cooperating with investigations into transactions that may raise compliance questions under the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA). These issues not only pose financial risks but can also impact the company's reputation and investor confidence.

Opportunities

Innovation and Product Development: SWK plans to invest between $300 million to $500 million in innovation and commercial investments through 2025 to accelerate organic growth. This strategic focus on innovation presents an opportunity to develop new products and technologies that can meet evolving customer needs and expand market share particularly in high-growth areas such as cordless and smart tools.

Geographic Expansion: With a majority of revenue derived from the United States SWK has significant opportunities to expand its international presence. The company's established brands provide a strong foundation to grow in emerging markets where demand for quality tools and outdoor equipment is increasing. Strategic partnerships and acquisitions could further facilitate international expansion and diversification of revenue streams.

Threats

Competitive Pressure: The tool industry is highly competitive with numerous players vying for market share. SWK must continuously innovate and differentiate its products to stay ahead of competitors. Price competition particularly from lower-cost manufacturers can erode margins and market position if not effectively managed.

Supply Chain Disruptions: Global supply chain challenges including material shortages and transportation bottlenecks pose a threat to SWK's ability to meet customer demand and maintain operational efficiency. While the company is undertaking a supply chain transformation it remains vulnerable to external disruptions that could impact production and delivery timelines.

In conclusion Stanley Black & Decker Inc (NYSE:SWK) demonstrates strong brand equity and operational efficiency as key strengths while facing challenges related to market demand sensitivity and legal risks. Opportunities for growth through innovation and geographic expansion are promising but the company must navigate competitive pressures and supply chain vulnerabilities. As SWK continues its strategic focus on cost reduction and product development it is well-positioned to leverage its strengths and capitalize on market opportunities despite the potential threats in its operating environment.

Non-GAAP Financial Measures

Organic revenue or organic sales is defined as the difference between total current and prior year sales less the impact of companies acquired and divested in the past twelve months and any foreign currency impacts. Organic revenue growth organic sales growth or organic growth is organic revenue or organic sales divided by prior year sales. Gross profit is defined as sales less cost of sales. Gross margin is gross profit as a percentage of sales. Segment profit is defined as sales less cost of sales and selling general and administrative (""SG&A"") expenses (aside from corporate overhead expense). Segment margin is segment profit as a percentage of sales. EBITDA is earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization. EBITDA margin is EBITDA as a percentage of sales. Gross profit gross margin SG&A segment profit segment margin EBITDA and EBITDA margin are adjusted for certain gains and charges such as supply chain transformation costs acquisition and divestiture-related items asset impairments restructuring and other adjusting items. Management uses these metrics as key measures to assess the performance of the Company as a whole as well as the related measures at the segment level. Adjusted earnings per share or adjusted EPS is diluted GAAP EPS excluding certain gains and charges. Free cash flow is defined as cash flow from operations less capital and software expenditures. Management considers free cash flow an important indicator of its liquidity as well as its ability to fund future growth and to provide a return to the shareowners and is useful information for investors. Free cash flow does not include deductions for mandatory debt service other borrowing activity discretionary dividends on the Company's common stock and business acquisitions among other items. Free cash flow conversion is defined as free cash flow divided by net income. The Non-GAAP statement of operations and business segment information is reconciled to GAAP on pages 12 through 14 and in the appendix to the earnings conference call slides available at http://www.stanleyblackanddecker.com/investors. The Company considers the use of the Non-GAAP financial measures above relevant to aid analysis and understanding of the Company's results business trends and outlook measures aside from the material impact of certain gains and charges and ensures appropriate comparability to operating results of prior periods.

The Company also provides expectations for the non-GAAP financial measures of adjusted EPS presented on a basis excluding certain gains and charges as well as free cash flow. Forecasted adjusted EPS is reconciled to GAAP EPS on page 4. Due to high variability and difficulty in predicting items that impact cash flow from operations a reconciliation of forecasted free cash flow to its most directly comparable GAAP estimate has been omitted. The Company believes such a reconciliation would also imply a degree of precision that is inappropriate for this forward-looking measure.

and non-cash asset write-downs of $42.2 million (predominantly tooling raw materials and WIP).











3 Strategic Sourcing & Operational Excellence costs in 2023 primarily relate to third-party consultant fees to provide expertise in identifying and

Here's why we bought the dip,"Stanley Black & Decker overcame a soft demand environment to deliver a top and bottom line beat Thursday but the stock is falling because the toolmaker simply reiterated its guidance. That's a fate shared by home-improvement peers and many other companies this earnings season. We added to our position on the pullback. Revenue fell 2% year over year in the January-to-March period to $3.87 billion edging out the $3.82 billion expected by analysts according to estimates compiled by LSEG. Adjusted earnings per share came in at 56 cents topping the 54-cent estimate LSEG data showed. Stanley Black & Decker Why we own it: Stanley Black & Decker is in the later innings of a multi-year restructuring plan. The company launched a series of initiatives designed to generate cost savings optimize inventory streamline and simplify the organization and transform its supply chain. Although repair and remodeling demand environment is soft due to higher interest rates management's cost-cutting plan will create a stronger company for the next cycle. As we wait for the turnaround to play out we're getting paid a hefty dividend. Competitors: Bosch Techtronic Industries and Illinois Tool Works Most recent buy: May 2 2024 Initiation: June 14 2023 Bottom Line Stanley Black & Decker turned in another solid quarter of execution on matters within management's control. It's making good on its plan of optimizing expensive inventory reducing complexities and improving its supply chain to reach $2 billion in annual cost savings by the end of 2025. The progress is evident in the results with adjusted gross margins continuing to improve. The one problem is the broader demand environment is still mostly soft preventing management from raising the midpoint of its outlook. Given the stock's lackluster year-to-date performance we would have thought investor expectations had come down enough to be satisfied with a beat and backing of guidance. However there's always someone with their expectations too high. That's pushing the stock down more than 7%. Stanley Black & Decker's professional customers remain resilient but demand from do-it-yourself customers has not returned to growth. This should be largely understood and we expect to hear similar rhetoric when Home Depot and Lowe's report their earnings later this month. We probably won't see DIY activity meaningfully rebound until mortgage rates come down and reinvigorate the existing home sales market. We focus on existing home sales because the first thing people typically do after buying an older home is spend money on repair and remodeling projects. This dynamic makes Stanley Black & Decker one of the more interest-rate-sensitive stocks we have in the portfolio. We don't want to have too many of them in this ""higher for longer"" environment but at least with Stanley Black & Decker our patience is being rewarded with hefty dividend yield of about 3.80%. The thesis may be taking longer to play out but what management is doing to take out costs in the soft environment will make its earnings power look more impressive once the cycle turns. We are lowering our price target to $105 from $110 because rate cut expectations keep getting pushed out extending the timing of the DIY market recovery. But we are reiterating our 1 rating and bought this pullback earlier Thursday. Quarterly commentary Stanley Black & Decker's largest segment by far — known as Tools & Outdoor — generated sales of $3.29 billion in the quarter topping the $3.27 billion expected by analysts according to FactSet. However operating income of $279 million slightly missed analyst projections of $286 million per FactSet. Volume growth of 1% in the company's flagship DeWalt power tools could not overcome a muted consumer and a soft do-it-yourself environment which pressured sales for hand tools. Outdoor organic revenue was up 2% in the quarter mostly driven by demand for handheld cordless outdoor power equipment. Pricing was flat which we think is a positive because it shows the company isn't cutting prices to spur demand. Once you give up price in this business it's very hard to get it back. Sales in Stanley Black & Decker's smaller Industrial segment— largely made up of fasteners in end markets such as automotive and aerospace — totaled $585 million in the period missing the $596 million estimate according to FactSet. Quarterly operating income in the segment of $71 million topped estimates at $63 million according to FactSet. Organic sales fell 4% partially offset by a 1% price increase across the segment. Within the segment its so-called Engineered Fastening business saw organic revenues grow 5% thanks to a 30% increase in aerospace and a 4% increase in automotive. As a reminder Stanley completed the divestiture of its Infrastructure business on April 1 for $760 million in cash. Net proceeds from the sale were used to reduce short-term debt in the second quarter. The company's adjusted gross margin performance of 29.0% was a solid mark improving 590 basis points compared with last year and exceeding expectations of 28.7%. The result keeps the business on track to achieve its goal of about 30% over the full year. The gross margin improvements were driven by lower inventory destocking costs supply chain transformation benefits and reduced shipping costs. Free cash flow was negative which is typical with first-quarter seasonality. However the result was a little better than expected due to inventory control. The company's capital deployment priorities this year are to invest in organic growth fund the dividend and strengthen the balance sheet. Stanley Black & Decker has been paying a dividend for 147 consecutive years with increases in each of the past 56. Guidance Management made no real changes to its 2024 guidance. It still expects total company organic sales to be relatively unchanged plus or minus low single digits. At the segment level organic sales in Tools & Outdoor are projected to be relatively flat at the midpoint while Industrial is expected to be relatively flat to slightly positive. Margins at Tools & Outdoors are expected to improve year over year while Industrial is expected to remain flat. Management continues to expect adjusted EPS to be between $3.50 to $4.50. Considering the stock sell-off Wall Street must have been looking for some signaling that earnings were trending toward the higher end of the range based on the consensus forecast of $4.14. This was way too optimistic. This modeling came well before the market erased its expectations for multiple interest rate cuts this year. While Stanley's wide earnings range leaves us ambiguity into the rest of the year CFO Patrick Hallinan said he believes the midpoint of the range can be achieved due to costs controls. Meanwhile management reiterated its full-year adjusted free cash flow of $600 million and $800 million. In addition the company expects gross margins to increase sequentially in both halves of 2024 and total 30% for the full year. Gross margins are expected to be in the low 30s exiting the year setting up 2025 for another year of strong year-over-year earnings expansion even if the demand environment stays tepid. The company's long-term adjusted gross margin target of 35% is supported by the $2 billion in annual cost savings it expects by the end of next year. ""We remain confident that our transformation can support the sustainable cost structure and efficiency needed to return our adjusted gross margin to 35% or greater while enabling targeted growth investments"" Hallinan said.

Some of the users wondered if the consumer Protection Agency has the authority to interfere and ban the sudden and high rising in the prices.

“I know that some may thing that the coffee prices may not be an essential or strategic products to discuss their prices however these prices cannot be changing randomly.” One of the users wrote on Facebook.





Due to the hike in its coffee prices social media users started to make comparison between the American brand coffee’s quality and other brands including Egyption ones saying that there are more cheaper places and even selling a more delicious coffee than Starbucks’s famous’s one.

A debate broke out about the reason of the hike as some said that it came as a result of the internarial raising in coffee prices however others said that this was not true and that the raising was completely random and for no reason.

According to Blomberg the global market is expecting shortages in the coffee corps during 2022. It was added that the production is expected to fall 1.4 million bags short of demand in the season that starts in October in most countries.

The pay-it-forward phenomenon at the Starbucks drive-thru involves each driver paying for the order for the driver behind them. In 2014 Starbucks customers at a location in St. Petersburg Florida kept the chain going for 11 hours starting at 7 a.m. and ending at 6 p.m. Employee Vu Nguyen was working the drive-thru window that day and told each customer that pulled up that their order had been paid for by the person before them asking them if they'd like to pay it forward. In all a whopping 378 customers participated until someone refused to pay for the drink behind them (via USA Today).

The idea behind paying it forward is rooted in kindness but what are the limits? One customer took to TikTok to share that they had broken a Starbucks pay-it-forward chain because while their order was $6 the person behind them had an order that cost $46. ""How y'all feel about this am I wrong?

Looking at the game’s massive success the devs launched a lot of sequels Animal Crossing: New Horizons being the latest one. And in that game recently one Reddit user has shared something mind-blowing that is indicative of the popularity of this gaming franchise.

According to this Reddit user there’s a Starbucks in the Montgomery region of the United States that serves a few Animal Crossing-based drinks. It’s an amusing gesture. Moreover this Starbucks also features a menu that has the image of the game’s iconic character Brewster which is just amazing.

The pricing of all the drinks on this menu is also based on the game’s currency Bells. Apart from this the menu also features some references to the game’s dialogues like “Coo.” If possible all the fans of this iconic game should visit this Starbucks once in their lifetime.

“You go back to your childhood” the Minnesota State sophomore center said.

So as the snow piled up on the rink on Saturday night so did the goals for Silye and No. 2-ranked Minnesota State.

Playing in what he called a “picture-perfect” setting Silye scored his first collegiate hat trick and led the Mavericks to a 7-1 CCHA victory over St. Thomas. The flakes swirled around the Minnesota State University campus throughout the evening creating a snow-globe scene for the 2022 edition of what’s almost become a state holiday in the State of Hockey.

“As challenging as it was I don’t think I would change it” said Silye a Amprior Ontario native who transferred to Minnesota State from Clarkson last summer.

Julian Napravnik had a goal and an assist for the Mavericks. Nathan Smith Sam Morton and Ryan Sandelin also scored goals. Jack McNeely and Cade Borchardt each had a pair of assists.

Although attendance wasn’t announced on Saturday it’s estimated that more than 10000 people were present throughout the event filling the stands for the first Hockey Day Minnesota played on a college campus and in a football stadium. The Mavericks-Tommies game was also the first Division I men’s game played outdoors and televised on Hockey Day.

“To be part of this was pretty special for so many people” Mavericks coach Mike Hastings said. “It was a good night on the rink and an incredible event.”

Following a pair of high school games snow began falling about an hour before the Mavericks and Tommies squared off and it continued throughout the evening. Pucks cut through the snow creating “rooster tails” behind them. Each media timeout was extended as Mankato high school players and others shoveled off the sheet as best they could. By the third period the piles got more and more difficult for them to push.

“The shovelers started getting gassed in the third” Hastings said. “The guys on the bench were appreciative of what was going on.”

It also got more difficult for goalies and other players to see pucks as they buried themselves in the drifts.

“The coach in me didn’t (like it)” Hastings said. “But the hockey guy in me did.”

Early on it seemed like the snow might equalize the playing surface between the best team in the state and the newest one. In their first three meetings this season the Mavericks (23-5-0 17-3-0 in CCHA) outscored the Tommies 19-1.

But MSU slogged through the snow and found ways to make plays and get pucks to the net outshooting St. Thomas 32-7. Silye scored the game’s first two goals at 8:54 and 11:08 of the first period.

The Tommies didn’t have a shot on goal in the first period but they made their first count in the second as Tim Piechowski made it 2-1 at 1:52. They nearly tied it a bit later but Piechowski put a shot off the right post.

It was all Minnesota State from that point on however as it scored three times in second and two more in the third including Sandelin’s goal just 17 seconds into the final frame. Silye finished off his hat trick at 8:39. It was the fifth hat trick of the season for the Mavericks.

“It was awesome being part of it” St. Thomas coach Rico Blasi said. “The snow the cold — it’s the way it’s supposed to be.”

This week McKay was named one of 28 goalies on the watch list for the Richter Award which goes to the top goaltender in Division I men’s hockey. McKay was a finalist for the award the last two seasons. The Richter committee will trim the last to about 15 names over the next two weeks.

Michigan Tech’s Blake Pietila is the only other CCHA player on the watch list.

For St. Thomas Peter Thome made 18 saves before turning the net over to Jacob Berger in the third. Berger started his career at Minnesota State before transferring to St. Thomas in 2020.

Jutting returns

Minnesota State alumni played on the Blakeslee rink during Friday night’s Hockey Day Minnesota festivities and the game featured 40 former Mavericks including retired NHL players David Backes Ryan Carter and Tim Jackman.

But the highlight might have been the return of Troy Jutting MSU’s head coach from 2000 to 2012. Jutting who also played for the Mavericks and was a longtime assistant coach under Don Brose had not been back around his old program since being dismissed in 2012.

“It’s been awesome to see all the guys” Jutting said. “There are guys here I played with guys I coached guys I recruited and guys I knew who came before me as a player.”

Cohen the president of development for the apartment complex’s Boston-based owner Beacon Communities will be joined by Erie Mayor Joe Schember representatives from Erie Insurance and other local officials on Monday afternoon to officially launch the $27 million project.

Upgrades proposed:New entrance 2-story addition part of $25 million renovation plan at Erie's Richford Arms

The event will take place at 2:30 p.m. at the Erie Art Museum’s Holstein Gallery 20 E. Fifth St. which is near the 100-unit Richford Arms building at 515 State St.

Beacon Communities’ plan for upgrades at Richford Arms — which provides affordable housing to low- and moderate-income downtown residents — are fueled by a $3.5 million low-interest loan from Erie Insurance the Fortune 500 company whose downtown campus is adjacent to the apartment complex and $2.45 million in loans from the city of Erie.

Financing:Could Richford Arms upgrade plan get a $1.7 million city loan? Erie City Council will decide

Cohen added that the Erie Insurance financing is “unprecedented” when it comes to the company’s affordable housing developments nationwide.

“For a Fortune 500 neighbor who is not in the affordable housing business to see the importance of this and decide to make a major investment that’s a rewarding and unique thing for us” Cohen said. “And the city of Erie has also been extremely supportive of this project.

“We consider this an official groundbreaking celebration that lets us acknowledge all the work that got us to this point” Cohen said. “We believe that good affordable housing is a part of having a thriving city.”

Richford Arms tenants range from people in their mid-20s to those in their early 90s. Tenants receive Section 8 rental subsidies or other assistance through the federal Department of Housing and Urban Development.

The planned improvements include a new entrance for residents; a raised outdoor terrace with seating planters and lighting; a new two-story addition to the north of the building at the site of Richford Arms' existing parking lot that would include kitchen space a television room new laundry room a wellness/fitness center support offices and storage as well as six new apartments.

Also included are improvements to the building's ground floor retail storefronts new common areas for wellness programs and renovations to various apartments and corridors.

Preliminary work has begun at the apartment complex according to Beacon Communities officials. Cohen said that Beacon hopes to have the work finished as soon as December.

Richford Arms resident Ethel Wheat 72 is excited.

""I can't wait. Everything is going to be new and that's the best thing"" Wheat said. ""They're already working on a lot of things.""

Financing breakdown

Erie Insurance invested in the Richford Arms project “as part of the company’s longstanding commitment to downtown Erie"" company spokesman Matthew Cummings said.

“Beyond the financial lift that our low-interest loan provides to the project our partnership with Beacon has allowed us to learn more about the company and its approach to improving quality of life for its residents” Cummings said.

“Beacon’s commitment to this project and the residents of Richford Arms aligns with our vision of a diverse and equitable community and our downtown revitalization efforts.”

The city of Erie has approved two loans for the project totaling $2.45 million.

One is a $1.7 million 30-year zero-interest loan that comes from three federal sources: Home Investment Partnerships funds money from the Community Development Block Grant program and dollars allocated to the city via the Coronavirus Aid Relief and Economic Security Act.

The money used to provide the loan to Beacon Communities from those three sources according Debra Smith the city’s economic development director was allocated to the city between 2017 and 2021 but was not spent on other projects.

HOME funds are used by the city on projects that emphasize homeownership opportunities promote the stabilization of neighborhoods and help develop rental properties for low- and moderate-income residents.

Erie uses CDBG funds each year for community projects such as street paving sidewalk improvement housing programs and homeless shelters as well as to partially fund a number of local nonprofit social service agencies and Erie's community centers.

The city typically gets more than $3 million in CDBG and HOME funds combined each year.

CARES Act dollars are emergency funds the city received in 2020 because of the COVID-19 pandemic.

The city is also providing Beacon Communities a $750000 loan exclusively from city HOME dollars. Federal guidelines allow the city to loan the money to Beacon Communities at zero interest Smith said because the funds are being used to create or improve affordable housing.

Schember said the Richford Arms project gives a much-needed boost to affordable housing in Erie.

City officials have said the Richford Arms project complements recent multimillion-dollar downtown investments by groups such as Erie Insurance the Erie Downtown Partnership and the Erie Downtown Development Corp.

Kevin Flowers:Another multimillion-dollar bet on downtown Erie

“We are excited about the opportunity to positively impact the quality of life for the residents and look forward to seeing the renovations” Schember said.

“This project complements the many other projects taking place right now that are transforming downtown Erie and we appreciate Beacon Communities for their investment their commitment and their belief in Erie.”

The bulk of the Richford Arms work is funded by $12 million in tax-credit financing from the Pennsylvania Housing Finance Agency.

Such tax credit programs allow businesses to invest in housing-related projects. In exchange those businesses get a percentage of their financial investment back via tax credits.

Cohen said the project's PHFA financing provides roughly $1.2 million annually for 10 years for a total of about $12 million.

Cleveland-based KeyBank and national housing finance giant Fannie Mae are also providing funding for the project Cohen said.

Cohen has said that no Richford Arms residents will be displaced by the renovations although some residents might have to make a ""one-time move"" to a newly renovated apartment as the work takes place.

The COVID-19 pandemic Cohen said underscores the importance of the upgrades.

“The pandemic has sort of emphasized and pulled the curtain back on how vulnerable people can be when they don’t have housing stability” Cohen said. “It emphasizes the critical importance to us of affordable housing assets like Richford Arms and it has absolutely underlined our mission.”

[WHY] Posco hopes holding company will help it go green





Q. What does Posco do?

Q. Why is Posco pushing for a holding company structure?

Q. What businesses will Posco focus on once it becomes Posco Holdings?

Q. So what happens to the steel business?

Q. When did Posco first start to expand beyond steel?

Q. How will the holding company structure affect Posco’s corporate value and its stock?

Half a century ago Korea was an impoverished postwar country with a gross domestic product per capita below $200. Jump forward to 2022 and people around the world are using Samsung smartphones watching LG televisions and driving Hyundai Motor vehicles that were shipped across the ocean on Korean-built carriers.Korea’s development into an industrial powerhouse started with the establishment of a government-backed steel company in 1968 known today as Posco. That stable supply of steel allowed Korea to start developing and manufacturing the products that now lead the country's exports.Today Posco is the world’s most competitive steelmaker according to World Steel Dynamics and the 12th-largest company on the Kospi by market cap. But as the world shifts toward sustainable growth Posco is trying to expand its non-steel businesses saying its reputation as a steelmaker is pulling down its market value.Posco’s goal in 2022 is to solidify the group’s reputation as a future materials group. To speed up the change Posco plans to spin off its steel business and become a holding company.The corporate restructuring scheme is pending approval at an extraordinary shareholders’ meeting scheduled on Jan. 28.Posco is Korea’s largest steelmaker and the sixth-largest in the world by steel production.Posco then named Pohang Iron and Steel was founded in 1968 by Park Tae-joon a former army general who was charged with the responsibility by then-President Park Chung Hee who hoped to foster Korea’s economic growth with a stable supply of steel.A major challenge following its establishment was a lack of financing and technical skills to build a steel plant because lenders refused to invest in Korea.Park Tae-joon lobbied officials in Korea and Japan to allocate around $500 million in Japanese reparations for the occupation of Korea (1910-45) to finance the company.“I tried to convince them saying that the Japanese ruled Korea for 36 years” Park said in 1991. “Koreans have been deprived of so many things because of Japan so the Japanese must compensate Korea materially and psychologically.”The construction of the steel mill and the blast furnace cost $119.48 million or 24 percent of total reparations from Japan.“We are building the integrated steelworks on the blood of our ancestors"" Park told his employees at the time. ""If we fail we will be committing a sin that can never be forgiven.”Posco started the operation of its first blast furnace at Pohang Steel Mill in 1973. The second steel mill was built in Gwangyang South Jeolla in 1987. Posco was listed on the New York Stock Exchange in 1994.Under Park’s leadership Posco became the world’s No.1 steelmaker by 1998. In recent years Posco has also expanded into secondary battery materials trade food and construction businesses.Posco decided to create a holding company structure to better drive new businesses with higher growth potential.Though it has developed into a global company on strong steel sales Posco now believes its reputation as a steelmaker is undervaluing its new businesses and goal of becoming a sustainable company.“Despite making progress in new businesses Posco’s market cap is less than half of what it was when it peaked in 2007” Posco told shareholders in a statement. “The potential of the new businesses is not properly acknowledged because of the strong belief [that Posco] is a low-growth steel company stock.”Posco shares traded at around 770000 won ($650) apiece in 2007. It now trades at less than half that price at around 300000 won.Steel will continue to be important as a crucial engineering and construction material but its importance has waned over recent years as economic growth in key countries has slowed down said Kim Yong-jin a business professor at Sogang University.The World Steel Association projected in 2020 that the global increase rate for steel demand will be 0.8 percent annually ((+over the next 20 years)) even after the pandemic stabilizes.“Not as much steel will be used in the digital era"" Kim said ""and the global movement to embrace carbon neutrality is also raising the need for Posco to reduce its reliance on steel.”In 2019 the United Nations announced that over 60 countries including the United Kingdom had committed to carbon neutrality by 2050. Last year the Korean government pledged to become carbon neutral by that year a decision followed by domestic companies including Posco.The steel industry accounts for 8 percent of CO2 emissions globally according to a report from consulting firm McKinsey which predicts that 14 percent of all steel companies could see their value decline unless they reduce carbon emissions.Posco’s focus following the split will be steel battery materials lithium and nickel hydrogen energy construction and food.Posco currently produces EV battery materials — cathode active materials and anodes — through its subsidiary Posco Chemical. To expand that production Posco Chemical is constructing plants in China and North America two of the largest EV battery markets.Last month the company announced that it would establish a cathode active material factory with General Motors in a joint venture in North America. In August it announced that it would construct a 30000-ton cathode material and precursor production plant in China and it is seeking to construct another in Europe. Precursors exist before cathodes and are composed of materials including nickel and cobalt.Posco Chemical currently has the capacity to produce 45000 tons of cathode active materials and 69000 tons of anodes. As of 2020 Posco Chemical globally ranks tenth in the cathode active materials market and fourth in the anodes market according to the company.Its goal is to expand anode production capacity to 260000 tons and cathode production capacity to 400000 tons by 2030.To ensure a supply of raw materials to do this Posco is building plants to produce lithium and nickel which are the key raw materials for EV battery materials.Posco is building a plant to produce lithium hydroxide the raw material for cathodes in the southern industrial city of Gwangyang South Jeolla to open in 2023. It also acquired a 15 percent stake in Black Rock Mining an Australia-based graphite producer to secure graphite fines a raw material for anodes and Hombre Muerto a lithium salt lake in Argentina in 2018. The lake’s has 13.5 million tons of lithium reserves according to the company.“Posco Group as a whole is strengthening its grip on the secondary battery materials market through investments in the integration of cathode and anode material value chains” said Jung Yong-jin an analyst at Shinhan Investment.But it may take some time before the market acknowledges that value chain.“Considering that it will be a while before specific results can be confirmed it will take some time until the market starts to embrace the hidden values of the company’s new growth engines” said Moon Kyeong-won an analyst at Meritz Securities.Posco has not yet commercialized the production of lithium and nickel but it aims to be able to produce 220000 tons of lithium and 140000 tons of nickel in 2030.Apart from materials Posco has also stepped into the vegan meat business through Posco International.The trading arm of Posco signed an agreement with Gikuin Company and HN Novatech alternative meat producers to support the global marketing and product development of their products.Gikuin Company makes plant-based meat made from brown rice oats and nuts while HN Novatech uses molecules extracted from seaweed and fish meat.Steel will continue to be an essential part of Posco’s business model.But to make steel a sustainable business Posco is developing technology to produce steel using hydrogen instead of coke which contains carbon.With current steelmaking technology around 0.75 tons of coking coal is required to make one ton of steel which emits around two tons of carbon dioxide as a byproduct. Steel made with green hydrogen gas will emit zero carbon dioxide once the technology is fully developed and commercialized according to Posco. The company plans to build a demonstration plant for the technology in 2028 and commercialize it in 2030.Green hydrogen is the cleanest type of hydrogen made from renewable energies. Other types include grey hydrogen made from fossil fuels and blue hydrogen derived from methane in natural gas.The key to the success and commercialization of hydrogen-based steelmaking will be the cost of green hydrogen which is tougher to generate in Korea than in other countries where solar and wind energies are more accessible due to their geographical advantages.As of 2019 the cost of generating solar energy in Korea was 163 won per kWh which is 10 times more expensive than in the Middle East. This makes hydrogen generated in Korea less price competitive.So Posco is relying on overseas partnerships.Last year Posco teamed up with Origin Energy Australia’s largest electricity and gas supplier to introduce the ammonia necessary for green hydrogen use in Korea. In 2020 it signed an agreement with Fortescue Metal Group (FMG) an Australian iron ore supplier to participate in green hydrogen production. The plan is to introduce green hydrogen to Korea.Posco’s goal is to have the production capacity for 6.3 million tons of green hydrogen in 2050.Posco’s expansion into non-steel businesses started more than a decade ago.The effort began after the appointment of Chung Joon-yang as Posco Chairman in 2009. Chung actively pushed the acquisition of non-steel businesses like Daewoo International in 2010. The number of Posco affiliates has increased from 36 in 2009 to around 70 in 2012.In 2010 Chung invested more than a trillion won on a Roy Hill project to develop an iron ore mine. Roy Hill is the developer of Australia’s largest single iron ore mine. In 2013 Posco agreed to take a 15 percent stake in a Canadian iron ore mine owned by ArcelorMittal with China Steel for $1.1 billion.Kwon Oh-joon who assumed the Posco chairmanship in 2014 placed the company’s focus back on steel to recover the reduced growth triggered by Chung's aggressive investments. Major assets sold during his term include a 38 percent stake in Posco Engineering and Construction to Saudi Arabia’s Public Investment Fund for 1.24 trillion won in 2015.But in his second term Kwon pledged to strengthen non-steel business especially advanced materials like lithium nickel magnesium and titanium.Choi Jeong-woo who became Posco Chairman in July 2018 has followed in the footsteps of his predecessors and restructured the organization to expand non-steel businesses.Under his leadership Posco ESM and Posco ChemTech merged into Posco Chemical in 2019. To raise production capacity of battery materials 1.27 trillion won of new shares was issued for Posco Chemical last year the largest ever for Posco Group.In a new year address on Jan. 3 Choi said that Posco will “solidify the group’s identity as an environmentally friendly future materials group.”“Posco’s efforts to expand into non-steel businesses began years ago before Choi” said Kim Tai-gi a former economics professor at Dankook University. “While the previous chairmen set the direction for the adjusted business models focused on the new growth engines Choi has been taking actions aggressively to actually bring changes to Posco Group’s portfolio.”Analysts say the holding company structure does not affect Posco fundamentals though many shareholders strongly argue otherwise.“The split should not be seen excessively critically on Posco’s stock price” said Lee Jong-hyeong an analyst at Kiwoom Securities. “Battery companies whose stock prices slid following a recent split partially sold their stock to secure proceeds to build major production facilities. This inevitably weakened [the parent company’s] control over the split company. But Posco does not need massive investment for its steel business so there is no need for the company to sell its shares.""Posco promised not to list the split company nor its future subsidiaries.Regardless shareholders are very frustrated about Posco’s decision because they don’t entirely trust the company’s promise.“As the sole shareholder [of the split company] Posco Holdings will be able to freely make changes to the articles of association” said Solidarity for Economic Reform a Seoul-based non-governmental organization arguing that Posco “did not propose policies that prevent listing of its subsidiaries.”Posco is trying to soothe the shareholders promising to up the dividend to at least 10000 won apiece and retire some of its treasury stocks this year to reduce the number of outstanding shares. Posco’s annual dividend for those who held shares in 2020 was 8000 won.BY JIM MIN-JI [jin.minji@joongang.co.kr]",,,,,,,,,,,,

The new Intel Ethernet 800 series is a 100GbE adapter. Here is an adapter via lshw:

100 in Roman numerals is “C” so we get the ice driver (Intel 100 Ethernet) as well as the C in E810-CQDA2.

Here is a quick look at the 100Gbps advertised speeds via ethtool connected at 100GbE speeds:

We often get questions around the SR-IOV lspci capabilities so here those are:

Here are the key specs of the Intel Ethernet 800 series:

Overall there is a lot going on here so this is the best we can offer in terms of specs at this point.

Performance and Power Consumption

In our testing we were able to hit 100Gbps speeds on a port in basic testing as we would expect from a NIC like this. Hopefully later this year we can show off some higher-end use-cases and that is why we are doing the massive fiber project. The actual testing for this review happened in early Q4 2021 before that project was finished.

In terms of power consumption we saw 16.6-20.7W over the course of our testing the Supermicro Intel E810-CQDA2. We were however using DAC and short-range optics. Here is the official Intel spec sheet on these cards:

There is a lot of variabilities here in terms of types of optics and cabling used as well as the capabilities being used and loading of the NICs. Still we feel like we were in Intel’s range for the cards so Intel’s guidance seems to be accurate.

Final Words

For many of our readers 100GbE today is going to seem excessive especially if one has not transitioned to Ice Lake Xeon AMD EPYC Rome/ Milan or Ampere Altra servers. Still for those that have made the PCIe Gen4 transition or will in the future moving to 100GbE NICs is very important.

As we move into 2022 and beyond we are going to see a further push towards disaggregation of compute storage and memory. As a result more organizations are going to rely on NVMeoF and storage delivered via network interfaces. Combining this with higher core counts means that a greater number of VMs can reside on the same host increasing network bandwidth needs even more. The next NIC(s) we will likely look at are 25GbE NICs and those may be more practical for many of our readers. Still the 100GbE space is going to be useful especially for high-density VM hosts network storage and similar applications.",,,,,,,,,,,,

This article was updated on Feb. 2 2022 to reflect clarifications from AT&T.

The Wellesley Municipal Light Plant (WMLP) has completed its installation of AT&T’s antennas that boost coverage and provide 5G data service. The mounting of the small cell antennas began in June 2020 when the WMLP announced that boxes would be affixed to telephone poles around town.

In the end there were 41 AT&T nodes installed. Based on the map provided by the WMLP 36% of the boxes have been installed on or adjacent to Worcester St. (Route 9) or Washington St. (Route 16) and the remainder in neighborhoods.

Don Newell Director of the Municipal Light Plant stated that the AT&T project was now completed. According to current plans the MLP will be installing 35 small cell antenna attachments for T-Mobile over the next five months.

Newell added “WMLP and T-Mobile will be holding an informational webinar in February 2022. The staff are in the process of finalizing the locations and installation schedules.” There was no mention of Verizon however coverage maps from industry sources show Verizon with 4G coverage along major travel routes in Wellesley.

I first became aware of the installation near my house in Wellesley Hills when I found my AT&T phone coverage showing “5 bars”. This was a striking improvement over the weak reception I’ve had in the past. By using the Speedtest app I was able to obtain download speeds of 150 Mbps+ on an iPhone SE second generation which showed “5GE” service. When I used an iPhone 12 it showed “5G” with a download speed of over 200 Mbps and I suspect it would be much faster nearer the antenna. According to AT&T the current network is a “4G LTE” even if the phone icons show otherwise.

When I investigated why my service was so much improved I found that one of the “small cell” antennas had been installed about 2/10 of a mile from my house and that the family room was “line of sight” to the pole with the AT&T node. All of this to say that most people unless they are directly in view of the new AT&T boxes will not see 200 Mbps downloads. I tested this theory by walking the street as there are two of the small cells about 0.5 miles from each other. In between the two poles the download rate dropped to about 40 Mbps which is still not bad.

Although some may have concerns about the cosmetics of the new cell arrays several neighbors I spoke with seem to have no such worries. Most commented that the gray rectangular nodes are no worse than the existing cable and transformer boxes that already festoon the poles. One neighbor whose house had a new box installed directly in front of them said that they switched to AT&T from their previous provider when the installation was completed – and now have great coverage.

While Wellesley is continuing down the 5G path there is still controversy at the national level with the technology. Just this week major airlines warned of “catastrophic disruption” to travel and shipping from 5G installations by Verizon and AT&T near airports. Verizon and AT&T had agreed to delay activating 5G using the newly acquired C-band spectrum twice: originally from December 5 and then pushed back again from a planned January 5 launch date until two weeks later. The delays were meant to give the industries Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) FCC and White House more time to address concerns.

Time will tell if the 5G rollout will be slowed down due to these concerns but at least in Wellesley we will have the benefit of better reception and faster speeds from AT&T and soon T-Mobile.

What is 5G and when does it arrive in Wellesley?

According to industry sources “5G is a 5th generation mobile network. It is a new global wireless standard that enables a new kind of network.” There are many variations of 5G technology some of which use existing 4G LTE infrastructure.

In Wellesley AT&T’s small cell antenna installation is based on 4G LTE technology.

When asked about why some phones in Wellesley may show “5G” speeds an AT&T spokesman said: “The technology is 4G LTE currently however 5G may display on devices due to overlapping coverage from nearby macro cells. The equipment is 5G capable which can be enabled in the future. And additional radio frequency equipment can be added for more speed whether 4G or 5G.”

We’ll keep a close eye out to see if things speed up even more!

Many mobile device users in the United States now have access to blazing-fast internet speeds stemming from the rollout of Verizon (VZ) and AT&T (T)’s new C-band 5G networks earlier this week.

While telecom companies have rolled out 5G networks to various locations across the country over the last few years many delivered an experience that was arguably only a notch above what 4G offers. Now AT&T (T) which owns CNN’s parent company and Verizon have turned on C-band 5G networks which are an important set of higher radio frequencies. These networks will supercharge the internet as we know it allowing users to for example stream a Netflix movie in 4K resolution or download a movie in seconds. (Verizon said its C-band speeds reach nearly 1 gigabyte per second about 10 times as fast as 4G LTE. If that’s not obvious it’s really fast.)

But not everyone will be able to take advantage of these C-band 5G networks out of the gate. You’ll need three key things to access one: a newer smartphone model that supports 5G a 5G-specific cellular plan and to be in an area with the new coverage.

Here’s what you need to know:

Is my phone compatible?

AT&T and Verizon have a handful of devices that are compatible with their new C-band 5G networks including the iPhone 12 and iPhone 13 models the Samsung Galaxy S21 line and soon Google’s Pixel 6 phones. (For a full list of C-band compatible devices visit AT&T and Verizon’s websites.)

If you’re on an Android device you can check which network your phone supports by going to Settings tapping on Network and Internet and then selecting Mobile Network. On iOS open Settings then Cellular and tap Cellular Data Options. If you’re using Dual SIM on iOS go to Settings then Cellular and choose the number whose options you want to change.

But if you haven’t bought a new smartphone in the past two years you most likely have a 3G or 4G phone.

It’s only a matter of time before most new phones come with built-in 5G support as manufacturers and carriers will push customers toward it over other networks. (AT&T plans to shut down its 3G network next month Verizon is shutting down its 3G network by the end of the year and T-Mobile will shut down Sprint’s 3G network by March 31.)

Do I need a new cellular plan?

If you own a 5G device you’ll still need a 5G-specific plan to access the faster C-band network. Existing 5G subscribers can do so without an additional charge. Both AT&T and Verizon offer plans that start at $35 a month for each phone line.

Verizon also announced a 5G home internet plan for its C-band network starting at $50 a month.

Where are the C-band networks?

Even if you have a 5G-capable device and a 5G mobile plan you may not be able to access the new higher-speed 5G network.

AT&T’s new C-band 5G network — which it is calling the 5G+ network — is currently only available in eight metro areas including Chicago Houston Austin Dallas/Fort Worth Detroit Miami Jacksonville and Orlando. The company said it will expand to more cities throughout the year most likely in cities where it has already launched 5G in other bands.

Anyone with a 5G-compatible phone will be able to download the latest mobile operating system to gain access to the network. On AT&T’s network anyone in a 5G+ market will see a “5G+” at the top of the device when the network is available.

Meanwhile Verizon said its new 5G Ultra Wideband network will be available to 100 million more people this month in over 1700 US cities including Chicago Miami Los Angeles New York City and even smaller cities such as Dayton Ohio and Rochester New York. To see if service is in your area Verizon’s website has a coverage map.

A “5G UW” indicator will appear on the top right corner of the device when a 5G phone on one of the plans is detected on the network.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiaGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWd1YXJkaWFuLmNvbS90ZWNobm9sb2d5LzIwMjIvamFuLzIzL2hvdy1teS1odXNiYW5kLWZpbmFsbHktY3JhY2tlZC1hbmQtZ290LWEtbW9iaWxlLXBob25l0gFoaHR0cHM6Ly9hbXAudGhlZ3VhcmRpYW4uY29tL3RlY2hub2xvZ3kvMjAyMi9qYW4vMjMvaG93LW15LWh1c2JhbmQtZmluYWxseS1jcmFja2VkLWFuZC1nb3QtYS1tb2JpbGUtcGhvbmU?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,How my husband finally cracked and got a mobile phone,"In her new memoir I Came All This Way to Meet You the American novelist Jami Attenberg describes meeting a man who is not on any social media at all and who therefore has no idea what it’s like to receive a like or retweet. Attenberg considers this state wildly unusual not to say bizarre; she’s all over Instagram and the rest. But her amazement is tempered with what sounds like envy. “You goddam beautiful unicorn” she writes of him. “What’s that like being entirely self-validating? What’s it like to wake up every day and not worry what anyone else thinks?”

As it happens I’ve spent the past 18 years of my life with just such a unicorn though the man I’m talking about is – or was – an even rarer beast than hers. So a guy isn’t on social media. So what? Lots of people aren’t. Facebook is for dinosaurs. The more important fact by far when it comes to my mythical creature is that until three weeks ago he did not in a Britain in which around 87% of adults own a smartphone even have a mobile. Not only had he never used social media he had never sent let alone received a text. The exquisite torture that comes of WhatsApp and its blue ticks was entirely unknown to him a man whose body is very far indeed from being hard-wired to respond to alerts. Nothing pinged in his pocket as he strolled along. When he was lost he had to ask a stranger not Google Maps. When he was out late he had to rely on his legs not an Uber. Calls? You’d be surprised. The last time he needed urgently to contact me while out and about he walked into a hotel bar and drawing on all of his great David Niven-like urbanity casually asked a waiter if he might “use your telephone for a moment”.

He never indulged in doom or any other kind of scrolling. For his time to be his own he required so little discipline

Unsurprisingly friends and strangers alike professed themselves astonished by this refusal to get with the programme (I mean the programme that involves being available 24 hours a day seven days a week) their manner hovering between amusement and exasperation. Do you people would ask sarcastically still recite your number when you answer your landline? But I always found irritation the more interesting response suggestive as it was of feelings of exclusion and hurt (“Don’t you want me to call you?”). Sometimes it bordered on anger a low-level rage that might possibly – I’m only guessing – have been connected to a sense of unfairness. While T had escaped the constant hassle the stress and the surveillance they had not and never would. (Not that they would ever admit to this. Far too much – their entire existence! – was is at stake for that.)

What about me though? At some point eyes would inevitably glide in my direction. Wasn’t I the long-suffering one! How did I cope? I’d be lying if I said it wasn’t sometimes annoying. A couple of months ago I left a party before him only to find that I didn’t have my keys with me; I had to wait on the doorstep for an hour. I used to roll my eyes if he asked to use my phone not least because I would then have to explain how to use it. “Useful aren’t they?” I’d say jaw clenched. But like Attenberg I was admiring too. Such a refusal spoke of confidence and ease; in his stubbornness he reminded me usefully of a past in which we all survived perfectly well without being contactable at any moment. His phone-less state also I think helped to maintain the privacy that is vital for peaceable coupledom. Even if I wanted to check up on him I couldn’t and he in turn had no interest in my phone because well phones were not something he cared about. I watched others being pestered by – or pestering – those closest to them and found that I was relieved to have been exempted from this regime however unwillingly at first.

But the biggest benefit of all was undoubtedly to him – and this is where envy sets in. All that extra time! When people asked how he managed to write so much – in the first lockdown while I stared at my tiny screen he began and finished his recent memoir – the answer was blindingly obvious. Unlike the rest of the world he never wasted a single moment wondering why someone hadn’t answered his last message; nor did he indulge in doom or any other kind of scrolling. For his time to be his own he required so little discipline. His in-between times were calm and quiet to be used for good things like reading or listening to music. Mine were – they still are – punctuated by incoming fire I’m seemingly forbidden to ignore (“Didn’t you see my email?”). My phone has the capacity to make me deeply unhappy.

But as you’ll have noticed this piece is written in the past tense. At Christmas T asked me to give him a phone and this I duly did sneaking it into his stocking so as not to make too big a deal of it. What had penetrated his defences? I had told him a hundred times – usually as I printed out yet another boarding pass – that he was in danger of becoming disenfranchised in a world where the phone is the key to everything and yet still he would not crack. In the end there were two things. First his beloved iPod was obsolete; he wanted to be able to use Spotify while he was running. Second there was Covid which requires so much paperwork all of which is best kept on a mobile phone.

The other night a friend begged for his number – everyone wants to be the first to break the long silence/ruin his life

Outwardly I was triumphant. “It’s for the best” I said in the level voice I reserve for these situations. But inwardly something else was going on. My goddam beautiful unicorn was about to disappear. When the Christmas post went to pot and not one but two sim cards went missing and the shiny new phone could not be used there was no ignoring it: relief rose inside me. A stay of execution for us both. Soon after this the sim having finally arrived there came a moment when I found him in an armchair AirPods in his ears utterly absorbed in the black rectangle in his hand. For how much longer would he remain a free man? Never such innocence again I thought mournfully.

But there is hope. Having spent all of his adult life phone-less some rules have been set; some habits are hard to break. T is not your typical phone user and perhaps he never will be. Only me and his sister have his number and I’m forbidden to give it out to anyone else. The other night a friend begged for it – the phone is the talk of our circle; everyone wants to be the first to break the long silence/ruin his life – and thumb screws having been applied I relented. The friend sent a text but there came no answer – not then or for the rest of the evening. “It’s probably switched off” I said. “What?” said the friend. “No one switches their phone off.”

Hmm. When I got home I inquired after the text that had been sent. Had T received it? He proffered his phone showing me his reply sent the following morning. “Automated message” it read. “This number is no longer available.” It was very convincing; he’d added dashes to the words “automated message” and somehow this made it look official. “I feel a bit guilty” he said shoving it in his pocket. But his face which wore a smile told a different story – of a phone that is not quite a phone. Or not yet.

Anthony Quinn: ‘A bus ride is now a bedlam of performative monologuists’

Anthony Quinn’s first selfie.

People were often incredulous that I’d never had a mobile. They talked to me about it as if I were missing a limb or afflicted with a serious illness. But it truly wasn’t that difficult to live without one. Thirty years ago nearly everybody did and life was fine.

Why though? I suppose because I never wanted one. From the outside looking in I noticed the way mobiles changed everyday behaviour. Insidiously the sleek pocket devil became what a pack of cigarettes was to a previous generation: something to occupy your hand hugely antisocial bad for your health.

At some point it became acceptable to interrupt a conversation by raising a finger and saying “I just need to take this”; to place your phone on a dinner table and check your incoming surreptitiously or not; to stalk along a pavement head down eyes absorbed by your screen (so I have to step out of the way for you?). I travel mostly by bus which used to be a good place to daydream to mooch to worry about the next chapter of my book. Solitary mooching must be a cornerstone of any civilised society. Alas the upstairs deck is now a bedlam of jabberers droners performative monologuists.

The dream was over after the pandemic. It no longer felt viable – or fair to Rachel – to have someone nannying me with NHS apps and Covid passes on a phone that wasn’t mine. It’s not all bad. No more trouble over entry at galleries theatres football stadiums. And I have Spotify when I go for a run – genius. For the rest though I’m hoping to maintain a low block on access. I don’t intend to give out my number. Email is the saviour. Honestly I love my friends! I just don’t want them to call me – ever.

TROW,T Rowe Price,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiW2h0dHBzOi8vbnlwb3N0LmNvbS8yMDIyLzAxLzIyL2dvbGRtYW4tc2FjaHMtY2VvLWRhdmlkLXNvbG9tb24tcGxheWluZy1pdC1jb29sLXdpdGgtbWVyZ2Vycy_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Goldman Sachs boss David Solomon playing it 'cool' with mergers,"Goldman Sachs has been looking to do a big deal or what investment bankers call “transformative” for years now. So what are they waiting for? People there keep telling me they need asset prices of merger partners to “normalize” aka fall enough so Goldman remains in control of the combined company.

Well we’re starting to see some “normal.”

A look at the asset prices of potential partners — PNC Bank US Bancorp State Street BNY Mellon some mid-sized asset managers and even potentially brokerage firm Charles Schwab & Co. — are starting to come back to earth as the Fed begins raising interest rates.

Another factor that might force CEO David Solomon’s hand are the obvious holes in Goldman’s business model. Goldman has a long and storied rep killing it in M&A and trading.

Tough competition

But it’s tough having only two horses in the race competing against banking behemoths like JPMorgan. Sure Goldman wasn’t the only bank to experience a hiccup because of trading volatility and higher expenses (the vaunted JPM did as well). But JPM has a big balance sheet far larger than the size of Goldman’s and JPM CEO Jamie Dimon can paper over surprises such as rapid and unexpected increases in compensation costs which bedeviled Solomon in the fourth quarter of 2021 and possibly into 2022.

That’s why Goldman’s earnings miss last week has the Wall Street rumor mill spinning again.

Solomon also knows that if you’re Goldman the merger has got to be the right one or else the CEO will go down in infamy as having evaporated one of the world’s greatest corporate brands.

And this is where it gets tricky. As for potential partners Schwab — the world’s most prestigious discount broker — would be an obvious choice. Schwab’s business involves registered investment advisers selling high-end financial products to rich people which complements Goldman’s own very high-end wealth-management business.

But Schwab’s price in Goldmanese hasn’t been normalized enough. The San Francisco-based Schwab has a market value of $168 billion compared to Goldman’s $115 billion. Charles Schwab’s ego — and yes the company’s 84-year-old founder namesake and chairman is still around — won’t let him sell out a bunch of traders in New York if he doesn’t have to.

Both PNC and US Bancorp have lower market caps than Goldman and they would be attractive particularly in a high-interest-rate environment the Fed has signaled; banks make a lot of money when rates rise.

But like Schwab neither has to do a deal. The monetary-policy environment favors their business model over Goldman’s.

Asset managers that might be available — think T. Rowe Price — would get Solly around $1.5 trillion in assets and entry into the lucrative mutual-fund business.

Ask yourself though: Why ­haven’t there been more marriages between fund companies and Wall Street? Answer: Combining those cultures is a little like trying to get Hillary Clinton to play nice with Donald Trump.

With all these variables to weigh the conventional wisdom among bankers is that Goldman isn’t rushing to do anything. Solomon is doing a great job; he’s beat earnings expectations seven times before the recent fourth-quarter 2021 miss. Some analysts say his stock looks cheap compared to competitors like Morgan Stanley but Goldman has the edge in market prowess.

That’s one way to look at it; another way is the reason why Morgan Stanley beat fourth-quarter expectations: It has a huge wealth-management business that stabilized and papered over a trading slowdown.

Again Solomon and his people are smart. They know they have to do a deal and the right one at the right time.

Sensible ‘Fink think’

Larry Fink’s annual letter to CEOs is always must-read material this year even more so because he added a fair amount of common sense to the relentless push by the Biden administration and corporate America to adopt green-energy policies.

Fink the CEO of BlackRock is no stranger to this effort. He’s used his clout as chief of the world’s largest money-management firm ($9 trillion in assets) to prod companies to adopt policies that he believes will transition the country and the world to what’s known as “net zero” carbon admissions.

With that came criticism from conservatives and this column since BlackRock alumni fill the Biden White House. Yes green energy sounds good in practice and Teslas are very popular in Beverly Hills but working-class Americans can’t afford electric cars. Higher oil and gas prices are tax increases on Middle America.

Fink didn’t back off his embrace of green energy. But in the letter he also pointed out how this movement is being hijacked by environmental zealots.

He advocated for a transition that takes into account that “any plan that focuses solely on limiting supply and fails to address demand for hydrocarbons will drive up energy prices for those who can least afford it resulting in greater polarization around climate change and eroding progress.”

Let’s hope his friends in the Biden administration are listening.",,,,,,,,,,,,

The deal will eclipse what was the largest game acquisition the $12.7 billion acquisition of Zynga by Take Two Interactive (the GTA guys) which was only announced less than a week ago.

These amounts sound unholy for a Zimbabwean like me whose country is labouring under a $10.5 billion debt. As a casual gamer though I’ve been tracking the revenues these gaming companies have been making and Microsoft is actually getting a bargain at $68.7 billion.

See Activision Blizzard also has King studios under its umbrella. These names might not mean much to some but for anyone who casually plays games there is a high chance you have played at least one game developed by these studios.

The following franchises are what Microsoft is getting:

For the serious gamer:

Call of Duty

World of Warcraft

Diablo

Overwatch

For the mobile and light gamer:

Candy Crush Saga

Farm Heroes Saga

There are more games like Crash Bandicoot and the Tony Hawk series that millennials will remember. So Microsoft is getting quite the catalogue.

Analysts say Microsoft is paying a fraction of what they would have paid had Activision Blizzard not been in trouble. The studio has been dealing with a multitude of sexual harrasment lawsuits on top of the latest Call of Duty game not performing as expected. So the share price has been rather subdued as the future of the company remained uncertain.

For context Activision Blizzard has 400 million monthly active players in 190 countries on its games. Not to mention just the value of franchises like WoW and CoD. So yeah $69.7 billion is a bargain.

Microsoft’s plans

These games will be added to Game Pass and I gotta say paying the $9.99 per month for Game Pass for PC is starting to look tempting. Imagine Halo Forza CoD WoW Overwatch etc for 10 bucks a month.

Game Pass was gaining popularity even before this acquisition and Microsoft recently announced reaching 25 million subscribers. That right there is well over $250 million a month from subscriptions cause some users subscribe for the $15 Game Pass Ultimate.

I foresee a flood of new subscribers and Microsoft is counting on the same. And if we factor in outright game sales Microsoft is looking pretty. See although Call of Duty: Vanguard did not perform as well as its predecessor it still managed to be the best selling game of 2021 and it will belong to Microsoft in about 18 months when the deal is expected to be concluded.

What about Sony?

PlayStation fans have the right to be worried. Will Microsoft make the Activision Blizzard titles XBox exclusives? Sony says they expect Microsoft to honour the agreements that are in place. And Microsoft on their part say the games will remain multi-platform but who knows what will happen when current agreements expire.

Yes there is money to be made in keeping games multi-platform. Would Microsoft be willing to forgo the millions they would get from PlayStation players? Or would the strategy be to chip away at the ‘exclusives’ advantage Sony has for its PlayStation? We shall see.

Mobile gaming is king now

While the Call of Duty franchise seems like the pick of the litter Candy Crush might be the most important.

In 2021 mobile gaming revenue accounted for about half of all gaming revenues. Mobile games brought in about $80 billion whist consoles raked in $45 and PC $37 billion in revenue. I fully get this as I have become somewhat of a mobile gamer even more than console or PC. Hence why the ray tracing Samsung chip had me excited.

So those casual games that even our moms play are becoming the big deal. Mock Candy Crush all you want but the game brought in over $1.1 billion in revenue in 2020 on it’s own. That could be 4 times more than the Game Pass subscriber revenue of $250 million we discussed earlier.

So when it’s all said and done Candy Crush Pet Rescue Bubble Witch and Farm Heroes could be gem that was enclosed in the WoW shell.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmVjb25vbWlzdC5jb20vYnVzaW5lc3Mvd2h5LW1pY3Jvc29mdC1pcy1zcGxhc2hpbmctNjlibi1vbi12aWRlby1nYW1lcy8yMTgwNzI0MtIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Why Microsoft is splashing $69bn on video games,"E VEN FOR Microsoft which boasts a market value of $2.3trn $69bn is a lot of money. On January 18th the firm said it would pay that sum—in cash—for Activision Blizzard a video-game developer. It is by far the biggest acquisition in the video-game industry’s history and the largest ever by Microsoft more than twice the size of its purchase in 2016 of LinkedIn a social network (see chart). The move which caught industry-watchers by surprise and propelled Activision Blizzard’s share price up by 25% represents a huge bet on the future of fun. But not perhaps a crazy one.

Gaming was a big fast-growing business even before the pandemic. Lockdowns bolstered its appeal—to hardened gamers with more time on their hands and bored neophytes alike. Newzoo an analysis firm reckons revenues grew by 23% in 2020 to nearly $180bn.

Activist Commentary: Carl Icahn is the grandfather of shareholder activism and a true pioneer of the strategy. While he is not slowing down at all he recently reached an agreement with his son Brett Icahn to rejoin the firm as the eventual successor. Brett plans to employ his father's favored approach of pushing companies to make changes designed to boost their stock prices though he hasn't ruled out friendly bets too. This is not a departure from the strategy Carl has succeeded with for many years. He can be friendly (i.e. Apple  Netflix ) or he can be confrontational (i.e. Forest Labs Biogen ) often it depends on the response of management. Brett is an impressive activist investor in his own right not because he is Carl's son but because he has demonstrated a long track record of extremely successful activist investing. The Sargon Portfolio he co-headed at Icahn at one time totaled around $7 billion and included extremely profitable investments in companies such as Netflix and Apple. The Sargon Portfolio significantly outperformed the market with an annualized return of 27%. However prior to that Brett started in 2002 with Icahn as an analyst and was later responsible for campaigns like Hain Celestial (280.3% return versus 46.7% for the S&P 500 ) Take Two Interactive (81.5% versus 64.5% for the S&P500) and Mentor Graphics (106.4% versus 79.4% for the S&P 500).

On Jan. 7 2022  Icahn and the company entered into a Nomination and Standstill Agreement pursuant to which the company appointed Brett Icahn and Gary Hu (both portfolio managers at Icahn Capital) as directors to the board and agreed to include them on their slate of director nominees for election at the 2022 annual meeting. Icahn agreed to abide by certain standstill provisions until he no longer has directors on the board.

Icahn has tremendous experience in the automotive industry currently owning and operating Icahn Automotive which makes up 28% of the total net sales of Icahn Enterprises (""IEP""). Icahn Automotive was built in large part through acquisitions. Starting as an investor in Federal-Mogul in 2001 Icahn ultimately acquired the entire company by 2017. Icahn also acquired substantially all the U.S. auto parts assets of Uni-Select Inc. a leading automotive parts distributor for domestic and imported vehicles; Pep Boys – Manny Moe & Jack a leading aftermarket provider of automotive service tires parts and accessories across the U.S. and Puerto Rico; the franchise businesses of Precision Tune Auto Care; and American Driveline Systems. Icahn ultimately sold Federal-Mogul to Tenneco in 2018 for $5.4 billion and today Icahn Automotive consists of Pep Boys automotive aftermarket retail and service chain Auto Plus automotive aftermarket parts distributor Precision Tune Auto Care owned and franchised automotive service centers and AAMCO Total Auto Care franchised service centers. The businesses of Icahn Automotive total over 22000 employees over 2000 company-owned and franchise locations and 25 distribution centers throughout the U.S. Canada and Puerto Rico.

Icahn is not only knowledgeable about this industry but he also has experience with this company. In March 2006 Dana declared Chapter 11 bankruptcy and Icahn acquired approximately $101.25 million of the company's then-$2.25 billion unsecured debt with the intention of being an ""active participant"" in the bankruptcy case. Icahn again became an equity owner in the fourth quarter of 2020 and filed a passive 13G on Feb. 4 2021 with a 7.5% ownership. His intent since changed from passive to active and he filed this 13D upon taking two board seats at the company.

There is no doubt that Icahn's two portfolio managers Brett Icahn and Gary Hu will make value-added directors as they not only have industry experience but are shareholder directors – either on its own is valuable for a board member but it is very rare to have a director with both of those attributes. So if that is all Icahn does from an activist perspective in this investment he should be creating significant value for shareholders.

However it is hard to overlook the elephant in the room. Icahn built his automotive industry on acquisitions and Dana appears to fit in very nicely in IEP's automotive business. Moreover IEP states that its strategy in its Automotive segment is to continue to grow its commercial parts sales and its automotive service business and it will continue to consider strategic alternatives in its automotive aftermarket parts business to maximize value. When Icahn acquired Pep Boys he also stated: ""We believe that with our abundant resources and knowledge of the industry we will be able to grow this business and take advantage of consolidation opportunities thereby benefiting customers manufacturing partners and employees as well as our shareholders."" So it is hard to believe that Icahn is not at least considering Dana as a potential acquisition or merger candidate. However as an investor who has always prioritized corporate governance and shareholder value we expect that if he does acquire the company it will only be after a sales process by an independent investment bank and an arms-length negotiation in which the Icahn directors recuse themselves.

Ken Squire is the founder and president of 13D Monitor an institutional research service on shareholder activism and the founder and portfolio manager of the 13D Activist Fund a mutual fund that invests in a portfolio of activist 13D investments. Dana is owned in the fund."

The MRO plant which was commissioned by President Yoweri Museveni will target the entire African helicopter MRO market including helicopters in use by UN Missions.

“You’re talking of saving money. You’re using imported helicopters which you don’t make or even maintain and repair. This is very serious” Museveni said.

The facility will help Uganda save about 3.5 million US dollars that have been spent on transportation and overhauling one helicopter outside Uganda.

Maj Gen Sabiiti Muzeyi the General Manager Luwero Industries a subsidiary of National Enterprise Corporation( NEC) said the facility with state of the art equipment is now fully operational.

“The UPDAF attached its technical personnel to the facility (in the field of Mechanics-Engine and Airframe; Avionics-Radio/Radar Instruments and Electrical system Armament-Electrical and Mechanical systems Ground Support Equipment and in Quality Control and Quality Assurance). The first batch of 15 is already deployed at the facility and carrying out the Overhaul of the first Mi-24 under the supervision of Expatriates but in the long run we shall do all this work by ourselves. I thank the CAF for all the support he has given to this Project” he said.

The commissioning function was attended by among others; the Minister of State for Defence and Veteran Affairs Hon. Huda Abason Oleru Lt Gen Proscovia Nalweyiso the General Manager Uganda Air cargo Lt General Nakibus Lakara the Chief of Military Intelligence-CMI Maj Gen Abel Kandiho the Deputy Managing Director National Enterprise Corporation-NEC Maj General (Rtd) Innocent Oula the deputy Commander Airforce Maj Gen Godfrey Kasigazi the chief engineer Uganda Air cargo Emmanuel Kwehangana the commander of the motorized infantry brigade Brig Gen Charles Byanyima the commander of the engineers brigade Brig Besigye Bekunda the Airforce wing commander Nakasongola Brig Christopher Kasaija the Deputy General Manager Luwero industries Col Abdul Rugumayo and the commander Air Force College Col Muhwezi.

Valari Copcin the Chief Executive Officer Pro-heli international services said the facility will handle major repairs service and overhaul of Mi-18 Mi-9 and Mi-24 helicopters.

“This facility being commissioned today is able to do major repairs service and overhaul of Mi-17 (Mi-8) and Mi-24 helicopters. This in turn saves the country loss of money in transportation and general turnaround time” he said.

According to the Commander UPDF Airforce Lt. Gen. Charles Lutaaya aircraft maintenance is generally expensive but with the commissioning of the maintenance repair and overhaul facility there will be on time repair of components and reduced wastage to enhance air force combat readiness and employment capabilities.

“Assets will no longer be grounded for long periods due to lack of spares and technical expertise input as this can be now sourced from the maintenance overhaul and repair expertise” Lutaaya said.

The Chief of Defense Forces Gen Wilson Mbasu Mbadi said the facility will bring in more revenue into the economy as aircrafts from the region will be serviced here.

“I want therefore to thank your excellency on behalf of the UPDF for continuously guiding us to help us build a formidable force in the region” Gen Mbadi said.

Gen. Sabiiti said the Ministry will make huge savings on costs of handling and freight.

“A huge saving will be made on the costs currently incurred by the Ministry of Defence/UPDF on clearing handling and freight of the helicopters to repair stations abroad which is not less than USD$1200000 one way for each helicopter. For example the helicopter currently being worked on in the hanger here was recently ferried to the Nakasongola Facility just on a low loader at a cost of just USD 520 equivalent” he said.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiY2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1vcm9jY293b3JsZG5ld3MuY29tLzIwMjIvMDEvMzQ2Njg3L2dyZWVubGFuZC10ZWNobm9sb2d5LXRvLWJvbHN0ZXItcHJlc2VuY2UtaW4tbW9yb2Njb9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Greenland Technology to Bolster Presence in Morocco,Click allow to get notifications on every article we post.,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMijwFodHRwczovL3d3dy5saXZlbWludC5jb20vbWFya2V0L3N0b2NrLW1hcmtldC1uZXdzL211bHRpYmFnZ2VyLXN0b2NrLXBlbm55LXN0b2NrLXR1cm5zLXJzLTEtbGFraC10by1ycy0yLTUtY3JvcmUtaW4tMy1tb250aHMtMTE2NDI4MTUzNjYwMjUuaHRtbNIBkwFodHRwczovL3d3dy5saXZlbWludC5jb20vbWFya2V0L3N0b2NrLW1hcmtldC1uZXdzL211bHRpYmFnZ2VyLXN0b2NrLXBlbm55LXN0b2NrLXR1cm5zLXJzLTEtbGFraC10by1ycy0yLTUtY3JvcmUtaW4tMy1tb250aHMvYW1wLTExNjQyODE1MzY2MDI1Lmh0bWw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Multibagger stock: Penny stock turns ₹1 lakh to ₹2.5 crore in 3 months | Mint,"Multibagger stock: Investing is penny stocks is considered highly risky as they become highly volatile on small trigger. But for those stock market investors who believe in 'buy sell and forget' practice high volatility in such low liquid stocks may turn out a big gain provided they have checked about the company's business model and sustainability of its profitability. SEL Manufacturing Company shares are the biggest example of it. In last 3 months this multibagger penny stock has risen from ₹0.35 (close price on NSE on 27th October 2021) to ₹87.45 (close price on NSE on 21st January 2022) logging around 24900 per cent rise in this small time span.

SEL Manufacturing Company share price history

In last one week this multibagger penny stock has hit 5 per cent upper circuit on all 5 sessions yielding around 21.50 per cent to its shareholders in this period. In last year-to-date (YTD) time this is one of the potential multibagger stocks for 2022 as it has risen from ₹44.40 to ₹87.45 yielding around 97 per cent return to its shareholders this year. So the penny stock can be considered as one of the potential multibagger penny stocks for 2022 as well. It is already one of the multibagger stocks in 2021 as it has surged from ₹30.20 to ₹87.45 apiece levels appreciating around 190 per cent in this time-frame.

In last two months the multibagger share price has risen from ₹27.45 to ₹87.45 per share levels logging around 220 per cent surge in this period. However in last 3 months as mentioned above this penny stock has surged from ₹0.35 to ₹87.45 rising to the tune of 250 times in this period.

Impact on investment

Taking cue from SEL Manufacturing Company share price history if an investor had invested ₹1 lakh in this penny stock one week ago its ₹1 lakh would have turned to ₹1.21 lakh today whereas it would have turned to ₹1.97 lakh in YTD time. If an investor had invested ₹1 lakh in this multibagger penny stock one month ago its ₹1 lakh would have become ₹3.20 lakh.

Similarly if an investor had invested ₹1 lakh in this multibagger penny stock 3 months before buying one share at ₹0.35 its ₹1 lakh would have turned to ₹2.50 crore today provided the investor had remained invested in the stock throughout this period.

About SEL Manufacturing Company

After closing at ₹87.45 apiece levels on Friday the textile conglomerate share price has climbed to its new 52-week high whereas its 52-week low is ₹0.35 per share which is made in the month of October 2021. The liquidity of the stock is very low as its current market capitalization is ₹2.90 crore. It's trade volume on Friday was 53.

Asked about the reason for such rise in the stock price of the company in recent days market analysts were unable to find out any strong fundamental reason as majority of the analysts don't track such stock with lower liquidity.

Promoters of the textile conglomerate Arr Ess Leading Edge Private Limited who own near 75 per cent of the SEL Manufacturing Company shares have recently informed Indian exchanges that they have pledged SEL Manufacturing Company shares in favour of SBICAP Trustee Company Limited.

In its communication with the exchange the company promoters informed ""We wish to inform you that we Arr Ess Leading Edge Private Limited promoter of SEL Manufacturing Company Limited (""the Target Company"") have pledged 8946369 equity shares (27%) of the Target Company in favour of SBICAP Trustee Company Limited.""

He also tests both Slip Start and Off-Road Assist to figure out the best way to handle the white stuff.

We've already watched and shared several videos about how Tesla's vehicles as well as other EVs perform in snow and . However this is arguably one of the better Tesla winter driving videos we've come across this season.

The Tesla Model Y appears to fare well in deep snow which comes as no surprise since it comes standard with two motors and all-wheel drive. That said it's important to have winter tires on the car. Some people incorrectly assume that all-wheel drive means excellent snow performance but that's not necessarily the case if the car is wearing the wrong rubber.

Dax has proper snow tires on his Model Y and he takes it out after one of the first significant snowstorms in his area. He begins by driving the car down a snowy unplowed neighborhood street to get a basic idea of how it performs.

While the Model Y handles the conditions quite well he admits that there have been times the crossover has struggled even with snow tires on. Dax says he never got stuck but there were situations in which he couldn't get the car to easily move right away so he used Slip Start.

Dax goes on to explain and demonstrate Slip Start. He says it doesn't completely disengage the Model Y's traction control but it allows the wheels to spin so you can rock the car out of a ""sticky"" situation. He also discusses and demonstrates Off-Road Assist.

The Off-Road Assist setting adjusts the crossover's traction control to maximize off-road performance. Like Slip Start it allows the wheels to spin but it also makes the overall torque delivery more subtle and works to balance front and rear motor torque. This way the Model Y may not get stuck as easily and if one side of the car has better traction than the other it can accommodate.

DaxM provides the following topics and timestamps to help you navigate the video.

Now more mainstream brands like Ford Volkswagen and Volvo are getting into the game. Even Hyundai with its new EV the Ioniq 5 is coming for Tesla and according to Edmunds it’s taken the lead.

They would know too because in this head-to-head comparison the Tesla Model Y they use is the same one that they own namely a top-spec Model Y Performance with Full Self Driving. That athletic nomenclature and matching ability put it ahead of the Ioniq 5 both figuratively and literally when it comes to sporty statistics and driving engagement.

It’s also got a lot more storage space in the front and rear cargo areas than the Ioniq 5. Despite all of these benefits Edmunds still says the Tesla loses this head to head. Here’s why.

We Drive: The 2022 Hyundai Ioniq 5 Is Better Than The Tesla Model 3

First in the real world the Ioniq 5 managed to drive 270 miles (434 km) on a single charge which is further than its EPA-estimated range of 256 miles (411 km). At the same time the Model Y came in at 263 miles (423 km) which is much lower than Tesla’s claim that it’ll go 303 miles (487 km). Even more impressive to Edmunds is the fact that you can get an Ioniq 5 with even more range for less money.

Then there’s the ride and the experience in each car. The Hyundai is considerably quieter than the Tesla. Edmunds says that from day one the Model Y has had creaks and noises throughout the cabin whereas the Ioniq 5 is super quiet and feels better built. Somehow it feels quicker to respond to pedal inputs too. It’s not faster than the Tesla but the testers were impressed with how it felt both speeding up and slowing down.

Finally there’s pricing. At $58990 the base Model Y is more expensive than even the top trim Ioniq 5. Edmunds says that its build quality ride comfort and approachable tech makes the Hyundai the new king of the mountain.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRlc2xhcmF0aS5jb20vdGVzbGEtbW9kZWwteC1wbGFpZC0wLTYwLW1waC1xdWlja2VyLXRoYW4tY2xhaW1lZC12aWRlby_SAVZodHRwczovL3d3dy50ZXNsYXJhdGkuY29tL3Rlc2xhLW1vZGVsLXgtcGxhaWQtMC02MC1tcGgtcXVpY2tlci10aGFuLWNsYWltZWQtdmlkZW8vYW1wLw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Tesla Model X Plaid proves quicker than claimed in real-world 0-60 mph test,"By

The Tesla Model X Plaid may not usually receive as much attention as its sibling the Model S Plaid but the six-seat all-electric SUV is nothing to scoff at. With 1020 horsepower and three electric motors Tesla claims that the vehicle could go from 0-60 mph in just 2.5 seconds. That’s enough to give some supercars a run for their money.

If a recent real-world test is any indication however it appears that Tesla actually understated some of the Model X Plaid’s capabilities. The test was conducted by YouTube’s Vehicle Virgins channel as part of a more extensive review of the flagship SUV. The YouTube reviewer was generally impressed with the Model X Plaid noting that while it feels slightly slower than the Model S Plaid the all-electric SUV still feels very quick and responsive in its own right.

Things became extra interesting however when the auto reviewer set up a VBOX to test the Model X Plaid’s 0-60 mph performance. After engaging Drag Strip Mode and waiting for the vehicle to get ready the auto reviewer launched the flagship all-electric SUV. Surprisingly enough the Model X Plaid did not show a 0-60 mph time of 2.5 seconds like what Tesla is claiming on its official website. The vehicle completed its 0-60 mph run in 2.3 seconds instead.

A 2.3-second 0-60 mph time is pretty insane for any vehicle more so for an all-electric SUV that can comfortably carry six people. Such numbers after all are comparable to the Dodge Challenger SRT Demon which was also listed with a 0-60 mph time of 2.3 seconds. It’s also pretty close to the 0-60 mph time of the Model S Raven Performance Tesla’s quickest vehicle before the rollout of the Model S Plaid. As per Car and Driver’s tests the Model S Performance with its Cheetah Mode update showed a 0-60 mph time of 2.4 seconds.

The Tesla Model X Plaid is a premium vehicle but it actually is more affordable than its sedan sibling. As per Tesla’s online configurator the Model S Plaid is listed with a price of $129990 while the Model X Plaid is listed with a price of $126490. This makes the Model X Plaid a very good deal especially considering that it’s a large spacious SUV that can carry the entire family while out-accelerating supercars in the stoplight.

Watch the Tesla Model X Plaid’s 0-60 mph launch in the video below.

What if instead of a Tesla Powerwall people bought a Ford F-150 Lightning Pro? Jason Fenske from Engineering Explained did the math and recommended people to do precisely this.

kWh

That’s obviously not something that should be considered for all situations. However Fenske’s reasoning makes a lot of sense considering what you pay for and what you get.A Tesla Powerwall starts at $10500. If you buy four or more prices drop to $7500 each. A Ford F-150 Lightning Pro costs $41669 if you manage to find a dealer that is not fond of markups: $39974 for the price and $1695 more for destination charges.The entry-level F-150 Lightning comes with a 98battery pack. At 14 kWh each you would need 7 Tesla Powerwalls to get the same energy capacity the electric pickup truck offers. That means you would have to pay $52500 on the Tesla products. Buying the F-150 Lightning Pro would cost you less and would also put a pickup truck around the battery pack.As Fenske mentions the issue is that Powerwalls are always there charging from the solar panels. Anyone with a pickup truck would probably use it to work in the morning and get home at night. In other words they would lose the energy generated by the solar panels unless they worked at night and charged (and slept) during the day. Another hypothesis was that the F-150 was not the main vehicle for the family but rather something that would be used only every once in a while.This is not the only issue with having an electric pickup truck with V2L capability. For the F-150 Lightning Pro to work as a giant power bank it needs a Home Integration System the 80A charger and a house prepared to deal 320A. Fenske did not mention how much that would cost probably because Ford may not have defined the prices yet.Even if these things are expensive the $7500 federal tax credit should bring them significantly down. There may be incentives for Powerwalls depending on where they are installed but we are not sure about that.The main problem with getting an F-150 Lightning Pro instead of a Powerwall is that you could only get one by the end of 2023 due to the high demand for them. Ford has more than 200000 pre-orders and plans to produce all of the ones that become purchases that time. Everyone who has not yet ordered one may have to wait for the second generation which will be presented by 2024.According to Fenske’s calculations the F-150 Lightning Pro will have the best price for kWh among all the electric vehicles about which we know prices and battery pack capacities. The engineer wonders how Ford managed to offer it for such a price tag. Regardless of the answer it is worth checking the Engineering Explained video right below for other interesting insights.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMia2h0dHBzOi8vbW9iaWxlLmd1aWRlYXV0b3dlYi5jb20vZW4vYXJ0aWNsZXMvNjQxNzMvYm13LWk0LTIwMjItZXQtdGVzbGEtbW9kZWwtMy0yMDIyLWNvbXBhcm9ucy1sZXMtY2hpZmZyZXMv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,2022 BMW i4 vs. 2022 Tesla Model 3: The Numbers,"BMW has introduced a pair of next-generation electric vehicles for 2022 including the iX crossover and the i4 sedan. But how does the latter stack up against the segment-leading Tesla Model 3?

To answer that question we’ve compared the numbers and specs for these two models. Here’s what we found…

Range: Model 3

The single-motor BMW i4 eDrive40 equipped with 18-inch wheels provides a maximum range of 484 kilometres while the one riding on 19-inch wheels can travel 454 kilometres. In M50 xDrive trim which includes dual motors and all-wheel drive the i4 will cover 435 or 365 kilometres with 19- or 20-inch wheels respectively.

Over at Tesla the base Model 3 with rear-wheel drive offers 438 kilometres of range. That number increases to 507 kilometres in the case of the AWD-equipped Model 3 Performance and 536 kilometres with the Long Range variant.

While the range figures for the BMW i4 are better than initially advertised Tesla wins the battle hands down.

Charging: Tie

When plugged into a 240V charging station both the i4 and Model 3 require 10 hours to complete a full charge. The standard Model 3 is a bit quicker though (8.5 hours).

Now here are some DC fast charging times you should know about:

BMW:

11kW charger: 0-100 percent in 7.6 hours

50kW charger: 100 km of range in 22 minutes

150kW charger: 100 km of range in 7 minutes

200kW charger: 10-80 percent in 31 minutes

Tesla:

Tesla Supercharger: 282 km of range in 15 minutes

Performance: Tie

The beauty of electric cars is their instant torque delivery resulting in impressive acceleration. Consider these numbers:

BMW:

i4 eDrive40: 5.7 seconds (RWD)

i4 M50 xDrive: 3.9 seconds (AWD)

Tesla:

Model 3: 6.1 seconds (RWD)

Long Range: 4.4 seconds (AWD)

Performance: 3.3 seconds (AWD)

Practicality: Model 3

The BMW i4 has a larger rear trunk at 470 litres (1290 litres when you fold the rear seats) versus 425 litres for the Tesla Model 3. However the latter adds a front trunk for a total cargo capacity of 649 litres.

Photo: BMW AG

Both cars are designed to accommodate five people but the interior of the Model 3 is more spacious thanks to a completely flat floor. Also the i4’s swooping roofline limits headroom for taller passengers sitting in the back.

Technology and Connectivity: Tie

Highlighting the otherwise clean dashboard of the Model 3 is a 15-inch multimedia display that is also used to control the HVAC system and monitor driving data. The console has four USB ports and two wireless smartphone chargers. A premium sound system with subwoofer is available.

The more traditional i4 combines a 12.3-inch digital instrument cluster with a 14.9-inch centre touchscreen powered by the latest generation of iDrive. Apple CarPlay and Android Auto come standard.

Both models can be upgraded wirelessly with over-the-air software updates. They also boast an array of driver assistance features including semi-autonomous driving capability (Tesla Autopilot and BMW Driving Assistant Professional).

Price: i4

For once BMW is cheaper than the competition. The new i4 eDrive40 starts at $54990 plus destination while the i4 M50 xDrive retails from $72990. Provincial incentives available in British Columbia Quebec Nova Scotia Yukon and the Northwest Territories apply but not the federal rebate of up to $5000 since Ottawa has set a price limit at $45000 for vehicles with six seats or less.

The Tesla Model 3’s base price for the single-motor RWD variant has been raised to $59990 for 2022 making it ineligible to the $5000 federal rebate. As for provincial incentives only Quebec’s is still available since Tesla has strategically set the price below the $60000 limit. Drivers in La Belle Province can get $8000 off.

The Long Range and Performance variants of the Model 3 start at $66990 and $76990 respectively.

Warranty: Model 3

Tesla and BMW offer similar coverage including:

Limited vehicle warranty: 4 years/80000 km

Rust perforation warranty: 12 years/unlimited km

Battery warranty: 8 years/160000 km

Tesla’s Long Range and Performance models increase battery coverage to 8 years/192000 km giving the Model 3 a slight edge overall.

NCKU’s Honorary Doctorate Conferment Ceremony for the school year 2021 took place on December 28th. This diploma was given by the university President Dr. Huey-Jen Su to Dr. Keh-Shew Lu Chairman President and CEO of Diodes Incorporated in recognition of his great contributions toward the semiconductor sector worldwide while demonstrating a civic entrepreneurial spirit.



Dr. Keh-Shew Lu received NCKU’s Honorary Doctorate

President Dr. Su praised Keh-Shew Lu for promoting the comprehensive development of engineering and effective management in the United States and Taiwan. Lu has not only served as an example for successors to emulate but has also created a new prospect for engineering. His efforts in cultivating meaningful connections between alumni of different generations are also worthy of admiration and appreciation.

Keh-Shew Lu earned a bachelor’s degree from National Cheng Kung University in electrical engineering in 1969 and was honored with the Outstanding Alumni Award in 2008. Now Dr. Lu has been conferred upon with an honorary doctorate by his alma mater to which he gave a gracious and modest award acceptance speech saying “I am humbled flattered and very pleased to be recognized by my alma mater.”

The Honorary Doctorate Conferment Ceremony was held in the Ge-Chi Hall on December 28th. President Dr. Su pointed out that the Ge-Chi Hall serves as the epitome of NCKU’s contribution to higher education in engineering over the last 90 years. Dr. Lu recalled the weekly tests of a few important courses at the Ge-Chi Hall when he studied at NCKU from 1965. “This is what we call the spirit of NCKU. Small steps are taken to achieve big goals. Students at NCKU study hard and create a hard-working culture together.”



Dr. Lu encouraged underclassmen to adhere to NCKU’s down-to-earth spirit and promote the common good of society

When Keh-Shew Lu reminisced about some charismatic professors including Chung-Chuang Wei and Tien-Fu Wu during his studies in the Dept. of Electrical Engineering many alumni smiled as they could relate to many things that he was talking about. Dr. Lu shared how he has benefited from the down-to-earth spirit of NCKU which taught him to be a diligent and hardworking individual. He started as a junior engineer at Texas Instruments and was then promoted to be a senior manager. Years later he led Diodes Incorporated from a company with a market value of TWD10 billion to a market value of more than TWD140 billion. He humbly credited his success to his alma mater at NCKU which taught him to be down-to-earth and realistic regardless of what challenges would come along the way. Dr. Lu encouraged underclassmen to adhere to NCKU’s down-to-earth spirit and promote the common good of society no matter whether they choose to pursue a career in academia or industry.

Diodes Incorporated a publicly listed company is an integrated device manufacturer that designs manufactures package tests and sells IC components to consumer electronics companies industrial controls companies and car manufacturers worldwide.

Quah 33 was working part-time as a laboratory director at the Diagnostics Development Hub's (DxD's) clinical diagnostics laboratory. DxD is funded by the National Research Foundation and led by the Agency for Science Technology and Research (A*Star).

In response to queries from The Straits Times on Sunday (Jan 23) an A*Star spokesman said the laboratory at which Quah worked was responsible for handling cPass serology tests. These are used to check whether a person's body has produced antibodies in response to vaccination or natural infection.

The lab does not perform antigen rapid tests or polymerase chain reaction tests which are used to detect if a person has been infected by Covid-19.

Quah's role was to sign off on reports from the laboratory the spokesman said.

She added that the laboratory has a quality-management system that is ""fully auditable"".

""It has processes in place to ensure that results are accurate and traceable. The process includes routine random audits to ensure no tampering.""

DxD suspended Quah from Sunday given the ongoing investigations and has commenced an internal audit.

Checks with the Accounting and Corporate Regulatory Authority show that Quah is involved in 12 other companies. These include several GP clinics a firm offering consultancy services for healthcare organisations and a company that organises classical music events.

He is also listed as director of PPD Global Central Lab another biomedical company in Singapore. PPD an American company with offices around the world is owned by Thermo Fisher Scientific.

Quah's LinkedIn profile page states that he is also a laboratory director at PPD although it is not clear exactly what his job entails. However Thermo Fisher is known to supply certain Covid-19 tests to Singapore including one that is being used to detect the Omicron variant. The Straits Times has approached these companies for comment.

The police on Sunday released a statement saying that Quah and his clinic assistant Thomas Chua had been arrested along with Iris Koh the founder of anti-vaccine group Healing the Divide.

Preliminary investigations found that Quah and Chua 40 worked together to submit false vaccination data while Koh 46 was believed to have referred clients to them.",,,,,,,,,,,,

SPOKANE Wash. – As the PBR Pendleton Whisky Velocity Tour’s (PWVT) Spokane Classic rolled to a close on Saturday night seven-time PBR World Finals qualifier Matt Triplett (Canton South Dakota) clinched the event win.

Triplett was paired with Trasher (Howell Rodeo Company Inc.) in Round 1 of the night firing out of the chutes for an impressive round-winning 87.5 points.

As the extraordinary animal athletes of the PBR dominated all ten matchups in the championship round the 30-year-old native Montanan cowboy was bested after a mere 2.14 seconds by Agent 88 (Howell Rodeo Company Inc.) as the night ended.

The PBR veteran leaves Spokane with $7381 and 37 world points. Triplett is now ranked No. 12 in the world standings as he attempts to return to the Unleash The Beast.

Idaho native Brady Oleson (Blackfoot Idaho) was hot on Triplett’s heels earlier in the night capturing second place overall.

Oleson was paired with Big Racks of Montana (Corey & Lange Rodeo) in Round 1 for a solid 84.5 points.

He then set his sights on the championship round but was tossed to the ground by his bovine opponent Sittin Sideways (Howell Rodeo Company Inc.) in 4.28 seconds.

Oleson collected 24 world points for his efforts and is ranked No. 29 in the world standings.

Colt Robinson (Prescott Arizona) kept the 1-for-2 streak going by besting his Round 1 opponent Whirly Bird (Big Bend/ Flying Five.) for 83.5 points. He was then bucked off by Billy Hill (Corey & Lange Rodeo) in the championship round in a mere 2.91 seconds.

Robinson earned 13 world points for his third-place finish.

Home state cowboy Cody Casper (Newport Washington) battled it out to finish in fourth place at Spokane Arena.

With a determined look Casper launched from the chutes in Round 1 aboard Mate (Big Bend/ Flying Five) for a resounding 81.5 points. His 1.88-second dance with Rock The House (Corey & Lange Rodeo) as Saturday came to a close was still met with cheers from local fans.

The Washington cowboy heads home with eight world points.

Dawson Branton (Prineville Oregon) and Thor Hoefer II (Priest River Idaho) finished in a tie to round out the Top 5.

In Round 1 Branton was paired with Hurricane Deck (Big Bend/Flying Five) for 80.5 points. Hoefer mirrored the score in his confident ride aboard his first-round opponent Uncle Touchy (Howell Rodeo Company Inc.).

Neither cowboy made the 8 in the championship round but their earlier rides netted them 4.5 world points each.

The talented bull riders of the PWVT will next head to Grand Rapids Michigan for the PBR Tractor Supply Co. Classic at Van Andel Arena Jan. 28-29. Additionally in a double-up weekend the PWVT will also be back in action again in Jacksonville Florida for the Jacksonville Invitational on Jan. 29 at Veterans Memorial Arena.

The Points Guy launched an app last September billed as a “one-stop shop” where consumers can track all their loyalty rewards for airlines hotels and credit cards in one place helping travelers redeem their earned miles.

But American claims the Points Guy uses the airline’s intellectual property unlawfully and wants it to stop. Brian Kelly CEO and founder of the Points Guy says consumers should have a choice about how to use their data.

Matters escalated earlier this month when American sent a cease-and-desist letter asking the Points Guy not to collect data related to its AAdvantage members. The Points Guy or TPG then filed a lawsuit against American Jan. 11 in state court in Delaware where American is incorporated. American in turn sued TPG and its parent company Red Ventures Jan. 18 in federal court in Texas where the airline is headquartered.

American’s suit accuses TPG and its corporate parent of “essentially free-riding on decades of investment by American” in building up its AAdvantage loyalty program.

The airline says its website use agreement prohibits AAdvantage members from giving account access to “any third party on-line service including but not limited to any mileage management service mileage tracking service or mileage aggregation service” and alleges TPG is causing customers to breach that agreement for its own benefit.

“Red Ventures is accessing AA.com and AAdvantage customer account data in a way that does not comply with our standards for use of confidential information” airline spokesperson Andrew Trull said in an emailed statement. “We have been in discussions with Red Ventures hoping to amicably resolve the issues and we were surprised when Red Ventures filed its lawsuit last Tuesday. We take customer data and proprietary information incredibly seriously and want to make sure it is protected and secure.”

Kelly considers American’s actions “short-sighted” particularly at a time when the industry is recovering from declines in air travel during the pandemic.

“We believe it’s the consumer’s choice” said Kelly who grew up in Jamison and now lives in New Hope. “If our reader wants us to help them look at the big picture and take a trip that’s a win for the travel industry.”

Describing how the TPG app works in its own lawsuit the Points Guy says users “provide TPG with their login credentials and authorize TPG to gather their account information and data by accessing the relevant loyalty program websites.”

TPG claims American is “the only major U.S. airline whose loyalty program miles expire” to the detriment of consumers while the TPG app helps travelers navigate those deadlines.

American did not comment on that aspect of the suit when asked by The Inquirer.

As Kelly explained it starting April 1 AAdvantage members’ miles will expire after 18 months of no activity. That said he noted it’s “pretty easy to keep them active” such as by using a credit card linked to the program.

“That’s actually what we educate people on at the Points Guy” he said.

Kelly started the Points Guy in 2010 and it was acquired in 2017 by Red Ventures which owns a suite of consumer-facing brands that include Lonely Planet.

According to TPG’s lawsuit the company’s website has 11 million unique visitors every month and its app has already been downloaded more than 100000 times.

Kelly likened the app’s purposes to third-party sites like Mint that allow users to track their bank account activity and personal finances in one spot.

“This is the 21st century” Kelly said. “Consumers want to access their data in ways that will help them.”",,,,,,,,,,,,

Andrew Neva owner and vice president of operations at the Northwest Meat Company in Chicago has seen this impact firsthand.

In a recent interview with FOX Business Network’s Grady Trimble Neva shared the news that he purchased about $25000 to $30000 worth of meat to prepare for restaurant demand — but the pandemic has presented unexpected challenges for his business.

INFLATION: TIPS FOR SAVING ON HOLIDAY MEATS

""Prior to omicron I purchased all this product because as we know everyone wanted to get out. So I bought all this product in October had to pay for it in November"" Neva explained.

""Then when omicron came … all my high-end steakhouses canceled their reservations. So as a result now I’m sitting on all this product that I still haven’t gotten paid on.""

These unsold high-end cuts are now sitting in the wholesale meat distributor’s freezer as the company awaits a change in demand.

BIDEN TO TARGET MEATPACKING GIANTS OVER SURGING INFLATION

In a phone interview with FOX Business Digital on Sunday Neva said the current surge of COVID-19 infections has led to more consumers sheltering in place rather than going out to dine at restaurants.

As of Jan. 23 2022 data from the Johns Hopkins COVID-19 Dashboard shows that more than 283890 people have been infected with the respiratory virus in a 28-day period in Cook County — which is home to Chicago the third-largest city in the U.S.

The state of Illinois as a whole has seen 752060 infections in the same period according to the online tracker.

""With the omicron variant in Chicago and the sheer number of people becoming sick and then obviously the fear of gathering in large groups especially indoors you've had a lot of cancellations"" Neva said. ""The portion of the business that was affected was kind of your high-end steakhouses. You know those are for your holiday parties your once-a-year gatherings your special events.""

NYC STEAKHOUSE OWNER SAYS HE LOST MILLIONS IN BUSINESS DUE TO CITY'S VACCINE MANDATE

He continued ""Well those are going to be the first to go and they were the first to go. So therefore any of the product I bought for that high-end market is still on my shelf.""

Restaurants that haven’t canceled wholesale orders are sitting on cuts of meat as well and are likely storing it in their coolers until regular dining business eats it all Neva added.

While Neva expects to see a modest industry rebound around Valentine’s Day other factors that are possibly playing a role in thawed meat demand include rising prices and severe winter storms.

""It's a lot more expensive to go out. Inflation is rampant in our industry. Our food inflation is hovering around 20%. So if you go out it's going to cost you a lot more"" Neva said.

""Plus the weather — we had a major snowstorm. If you get a massive snowstorm then forget about it.""

Neva continued ""My clients are planning [on] special venues and all that. But what people do will remain to be seen.""

He also said ""I'm going to plan for it but at the end of the day it’s going to be what it's going to be and I'm just going to ride with it.""",,,,,,,,,,,,

On Jan. 23 2019 Zephen Xaver walked into the SunTrust Bank along U.S. 27 south of Lake Jackson opened fire and killed five women inside.

Four of the five victims were working inside the bank when they were shot: Ana Pinon-Williams Debra Cook Marisol Lopez and Jessica Montague. The fifth victim was a customer named Cynthia Watson.

According to the Sebring Police Department Xaver called law enforcement shortly after 12:30 p.m. and said he fired shots inside the bank. The then-21-year-old who was armed and wearing a bullet-proof vest barricaded himself inside. Deputies and officers responded and surrounded the building with guns drawn.

After a two-hour standoff Highlands County deputies moved in with an armored vehicle and took Xaver into custody.

Police said they haven't found any connection between suspect Xaver and the victims. It also did not appear that there had been any attempt to rob the bank.

""We have no information as to what his true motive may have been"" Sebring Police Chief Karl Hoglund said during a previous interview. ""We believe it was a random act.""

Sebring shooting victims

Marisol Lopez Jessica Montague Debra Cook and Ana Piñon-Williams were working at the SunTrust branch on U.S. 27 when Xaver opened fire. A customer Cynthia Watson was also killed in the attack.

Following the shooting Piñon-Williams' brother-in-law made a public statement on behalf of the family. He said the mother of seven was devoted to her family and her faith ""truly a light in this world.""

""Loving her was easy. Living without her will be hard. Our family will not only survive but we will thrive"" Tim Williams said.

Bank employee Marisol Lopez 55 leaves behind her husband and two children. Her Facebook profile picture shows her smiling with a loved one. That smile is how longtime neighbor Gil Osborne said he will remember her.

""She had the best personality always friendly always smiling and always generous"" Osborne told FOX 13 News in an earlier interview.

Officials said there was another employee in the bank at the time of the shooting. Law enforcement did not name the employee but said the person was in a back room when shots were fired. They were able to escape and call for help.

Who is Zephen Xaver?

The man police say shot and killed five people in a Sebring Florida SunTrust bank Wednesday was described by a woman who knew him as ""normal"" and ""well-mannered.""

Sharon Spillane a friend of Xaver’s parents told FOX 13 in 2019 that she never in a million years saw this coming.

""We’ve cooked together I’ve been in their house we’ve watched movies. They’re a very normal family"" Spillane said. ""He had a job and he was very quiet and very well-mannered. Anytime that I saw him he was very well-mannered always good posture and well-spoken.""

Featured article

However Xaver’s ex-girlfriend paints a different picture. In a previous interview with FOX 13 Alex Gerlach said Xaver was obsessed with guns and knives.

""The only thing I can remember is him talking about guns and wanting guns"" Gerlach said in a 2019 interview. ""He wants to hurt people physically.""

According to Gerlach she met Xaver in a psychiatric hospital in 2013. She said they dated off and on for about two years.

""At one point my mother was terrified because she thought he was going to physically harm me"" explained Gerlach who described Xaver as a troubled teen. ""For some reason he always hated people and wanted everybody to die.""

Featured article

Gerlach said Xaver continued to make chilling comments over the years and said one week before the shooting he sent her a picture of him holding a gun.

""I've been scared for years and every single person I've told has not taken it seriously and it's very unfortunate it had to come to this"" she said in 2019.

Documents provided by the Bremen Police Department in Indiana state officers went to Xaver's high school in 2014 after school officials said he was having disturbing thoughts.

Featured article

The documents state Xaver told school officials he had dreams of hurting his classmates. According to the police report Xaver's mother agreed to take her son to a behavioral health center.

The Florida Department of Corrections confirmed Xaver was a correctional officer trainee with Avon Park Correctional Institution for about two months. He resigned two weeks before the shooting.

What happened to the Sebring SunTrust Bank building?

SunTrust decided not to reopen the bank where the massacre took place and had the building torn down five months later.

""I think it’s a good thing. I couldn’t imagine walking into the building myself"" Sebring resident Jake McClelland said in an interview with FOX 13 in 2019.

""When you drive by and you happen to look on that side of the road you know it’s always in the back of your mind"" said resident Joe Minshew.

One year after the shooting a new park honoring the five lives lost was dedicated on the land where the band once stood.

Reflection Park features a memorial with a pentagon-shaped plaque with sunbeams from the SunTrust bank logo emblazoned on it. Each side of the plaque represents one of the five lives lost during the massacre. On it a plaque reads ""the light shines in the darkness and the darkness can never extinguish it.""

The Sebring Police Department marked the third anniversary of the shooting on its Facebook page with photos of lit candles and the caption ""Always in our Hearts.""

What's next for accused Sebring shooting suspect Zephen Xaver?

Xaver is facing five counts of first-degree murder for the Sebring shooting and could be sentenced to death. A hearing has been set for Feb. 4 and his trial is scheduled for May 2 2022. He has pleaded not guilty.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMikgFodHRwczovL3d3dy4xMWFsaXZlLmNvbS9hcnRpY2xlL25ld3MvbG9jYWwvYXRsYW50YS1kb3dudG93bi1zdHJlZXQtY2xvc3VyZXMtc2F0dXJkYXktdHJ1aXN0LXBsYXphLWJ1aWxkaW5nLzg1LWEwNTFhZjRmLTk2ZTgtNGUzZi1hYjNhLWFkNzdmNzlmZTUxNNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Atlanta street closures Saturday downtown | 11alive.com,"The closures will remain in effect until this afternoon.

Today we continue our movie roundtable series with four movies known for being true-to-life: “A League of Their Own” “42” “The Rookie” and “Eight Men Out.” Our panelists -- Mark Bowman Ian Browne Christina DeNicola Alyson Footer Steve Gilbert and Bill Ladson -- conducted a spirited debate diving into the nuances of each film. A note on the selection process: All movies debated were placed into brackets which brought forth a little bit of a conundrum given the high volume of terrific baseball movies that could easily fall into more than one category. “Best Ensemble Cast” was probably the most wide-ranging; after all it’s fair to say 80 percent of all baseball movies had A-plus A-list casts. But we placed movies in only one bracket each which is how “A League of Their Own” ended up in Based on a True Story and not Best Ensemble. Clearly this classic fits almost every category -- because it is a nearly flawless film. Previous movie roundtables:

• Best ensemble

• Best Hollywood ending

• Let the kids play! Best baseball movies featuring children

Alyson Footer editor/moderator: Baseball movies draw a wide range of opinions. Some people for example love “Major League” some don’t. Most love “Bull Durham” but not everyone. But it seems like everyone loves “A League of Their Own.” Fair comment? Ian Browne Red Sox beat reporter: Oh my gosh. “A League of Their Own"" is such a good movie. I watched it yesterday maybe for the first time since I saw it in the theater in 1992. I honestly forgot how good it was. Geena Davis is just spectacular in this. I love her sibling bond/rivalry with her sister. Christina DeNicola Marlins beat reporter: There may be no crying in baseball but there's one thing for certain: You've got to be a robot if you're not teary-eyed by the end of it. Footer: I fully boo-hoo every time and I've seen it 30 times. Steve Gilbert D-backs beat reporter: I think ""A League of Their Own"" is one of the most if not the most underrated baseball movies. Browne: Agree. I was thinking that as I re-watched. There are no flaws in that movie. Some baseball movies seem bound to go over the top with schmaltz. This really seemed so genuine. Bill Ladson MLB.com reporter: Prior to 1992 my all-time baseball movie was Pride of the Yankees because Gary Cooper did a great job playing Lou Gehrig. But then I saw ""A League of their Own"" -- Penny Marshall did one heck of a job directing the film. I thought Geena Davis was an actual baseball player. My favorite scene was Davis and Lori Petty colliding at the plate. I thought I was watching a real game. The song “This Used to be My Playground"" by Madonna brought tears to my eyes because the lyrics reminded me so much of the time I played baseball in the Astoria Projects in Queens New York. DeNicola: That song for the closing credits and with the actual ballplayers on the field?! Gilbert: The best-ever line in a baseball movie comes from ""A League of Their Own"" and it's not the “no crying” one. I think the scene when Dottie is leaving and she says to Jimmy Dugan that it just got to be too hard and he comes back with ""It's supposed to be hard. If it were easy everyone would do it. The hard is what makes it great."" -- That spoke to me as someone who has been around the game for a long time. Browne: Unlike most baseball movies the ending leaves you really conflicted. Because you’ve become attached to Geena’s character Dottie and her sister Kit who is played wonderfully by Lori Petty you don’t want either team to lose the World Series. The play at the plate where Kit rams into Dottie and the ball squirts free is a perfect ending. Deep down you wonder if maybe Dottie purposely let it get away.

Footer: She definitely did. DeNicola: There’s still debate about whether she dropped it on purpose! When you can keep the people talking this many decades later that's impressive. Browne: Yeah that's why I think it was so well done. There's ambiguity. Like maybe she subconsciously dropped it! Ladson: I think she didn't drop the ball on purpose. Also I loved the part when Lori Petty threw the rock after she was traded. Mark Bowman Braves beat reporter: ""A League of Their Own"" is one of those movies you stop to watch every time you find it while channel surfing. The comedy Jon Lovitz Tom Hanks Rosie O'Donnell and Madonna provide is tremendous. The movie provides a good feel what the women experienced while playing in this league. So it successfully blends comedy and history. Browne: Amazing to think that in 1992 Tom Hanks was well-established as mainly a great comedy actor. We go back and watch the movie now realizing he became one of the best actors of our lifetime playing so many huge roles from “Forrest Gump” to “Philadelphia” to “Cast Away” to “Saving Private Ryan” and on and on. He was fantastic as Jimmy Dugan basically falling asleep at the games after taking over the Rockford Peaches in the early scenes and then falling in love with the team to the point that he bypasses a Triple-A job at the end of the movie so he can keep managing these women. The arc of Jimmy’s character -- from a lost booze-bag to someone who gets his life back together -- is really well done. And no line has ever stood up more than ""There's no crying in baseball!"" Jimmy would not have been happy with what he saw in the 2003 Red Sox Game 7 ALCS clubhouse when giant men like David Ortiz were slumped over a couch sobbing.

Bowman: I just don't know why Kit didn't intentionally walk her sister with first base open in the ninth inning of Game 7. Guess she was just setting up the chance to score the dramatic winning run in the bottom half. Footer: Some of the real-life women who played in the AAGBPL have done a lot of interviews about the movie over the years and I love that they all say it's pretty true to life. The only thing they’ve quibbled with was the way the chaperones were portrayed. Shirley Burkovich said the chaperones were among the most important people in the players' lives; a lot of them were barely out of their teen years and living away from home for the first time. Chaperones were hugely important not nuisances. That’s pretty much the only thing the real players took exception with. DeNicola: So much of the film still resonates to this day. There's a line -- and I'm paraphrasing -- that Rosie O'Donnell's character says about how she was always a ""weird girl strange girl"" just because she could play. It doesn't happen as much now thankfully but if you're a girl playing sports you're seen different. Happened to me. Footer: The end scene when they all pour into the Hall of Fame to see the exhibit for the first time was so well done. Gilbert: It brought it all together at the end. Seeing Stillwell who lost his mom ... pretty touching. Ladson: One of the best endings I ever saw. Browne: This honestly might be the least-flawed of all baseball movies. DeNicola: So well done! I had a chance to meet a few of the ballplayers at the 2015 All-Star Game. Still one of my favorite moments. I got chills. Footer: Three members of the AAGPBL -- now in their 80s and 90s -- attend MLB's Trailblazer Series (a baseball tournament for girls ages 9-11) every year. They sit in the stands and literally watch these games from morning until the end of the day. Maybelle Blair (92 years old at the last tourney) brings her glove with her -- signed by Joe Torre -- and asks the kids to play catch. A few have taken her up on it. She still has a strong arm and pinpoint aim. Let’s move on to “The Rookie.” I re-watched it recently and while I was “meh” on the storyline as a whole I did find myself getting a little emotional when Jim Morris got news of the callup to the big leagues and when he got word in the ‘pen to start warming up. During my years covering the Astros beat there was nothing I loved more than covering guys when they got their first call to the big leagues. It never ever gets old. I felt like the way they portrayed it in “The Rookie” was pretty close to how this stuff happens.

DeNicola: It was a great reminder the Rays have been finding pitchers out of nowhere for years! Browne: Yes “The Rookie” is not a great movie. But it's one of those that leaves you entertained as you sit in your seat. It is kind of like a ""comfort food"" type of movie. Gilbert: It stayed pretty close to the actual story as well. Ladson: I thought this was going to be a boring film but I was impressed with the way Dennis Quaid played Jim Morris. Quaid’s perseverance was convincing -- going from a chemistry teacher/high school baseball coach to having a cup of coffee with the Devil Rays. The confrontations that Morris had with his father were sad because the father moved the family too many times when Morris was a kid.

Browne: Dennis Quaid to use a bad baseball cliché knocks it out of the park as Jim Morris. Forget about the movie for just a second. What a great human-interest story if probably turned up a few notches by Hollywood. Looking back I’m surprised more wasn’t made of the actual story when it happened in 1999. Must have been because MLB.com wasn’t around yet! Gilbert: It felt more like a family-relationship movie than a hardcore baseball movie if that makes sense. DeNicola: Exactly! The father/son dynamic in particular. Quaid not wanting to become his father and yet still wanting his approval. I've lived in Miami my whole life so seeing the impact one person's accomplishments can have on a small town is truly remarkable and moving.

Browne: Baseball movies so often seem to come down to fathers and sons right? No different here. Jim had a very icy relationship with his dad who moved the family around a lot and had little interest in Jim’s love for baseball. But Jim eventually realizes he was also being stubborn with his dad and took some accountability for the relationship not being what it should have been. Jim didn’t know his dad was at his debut until he saw him out of the corner of his eye while he was talking with reporters. That is pretty touching when he gives his dad the ball. His dad said poignantly after missing so many games in Jim’s youth “I wasn’t going to miss this one.” And it was Brian Cox the amazing lead character of Succession! Ladson: I loved that part of the movie. Footer: A nice father-son portrayal and I believe we're 6-for-6 in roundtable movies in the category of unrealistic media portrayals. Browne: Yes but spoiler alert that streak might end before this discussion is over! Maybe it is over the top but I liked the scene when Jim got out of his car at one of those speed trap spots on the road and fired the ball and thought it said ’76’. Then for dramatic effect when he turned his back the bulbs on the original ‘7’ fill out and become a 9. DeNicola: I would love to know if that actually works. Bowman: “The Rookie” was a story that might have seemed too good to be true for Disney before it actually happened. Love the story. But the movie itself just felt average. It's certainly not one I look forward to finding when looking for something to watch. Footer: Next up: “42.” I saw it twice in the theater in one week but while I’d like to say it was because I was so moved by the movie (which I was) it was more because Chris Meloni played Leo Durocher and I needed to see that more than once. But “42” was really well-done and the subject matter was a tough one given the language and abuse that Jackie Robinson had to endure while he broke the color barrier. From everything we’ve read on this piece of our history the movie seemed to jibe with reality. Gilbert: Considering Rachel Robinson thought it accurately represented what went on I think it's safe to say you're right about it being realistic. DeNicola: Revisiting “42” for the first time since Chadwick Boseman's death was very emotional. He was such a great actor and from all reports an even better person. Browne: I loved the movie. I actually got to go to a private screening with the Red Sox in 2013 at a theater in Fort Myers. I remember Jackie Bradley Jr. being blown away and really impacted by the movie. Ladson: I saw the Jackie Robinson story which starred Jackie Robinson and Chadwick Boseman was better playing Robinson in “42.” This is the movie where Boseman made a name for himself and what a job he did. I loved the way he showed his emotions while facing racism especially when he was facing Ben Chapman of the Phillies. Boseman broke his bat and nearly had a nervous breakdown. I also loved Harrison Ford as Branch Rickey. I thought I was going to love the Pee Wee Reese character the person people said helped Robinson the most in real life but I ended up loving the Eddie Stanky character more. I liked the confrontation between Stanky and Chapman. Stanky was always defending Robinson and challenged Chapman to a fight for all the racist language Chapman used against Robinson.

Browne: Two words: Harrison Ford. He is a dominant force as Branch Rickey throughout the entire movie. Nearly every line catches your attention. “I want someone who has the courage not to fight back!” That’s powerful stuff. I just loved him in this movie. Never could have pictured him in such a role when I saw ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"" when I was like 10. Bowman: I do want to believe Branch Rickey was exactly how he was portrayed by Ford. Browne: The Durocher character was so outstanding that I'm bummed he was suspended for the 1947 season. I would have loved to see him manage the whole season. Durocher would have destroyed Ben Chapman and that would have been amazing. Gilbert: The scenes with the Phillies manager are really hard to watch but it really slaps you in the face with what Robinson had to face. You think you have an understanding of it but you see those scenes and you're reminded of just how horrific it truly was. Footer: Former lefty reliever C.J. Nitkowski played the pitcher during the horrible scene with Chapman and C.J. said later he was just counting the minutes until that day of shooting was over. It was terrible for everyone. DeNicola: Got to show some love to André Holland as well who was superb in Moonlight and did a nice job as Wendell Smith. Bowman: “42” is one of the best sports films you will ever find. One of the best compliments I can give is that I didn't want to see it end. I wanted to continue to follow a story I know pretty well. But that's because Boseman Ford and so many others gave you reason to believe you truly were a part of that great journey.

Browne: I agree that Boseman was amazing as Jackie Robinson. So much so that it hit me like a truck when I heard about his death. I think he did a great job of not romanticizing the character. Even though others thought he was a hero Boseman’s performance shows what an internal struggle this all was for Jackie. Footer: Another tear-jerking moment for me was the very end when they showed all the photos of real-life Jackie and Rachel Robinson. Gilbert: When you see Jackie with the grey hair. It hits you the toll this took on him physically. Browne: I noted in a previous roundtable how the media is never portrayed accurately or well in baseball movies. This might be an exception. I loved Wendell Smith -- played by André Holland -- in this movie. “I’m going to be your Boswell"" he tells Jackie early in the movie. All the scenes with him are great. He tells Jackie he needs to “slow things down” with the media just like he does when he is playing. Ladson: I wished the movie went past 1947. I wanted more. I wished they showed Jackie Robinson's entire baseball career. Browne: I thought the sportswriter character -- the sportswriter Holland was cast to play -- comes off as very believable for that era. Ladson: But he had to do his work in the stands. I hated it. Gilbert: His character was great. I think it showed that racism wasn't just a baseball issue but how it impacted others as well. I mean Wendell couldn't sit in the press box. It's so hard to understand how that's even possible. A good reminder that Jackie paved the way not just for baseball players of color but from all walks of life. Bowman: Yeah I thought Holland was great. Wendell Smith played a significant role in this journey. He influenced the thoughts of countless individuals from the time Jackie signed with Brooklyn. DeNicola: And he warned Jackie about the types of questions he would get as soon as he stepped on the field for Spring Training that first day! Browne: It was just such a nice thing that at least one baseball movie decided not to make a sportswriter look like a bumbling idiot! In fact quite the opposite. Footer: “42” is a movie that needs to be shown in every classroom of every school in America. DeNicola: Absolutely. Heck to everyone in America. Bowman: I loved the scene when they were in Cincinnati and Pee Wee Reese stands with Jackie before the game starts. Loved hearing him say something like ""Maybe we can all wear 42 tomorrow so that they won't be able to tell us apart.""

Footer: And look at what we do now every April 15 ... Browne: Prophetic! Ladson: A lot of historians say that pat on the back was fake. I hear a lot more about Gil Hodges' role with Jackie Robinson. DeNicola: I suppose with any ""based on a true story"" we have to accept some creative licenses will be made for the sake of cinema. Browne: I would have liked one highlight from the 1947 World Series. That's my only baseball critique. They played the Yankees right? That's pretty huge. Footer: Let's move on to “Eight Men Out.” Guilty pleasure for me (see what I did there). I love the cast. John Cusack is one of the great actors of our time. Gilbert: I fell in love with the Buck Weaver character. When Buck plays with the kids on the street and his scene with Kid Gleason before Game 1 and talking about playing the game for free. I felt for Buck at the end. Browne: By far one of the most serious baseball movies I’ve ever seen. Not a lot of frills or comedy. Just one big fat scandal. A little bit of the beauty of the movie is what we still don’t know to this day. How involved was Joe Jackson in the scandal? Is he mostly as innocent as the movie makes him seem? Eddie Cicotte was very happy to be on the take but even he had mixed feelings when he won Game 7 to keep his team alive in the series demanding to his manager that he wanted to pitch that game. DeNicola: This was probably my least favorite of these films but mainly because it didn't deal with an underdog. What was it about the late 1980s and baseball films?

Browne: I agree that it wasn't a wildly entertaining movie to watch. But to me that doesn't detract from it being an important movie. Ladson: It’s always interesting to see how baseball was played back in the early 20th century. While I feel bad for Buck Weaver and Shoeless Joe Jackson the movie made me feel sad for Charles Comiskey the owner. He was expecting to win the 1919 World Series and was furious that he didn’t get the big prize. It’s sad the White Sox decided to fix the series because they didn't like the way they were getting paid by the owner. John Cusack was outstanding as Weaver and he convinced me that he was innocent and never should have been suspended. Gilbert: At least they got Shoeless Joe hitting from the left side (properly) unlike Field of Dreams. I agree Bill. I felt worse for Buck than I did for Shoeless Joe. Browne: John Cusack does a great job as Buck Weaver. He certainly acts as if he had nothing to do with the fix and it is believable by how he played in the series yet he was ultimately banned from baseball. The movie just gives you a lot to think about. I think Buck just had a much stronger personality than Joe. At least if you believe their portrayals in the movie. Joe seemed like kind of a weak character. He just loved to hit and was great at baseball. Maybe not a lot going on between the ears though? Ladson: Weaver wasn't able to prove his innocence. Browne: How about the scene with Lefty “0 and 3 in the World Series” Williams when the gambler asks him if he likes his wife? Lefty confirms that he does and the gambler tells him she will be dead if the White Sox win Game 8. No pressure right? Bowman: Count me among the many who have long been intrigued by Shoeless Joe Jackson. I thought the movie did a good job of stoking the debate about how much Jackson had to do with the fix. His play and production certainly didn't indicate he was throwing the series. But he was part of the conversation and didn't inform the team. Still feel bad for a guy who may not have realized what he was getting into. Gilbert: I want to know if Landis was really swatting flies when the owners were trying to hire him. Footer: I do think it's an important film to have been made even if it's not award-worthy. When you see the actual games being thrown you realize how disgusting it is. Browne: Yes it's really nauseating. And the book and subsequent movie really brought this to the forefront and educated people about an important if very sad baseball scandal. Gilbert: It really helped humanize the people involved. DeNicola: Absolutely and that's what you usually want to see in a film. You want the viewer to sympathize or feel bad for the characters because there are areas of gray. David Strathairn as Eddie is a perfect example.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMicmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJsb29tYmVyZy5jb20vbmV3cy9hcnRpY2xlcy8yMDIyLTAxLTIzL3Utcy1zdG9ja3MtaGlzdG9yaWNhbGx5LWRlbGl2ZXItc3Ryb25nLWdhaW5zLWluLWZlZC1oaWtlLWN5Y2xlc9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,U.S. Stock Investment News and Federal Reserve Analysis,"Why did this happen?

His visit went quite well with Van Buren receiving an offer from the Hokies during his time in Blacksburg.

Unsurprisingly Van Buren was excited to receive a Hokies' offer as he shared with us.

""I grew up being a Virginia Tech fan. There are lots of students and players from my area who have attended and played there. So I was honored that Coach (Tyler) Bowen extended an official offer. Virginia Tech is a great school I have friends there and I could see myself as a Hokie"" Van Buren said.

Van Buren's conversation with offensive coordinator Tyler Bowen went quite well overall as he shared with us.

""My conversation with Coach Bowen was very genuine and he was telling me how he was pumped to have me up there and how he loved my film and how I fit exactly what they’re looking for in a quarterback"" Van Buren said.

Michael Van Buren also spent a lot of time with QBs coach Brad Glenn and had this to say about his time and conversations with Glenn.

""My time and conversation with Coach Glenn was great. We talked about his coaching style and what he expects from his quarterbacks. Overall we were just getting to know each other a little bit so we can start to build that relationship that will carry on throughout my recruitment"" Van Buren said.

Overall Van Buren's visit went quite well beyond just his good conversations with Tyler Bowen and Brad Glenn.

""My visit as a whole was amazing. I got to know a lot more about Virginia Tech that I didn’t know. I got to see a lot more of the campus since the only time I was there was for a game but I also actually got to spend time with the coaches build a relationship with them have great conversations and gain knowledge from them"" Van Buren said.

While there was a lot that went well during Van Buren's visit the genuineness and energy of the coaching staff was at the top of the list of what stood out.

""What stood out to me was how genuine and energetic all the coaches were. I could really tell that they want the best for all of their players that they truly love Blacksburg and as new staff they want to keep the great legacy going with Coach (Brent) Pry as the new head coach"" Van Buren said.

The fact that Virginia Tech left this strong of an impression on Michael Van Buren is a great start for someone who likely will be one of their top 2024 offensive targets. He's also poised to be one of the top 2024 quarterbacks in the country with nine offers now from Virginia Tech Michigan Penn State Pittsburgh Maryland Boston College Georgia Tech Arizona and Temple.

So how does this visit impact Virginia Tech's standing in the recruitment of Michael Van Buren?

""Virginia Tech’s football staff facilities and campus are top notch and impressive. It is a historic school and I have kept up with them for awhile. Given all of this including that it’s close to home visiting and getting the offer gives me a lot to think about.""",,,,,,,,,
TSN,Tyson Foods,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFya2Fuc2Fzb25saW5lLmNvbS9uZXdzLzIwMjIvamFuLzIzL2Fya2Fuc2FzLWJ1c2luZXNzLWV4ZWN1dGl2ZS1jb250cmlidXRlcy10by1kb3plbnMv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Arkansas business executive contributes to dozens of Republican congressional races | Arkansas Democrat Gazette,"



WASHINGTON -- Poultry executive Ronald Cameron is quietly dropping big money on the congressional midterm election fight channeling funds to Republican candidates across the country as the party aims to retake control on Capitol Hill.

Cameron the chairman of Mountaire Corp. keeps a low public profile despite his history of high-dollar contributions to Republican groups. Many of his contributions are tied to a post office box in Little Rock according to filings from the Federal Election Commission.

Mountaire is the fourth-largest chicken company in America according to its website. Cameron's grandfather founded the company more than a century ago.

For the 2022 midterm election cycle Cameron has poured more than $1.9 million into direct efforts to help Republicans gain control in the U.S. House and Senate either through political action committee spending or contributions to individual campaigns according to available campaign finance filings. The funds were received from November 2020 to September 2021. Those contributions are on top of more than $2 million he's sent to other political committees during the midterm election cycle.

Fourth-quarter contributions to House and Senate campaigns covering October through December are to be filed with the election commission by the end of this month.

Emails and phone calls seeking to reach Cameron for comment were unsuccessful. Mountaire did not respond to emailed questions from the Arkansas Democrat-Gazette.

These political contributions -- totaling at least $3.9 million so far this midterm election season -- make Cameron one of the biggest political donors in Arkansas said Karen Sebold an assistant professor of political science at the University of Arkansas Fayetteville.

""So you hear about Michael Bloomberg all the time. You hear about George Soros all the time. But you don't hear about Ronnie Cameron very often"" Sebold said. ""So that's what kind of makes him unique is that he is right up there with those big donors those big spenders. But he doesn't receive that kind of attention because most people aren't familiar with him.""

The chicken mogul has traditionally given to GOP groups and to conservative Super PACs like Club For Growth Action and Americans for Prosperity Action said Sebold who specializes in campaign finance. Cameron has contributed $2 million between those two groups in this midterm election cycle according to available election commission data.

Republicans in this election cycle are pushing to gain power in Congress. Democrats are operating with a razor-thin majority in the Senate. In the House Democrats hold a slim majority but many party incumbents are retiring or seeking other offices.

Democratic Party of Arkansas Chairman Grant Tennille said Cameron holds a significant amount of influence. But based on his low public profile Cameron appears to prefer to wield that power out of the limelight Tennille said.

The typical Republican voter in Arkansas won't likely know about Cameron and the influence he holds in the state and across the nation Tennille said.

Over the years Cameron has given millions of dollars to political committees that have supported former President Donald Trump.

Earlier in the coronavirus pandemic the Trump White House announced that Cameron would be part of a panel of advisers on economic revival.

""That's a high-profile position for someone out of the state of Arkansas"" Sebold said.

The political spending Sebold said grants Cameron a proximity to people in power who can benefit his industry.

Cameron's grandfather Guy Cameron founded Mountaire in 1914 and the company started processing chickens in De Queen decades later according to its website.

Mountaire Corp. along with operating affiliates Mountaire Farms Inc. and Mountaire Farms of Delaware Inc. has people at facilities in Arkansas Delaware Maryland Virginia and North Carolina the company says on its website.

Republican congressional campaigns across the nation reported receiving more than $420000 from Ronald Cameron between March and September of last year according to available election commission filings.

Tens of thousands of dollars went to more than two dozen Republicans who in January 2021 voted to reject results from the 2020 presidential election. Those lawmakers voted in favor of tossing presidential election results from Arizona Pennsylvania or both.

The votes in the House came after a mob backing Trump fought its way into the U.S. Capitol in an attempt to stop the certification of President Joe Biden's election victory.

Cameron is backing a variety of candidates from well-established Republicans like House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy of California and Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida to newer members of Congress.

During this election cycle Cameron has contributed to Reps. Lauren Boebert of Colorado and Madison Cawthorn of North Carolina two Republicans who have stoked controversy while in office.

Boebert faced backlash last year when video surfaced of her making comments against Rep. Ilhan Omar D-Minn. Critics denounced those comments as Islamophobic.

The video posted on Twitter showed Boebert implying that Omar was mistakenly thought to be a terrorist while at the Capitol.

""I look to my left and there she is Ilhan Omar. And I said 'Well she doesn't have a backpack; we should be fine'"" Boebert said garnering claps from an audience.

Cameron's donation to Boebert came months before the video of her remarks against Omar made headlines.

Cameron is also backing Arkansas incumbents. He gave money to the reelection campaigns of Sen. John Boozman of Rogers and Rep. French Hill of Little Rock.

Cameron isn't the only Arkansan spending big during the midterm election season. Available filings show that Warren Stephens the chairman president and CEO of Stephens Inc. has poured $2 million into the Senate Leadership Fund a Super PAC aimed at building a Republican majority in the Senate.

Through a spokesman Stephens declined to comment to the Democrat-Gazette.

Many people still tend to think of donors from Walmart Inc. or Tyson Foods Inc. as the biggest out of Arkansas but they are traditionally not said Sebold. The bigger spenders are from Stephens Inc. and Mountaire Corp. she said.

Cameron has given $1.5 million to Americans for Prosperity Action during this midterm election cycle according to the election commission's website.

Cameron also sent half a million dollars to the Club For Growth Action which is dedicated to ""defeating big-government politicians and replacing them with pro-growth limited government conservatives"" according to its website.

""We do this by running independent hard-hitting TV radio Internet and direct mail campaigns in critical Senate and House races across the country"" it says on the website.

Citing documents from the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) Food Safety Inspection Service (FSIS) the company alleges that a worker at the plant continued to have birds dumped onto a malfunctioning belt and piled the chickens up to four birds deep smothering 317 birds on the bottom.

“After speaking to the kill belt and dumper belt operators it became evident the incident occurred because the kill belt operator continued to try running the kill belt when it was clearly not functioning. Because the dumper belt is operated by the same lever this caused the dumper belt to continue dumping birds on the same section of kill belt. Meanwhile the dumper belt operator did not stop the dumper belt until the kill belt was stacked nearly to the level of the dumper belt” the FSIS document shared by PETA read.

An FSIS inspector according to the document informed the company that both belt operators should be trained how to handle instances when one or both belts malfunction and should also have means of and be responsible for communicating with one another to prevent such instances.

That initial inspection was conducted on July 8 2021. A little more than a month later a similar incident occurred but an exact number of birds killed was not provided.

Daniel Paden PETA vice president of evidence analysis wrote to Allamakee County Attorney Anthony Gericke and asked him to review the matter and file cruelty to animals charges against those responsible in the incidents.

Agri Star Meat & Poultry ranks as the 30th largest poultry company in the United States. The kosher meat processing and packing company produced an estimated 270000 pounds of ready-to-cook chicken on a weekly basis in 2020 according to the WATTPoultry.com Top Companies Database.

Technion team remove ‘forever chemicals’ from water

Researchers from the Technion–Israel Institute of Technology have developed innovative technology to remove dangerous pollutants from drinking water.

The technology efficiently removes and destroys synthetic organofluorine chemical compounds (PFAS). PFAS is a family of problematic pollutants also known as “forever chemicals” because of their chemical stability and environmental persistence.

There are thousands of PFAS chemicals and they are found in many different consumer commercial and industrial products. This makes it challenging to study and assess the potential human health and environmental risks. These substances can be found in air water soil and food as well as a large range of products including Teflon pan coating fire-fighting foam flame retardants and water-repellent additives. They reach the groundwater in various ways including agricultural irrigation using treated wastewater and fire-fighting substances seeping into the soil. As a result of their chemical stability they remain intact in the ground for a long time leading to extensive contamination of drinking sources which in turn significantly increases human exposure.

“Lately it has become clear that these chemicals are of severe health and ecological hazard – thus finding ways to remove and destroy them is of great importance” said Technion Asst. Prof. Dr. Adi Radian.

Radian head of the Soil and Environmental Chemistry Lab in the Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering headed the study with her post-doctoral student Dr. Samapti Kundu. Their findings were published in the Chemical Engineering Journal.

Francis Ngannou pocketed $600000 (£440000) for winning the undisputed UFC heavyweight title and his opponent Cyril Gane took home $500000 (£370000) in just his eleventh professional fight.

3 Francis Ngannou won the war of old sparring partners at UFC 270 Credit: GETTY

The other title fght on the card saw Brandon Moreno make $300000 (£220000) as he lost his UFC flyweight title to Deiveson Figueiredo who took home $150000 (£110000).

The lowest amount paid to any fighter on the card was $10000 (£7000) which five different fighters took home.

Ngannou has talked openly about wanting to compete in a boxing ring at some point and he has pitched to do so while under contract with UFC.

The idea is the UFC would co-promote his boxing fights in a similar way they did with Conor McGregor for his bout with Floyd Mayweather.

3 Ngannou says he wants to move over to the lucrative world of boxing

Ngannou is looking to take on WBC heavyweight champion Tyson Fury and the Gypsy King is interested but being stuck in his UFC deal is proving problematic and that’s strained his relationship with White.

The disparity is clear for all to see though. Ngannou took home $600000 for winning an undisputed heavyweight title fight. In heavyweight boxing Fury is reported to have made $30million (£22million) from his trilogy fight with Deontay Wilder.

It’s not hard to see why Ngannou wants to move over to the lucrative world of heavyweight boxing and he’s flatly told the UFC he won’t fight for $600000 anymore.

""I will not fight for $500000 $600000 anymore"" he told ESPN's Brett Okamoto. ""It's over. I took this fight for personal reasons and because I want to make sure that regardless of (whether) it's unfair (whether) I have been wrongly treated I can make my case of saying I have completed the eight fights.""

3 UFC boss Dana White is standing in the way of Ngannou's fight with Fury

Ngannou and White have been at odds over his new contract a deal that is meant to expire this year. Had he lost against Gane he could have been a free agent.

However because of a ‘champions cause’ Ngannou will remain in the UFC for another year.

The Cameroonian estimates he will face Fury in 2023 - when he would be a free agent from UFC - and the money at stake is likely to be twenty times as much as he made in the biggest fight of his UFC career.

The #UFC270 purses are out:



Francis Ngannou made $600000 while Ciryl Gane pocketed $500000.



Tyson Fury was said to have made close to $30million for his trilogy fight with Deontaty Wilder.

In NBA NHL NFL and MLB athletes make between 48-52% of the revenue share that their teams and the league generates. UFC athletes get around 16% of the company's profits.

When you consider Fury made over 25 times as much as the entire card of UFC 270 - which was $1.8 million - it's certainly food for thought."

Asset quality (measured by the percentage of nonperforming loans) is very robust. And balance sheet liquidity is exceptionally strong boosted by a combination of unprecedented access to central bank funds (particularly in Europe) huge customer deposit inflows and muted loan growth.



Bank credit ratings have returned to pre–COVID-19 levels and there is potential for further upward rerating as agencies recalibrate their rating methodologies. Looking forward we expect the banks will return some capital to shareholders reducing balance sheet strength. Even so we still think bank capital will remain buoyant—and highly supportive for bondholders.

Government Intervention Has Helped Enormously

The banks mostly entered the crisis in a financially strong position. The intervention of governments and their central banks has also been crucial. Massive support programs and stimulus packages have in many cases averted the worst-case outcomes from the impact of COVID-19 for businesses and individuals. That in turn has reduced the pressure on banks across the developed world.



On that basis the large loan-loss provisions for COVID-19–related damage that the banks made in 2020 now look overly prudent and some have already been written back. The banks appear to have fully provided for a potential increase in loan losses in 2022 and 2023. And if anything they should have scope to reverse more of their provisions in the second half of this year as previous economic assumptions continue to be revised upward.

Bondholders Are Beneficiaries—but Face Some Threats Too

Although equity profitability remains muted—constrained by low rates competition the costs of digital capex and (in the short term) loan-loss provisions—the shift to a rising-rate environment should help boost banks’ profits. But for banks’ bondholders profitability is not so important except insofar as it affects banks’ ability to raise fresh equity capital. Their main concern is the strength of the equity buffers that protect them from capital losses. And the current very healthy state of bank balance sheets benefits the riskiest bonds—subordinated credits including contingent convertible bonds such as Additional Tier 1 (AT1) securities—the most.



Banks’ bondholders enjoy some further advantages in a post-COVID world. For instance legacy issues such as GFC-era lawsuits are mostly resolved. More credible regulatory stress-testing (now including climate risks) gives more comfort than pre-GFC and greater regulatory support for mergers and acquisitions (especially in Europe) should make for stronger banks and better-protected bondholders.



Also bank business models are becoming better diversified with a greater focus on fee-generating activities. And the worldwide transition to greener business models should create more opportunities for profitable lending.



But banks’ bondholders face some new threats too. Banks will now be looking to return what they deem to be excess capital to shareholders in the form of dividends and buybacks with US banks likely the most aggressive. But although we expect CET1 buffers to weaken a little we think regulators will stop the banks eroding them too close to the minimum requirements.



That said the next crisis could prove harder to weather: governments have extended extraordinary levels of support during the pandemic but are unlikely to be able to respond to emergencies so generously in future. Also technological advances can drive profits but may also fuel new competitors. The banks have done well to fend off challengers so far but disruptive new entrants are still a risk. Lastly the possibility of a major cyber incident remains a serious and unquantifiable threat (Display).",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiW2h0dHBzOi8vbnlwb3N0LmNvbS8yMDIyLzAxLzIyL2dvbGRtYW4tc2FjaHMtY2VvLWRhdmlkLXNvbG9tb24tcGxheWluZy1pdC1jb29sLXdpdGgtbWVyZ2Vycy_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Goldman Sachs boss David Solomon playing it 'cool' with mergers,"Goldman Sachs has been looking to do a big deal or what investment bankers call “transformative” for years now. So what are they waiting for? People there keep telling me they need asset prices of merger partners to “normalize” aka fall enough so Goldman remains in control of the combined company.

Well we’re starting to see some “normal.”

A look at the asset prices of potential partners — PNC Bank US Bancorp State Street BNY Mellon some mid-sized asset managers and even potentially brokerage firm Charles Schwab & Co. — are starting to come back to earth as the Fed begins raising interest rates.

Another factor that might force CEO David Solomon’s hand are the obvious holes in Goldman’s business model. Goldman has a long and storied rep killing it in M&A and trading.

Tough competition

But it’s tough having only two horses in the race competing against banking behemoths like JPMorgan. Sure Goldman wasn’t the only bank to experience a hiccup because of trading volatility and higher expenses (the vaunted JPM did as well). But JPM has a big balance sheet far larger than the size of Goldman’s and JPM CEO Jamie Dimon can paper over surprises such as rapid and unexpected increases in compensation costs which bedeviled Solomon in the fourth quarter of 2021 and possibly into 2022.

That’s why Goldman’s earnings miss last week has the Wall Street rumor mill spinning again.

Solomon also knows that if you’re Goldman the merger has got to be the right one or else the CEO will go down in infamy as having evaporated one of the world’s greatest corporate brands.

And this is where it gets tricky. As for potential partners Schwab — the world’s most prestigious discount broker — would be an obvious choice. Schwab’s business involves registered investment advisers selling high-end financial products to rich people which complements Goldman’s own very high-end wealth-management business.

But Schwab’s price in Goldmanese hasn’t been normalized enough. The San Francisco-based Schwab has a market value of $168 billion compared to Goldman’s $115 billion. Charles Schwab’s ego — and yes the company’s 84-year-old founder namesake and chairman is still around — won’t let him sell out a bunch of traders in New York if he doesn’t have to.

Both PNC and US Bancorp have lower market caps than Goldman and they would be attractive particularly in a high-interest-rate environment the Fed has signaled; banks make a lot of money when rates rise.

But like Schwab neither has to do a deal. The monetary-policy environment favors their business model over Goldman’s.

Asset managers that might be available — think T. Rowe Price — would get Solly around $1.5 trillion in assets and entry into the lucrative mutual-fund business.

Ask yourself though: Why ­haven’t there been more marriages between fund companies and Wall Street? Answer: Combining those cultures is a little like trying to get Hillary Clinton to play nice with Donald Trump.

With all these variables to weigh the conventional wisdom among bankers is that Goldman isn’t rushing to do anything. Solomon is doing a great job; he’s beat earnings expectations seven times before the recent fourth-quarter 2021 miss. Some analysts say his stock looks cheap compared to competitors like Morgan Stanley but Goldman has the edge in market prowess.

That’s one way to look at it; another way is the reason why Morgan Stanley beat fourth-quarter expectations: It has a huge wealth-management business that stabilized and papered over a trading slowdown.

Again Solomon and his people are smart. They know they have to do a deal and the right one at the right time.

Sensible ‘Fink think’

Larry Fink’s annual letter to CEOs is always must-read material this year even more so because he added a fair amount of common sense to the relentless push by the Biden administration and corporate America to adopt green-energy policies.

Fink the CEO of BlackRock is no stranger to this effort. He’s used his clout as chief of the world’s largest money-management firm ($9 trillion in assets) to prod companies to adopt policies that he believes will transition the country and the world to what’s known as “net zero” carbon admissions.

With that came criticism from conservatives and this column since BlackRock alumni fill the Biden White House. Yes green energy sounds good in practice and Teslas are very popular in Beverly Hills but working-class Americans can’t afford electric cars. Higher oil and gas prices are tax increases on Middle America.

Fink didn’t back off his embrace of green energy. But in the letter he also pointed out how this movement is being hijacked by environmental zealots.

He advocated for a transition that takes into account that “any plan that focuses solely on limiting supply and fails to address demand for hydrocarbons will drive up energy prices for those who can least afford it resulting in greater polarization around climate change and eroding progress.”

Experts discuss the regulation of bank overdraft fees.

Font Size: A A A

Did you know that you can require your bank to decline a transaction instead of charging an overdraft fee?

If not you are not alone—in a recent study 70 percent of Americans who were charged overdraft fees did not know they had the right to have their bank decline the transaction instead of charging them a fee.

In 2010 rulemakers amended Regulation E to require financial institutions to provide notice to consumers and have them opt-in to overdraft fees. But some advocates believe this regulation does not go far enough to protect consumers from predatory banking practices associated with overdraft fees.

Large banks such as Capital One and Bank of America recently decided to end or greatly reduce the use of these fees despite making an average of $15 billion a year in overdraft fees. Some commentators say this shift comes on the heels of increased interest in regulating these types of fees at the federal level.

The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) for example has stated its intention to intervene in overdraft practices to restore proper competition. CFPB director Rohit Chopra expressed concerns that banks depend on overdraft fees in their profit model rather than compete for the best services and interest rates which has bad outcomes for consumers.

U.S. Senators Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) and Cory Booker (D-N.J.) introduced the Stop Overdraft Profiteering Act of 2021 last August to regulate profits from overdraft fees in the United States. They drafted the act in response to growing concerns about predatory banking practices which predominantly impact low-income communities.

According to the CFPB 80 percent of revenue from overdraft fees comes from just 9 percent of customers who are charged 10 or more times a year for spending above their balance. So low-income individuals pay three times as much to maintain their checking accounts.

As frontline health care workers abandon the field at an alarming rate hospitals are struggling to meet staffing demands — and patients are suffering for it. But Craig Allan Ahrens senior vice president of strategy and growth for a start-up called CareRev has an “innovative” solution for both short-staffed hospitals and burned-out healthcare workers: The solution isn’t overly complicated. It all goes back to supply and demand. By creating a pool of ready skilled labor willing to work as needed instead of only full-time healthcare systems can take advantage of professionals who want to work to tackle fluctuating needs. Translation: Uber for nurses. The idea has been gathering steam during the COVID-19 pandemic which has pushed America’s capitalist health care system to its limits dramatically exposing and exacerbating preexisting issues. The imperative for health care to turn a profit has left hospitals woefully understaffed under-resourced and unable to properly deal with the influx of COVID-19 patients. Thus the question of the health care labor market has been driven to the fore with everyone agreeing that something needs to change. But instead of acknowledging that decades of pinching pennies and cutting corners led to this chaotic juncture and course-correcting by sacrificing future profits to permanently increase capacity major health care companies have opted for a more predictable response. They’ve united with venture capital and Silicon Valley in a depressingly on-brand pivot to the gig economy. Saving money on labor regardless of the outcome for workers and patients is the name of the game in hospital management. It’s how we got into this mess to begin with. And it seems the responsible parties know better than to let a good crisis go to waste.

The Flexibility Trap CareRev which received $50 million in series A funding from Transformation Capital earlier last year is just one of several companies looking to “bring a different perspective” to health care labor. The company does not employ nurses; instead it functions as a technology-driven platform that connects hospitals needing shifts filled to nurses and other health care specialists looking for work on their own schedule. Like Uber drivers these nurses operate as independent contractors. Because nurses who use CareRev are not employees of the company they aren’t eligible for benefits through it. CareRev offers its users the ability to purchase health care through a partnership with Stride Health — the same insurance broker that works with other gig work companies like Uber. And that’s as far as benefits extend. Workers using the app are left to their own devices to manage tax contributions retirement funds and what to do about money when they need time off. The word ‘flexibility’ does a lot of heavy lifting in selling gig work as innovative and emancipatory for workers. According to proponents of the new model it’s not the management-by-stress techniques employed by profit-focused hospital executives that are driving the labor exodus from health care. The problem is the lack of “flexibility.” It’s not understaffed and under-resourced hospital floors according to Ahrens but the “red tape (of) regulatory and licensing hurdles to practice” and the “onerous onboarding and credentialing processes that keep professionals in orientations instead of actually providing care” that are making people leave the profession they once cared deeply about. CareRev advertises higher wages to nurses than standard full-time employment but in pitching the gig model to hospital administrators Ahrens advises that “engaging professionals beyond money by focusing on flexibility is key.” The word “flexibility” does a lot of heavy lifting in selling gig work as innovative and emancipatory for workers. However as political scientist and author of the book Consumer Management in the Internet Age: How Customers Became Managers in the Modern Workplace Joshua Sperber told Jacobin “Flexibility means you’re fundamentally precarious.” Sperber noted that in traditional labor markets workers compete with each other to fill job openings but once in the workplace they often find shared interests and some measure of stability. With the gig economy workers are constantly in competition with each other for the next shift. Gig companies says Sperber: promote the idea that you have the choice to say yes or no pick up what hours you want or set your own rates and in practice that’s never going to work because you’re competing with a whole bunch of other comparably qualified professionals. So there’s not only increasing downward pressure on wages but there’s also pressure to accept jobs even when they’re forty miles away. Companies like CareRev and its competitors — ShiftMed Trusted Health Nomad Health connectRN — are raising tens of millions of dollars in venture capital investment because they provide value to their customers. But their customers are not the health care workers who want to earn a living on their platforms. Their actual customers are for-profit hospitals desperate to cut labor costs. Labor historian and history professor at University of Chicago Gabriel Winant examined the relationship between neoliberal capitalism and the health care industry in his book The Next Shift: The Fall of Manufacturing and the Rise of Health Care in Rust Belt America. He spoke with Jacobin about how health care employers have historically viewed labor as a hindrance to their profits rather than facilitators of care to their patients: Individual employers — hospitals nursing homes home care agencies — have incentives to try to hold down their staffing levels as much as possible since this is the best way for them to make their margins work. In consequence health care is run increasingly on a “lean” basis at the bare minimum of staffing and then when there is a need to increase supply firms like CareRev are positioned to profit; it’s good for them and good for hospitals but bad for workers and bad for patients.”

Lean Mean Profit Machine The lean paradigm and resulting worker burnout existed long before the pandemic. The focus on margins rather than patient care justified by the assumption that the same efficiency that increased profit would also benefit patients led hospitals to look to automotive manufacturing as the template for how health care should be administered. Originating in the auto industry “just-in-time” production is the practice of dynamically scaling labor resources and production to match demand — always ordering parts or workers at the last minute based on a real-time assessment of needs and never keeping extra reserves on hand since doing so might be financially wasteful. For hospitals this has meant reducing the number of hospital beds and carrying the absolute minimum of drugs and personal protective equipment (PPE). And since labor remains the biggest cost to any hospital reducing full-time staff has become a key feature of “successful” hospital administration. Hospital administrators will fight tooth and nail for the continued ability to put their patients’ health and their workers’ well-being in jeopardy for profit. We saw this clearly in Massachusetts where nurses at Saint Vincent Hospital recently ended the longest nurses’ strike in state history over safe staffing levels. And the pandemic has only increased hospitals’ appetite for cheap and flexible labor. The pandemic has only increased hospitals’ appetite for cheap and flexible labor. Before the pandemic hospitals were mostly content to supplement their lean staffing with travel nurses from staffing agencies. Travel nurses typically are engaged in six- or twelve-week contracts at the same hospital. Some eventually are hired on full-time. Travel nurses are also likely to be compensated for the expenses related to moving for a job. Hospitals spend more for temporary travel nurses than they do for ordinary full-time nurses but as Winant explained: Many travel nurses have put themselves in harm’s way out of a sense of obligation or a justifiable desire for a pay bump or both in the past two years and there’s nothing wrong — and even something laudable — about the individual choice to do that. And of course nurses should have the right to adventure and travel and mobility just like everyone should. But this industry is currently tied to a model where hospitals don’t employ enough nurses or other workers even during normal times — don’t pay them enough or treat them with the respect they deserve — and the travel nurses are brought in to cover over that ugly reality when it starts to show. The cost of travel nurses has increased substantially over the pandemic. Some hospitals are paying over $200 an hour for nurses to take shifts. Some agencies have begun to import nurses from other countries to meet the demand and potentially lower costs but hospitals are becoming frustrated with the time it takes to get foreign-born medical professionals through immigration. CareRev and its fellow harbingers of gigification are seeking to remedy this contradiction allowing hospitals to source temporary staff locally for much less than they pay for either full-time or travel nurses. Hospitals can have cheap labor on hand when they need it and they bear no responsibility for those workers when there’s no immediate demand for their skills. In that sense the Uber-for-nurses model is the dystopian logical conclusion of just-in-time production as applied to health care. And there are other benefits to the gig model for health care employers. As the Saint Vincent nurses demonstrated unions have some ability to change their working conditions — directly through striking but also indirectly through organizing to pass bills like they did in California where safe staffing levels are now state mandated. In the gig economy there is no communal space for workers to meet and organize. Instead of talking with fellow nurses about looking for work and how they are treated by hospital administration job seekers are stuck looking at their phones trying to decide if the shift located forty miles away is worth it. Gigification is the most direct method of labor atomization capitalism has ever employed.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiY2h0dHBzOi8vYWJjbmV3cy5nby5jb20vR01BL05ld3MvdmlkZW8vaGFja2Vycy10YXJnZXRpbmctdWJlci1jdXN0b21lcnMtdmVyaWZpY2F0aW9uLXNjaGVtZS04MjQxNDE4NtIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Video Hackers targeting Uber customers with verification scheme,"Hackers targeting Uber customers with verification scheme A Florida man says he was the victim of a ""two-factor authentication"" scam.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRhaWx5ZG90LmNvbS9pcmwvdWJlci1kcml2ZXItcGlja3MtdXAtZ2lybGZyaWVuZC1taWQtcmlkZS10aWt0b2sv0gFRaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZGFpbHlkb3QuY29tL2lybC91YmVyLWRyaXZlci1waWNrcy11cC1naXJsZnJpZW5kLW1pZC1yaWRlLXRpa3Rvay8_YW1w?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,‘I felt extremely unsafe’: TikToker says Uber driver described being violent toward his girlfriend—who then joined them mid-ride,"This post contains mentions of domestic violence and self-harm.

TikToker @keekssmageekss has taken to the platform to share her experience of an Uber ride gone awry.

In a series of videos posted to the platform the TikToker said that her driver claimed to have gone to jail for choking his girlfriend who then joined them for the ride. The initial video of the incident has received over 385000 views.

“He was stopping my ride to pick up his girlfriend who he claims is crazy” text overlays on the video read. “I felt extremely unsafe and afraid that if I tried to get out of the Uber or cancel the ride it would make things worse. He said he went to jail for choking her. I tried my best to stay calm and nice to not escalate the situation but you can hear the nervousness in my voice and see how heavy I was breathing.”

In the video her driver can be heard talking about his military career and saying that he felt he couldn’t “let [his girlfriend] go” out of fear that doing so would cause her to end her life. The driver thanked the TikToker for “being patient” as they waited for the girlfriend.

The next morning she posted a follow-up video addressing the concerns of some commenters saying the situation was very stressful and that she was just trying to calm her anxiety.

“Thank you everyone for checking on me and for the kind comments” she said in the video. “I posted this because even though I’m still kind of triggered by it all I think it’s important for other women who maybe have never experienced something like this to be aware that this is a situation that could happen and understand how to handle the situation to keep yourself safe.”

She confirmed in the comment section of her second video that the driver’s girlfriend did in fact get in the car and asked her several personal questions that she ended up deflecting. She also said her best friend and boyfriend were each tracking her location to make sure she got home.

Commenters questioned @keekssmageekss asking why she didn’t just use any kind of safety or emergency features of the Uber app. She replied that she wasn’t sure how it worked and she didn’t want to alert the driver to how she was feeling unsure if he would react violently.

“I literally don’t understand why you didn’t do the emergency services option Uber has in the app” one such commenter wrote.

When another commenter wrote that they didn’t understand why she didn’t just try to get out of the vehicle @keekssmageekss told them they “don’t have to.”

“You can say what you would have done but until you’re living it you don’t know” she wrote.

The Daily Dot has reached out to @keekssmageekss via TikTok DM and a comment on the video regarding the situation as well as to Uber directly.

Tunchy has been having an absolute shocker of a week after she copped serious heat on social media for using her huge platform of 485k Instagram followers to leverage a refund from the small business she hired to organise her honeymoon.

After that initial bonfire of cookery the business at the centre of Tunchy’s refund saga responded with a statement of their own claiming the bikini model was “demanding and threatening”.

As many folks online noted Tunchy had no grounds to claim mistreatment since the company’s policy clearly stated that you can’t cancel your holiday and get a refund after you’ve paid for it.

But just when you think Jadé Tunchy has completed her week in the news a new chapter emerges.

The Daily Mail today published a screenshot showing Tunchy posting a scathing review of Uber Eats on their Facebook page via the private Instagram account Celeb_Spellcheck.

In the post the influencer has a massively overblown dig at the food delivery drivers.

“I order off you guys all the time and I’m starting to find it really annoying that you have so many non-English speaking delivery people who can’t follow basic delivery instructions” Jadé wrote.

“I got a notification today saying my food was arriving and it took the person a further 20 mins to get to my door because he didn’t read my delivery instructions properly and when I called him to explain he didn’t understand a word I was saying.”

“Your GPS is consistently sending drivers to the wrong address which I’ve explained in my instructions which most people read and have no problem with but when foreigners are delivering it takes twice as long for me to receive my then cold food. Sort it out.”

Big yikes.

Tunchy who currently has her Instagram account switched to private posted the following apology after Celeb_Spellcheck published the screenshot issued the following apology.

“I’m sorry to anyone I’ve hurt with my comments. I hold myself accountable for my actions” Tunchy wrote.

“It doesn’t excuse anything but know that I have grown immensely in the past several years. I always do my best to be someone others can look up to and I know I’ve let people down and for that I’m truly sorry.”"

A man who was on the roof of a home with a bow and arrow was arrested according to police.

Bristol Township police were called Wednesday late in the afternoon to the 4000 block of Nichol Street in the Newportville section for a report from a woman that a friend’s father had punctured her tires with a screw gun. The woman told a dispatcher the friend’s father was on the roof of the home with a bow and arrow according to court papers.

Police said they arrived to find Joseph C. Mershon 38 of Bristol Township on the roof in an orange sweatshirt and carrying a bow and arrow.

A 2019 Honda Pilot was located outside the home with two flat tires police said.

Mershon eventually came off the roof and went inside police said.

Officers and the Honda Pilot owner agreed to leave the damaged vehicle temporarily police said.

About an hour later 9-1-1 received numerous calls for glass breaking and someone reporting a man was outside damaging the Honda Pilot police said.

Officers went back to the home on Nichol Street and found the vehicle with the hood ajar and two windows broken out police said.

Mershon made social media posts and a video that alluded he was behind damage police said.

Mershon posted a photo of the damaged vehicle on social media. He also recently posted several odd posts about damaging communication equipment and creating a device to shoot planes out of the sky.

The damage to the Honda Pilot was determined to be valued at $5000.

Several officers attempted to arrest Mershon and he resisted. He refused to release his arms so they could detain him police said.

A Taser was used to arrest Mershon police said.

Pictures online showed police with rifles surrounding the home before Mershon was taken into custody.

Now that we're deep into the winter your skin might be feeling the effects of the dry chilly hair. Perhaps it's itchy and flaky? Chapped and tight? Or maybe it’s completely normal and unbothered. Ultimately no matter how your dermis is faring these days there's a strong case to be made for upgrading your skin care routine during the cold-weather months. And thankfully the best skin care products of January 2022 came in swinging with a bevy of ultra-hydrating and gently exfoliating complexion saviors like moisturizers serums and under-eye treatments.

Besides new products January saw some big changes in the skin care sphere; namely those with an eco-conscious mission. Take Chanel for example which made its foray into the clean beauty category this month with a new line entitled N°1 de Chanel. Likewise Philosophy reformulated its beloved Hope in a Jar line to make its formulas cleaner and implement more sustainable packaging. If this is any indication brands will continue to innovate in the ongoing quest to clean up the beauty industry more so than ever this year.

In addition to new innovations many brands are going back to basics by leaning into hydration and repair. From Ole Henriksen’s Peptide Boost moisturizer to Kiehl’s Ultra Facial Overnight Hydrating Face Mask brands are focusing on barrier repair which is more than understandable because the baseline of great skin is a healthy moisture barrier.

If you’ve already championed a flourishing skin barrier turn to newness from brands like Shani Darden and Versed for their exfoliating resurfacing and tightening formulas to really take your skin to the next level this year.

UPDATE: United Clarifies PlusPoints

A representative from United Airlines reached out to indicate that while they had a technical error that caused some upgrades to not include PlusPoints this error has been fixed:

“After reading your recent coverage of United’s latest MileagePlus Premier status purchase offer I wanted to reach out to share some good news. Happy to confirm that customers who purchase Platinum 1K or GS status through our latest offer will receive PlusPoints. We experienced a technical issue that has delayed the deposit of annual PlusPoints to select members who are purchasing to maintain status. All eligible members should see their PlusPoints deposited to their accounts in the coming weeks.”

This is good news for those who decided to spend the money. It also highlights that at the time of publication it was correct that some upgraders were not getting the PlusPoints when they upgraded but this has been corrected.

United Airlines MileagePlus Program Offers Status Retention

Many holders of elite status in United Airlines’ MileagePlus program were recently presented with an opportunity to pay to retain their status if they were unable to re-qualify the prior year. Depending on the amount of PQPs earned and their prior level offers ranged from $2000-5000+. This represents yet another cash grab from elites following the “Fly to the Finish” promotion.

In my own experience I accumulated around 11000 PQPs (I failed to record the exact number following my last flight before it reset to zero but it was between 10800 and 11600.) I had just 15 segments leaving me well short of the requirements and beyond any mileage run opportunities that might have renewed my status organically. I more than qualified for the third-highest published tier Premier Platinum short of 1K.

My price for moving back into the good graces of United’s upper echelon? A staggering $4530 – but only if I do so before February 4th at which point my price increases to $5030. If a 1K takes them up on such an offer initial results indicate they will not earn additional PlusPoints which can be valuable for upgrades if granted (see above note on PlusPoints) they will earn more miles on flights during the year but no MileagePlus miles for the upgrade itself.

There was no opportunity to redeem miles for the upgrade something I might have considered depending on the number of miles required.

Some Were Granted Status For Free

As “reported” (….whined about by me) some were granted a free extra year at their current status level. In Facebook groups some reported earning as few as half the PQP requirements required for 1K status (13000) and a more limited run with United than others but were given an extra year anyway.

Some expressed anger at the notion that others who failed to meet the requirements received the same status and most of the same benefits as those who qualified outright. Others were unable to earn the needed MileagePlus credits to retain premier statuses in the frequent flyer program had previously been incredibly valuable to United Airlines Holdings but haven’t been lately and received nothing.

How Many Will Become Free Agents?

In a year where everyone is eligible for a status match or challenge this is risky behavior for the United MileagePlus program. Anecdotally (because where would one find the figures for this anyway?) some MileagePlus members have expressed that they will take their business elsewhere. Some of them will actually do that some will just huff and puff about it (present company excluded) and some will see how the year plays out.

I see little value in Premier Silver to Premier Platinum. Many love the Star Alliance partners and their vast connections but I haven’t found as much value in partner airlines. I recently flew Austrian and Aegean and was surprised by limited checked luggage and little benefit to holding Star Alliance Gold status which offers fewer perks as the top level in the alliance than peers like oneworld.

That said the upcoming year will likely require at least one trip to Armenia which is virtually impossible at present from oneworld while Star Alliance offers several options.

Conclusion

Pushing aside the benefits in participating in one of these status retention offers like the miles you earn on flights or access to lounges when traveling abroad there is a use case for considering such an offer. For flyers based at United hubs like Newark Liberty International Airport or Houston Bush Intercontinental upgrades are hard to come by even for top-tier elites though they stand a good chance. Paying for upgrades throughout the year may add up to as much as this retention offers cost. Personally my travel will be mostly abroad this year and PlusPoints just aren’t a guarantee for a seat in the front so I will likely move elsewhere.

What do you think? Did you receive a retention offer? Did you take them up on it?",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXmh0dHBzOi8vbnlwb3N0LmNvbS8yMDIyLzAxLzIzL2lzcmFlbC1ib3VuZC1mbGlnaHQtdHVybnMtYmFjay1hZnRlci1wYXNzZW5nZXJzLXJlZnVzZS10by1sZWF2ZS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Newark flight turns back after passengers refuse to leave business class,"A flight from Newark International Airport to Tel Aviv returned to New Jersey on Thursday after two Israeli passengers helped themselves to upgraded seats on a half-full plane.

The passengers clashed with the United Airlines cabin crew after they refused to prove they were ticketed to sit in business class according to the Times of Israel which cited Hebrew-language outlets.

The conflict happened about 90 minutes after the flight took off and the disruptive fliers were arrested when the plane returned to the States according to the report.

“Law enforcement officials met the aircraft upon landing” United Airlines said in a statement to The Post Sunday.

“The flight was subsequently cancelled. Our team at New York/Newark have provided our customers with meal vouchers and hotel accommodation and have made arrangements for customers to complete their journeys.”

The incident came a day after a Miami-to-London flight turned around and went back to Florida when a woman in first class refused to wear a mask.

The FAA recorded 5981 unruly passenger incidents last year — the vast majority of them caused by fliers refusing to comply with COVID-19 mandates.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiT2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNubi5jb20vMjAyMi8wMS8yMi90ZWNoLzVnLWFpcmxpbmVzLWNyaXNpcy13aGF0LWhhcHBlbmVkL2luZGV4Lmh0bWzSAUhodHRwczovL2FtcC5jbm4uY29tL2Nubi8yMDIyLzAxLzIyL3RlY2gvNWctYWlybGluZXMtY3Jpc2lzLXdoYXQtaGFwcGVuZWQ?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,The 5G-airlines crisis was mostly averted. Here's what happened - and what we still don't know,"New York CNN Business —

Potentially abysmal air travel interruptions were narrowly avoided this week when wireless carriers made a last-minute change to their planned 5G rollout in response to fears that new cell service towers could interfere with a key component on passenger jets that allows them to safely land in low visibility conditions.

Warnings of mass flight cancellations came as AT&T Verizon and the airline industry hashed out a deal to delay 5G deployment around major airports. And on Thursday the Federal Aviation Administration cleared a greater number of commercial airliners to fly in the situations where pilots consider possible 5G interference to be the most dangerous. Now nearly 80% of the United States’ entire commercial airliner fleet has that clearance.

In the end crisis seemed to be mostly averted. No planes fell out of the sky. And — with a few exceptions — air travel stayed mostly on schedule.

But we’re not in the clear yet.

The agreement to delay 5G deployment around airports is only a temporary fix and it’s not clear if all the negotiating parties have a specific deadline they’re working toward. A significant number of planes still haven’t been cleared to land in those most dangerous situations. Regional air carriers have been crying out that they’ve been left out of discussions and are still facing long- and short-term impacts. And to the public’s knowledge a permanent solution to the issue still hasn’t been settled on.

Here’s everything we do — and don’t — know about the situation.

What’s the deal with the FAA ‘clearing’ some planes but not others?

Radar altimeters are devices that uses radio waves to gauge how far an aircraft is off the ground and they’re essential for commercial airliners to land in bad weather. At the root of the ongoing problem is the fact that 5G frequencies Verizon and AT&T have just deployed known as the C-band are very near to the frequencies used by radar altimeters sparking concerns about interference.

Over the past two weeks radar altimeter manufacturers have scrambled to “evaluate data from the wireless companies to determine how robust each model” of radar altimeter is and whether it can still function even when flying near an active 5G antenna according to the FAA.

In a statement Thursday the FAA said it issued more approvals that allow 78% of the US commercial airliner fleet to perform low-visibility landings at airports near where wireless companies deployed 5G. Essentially regulators said that they now deemed it safe for aircraft that used one of 13 types of radar altimeters.

The approved models include:

All Boeing 717 737 747 757 767 777 787 MD-10/-11 jets

All Airbus A300 A310 A319 A320 A330 A340 A350 and A380 models

Some Embraer 170 and 190 regional jets

But of course more than 20% of the United States’ commercial aircraft fleet hasn’t been approved. And the FAA warned that it anticipates that “some altimeters will be too susceptible to 5G interference.”

“To preserve safety aircraft with those altimeters will be prohibited from performing low-visibility landings where 5G is deployed because the altimeter could provide inaccurate information” the agency said.

The agency also warned that the buffers that are reducing 5G signal strength around certain airports are essential for keeping safe operations going.

It is not clear however why the FAA and altimeter manufacturers could not have done these evaluations sooner.

On its website the FAA states that over the past two weeks it has “received vital 5G” data that made these decisions possible and “facilitated data sharing” between altimeter manufacturers and wireless companies.

What’s the deal with regional carriers?

They’re still in limbo according to Faye Malarkey Black who as Regional Airline Association president represents the carriers connecting larger hubs to dozens of smaller cities around the country.

Regional flights have brands like American Eagle Delta Connection and United Express and they’re contracted out to companies or subsidiaries like Envoy ExpressJet Republic Airways and SkyWest Airlines.

And for them — “crisis has not been averted” Black warned.

Bombardier jets which are frequently flown by regional carriers haven’t gotten the green light for their altimeters. And Black said the rural airports will still “take a big hit to [their] operation when weather rolls in.”

“We will never compromise on safety” Black wrote on Twitter. “Flights will be grounded. Near term = highly disruptive. Long term = small [communities] will have less choice & less service.”

How did we get here and who’s to blame?

We’re not sure. The airline industry has known for years that 5G was coming. Part of the issue may be an ongoing power struggle between the FAA and the Federal Communications Commission which is the United States’ referee for all things radio spectrum-related and sold off the band of spectrum at issue to wireless companies for a whopping $80 billion last year.

The FAA and FCC had been aware that airlines believed a travel disaster could be imminent if 5G were deployed without addressing the altimeter concerns. Wireless carriers had largely dismissed those concerns however and it wasn’t until international airlines began canceling flights ahead of the 5G deployment on Wednesday that everyone began to announce significant strides in finding a solution.

And that’s how we got to where we are now with temporary buffer zones that prevent 5G from being deployed near certain airports — we don’t know exactly which ones — and a massive scramble to hash out exactly how much the altimeters will be impacted by this new cell service.

As far as who is to blame Verizon and AT&T — which owns CNN parent company WarnerMedia — pinned much of the blame on the Federal Aviation Administration in statements on Tuesday.

But the FAA has been adamant that the aviation industry’s concerns are real — and with the industry already reeling from the global pandemic — airlines are desperately hoping to avoid giving people yet another reason not to fly.

Emirates president Sir Tim Clark did not mince words about what he sees as the issue placing blame on the entire structure of the US system saying “this is one of the most delinquent utterly irresponsible” situations that he’s seen in his aviation career.

He added that the “risks and dangers” should have already been evaluated.

How do we fix all this?

It’s not clear. Discussion among wireless carriers AT&T and Verizon as well as the airline industry and federal regulators are still ongoing.

We’re not sure if or when they will publicly announce a definitive path forward but decisions will have to be made especially considering the 5G “buffer zones” around major air hubs are still only temporary.

Tom Wheeler who served as chair of the FCC from 2013 to 2017 wrote some suggestions in a November piece for The Brookings Institution where he said the concerns over spectrum interference could be allayed by making adjustments to the altimeters themselves.

The problem? That’s likely to cost billions of dollars — billions that no corporation wants to take out of its own pockets.

“There are only three sources of such funds for the aviation industry. The government could pay out of the almost $82 billion generated by the sale of licenses to use the [5G spectrum at issue]; that would probably require an act of Congress” Wheeler wrote. “The wireless industry could pay an additional tariff on top of the billions already spent for spectrum the government said would be ready for use on December 5. The aviation industry having known for some time of the new 5G allocation could pay to fix the offending altimeters.”

Wheeler for his part also placed much of the blame for this debacle on a lack of leadership and a lack of a national spectrum policy.

What’s next?

We’re still waiting for updates on the negotiations from the FAA FCC and all the other involved parties. It’s not clear if there is a firm deadline they’re working toward nor is it clear how long the “temporary” 5G buffer zones will stay in place.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiQWh0dHBzOi8vc2ltcGxlZmx5aW5nLmNvbS9hdGxhcy1haXItY2hpbmEtc2YtYm9laW5nLTc0Ny1hZ3JlZW1lbnQv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Atlas Air To Keep Flying Boeing 747s For China's SF Airlines,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with ('Connection aborted.', RemoteDisconnected('Remote end closed connection without response')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiQWh0dHBzOi8vc2ltcGxlZmx5aW5nLmNvbS9hdGxhcy1haXItY2hpbmEtc2YtYm9laW5nLTc0Ny1hZ3JlZW1lbnQv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMirAFodHRwczovL2FzaWEubmlra2VpLmNvbS9TcG90bGlnaHQvQ29yb25hdmlydXMvQ29yb25hdmlydXMtRnJlZS10by1yZWFkL0Nvcm9uYXZpcnVzLVdlZWstb2YtSmFuLi0xNi10by1KYW4uLTIyLUJyYXppbC10by1zdG9wLXVudmFjY2luYXRlZC1mb290YmFsbGVycy1wbGF5aW5nLWluLXRvcC1sZWFndWVz0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Coronavirus: Week of Jan. 16 to Jan. 22 Brazil to stop unvaccinated footballers playing in top leagues,"Nikkei Asia is tracking the spread of the coronavirus that was first detected in the central Chinese city of Wuhan.

Accomplishments His goal is not just for employees to go home as they arrived but for employees to go home even better than they arrive each day – safe inspired and motivated.

Engages with team members through our internal social platform Workplace by Facebook where their safety and well-being is always the top priority

Starts every conversation with safety and is known for ending all conversations and messages with “Stay safe and thanks for being on the Team”

United Rentals is the largest equipment rental company in the world. It has an integrated network of 1278 rental locations across North America 11 across Europe 28 in Australia and 18 in New Zealand. In North America the company operates in 49 states and every Canadian province. The company’s approximately 20100 employees serve construction and industrial customers utilities municipalities homeowners and others.

Describe your personal journey to becoming a CEO who “gets it.”

I began my career in the construction equipment rental industry over 30 years ago and have had the opportunity to grow up in the business by working at every level of our organization. My unique personal journey has allowed me to really understand a day in the life of what it takes to be safe on the front line every minute of every day – and it also opened my eyes to the very real challenges that our team faces. Safety is personal to me and I expect each member of our team to go home each day even better than they arrived.

What is the biggest obstacle to safety at your organization and how do you work to overcome it?

The biggest obstacle to safety for us is the speed and magnitude of our business. It’s easy to get distracted or feel pulled to do something a faster way versus the safer way. We combat this challenge by starting every day with a safety focus huddle followed by two stretches from our Meta-Posture Program. This gives our team the opportunity to discuss scenarios to working safely such as preventing line-of-fire injuries hand tool tips the impact weather has on our safety and much more. Our Meta-Posture Program is a warmup and stretch program designed to get the muscles and joints ready for the day. This stretch time allows employees to slow down focus and breathe before starting their busy day.

Why is safety a core value at your organization?

At United Rentals our mission is to deploy the best people equipment and solutions to enable our customers to safely build a better and stronger future. Safety first is a core company value which means we act – and require others to act – in a manner that puts the safety of our employees customers and communities first. Safety is personal at United Rentals; we all have the personal responsibility of our own safety but also the safety of others around us.

How do you instill a sense of safety in employees on an ongoing basis?

At United Rentals we are United4Safety which means we “think safe work safe drive safe and live safe.” There are a multitude of ways we work to keep safety at the forefront of our minds for making the right decision every single day. One of the most important ways is by encouraging active caring. This means taking the time to notice others’ activities and to communicate concerns and suggestions in a constructive way. We use our Hazard 360 Awareness – every task every time – to identify hazards and all of our employees are empowered with stop-work authority if they observe an unsafe or potentially hazardous working condition or behavior – meaning if you see something say something.

How does your organization measure safety?

Our safety program takes into consideration every part of our organization – including our locations and the worksites we visit – to ensure our employees are trained properly and hazards are identified to aid in injury and incident prevention. We have a “near miss STOP work and good catch” reporting process that encourages our team to share incidents and provide insight for opportunities for improvement. It’s important to put those learnings to good use so our processes and procedures are ever evolving as we implement them in support of our team working safely. By monitoring our performance learning from our experiences and thinking about the workplace of the future we will continue to strengthen existing programs and develop new ways to further our leadership position on safety.

What role does off-the-job safety play in your organization’s overall safety program?

Safety is a way of life and it’s our first thought in everything we do at work on the road and at home. Our safety efforts are rooted in our safe work practices and life safety rules which serve as our standard operating procedures. Our Live Well Safe & Healthy program is a comprehensive approach to wellness that encourages healthy lifestyle behaviors and helps to raise the morale productivity and overall engagement of our employees. The program includes biometric screening at work or offsite a health assessment a paid wellness day off tobacco cessation support and participation incentives. Additionally employees and family members can participate in virtual health challenges to encourage daily activity.

What have you done to support employee mental health and well-being within your organization?

While we often talk about physical safety and wellness at United Rentals we also consider what it means to be emotionally and mentally safe and healthy at work. Our intention is for employees to leave work each day feeling even better than when they arrived. We launched a mental health initiative during 2020 to strengthen support for employees in general and in the face of the prolonged stress of the COVID-19 pandemic. Our safety teams partner with our Together United employee resource group to host a series of events focused on mental health awareness. These events offer information promote dialogue and highlight resources available to assist our team and their families. We have an employee assistance program that provides a variety of free and confidential services to help employees manage the day-to-day stress and responsibilities of balancing work and personal lives.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMimAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5lc3NlbnRpYWxseXNwb3J0cy5jb20vbmFzY2FyLW5ld3MtbmFzY2FyLWNvbW11bml0eS1jb25ncmF0dWxhdGVzLWF1c3Rpbi1oaWxsLWFzLXRoZS1yaWNoYXJkLWNoaWxkcmVzcy1yYWNpbmctZHJpdmVyLWFubm91bmNlcy1ibGlzc2Z1bC1uZXdzL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,NASCAR Community Congratulates Austin Hill as the Richard Childress Racing Driver Announces Blissful News,"WATKINS GLEN NEW YORK – AUGUST 07: Austin Hill driver of the #16 United Rentals Toyota walks the grid prior to the NASCAR Camping World Truck Series United Rentals 176 at Watkins Glen International on August 07 2021 in Watkins Glen New York.

NASCAR community reacts

The coming season could be a big one for Austin Hill

There’s no doubt that the coming season could turn out to be a big year for Hill in his career.

This is because after impressing in the NASCAR Camping World Truck Series in 2021 Austin Hill was signed by Richard Childress Racing for their Xfinity Series team. And although the driver couldn’t win the Truck Series title he did enough to get noticed and earn the step-up to a team as iconic as RCR.

“Austin Hill has established himself as a very competitive racer within the NASCAR Truck Series and we know that he is ready for a full-time opportunity in the NASCAR Xfinity Series” team owner Richard Childress said.

“Austin is a talented young driver and I feel confident that he will help contribute to wins at RCR.”

The Minnesota health care giant said last week that operating earnings from its Optum division grew nearly 10% to $3.4 billion in the quarter. Optum runs one of the nation’s largest pharmacy benefits managers and provides care through its Optum Health network of doctors clinics and surgery centers.

That business served 100 million people last year and saw its revenue per customer increase by a third.

Operating earnings which don’t count interest expense and taxes also soared for the company’s UnitedHealthcare insurance side which added more people through government-funded Medicare Advantage and Medicaid coverage. That business now covers more than 50 million people.

Company executives said Wednesday that COVID-19 costs were in line with expectations during the quarter and were balanced by a drop in doctor visits and other care.

A surge in cases from the omicron variant of the virus hit late in the quarter and has since bumped up patient hospitalization levels. But UnitedHealth said the severity of cases requiring hospitalization care seems to be lower so far.

Overall UnitedHealth Group earned $4.07 billion in the final quarter of 2021 up from $2.21 billion the previous year.

Removing one-time benefits and charges per-share earnings were $4.48 or 18 cents better than expected on Wall Street according to a survey by Zacks Investment Research.

Revenue jumped more than 12% to $73.74 billion and also topped expectations.

UnitedHealth’s Optum Health business works with more than 60000 physicians and runs primary specialty and urgent care clinics as well as surgical sites.

The company said it pulled in more revenue per customer as it expanded and shifted more patients into value-based care. That involves reimbursing doctors and other care providers based more on how a patient does rather than for each service performed.

UnitedHealth and rivals like the drugstore chain and insurance provider CVS Health are moving more into providing care in an attempt to keep patients healthier and reduce expensive care like hospital stays.

That approach can bring in more revenue for the care providing side of their businesses while also cutting costs on the insurance side.

Overall UnitedHealth booked $24 billion in operating earnings last year with Optum contributing about half that total.

For 2022 the company reaffirmed its forecast for adjusted earnings of between $21.10 and $21.60 per share on revenue ranging from $317 billion to $320 billion.

Analysts expect on average earnings of $21.63 per share on $316.76 billion in revenue according to FactSet.

UnitedHealth shares climbed 2% to $470.40 Wednesday while the Dow Jones Industrial Average of which UnitedHealth is a component rose slightly.

The price of UnitedHealth Group Inc. shares topped $500 for the first time late last year setting a new all-time high for the Minnetonka Minnesota company.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiV2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmludmVzdG9wZWRpYS5jb20vYXNrL2Fuc3dlcnMvMDgxMzE0L3doYXRzLW1vc3QtZXhwZW5zaXZlLXN0b2NrLWFsbC10aW1lLmFzcNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,What's the Most Expensive Stock of All Time?,"Stock price is an indicator of a company's market value but the price of a share of stock will also depend on the number of shares outstanding. The reason why certain stocks are priced so high is usually due to the company having never or rarely having completed a stock split.

There are many ways to evaluate a stock in addition to its absolute share price. Here we take a look at some of the largest companies in the U.S. and abroad.

Key Takeaways Companies are typically valued by their total market capitalization on a stock exchange or number of shares outstanding times the share price.

Still many investors are interested in the most pricey shares available on an exchange which can indicate exclusivity.

Companies can also be ranked by revenue and profitability.

Top Companies by Stock Price

The most expensive publicly traded share of all time is Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.A) which was trading at $458675 per share as of January 2022. Berkshire hit an all-time high on Jan. 18 2022 at $487255. Thanks to spectacular shareholder gains and the idiosyncrasies of its founder this share value is unlikely to be matched by anything other than continued gains in Berkshire’s share price.

The next company behind Berkshire in terms of nominal share price is NVR (NVR) at $5154.98 per share as of January 2022. Then there is the Seaboard Corporation (SEB) which was trading at $3731.02 and Amazon.com (AMZN) at $2852.86 followed by Alphabet Inc (GOOG) at $2607.03 a share.

Top Companies by Market Cap

By market capitalization as of January 2022 Apple (AAPL) is the biggest company at $2.652 trillion followed by Microsoft (MSFT) at $2.222 trillion Google (GOOGL) at $1.725 trillion Amazon.com (AMZN) at $1.446 trillion Tesla (TSLA) at $947.92 billion and Meta (META) formerly Facebook at $843.34 billion.

Back in 2007 Chinese energy giant PetroChina (PTR) reached an estimated market value of around $1 trillion. However this valuation didn't stick. As of January 2022 PTR's market capitalization stood at just $146.95 billion.

Top Companies by Revenue

In terms of the biggest global companies by revenue Walmart (WMT) comes in as number one—according to the Fortune 500 list. Walmart's revenues were $523964 billion in 2021. Behind Walmart was State Grid with $383906 billion in revenues followed by Amazon with $280522 billion and China National Petroleum at $379130 billion.

Sinopec Group ranks fifth with $407009 billion in annual revenues and the sixth and seventh spots are covered by Apple and CVS Health with $260174 billion and $256776 billion in yearly revenues respectively.

Based on only U.S.-headquartered companies' 2020 performance Walmart still has the top spot while Amazon comes in second. Exxon Mobil ranks third and Apple ranks fourth. Healthcare companies take up the fifth seventh and eighth spots: CVS UnitedHealth Group and McKesson generating $256.78 billion $242.15 billion and $231.05 billion respectively.

Berkshire Hathaway ranks sixth with $254.62 billion in annual revenues and the ninth and tenth spots are covered by AT&T and AmerisourceBergen at $181.19 billion and $179.59 billion in yearly revenues respectively.

Based on only U.S.-headquartered companies' 2019 performance Walmart still has the top spot while ExxonMobil (XOM) comes in second with $290.21 billion a year in revenues. Apple ranks third with $265.59 billion and Berkshire Hathaway fourth with $247.84 billion. Healthcare companies take up the sixth through eighth spots: UnitedHealth Group McKesson and CVS generating $226.25 billion $214.32 billion and $194.58 billion respectively.

Top Private Companies

In terms of private companies Forbes ranks Minnesota-based Cargill as the largest private U.S. company with $134.4 billion in annual revenues. The company has 155000 employees. Second is Koch Industries with $115 billion in revenues and 122000 employees. Ranking third is the grocery chain Publix Super Markets with $44.9 billion in annual revenue and 227000 employees.

The fourth and fifth largest private companies are Mars and H-E-B which generate $40 billion and $32.8 billion respectively. Each employs over 100000 employees.

The Bottom Line

On a pure market value measure Apple has often been considered the most valuable publicly traded company of all time. Although Microsoft did briefly hit the $2 trillion market cap mark in June 2021. It is certainly possible another company’s market cap will exceed these measures and maybe—though less likely—another company will surpass Berkshire Hathaway as the highest priced single stock share.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZvb2wuY29tL2ludmVzdGluZy8yMDIyLzAxLzIyLzQtc3RvY2tzLXdpdGgtdHJhY2stcmVjb3JkLW1ha2luZy1pbnZlc3RvcnMtcmljaGVyL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,4 Stocks With Exceptional Track Records of Making Investors Richer,"Down years are few and far between with these moneymaking stocks.

Whether you're a new investor or a tenured veteran who's been putting your money to work on Wall Street for decades you're likely aware that the stock market doesn't move up in a straight line. Although its major indexes have a knack for increasing in value over time even the best stocks have down years.

However a select group of highly profitable time-tested stocks have shown that down years can be few and far between. The following four companies have exceptional track records of generating positive total returns including dividends for investors and have made them a whole lot richer.

Costco Wholesale

Most people are probably familiar with warehouse club Costco Wholesale (COST 1.69%). Whether you have a membership to its stores or have been stuck in the line of traffic leading up to its mammoth shopping locations Costco and its more than 560 U.S. stores are tough to miss.

What you might not realize is that including dividends paid Costco has delivered a positive total return in 18 of the past 20 years. Between Dec. 31 2001 and Dec. 31 2021 Costco generated a total return for investors of more than 1700%!

One of the most obvious reasons Costco is such a success story is its size. Similar to how Walmart throws its weight around to undercut local mom-and-pop stores on price Costco uses its size and deep pockets to buy goods in bulk. Buying large quantities of goods often means getting each unit for a lower price. Costco is then able to pass along these savings to its members and regularly undercut grocery chains and retailers on price.

This leads to the next key factor of the Costco operating model: Its memberships. Since the margins on grocery items are razor-thin Costco relies on membership fees to buoy its margins and keep customers loyal to the brand. Getting members into its stores also encourages them to shop around and purchase higher-margin discretionary items such as clothes electronics and jewelry.

Lastly since a sizable percentage of the items Costco sells are basic need goods the company often generates highly predictable cash flow -- and Wall Street values predictability.

UnitedHealth Group

Another well-known company with an exceptional track record of making its investors a lot richer is UnitedHealth Group (UNH 0.39%). The largest healthcare stock by market cap has also generated a positive total return for shareholders in 18 of the past 20 years with an aggregate gain in excess of 3300% over two decades.

UnitedHealth is arguably best known for providing individual and commercial health insurance. Just like any insurance company periods where claims and/or expenses spike higher do occur from time to time. However the great thing about insurers speaking from a business standpoint is that they have little issue passing along premium price hikes to cover their expenses. Whether it's higher costs experienced from treating COVID-19 patients or the expectation of higher future medical care expenses UnitedHealth Group's insurance division is consistently profitable.

What investors might not realize is that subsidiary Optum is the far more intriguing segment. Optum is itself split into three divisions (OptumRx OptumInsight and OptumHealth) with a focus on everything from providing pharmacies with prescription refills to supplying hospitals and medical organizations with software designed to streamline their operations. Optum is growing considerably faster than UnitedHealth's insurance segment and it should bring in juicier long-term margins.

Thanks to Optum's rapid growth and the transparency of the company's traditional insurance operations there's a good likelihood that UnitedHealth's incredible run will continue.

When it comes to consistency virtually none of the thousands of listed securities have delivered the green quite like electric utility stock NextEra Energy (NEE 1.58%). Since the end of 2001 NextEra has had only one year where it's produced a negative total return (2008). With 19 positive total returns over 20 years NextEra has rewarded its patient shareholders with aggregate gains of around 2400%.

If you're noticing a recurring theme among these stocks it's that businesses providing necessary goods and services tend to perform well. If you own a home or rent there's a very good chance you'll need electricity and/or natural gas to live comfortably. Demand for NextEra's services won't change much from year to year. Furthermore utility operations tend to be monopolies or duopolies which provides a steadiness to the cash flow of electric utilities.

What sets NextEra Energy apart from its peers is the company's renewable energy focus. NextEra plans to spend an aggregate of $50 billion to $55 billion on new infrastructure projects between 2020 and 2022. The company is already generating more capacity from wind and solar power than any other utility and this is unlikely to change anytime soon. These clean-energy projects are helping to reduce electricity generation costs which ultimately is what's lifted NextEra's compound annual growth rate to the high single digits in a notoriously slow-growing sector.

Additionally NextEra's traditional utility operations provide cash flow stability. By ""traditional"" I mean those not powered by renewable energy. Having some of its operations regulated by public utility commissions ensures the company doesn't have to contend with potentially volatile wholesale electricity pricing.

Berkshire Hathaway

A fourth and final stock with a nearly unbeatable track record of making its long-term shareholders richer is Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.A 0.96%) (BRK.B 1.01%).

Aside from generating a positive return in 16 of the past 20 years the company's Class A shares (BRK.A) have averaged an annual return of better than 20% since the beginning of 1965. Between Dec. 31 1964 and Dec. 31 2021 Berkshire Hathaway produced a gain of more than 3600000% for its investors.

If you're wondering why Berkshire Hathaway is such a successful investment look no further than its CEO billionaire Warren Buffett. The Oracle of Omaha as he's known has a knack for investing in and/or acquiring cyclical businesses in the financial utility consumer staples and information technology sectors. Even though recessions are an inevitable part of the economic cycle Buffett understands that periods of economic expansion last many times longer than recessions. He's playing a numbers game with time as his greatest ally.

Berkshire Hathaway's success is also a reflection of Buffett and his investing team loading the company's investment portfolio with dividend stocks. In 2022 Berkshire is on track to collect more than $5 billion in dividend income which equates to a yield relative to cost basis of around 5%. Dividend stocks are almost always profitable and time-tested making them the perfect place to park money for the long run.

Can they be fought?,"If you haven't been paying attention to the proposed carbon dioxide-carrying pipelines being discussed at meetings around Iowa now is a good time to start. Maybe you don't think they'll affect you. They will.

They'll affect you directly if you're a landowner along the route whose property could be used to lay in pipeline including through eminent domain. Such designations garnered attention not much of it positive after the Dakota Access Pipeline came through and left long-term damage to some land and crops.

But anyone who lives in Iowa has a stake in protecting the state's environment and beating back climate change.

These proposed pipelines three of which will seek approval from the Iowa Utilities Board are billed as solutions to environmental problems some Iowans weren't even sure existed. The three are Summit Carbon Solutions Navigator CO2 Ventures and Archer Daniel Midland. Navigator would take carbon dioxide emitted from ethanol and chemical fertilizer plants and transport it to a destination in Illinois where it would be dehydrated and buried deep underground.

More:Dakota Access pipeline was justified in using eminent domain Iowa Supreme Court rules

But how necessary is that? Until now CO2 has been released into the air from ethanol plants but that was downplayed as a problem. ""It calls out the lie that ethanol is clean energy"" quips Ed Fallon of Bold Iowa a nonprofit opposing the project. And if the emissions really weren’t troubling then would we embrace something classified as a ""hazardous project"" — much less want it running under our properties?

At an informational meeting in Ames this month Elizabeth Burns-Thompson Texas-based Navigator's vice president of public affairs said Iowa needs a pipeline because its geology isn't suited to burying the carbon dioxide here. The pipeline would run 1300 miles more than 800 of those in Iowa which she said represents a $3 billion investment $1.6 million of which would stay here generating 5000 jobs.

Burns-Thompson who described herself as a “farm kid from here in Iowa” said the project is of value to the agricultural community. ""This is your land. Treating it with utmost respect is our top priority"" she said of Navigator and project partners Valero Energy Corp. and BlackRock Global Energy & Power. ""The facility could reduce its carbon intensity score by 50%"" she said.

Carbon pipeline projects rely on significant tax incentives

As she acknowledged a key driver of such pipeline projects is taking advantage of federal government tax incentives. The tax benefit colloquially referred to as 45Q offers $50 per ton of permanently sequestered CO2 or $35 if it's used for enhanced oil recovery another option. Ultimately Navigator hopes to store and store 15 million tons.

But using public tax dollars for fossil fuel production isn't quite what some environmentalists have in mind. ""It's a false climate solution"" says Carolyn Raffensperger of Ames an environmental lawyer and executive director of the national Science and Environmental Health Network. She shared a report compiled by environmental historian Peter Montague of seven failed carbon capture projects in the U.S. and one in Canada. Significantly Archer Daniels Midland had one of them.

""Archer Daniels Midland does not appear to share federal officials’ enthusiasm for carbon capture and storage"" says the report which noted that a company feasibility study for cutting its corporate greenhouse gas emissions 25% didn't even include carbon capture and sequestration. The company wrote in 2020 that ""the ability to capture stack emissions and sequester them is likely 10 years out.""

Montague added: ""Nevertheless in early 2022 ADM announced that it was partnering with Wolf Carbon Solutions to develop a pipeline to carry away carbon dioxide from ADM’s facilities in Clinton and Cedar Rapids Iowa"" (emphasis mine). ""The pipeline will have a reported capacity of 12 million tons of liquified carbon dioxide per year far more than ADM alone would need.""

More:What we know about two carbon capture pipelines proposed in Iowa

Concerns are many including 'prolonging the fossil fuel era'

Some opponents say such measures would either help forestall real changes to our carbon footprint or soon become obsolete as electric cars gain favor and ethanol is no longer needed to fuel them. The Center for International Environmental Law says ""Until now carbon capture and storage (CCS) have been primarily used to 'keep the coal industry alive'"" and to benefit gas and oil interests.

A researcher for the center argues that the practice ""masks the harmful carbon emissions from the underlying source enabling that source to continue operating"" generates additional risks and costs from pipelines and ""exacerbates global warming by boosting oil production and prolonging the fossil fuel era.""

Jessica Mazour conservation coordinator at the Iowa Sierra Club says that for every ton of CO2 that's sequestered 1.2 to 1.4 tons would be generated from the extraction of fossil fuels. She calls it ""greenwashing"" a “false climate solution when we should be investing in solar wind battery storage conservation and efficiency.""

There are also concerns over conflicts of interests in Iowa's process for approving such projects. Former Gov. Terry Branstad a Republican has a financial interest in pipelines as a policy adviser for Summit Carbon Solutions. Branstad also appointed when he was governor two of the three Iowa Utilities Board members who would vote on approval. The third was appointed by Gov. Kim Reynolds who was Branstad's lieutenant governor before becoming governor.

Reynolds has also called for state investment in carbon capture solutions. On Radio Iowa she stressed state funding for Iowa State University to research how Iowa farmers could secure carbon credits for planting crops.

As it is says Raffensperger ""Iowa is the most ecologically damaged state in the union."" Yet its public universities get money to do research that benefits companies. ""Where is the funding for university research that will solve the climate problem?""

Branstad has tried to discredit the Sierra Club for its opposition to these pipelines. He signed a letter sent to people in about a third of Iowa counties asking them to support the Summit pipeline and to not be ""intimidated” by the Sierra Club: “They are not your friends and will be long gone after they have destroyed the ethanol industry and the value of your corn-producing land.”

Then there's a secrecy element. Bruce Rastetter CEO of Summit Agricultural Group Summit's parent company has asked the Iowa Utilities Board to not publicly release the names of landowners along the routes for their privacy and because that could help Summit's competitors. But the Iowa attorney general's consumer advocate sought the release of the names saying landowners who oppose the project should be able to mount a joint defense.

Opponents come from varying backgrounds and they're organized

Steve Higgenbottom a Wapello County landowner already felt burned by the Dakota Access Pipeline running through his property. Now his land stands in the path of another pipeline project. The last time crews dug 30 feet down to install the pipeline and put terraces above it but the terraces settled and now he has drainage problems ""football fields away from the pipeline."" He said the company won't return to fix the problems; he estimated it would take $100000. He calls this plan ""pie in the sky.""

To date 15 county boards of supervisors have voted to oppose eminent domain use to access people's lands according to Mazour.

The risk of a pipeline rupture and carbon dioxide leak is also a concern. It happened in 2020 in the small Mississippi community of Satartia. In The Huffington Post journalist Dan Zegart reported on two dozen people being ""overcome within a few minutes collapsing in their homes; at a fishing camp on the nearby Yazoo River; in their vehicles. Cars just shut off since they need oxygen to burn fuel. Drivers scrambled out of their paralyzed vehicles but were so disoriented that they just wandered around in the dark.""

In Satartia residents at least had a warning says Raffensperger because hydrogen sulfide which smells was mixed in with the CO2 which doesn't. If that concentrate were released in Iowa and mixed with water from a stream it would acidify the liquid making it undrinkable she said.

If there's hopeful news here it's that this time more people are paying attention. The Sierra Club is partnering with eight other nonprofits to organize a diverse group of opponents some 650 of whom meet weekly Mazour says. ""We've been told we're supposed to hate each other"" she said of the urban and rural Democratic and Republican cross-section ""but we actually have quite a bit in common. We care deeply about the land.""

Raffensperger who has read hundreds of comments submitted to the utilities board from affected parties sees an extraordinarily powerful story of landowners working with environmentalists for future generations. ""This conversation is fundamentally different than anything I've seen in Iowa"" she said.

Could that be enough to beat back the big money and powerful forces at play?

""Money is the second strongest driver in politics"" said Fallon a former Iowa legislator. The only one greater force he said ""is votes.""

Con esto más grupos criminales se han involucrado en su producción atizando la tensión con los carteles al frente de este negocio.

En diciembre de 2021 el gobierno estadounidense impuso sanciones a cuatro compañías chinas acusadas de vender precursores químicos para la producción de fentanilo. Entre ellas la más destacada fue Hebei Atun Trading que a través de la leyenda Mexico Hot Sell vende estos productos en su página web según reportó Milenio.

Sin embargo la empresa no es la primera en incursionar en este medio. En el 2021 otras 64 empresas también fueron señaladas del mismo delito.

En China los traficantes recurren a los más sencillos métodos de venta. Disponen cuentas de WhatsApp y Skype donde sus clientes pueden contactarlos fácilmente y obtener toda la información para adquirir sus productos.

Del otro lado del mar en México sus principales compradores son carteles mexicanos el Cártel Jalisco Nueva Generación (CJNG) y el Cártel de Sinaloa (CS). Ambos se disputan el liderazgo por el tráfico de opioides hacia Estados Unidos.

Por su parte en China las autoridades estadounidenses han puesto la mira sobre personajes como Chuen Fat Yip cabeza de Wuhan Yuancheng Gongchuang Technology otra de las empresas sancionadas.

De acuerdo con un comunicado del Departamento de Justicia de Estados Unidos Fat Yip está acusado de ser uno de los más importantes traficantes internacionales de fentanilo. Su participación va desde la fabricación producción y distribución de fentanilo y precursores hasta su venta en línea.

Chuen es el perfecto ejemplo de cómo la presencia china ha copado la producción de fentanilo. Sumado a esto la venta online de precursores no podría suceder en un peor momento.

El impacto del fentanilo en México y Estados Unidos lo ha posicionado como la amenaza número uno entre todas las drogas. Solo entre abril de 2020 y abril de 2021 causó la muerte de cerca de 100.000 personas en Estados Unidos abriéndose camino para quedarse en el mercado.

Análisis de InSight Crime

Las ventas por internet no son novedad en el negocio del fentanilo. Sin embargo el uso de estos canales ha abierto el espectro de traficantes haciendo más difícil de detener el flujo de drogas y violencia que se extienden por México y Estados Unidos.

Como consecuencia además de las muertes en Estados Unidos en México la violencia en estados como Zacatecas se ha disparado pues es un paso obligado en la ruta de tráfico.

Esto se ha visto agravado por la aparición de nuevos jugadores en la disputa por el fentanilo. Además del CJNG y el Cartel de Sinaloa los Zetas Vieja Escuela el Cártel del Golfo y una organización conocida como Los Talibanes ahora hacen parte de la pugna que tiene como epicentro Zacatecas.

Aunque Estados Unidos ha puesto la mira sobre estas rutas y puertos como Manzanillo las empresas chinas han demostrado que se adaptan con facilidad a este mercado.

VEA TAMBIÉN: China y su aterradora capacidad de adaptación al mercado de fentanilo

En un principio los traficantes chinos vendían y traficaban directamente el fentanilo desde Asia hasta México. Sin embargo cuando en 2019 China prohibió su venta los traficantes optaron por la venta de precursores para su producción.

Durante la pandemia por COVID -19 en 2020 puertos como el de Wuhan cerraron. Esto obligó a los carteles a adaptarse y buscar otros proveedores. Una vez reabierto el envío de precursores por correo diversificó el tráfico de estas sustancias.

Finalmente la oferta de químicos a través de internet ha probado ser el as bajo la manga de los traficantes asiáticos. Esto ha reafirmado su papel en la comercialización de opioides desatando un panorama peor que los anteriores en el contexto de esta crisis.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiT2h0dHBzOi8vbGF0aW51cy51cy8yMDIyLzAxLzIyL3ZlbnRhcy1kZS1hdXRvcy1kZS1sdWpvLWVuLW1leGljby12YW4tZW4tcmV2ZXJzYS_SAVNodHRwczovL2xhdGludXMudXMvMjAyMi8wMS8yMi92ZW50YXMtZGUtYXV0b3MtZGUtbHVqby1lbi1tZXhpY28tdmFuLWVuLXJldmVyc2EvYW1wLw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Ventas de autos de lujo en México van en reversa,"México destacó en los años previos a la pandemia entre las naciones más importantes en el consumo de lujo sin embargo la crisis muestra que el segmento de altos ingresos en el país es también muy sensible a las variaciones en la economía ello se reflejó de manera clara en la venta de automóviles de lujo que en el 2021 acusó una reducción de 8.5% respecto al año anterior.

Aunque la caída parece moderada habrá que considerar que ésta se dio tras el desplome de 33.7% en el 2020 ello de acuerdo con cifras de la Asociación Mexicana de la Industria Automotriz (AMIA) y el Instituto Nacional de Estadística y Geografía (INEGI).

En el año que recién concluyó se vendieron 28 mil 600 unidades muy lejos de su nivel récord de 2016 en que se comercializaron 69 mil 771 vehículos.

En estos cinco años se acumuló una caída de 59.0% y contrasta con la reducción de 36.9% que registró la venta de autos en el país en todos sus modelos durante el mismo lapso tal variación reflejó la mayor sensibilidad del mercado de autos de lujo al ciclo económico y que la debilidad de la demanda en el mercado automotriz no inició con la crisis sanitaria sino más bien la vino a profundizar.

Por marcas en el 2021 lideró el mercado la japonesa Toyota con 7 mil 617 unidades que representó el 27% de las ventas totales de autos de lujo en el país le siguió la alemana Audi con 4 mil 692 automóviles 16% del total el tercer sitio fue para la también alemana BMW con 3 mil 709 vendidos 13% del total y en cuarto lugar los Mini de Reino Unido con 3 mil 97 vendidos 11% del total. Estos cuatro fabricantes concentraron el 67% del mercado de autos de lujo en México con 19 mil 115 unidades vendidas.

De las 22 marcas participantes en el mercado mexicano 14 registraron retrocesos respecto al 2020. En la caída destacó la armadora Ford con cero unidades vendidas le siguió Volkswagen con solo 4 vehículos comercializados una baja de 88% de los Acura importados de Estados Unidos se vendieron 69 unidades 53% menos que un año antes y la poderosa Mercedes Benz solo logró colocar en el mercado mil 989 unidades 51% menos que un año antes.

La venta de autos de lujo fue un reflejo de lo que sucede con la venta total de vehículos ligeros en el país que de 2017 a 2020 registró cuatro retrocesos consecutivos acumulando una baja de 41% tendencia que amenazaba con extenderse para el 2021 pero fue salvada por el repunte de los dos últimos meses y pudo terminar con un avance de 6.8% al comercializar 1 millón 14 mil 680 vehículos. Volumen que si bien muestra una ligera recuperación tras la fuerte caída es muy similar al nivel de ventas que se registró en el 2012.

La recesión que experimenta la venta de autos de lujo en México parece indicar que el sector de la población con más recursos económicos decidió posponer la compra de autos hasta tener una percepción más clara y positiva de la economía y prefieren esperar tiempos mejores para regresar de compras al mercado de vehículos de alta gama.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMie2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmVsZWNvbm9taXN0YS5jb20ubXgvYXJ0ZXNlaWRlYXMvTG9zLWRpc2Nvcy1kZS12aW5pbG8tdnVlbHZlbi12ZW50YXMtY3JlY2VuLWVuLUVzdGFkb3MtVW5pZG9zLTIwMjIwMTIzLTAwMDQuaHRtbNIBf2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmVsZWNvbm9taXN0YS5jb20ubXgvYW1wL2FydGVzZWlkZWFzL0xvcy1kaXNjb3MtZGUtdmluaWxvLXZ1ZWx2ZW4tdmVudGFzLWNyZWNlbi1lbi1Fc3RhZG9zLVVuaWRvcy0yMDIyMDEyMy0wMDA0Lmh0bWw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Los discos de vinilo vuelven: ventas crecen en Estados Unidos,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.eleconomista.com.mx/arteseideas/Los-discos-de-vinilo-vuelven-ventas-crecen-en-Estados-Unidos-20220123-0004.html on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMie2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmVsZWNvbm9taXN0YS5jb20ubXgvYXJ0ZXNlaWRlYXMvTG9zLWRpc2Nvcy1kZS12aW5pbG8tdnVlbHZlbi12ZW50YXMtY3JlY2VuLWVuLUVzdGFkb3MtVW5pZG9zLTIwMjIwMTIzLTAwMDQuaHRtbNIBf2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmVsZWNvbm9taXN0YS5jb20ubXgvYW1wL2FydGVzZWlkZWFzL0xvcy1kaXNjb3MtZGUtdmluaWxvLXZ1ZWx2ZW4tdmVudGFzLWNyZWNlbi1lbi1Fc3RhZG9zLVVuaWRvcy0yMDIyMDEyMy0wMDA0Lmh0bWw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1lZGlvdGllbXBvLmNvbS9iYXNxdWV0Ym9sL25iYS9sZWJyb24tamFtZXMtbGFrZXJzLW51bWVyby12ZW50YXMtbmJh0gFQaHR0cHM6Ly9hbXAubWVkaW90aWVtcG8uY29tL2Jhc3F1ZXRib2wvbmJhL2xlYnJvbi1qYW1lcy1sYWtlcnMtbnVtZXJvLXZlbnRhcy1uYmE?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,LeBron James y Lakers los número uno en ventas de la NBA,"Editorial Mediotiempo

El departamento de mercadotecnia y ventas de la NBA anunció quienes son los jugadores y equipos que más venden en toda la liga.

Fue así que se dio a conocer que LeBron James es el que más vende pues su jersey es el más buscado pues se trata del jugador más valioso.

Así también Lakers aparece como el equipo que más ventas tiene de toda la NBA a pesar de que tanto la estrella de su equipo LeBron como a nivel colectivo no pasan buen momento con una temporada irregular.

El cuatro veces campeón es el líder dentro del ranking de jerseys más vendidos en la NBA Store. Esta lista la complementan Stephen Curry Giannis Antetokounmpo Kevin Durant y Luka Doncic para completar el top 5.

En la categoría de los equipos la Conferencia Oeste domina la zona alta de la lista. Los Lakers son los que ocupan la primera posición seguidos por los Warriors de Golden State.

2022 ya ha empezado y deja detrás uno de los años más extraños que podemos recordar en el mundo del videojuego. Durante los últimos meses en Gamereactor os hemos ofrecido un seguimiento exhaustivo de las ventas de videojuegos en España y tras haber quitado el árbol de Navidad haber cantado el último villancico y haber comido el último trozo de turrón hemos decidido repasar las ventas de videojuegos de España en 2021.

Nintendo Switch encabeza las consolas más vendidas de 2021

El año que ha visto el lento arranque de la nueva generación de consolas y el dominio casi absoluto de Nintendo en nuestro territorio. La consola híbrida de la Gran N Nintendo Switch alcanzaba los 2 millones de unidades vendidas casi al cierre de octubre. Todo un hito para los de Kioto en territorio patrio sobre todo por las enormes distancias que ha marcado con la competencia.

Porque sus cifras no se quedan ahí. Al terminar 2021 Nintendo Switch se sentó en el trono de la consola más vendida de España rozando las 500.000 vendidas a lo largo de todo el año. Los números son buenos pero quedan por debajo de los que hizo en 2020 a pesar del lanzamiento del nuevo modelo OLED. Este por cierto ha rozado las 80.000 consolas desde que salió a la venta el 8 de octubre lo que implica una media de unas 7.000 consolas por semana.

Publicidad:

Las distancias marcadas por Switch frente al resto son enormes. Bajo ella hay que mirar ya a las consolas de nueva generación donde PlayStation 5 se ha posicionado como absoluta líder. En todo el año se han vendido cerca de 275.000 PS5 en España. En toda su vida 363.000 consolas PlayStation 5 han salido de las estanterías de las tiendas españolas.

Xbox Series no ha podido llegar a los números de ninguna de las otras dos. La dupla Series X y Series S ha cerrado el 2021 sin olvidar que aquí se vende más el modelo barato (por precio y por disponibilidad) y vendiendo un total de 83.000 consolas. Así la cifra total desde su lanzamiento en noviembre de 2020 asciende a casi las 110.000 Xbox Series X|S vendidas en España.

Top ventas de consolas en 2021



Nintendo Switch - 495.000 unidades

PlayStation 5 - 275.000 unidades

Xbox Series X|S - 83.000 unidades

PlayStation 4 - 53.000 unidades

Xbox One - 4.000 unidades



En materia de hardware 2021 va a ser recordado como el año del ""quiero pero no puedo"" de la nueva generación. Las dificultades para comprar las consolas de Sony y Microsoft han permitido a Nintendo despuntar todavía más aunque ya venía empujando con fuerza prácticamente desde el primer año de vida de Switch. Con un escenario así y en vista de que los problemas de componentes y distribución van a seguir todo apunta a que Nintendo Switch volverá a dominar en 2022 aunque desde su compañía han avisado de que no habrá tantas en tiendas como querrían.

Un Black Friday para el olvido en el año de la nostalgia

Para las consolas el Black Friday de 2021 en España fue una de esas ocasiones en las que las expectativas quedan muy por encima de los resultados. Ni PlayStation 5 ni Xbox Series X|S llegaron a sorprender por unas cifras rompedoras aunque sí por la cercanía que se dio entre ambas esa semana.

Sony se quedaba en unas muy flojas 5.500 consolas y de cerca la dupla Xbox le tocaba los talones con 4.000 consolas. Número que para dar contexto se movían en la media de una PS5 bastante ausente en estanterías y por encima de una Xbox Series X|S que a lo largo del año ha estado oscilando entre las 1.000 y las 3.000 consolas semanales.

Con un panorama así Switch lo tuvo fácil para septuplicar a PS5 aun teniendo su peor Black Friday hasta la fecha. La híbrida vendió 35.000 consolas. Lejos de las 50.000 de 2020 y muy lejos de las 60.000 de 2019. Nintendo ha dominado sí pero su descenso en hardware este año ha quedado patente con el viernes negro.

Las que sí han pegado con fuerza este año han sido las miniconsolas retro. Aquí Nintendo ha sabido jugar las cartas de la nostalgia y la sensación de urgencia con la Game & Watch de Zelda. La consola del 35 aniversario de Link llegó con 17.500 colocadas en sus dos primeros días de vida y terminó 2021 con hasta 27.500 unidades colocadas. Su hermana mayor la Game & Watch de Mario llegó a ser segunda en ventas de hardware entre el 27 de septiembre y el 3 de octubre.

FIFA y Pokémon los juegos más vendidos del año

Los lanzamientos más potentes del año han sido los que han llegado durante el último trimestre. España país del fútbol por excelencia ha dejado claro que FIFA sigue siendo el juego rey del deporte rey y como prueba están las casi 540.000 copias en formato físico que vendió desde su lanzamiento el 27 de septiembre.

También deja claro que sus jugadores están repartidos entre PlayStation 4 y Nintendo Switch. De todas esas ventas el 61% ha sido de la versión de PS4 y el 216% de la Legacy Edition para la híbrida de Nintendo. El resto se reparten entre las versiones next-gen de PS5 y Xbox Series con Xbox One y PC como colistas. La falta de nuevas consolas ha impedido que las funciones exclusivas de next-gen lleguen a más manos.

Como ya hemos adelantado la segunda franquicia que escala a lo más alto del software de 2021 ha sido Pokémon. Con el rompedor Leyendas Pokémon: Arceus fichado para 2022 Sinnoh ha tenido vía libre para llenar la cota de monstruos de bolsillo del año y no ha desperdiciado la ocasión. Los remakes Pokémon Diamante Brillante y Perla Reluciente han terminado el año con un total de 210.000 juegos físicos vendidos (incluyendo una edición Dual que vale por dos al incluir una copia de cada edición). ¿El favorito? Un Diamante Brillante capitaneado por el legendario Palkia que ha acaparado casi el 66% de las ventas de estos remakes.

¿Quién se acomoda en el top 3 de software físico en España? Un fontanero que viste los colores de Nintendo. Super Mario 3D World + Bowser's Fury no ha parado de arañar ventas con constancia semana a semana desde su lanzamiento en enero de 2021 llegando a terminar el año con un total de 191.000 unidades vendidas. Ser de Wii U no le ha pesado de hecho el nuevo capítulo añadido el estar disponible en una consola que vende sin parar (y el bigote ya puestos) lo han mantenido siempre a flote.

Los lanzamientos de 2021 más vendidos



FIFA 22 (Multi) - 537.000 copias

Pokémon Diamante Brillante y Perla Reluciente (Nintendo Switch) - 228.000 copias

Super Mario 3D World + Bowser's Fury (Nintendo Switch) - 187.000 copias

Just Dance 2022 (Multi) - 90.000 copias

The Legend of Zelda: Skyward Sword HD (Nintendo Switch) - 60.000 copias

Far Cry 6 (Multi) - 59.000 copias

Mario Party Superstars (Nintendo Switch) - 59.000 copias

NBA 2K22 (Multi) - 58.000 copias

Ratchet & Clank: Una Dimensión Aparte (PS5) - 57.500 copias

F1 2021 (Multi) - 55.000 copias

Resident Evil Village (Multi) - 46.000 copias

Metroid Dread (Nintendo Switch) - 37.000 copias

Monster Hunter: Rise (Nintendo Switch) - 33.000 copias

Call of Duty: Vanguard (Multi) - 31.500 copias

Marvel's Guardians of the Galaxy (Multi) - 29.000 copias

Big Brain Academy: Batalla de Ingenio (Nintendo Switch) - 22.000 copias

Ghost of Tsushima: Director's Cut (PS4/PS5) - 20.000 copias

Battlefield 2042 (Multi) - 17.000 copias



Puede que hayamos obviado otros títulos deportivos fuertes como NBA 2K22 o F1 2021 (55.000 copias) u otras ""nintendadas"" como Mario Party Superstars (59.000 copias) incluso ""milagros"" como el primer Metroid 2D nuevo hecho en España Metroid Dread (37.000 copias). Los exitazos en las estanterías han marcado enormes distancias frente a todo lo demás reforzando la idea de que el software ha cerrado 2021 con unas cifras muy buenas para Switch PS4 y PS5. Ese trío ha sido el capitán en las ventas de videojuegos sin alterar el orden salvo alguna rarísima ocasión.

Los estrenos más flojos del año en 'retail'

No todo son cifras estratosféricas y de cientos de miles. A lo largo de 2021 hemos sido testigos de varios estrenos que han sumado unas cifras flojas que a su vez han reflejado el estado del hardware en algunas ocasiones.

Hay franquicias que no fallan como FIFA; pero este año ha sido el de la caída de otros titanes. Call of Duty: Vanguard casi pasaba de puntillas con sus 10.000 copias de lanzamiento. Quizá el desgaste quizá un formato físico que va quedando relegado a un segundo plano en ciertas IP. Sea como fuere un pack de Fortnite le adelantaba por la derecha en su semana de estreno.

Las 3.500 copias de Returnal estrenado en la misma semana que New Pokémon Snap demostraban que PS5 todavía no tenía tirón suficiente como para elevar a un juego exclusivo en ventas y menos a una nueva IP. Algo similar sucedió con Deathloop porque ni los bucles hacía que alcanzara las 1.500 ventas de estreno.

Microsoft también tiene nota que tomar de su paso por tiendas en 2021. Sus grandes puntas de lanza Halo Infinite y Forza Horizon 5 llegaron casi de incógnito a las tiendas y sumaron unas cifras de estreno que combinadas no sumaron más de 5.000 unidades. No es para nada una sorpresa porque en Microsoft cada vez están más volcados con llevar a los usuarios a Game Pass.

Nintendo por su parte tampoco se libra de protagonizar algunos de estos episodios. A pesar de firmar el segundo mejor lanzamiento del año la compañía también ha tenido estrenos como el de un Mario Golf al que Alex Kidd le ganaba en su terreno o WarioWare: Get It Together! que se movía en unas cifras similares al juego deportivo de Mario.

Ni la fuerte presencia de la híbrida lograba que algunas rarezas como No More Heroes III levantaran cabeza aunque sí demostró que España sí es país para Travis o que hay esperanza para el rol duro como el de Shin Megami Tensei V.

Con el catálogo de lanzamientos que se está empezando a abrir camino este año la competencia se antoja mucho más dura que en 2021. En Gamereactor seguiremos el desarrollo de las ventas en tiendas españolas durante todo 2022 y como de costumbre os mantendremos informados."

VZ,Verizon,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiS2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNubi5jb20vMjAyMi8wMS8yMi90ZWNoL2hvdy10by1hY2Nlc3MtNWctYXR0LXZlcml6b24vaW5kZXguaHRtbNIBRGh0dHBzOi8vYW1wLmNubi5jb20vY25uLzIwMjIvMDEvMjIvdGVjaC9ob3ctdG8tYWNjZXNzLTVnLWF0dC12ZXJpem9u?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,How to access AT&T and Verizon's new super fast 5G networks,"CNN Business —

Many mobile device users in the United States now have access to blazing-fast internet speeds stemming from the rollout of Verizon (VZ) and AT&T (T)’s new C-band 5G networks earlier this week.

While telecom companies have rolled out 5G networks to various locations across the country over the last few years many delivered an experience that was arguably only a notch above what 4G offers. Now AT&T (T) which owns CNN’s parent company and Verizon have turned on C-band 5G networks which are an important set of higher radio frequencies. These networks will supercharge the internet as we know it allowing users to for example stream a Netflix movie in 4K resolution or download a movie in seconds. (Verizon said its C-band speeds reach nearly 1 gigabyte per second about 10 times as fast as 4G LTE. If that’s not obvious it’s really fast.)

But not everyone will be able to take advantage of these C-band 5G networks out of the gate. You’ll need three key things to access one: a newer smartphone model that supports 5G a 5G-specific cellular plan and to be in an area with the new coverage.

Here’s what you need to know:

Is my phone compatible?

AT&T and Verizon have a handful of devices that are compatible with their new C-band 5G networks including the iPhone 12 and iPhone 13 models the Samsung Galaxy S21 line and soon Google’s Pixel 6 phones. (For a full list of C-band compatible devices visit AT&T and Verizon’s websites.)

If you’re on an Android device you can check which network your phone supports by going to Settings tapping on Network and Internet and then selecting Mobile Network. On iOS open Settings then Cellular and tap Cellular Data Options. If you’re using Dual SIM on iOS go to Settings then Cellular and choose the number whose options you want to change.

But if you haven’t bought a new smartphone in the past two years you most likely have a 3G or 4G phone.

It’s only a matter of time before most new phones come with built-in 5G support as manufacturers and carriers will push customers toward it over other networks. (AT&T plans to shut down its 3G network next month Verizon is shutting down its 3G network by the end of the year and T-Mobile will shut down Sprint’s 3G network by March 31.)

Do I need a new cellular plan?

If you own a 5G device you’ll still need a 5G-specific plan to access the faster C-band network. Existing 5G subscribers can do so without an additional charge. Both AT&T and Verizon offer plans that start at $35 a month for each phone line.

Verizon also announced a 5G home internet plan for its C-band network starting at $50 a month.

Where are the C-band networks?

Even if you have a 5G-capable device and a 5G mobile plan you may not be able to access the new higher-speed 5G network.

AT&T’s new C-band 5G network — which it is calling the 5G+ network — is currently only available in eight metro areas including Chicago Houston Austin Dallas/Fort Worth Detroit Miami Jacksonville and Orlando. The company said it will expand to more cities throughout the year most likely in cities where it has already launched 5G in other bands.

Anyone with a 5G-compatible phone will be able to download the latest mobile operating system to gain access to the network. On AT&T’s network anyone in a 5G+ market will see a “5G+” at the top of the device when the network is available.

Meanwhile Verizon said its new 5G Ultra Wideband network will be available to 100 million more people this month in over 1700 US cities including Chicago Miami Los Angeles New York City and even smaller cities such as Dayton Ohio and Rochester New York. To see if service is in your area Verizon’s website has a coverage map.

A “5G UW” indicator will appear on the top right corner of the device when a 5G phone on one of the plans is detected on the network.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiQmh0dHBzOi8vZHJvbmVsaWZlLmNvbS8yMDIyLzAxLzIzL2Ryb25lcy1hbmQtbW9iaWxlLWVkZ2UtY29tcHV0aW5nL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Drones and Mobile Edge Computing: Verizon and AWS Expand Service,"Verizon and AWS Expand Locations: Easy Aerial Tests Advantages for Drones and Mobile Edge Computing

by DRONELIFE Staff Writer Ian M. Crosby

Verizon and AWS are expanding their mobile edge computing service Verizon 5G Edge with AWS Wavelength to Charlotte Detroit Los Angeles and Minneapolis. The real-time cloud computing platform brings AWS compute and storage services to the edge of Verizon’s wireless network and minimizes the latency and network hops required to connect from an application hosted on the platform to the end user’s device. Launched in 2020 5G Edge with AWS Wavelength enables developers and businesses to create and deploy a range of applications including machine learning Internet of Things (IoT) and video and game streaming. Mobile edge computing is available in 17 locations in the U.S. via AWS Wavelength zones.

Fermata Energy a Verizon Ventures company and Easy Aerial a leading provider of drone-in-a-box-based monitoring and inspection solutions rank among the participants in the 5G Studio a collaboration between Verizon and Newlab to develop transformative technology solutions that make use of Verizon’s 5G Ultra Wideband network technology and Verizon 5G Edge with AWS Wavelength at Newlab

The low end-to-end latency provided by Verizon 5G Edge with AWS Wavelength enabled Easy Aerial to collect and transfer live drone video for near real-time object detection and telemetry data for rapid processing and analysis. 5G and mobile edge computing also allowed for the removal of costly computers from the drone reportedly saving roughly 10% in drone costs and increasing flight time by approximately 40%.

“Being able to utilize the high bandwidth for unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) that Verizon 5G Edge with AWS Wavelength provides is a game changer” said Easy Aerial CTO Ivan Stamatovski. “It shifts the paradigm on what is possible to achieve with airborne sensors by processing data at the edge of the network in near real-time.”

Fermata Energy’s Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) technology enables electric vehicles (EVs) to serve as mini power plants by discharging energy services from EVs’ batteries to the home building or energy grid through the use of a bidirectional charger. This technology enables Fermata Energy to deploy an EV as an effective energy resource.

Additionally Verizon and AWS are working with software as a service (SaaS) providers Couchbase and Confluent to make it easier to build applications running on Verizon 5G Edge with AWS Wavelength. With the use of infrastructure templates Verizon and AWS improved the abilities of these providers to automate the complexity of edge networking core compute and the software itself.

“Using Verizon 5G Edge with AWS Wavelength and Confluent our joint customers are able to build real-time IoT connections with ultra-low latency” said Gerry Fierling Sr. Director Global AWS Alliance Confluent. “This allows organizations to intelligently respond to events happening essentially in real-time as they deploy more 5G-enabled devices across their organizations to power next-generation digital experiences and business processes.”

Verizon also offers developers the 5G Edge Discovery Service to easily implement the 5G Edge footprint into mobile applications available on the 5G Edge developer portal.

“Through our continued collaboration with AWS we’re helping developers and businesses in every industry create truly transformational applications for use cases such as immersive VR gaming video distribution and connected and autonomous vehicles” said Verizon Business CEO Tami Erwin. “By expanding our 5G Edge locations across the U.S. we’re enabling developers to quickly and easily build apps and services that take advantage of the low latency massive bandwidth and strong reliability of 5G and edge computing.”

Verizon 5G Edge with AWS Wavelength is currently available in Atlanta Boston Charlotte Chicago Dallas Denver Detroit Houston Las Vegas Los Angeles Miami Minneapolis New York City Phoenix the San Francisco Bay Area Seattle and Washington DC.

This article was updated on Feb. 2 2022 to reflect clarifications from AT&T.

The Wellesley Municipal Light Plant (WMLP) has completed its installation of AT&T’s antennas that boost coverage and provide 5G data service. The mounting of the small cell antennas began in June 2020 when the WMLP announced that boxes would be affixed to telephone poles around town.

In the end there were 41 AT&T nodes installed. Based on the map provided by the WMLP 36% of the boxes have been installed on or adjacent to Worcester St. (Route 9) or Washington St. (Route 16) and the remainder in neighborhoods.

Don Newell Director of the Municipal Light Plant stated that the AT&T project was now completed. According to current plans the MLP will be installing 35 small cell antenna attachments for T-Mobile over the next five months.

Newell added “WMLP and T-Mobile will be holding an informational webinar in February 2022. The staff are in the process of finalizing the locations and installation schedules.” There was no mention of Verizon however coverage maps from industry sources show Verizon with 4G coverage along major travel routes in Wellesley.

I first became aware of the installation near my house in Wellesley Hills when I found my AT&T phone coverage showing “5 bars”. This was a striking improvement over the weak reception I’ve had in the past. By using the Speedtest app I was able to obtain download speeds of 150 Mbps+ on an iPhone SE second generation which showed “5GE” service. When I used an iPhone 12 it showed “5G” with a download speed of over 200 Mbps and I suspect it would be much faster nearer the antenna. According to AT&T the current network is a “4G LTE” even if the phone icons show otherwise.

When I investigated why my service was so much improved I found that one of the “small cell” antennas had been installed about 2/10 of a mile from my house and that the family room was “line of sight” to the pole with the AT&T node. All of this to say that most people unless they are directly in view of the new AT&T boxes will not see 200 Mbps downloads. I tested this theory by walking the street as there are two of the small cells about 0.5 miles from each other. In between the two poles the download rate dropped to about 40 Mbps which is still not bad.

Although some may have concerns about the cosmetics of the new cell arrays several neighbors I spoke with seem to have no such worries. Most commented that the gray rectangular nodes are no worse than the existing cable and transformer boxes that already festoon the poles. One neighbor whose house had a new box installed directly in front of them said that they switched to AT&T from their previous provider when the installation was completed – and now have great coverage.

While Wellesley is continuing down the 5G path there is still controversy at the national level with the technology. Just this week major airlines warned of “catastrophic disruption” to travel and shipping from 5G installations by Verizon and AT&T near airports. Verizon and AT&T had agreed to delay activating 5G using the newly acquired C-band spectrum twice: originally from December 5 and then pushed back again from a planned January 5 launch date until two weeks later. The delays were meant to give the industries Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) FCC and White House more time to address concerns.

Time will tell if the 5G rollout will be slowed down due to these concerns but at least in Wellesley we will have the benefit of better reception and faster speeds from AT&T and soon T-Mobile.

What is 5G and when does it arrive in Wellesley?

According to industry sources “5G is a 5th generation mobile network. It is a new global wireless standard that enables a new kind of network.” There are many variations of 5G technology some of which use existing 4G LTE infrastructure.

In Wellesley AT&T’s small cell antenna installation is based on 4G LTE technology.

When asked about why some phones in Wellesley may show “5G” speeds an AT&T spokesman said: “The technology is 4G LTE currently however 5G may display on devices due to overlapping coverage from nearby macro cells. The equipment is 5G capable which can be enabled in the future. And additional radio frequency equipment can be added for more speed whether 4G or 5G.”

We’ll keep a close eye out to see if things speed up even more!

The opportunity for a crash conversion from fossil fuels that was posed by 2020’s pandemic-induced economic paralysis is now being squandered. The fashionable COVID denialism of the anti-vaxxers is ironically complicit in the actual crimes of the pharmaceutical industry such as the instating of a “vaccine apartheid” —failing to make the vaccine available to Africa and the much of the Global South. Just at the moment that socialist ideas are being legitimized in mainstream discourse again the drum-beat for “normalcy” (sic) means less pressure for an urgently mandated public expropriation of corporate cyber-overlords such as Verizon as well as Big Pharma and Big Oil. Meanwhile consumerist and technocratic pseudo-solutions such as the bogus notion of reducing one’s personal “carbon footprint” obscure the systemic nature of the problem.

Drugmaker Biocon is banking on the ramp-up of interchangeable biosimilar insulin glargine expecting the product to boost the revenue and profit growth in the next several quarters primarily from the US market ""The launch supplies for the interchangeable biosimilar insulin glargine have made a big difference"" said Shreehas Tambe deputy CEO Biocon Biologics in an interview with ET.Tambe said the market share of its biosimilar insulin glargine which is marketed by its partner Viatris both as branded ( Semglee ) and an unbranded version has been able to corner around 2%-4% market share.""We are looking at this market share to get into teens in the coming financial year"" Tambe said.Semglee which was approved in July last year became the first interchangeable biosimilar product approved by USFDA allowing the substitution of Semglee for Sanofi's Lantus . Biocon and Viatris have jointly developed Semglee. While Biocon supplies the drug Viatris is responsible for regulatory approvals and distribution in the US market.Semglee which is available in both the pen and vial presentations represents a $2 billion opportunity for Biocon and Viatris. The interchangeable biosimilar also has exclusivity of one year to reap the windfall.Biocon doesn't individually provide the break-up of individual product sales but biosimilar glargine along with sales of oncology biosimilars and insulins portfolio in emerging markets has boosted the performance of Biocon Biologics - the subsidiary that houses biosimilar business. Sales of Biocon Biologics which contributes about 45% of Biocon's revenues rose 28% year-on-year to Rs 981 crore in FY22.Biocon's partner Viatris is working to ensure wide access to the product that is priced at almost 65% discount from the list price of Lantus. The interchangeable glargine has received preferred status in the national formularies of two leading US pharmacy benefit managers (PBMs) Prime Therapeutics and Express Scripts and will also be offered through Walgreens Prescription Savings Club.Tambe said all this would ensure availability to 60 million patients and the idea is to reach as many patients as possible regardless of financial circumstances insurance or channel.Biocon sells two biosimilars Fulphila (pegfilgrastim) and Ogivri (trastuzumab) both used for treating cancers in the US. It also has three products adalimumab bevacizumab and insulin aspart ready for launch.Biocon also entered covid vaccines by partnering with Serum Institute of India (SII) in September 2021. The partnership allows Biocon Biologics to fill-finish and distribute 100 million doses of Covishield and Covavax vaccines annually. The vaccines will be supplied by SII.Tambe said the commercialisation will begin from October 2022 and will help the company earn $400 million revenues with expected EBITDA margins in the range of mid to high 30s.",,,,,,,,,,,,

If you have fallen for a scam you are not alone.

Online scams have been on the rise since the pandemic started. Stats from Canada's Anti-Fraud Centre (CAFC) indicate there were more than 68000 reported cases of fraud in 2021 and that is not including December. The losses totalled up to $231 million more than double the losses in 2020.

Knowledge is your best defence against scams. Beyond the CAFC website the Better Business Bureau (BBB) has a scam tracker that keeps tabs on reported cases of fraud. In this article we have compiled a list of tips for avoiding fake job offers and a few more to help you find the real deal.

How to avoid job offer scams

A general rule of thumb is if you think the job offer is too good to be true you're probably right.

Here are some of the clues that may indicate you have a fake job offer on your hands:

If you didn't apply for it it's probably not real. Fake job offers are usually unsolicited. They come from companies you didn't apply to for jobs that you didn't apply for.

They may offer a high salary and have vague requirements that make them seem like anyone could be a good candidate (over age 18 no experience required etc.) They are designed to pander to your emotions to make you think the job search is over and you have found a source of financial security.

The sender's email address may be suspicious— or it may not. Legitimate business owners do use free email services like Gmail but it is more likely that companies will have their own domain names in their email address. Keep in mind though scammers are able to hijack emails of existing companies and pose as recruiters. If you do suspect you received a fake job offer from a real company—do not reply to the email—but contact someone else at that company to see if they really tried to get ahold of you. If there is no contact information in the sender's email that could be a red flag.

The fake recruiter may ask you to pay money in order to get the job offer. They may give you a cheque to buy supplies with which turns out to be fake and you are left on the hook for whatever you purchased. You should not have to pay for a legitimate job offer or do any transaction activities.

They ask for personal information such as your home address and your Social Insurance Number (SIN). You should never give out your SIN unless it is legally required. Employers only need your SIN after you are hired.

Lastly do a simple search before you agree to anything. Do not click on any links reply to any messages or download anything until you are satisfied that you are talking to a legitimate recruiter. You should have been expecting their message if you are. Do a quick background check on the sender and the company they are representing. See if typing the company name along with ""scam"" turns up any results.

If you do suspect you have received a fake job offer you can report it to the CAFC and the BBB.

Finding genuine job offers: network and apply

When you receive a real job offer it is from a company that you know. Either you applied to it or you were introduced to them through networking.

LinkedIn estimates about 85% of jobs are found through networking. So if you know people in Canada ask them for leads.

If you are in Canada you can also search for employment services offered by your municipality or province. If you are an international student your university will have resources to help you find jobs.

When you are applying online try sending your application to the company website directly.

You can also find resources that are specifically for helping newcomers find jobs. Immigration Refugees and Citizenship Canada (IRCC) offers free settlement and employment services on their website which can be used whether you are in Canada or abroad. Canada also has a job bank website where Canadian employers can search for local and international talent.

You can also check the provincial websites that are participating in the Atlantic Immigration Program (AIP) to find designated employers who are seeking foreign workers. Also communities participating in the Rural and Northern Immigration Pilot (RNIP) may have opportunities on their municipal webpages.

Make sure when you apply that you have a cover letter and a Canadian-style resume which usually includes less personal information than what is required in other countries. Tailor your application to the job you are applying for. Read the job description thoroughly. Explain to the hiring manager why you are a good fit and how you can benefit the company. Do a quick background check on the company too see if it is a good place to work.

Finally just apply. Employers hire for a number of reasons beyond what is written on the page. Even if you do not think you are qualified apply anyway.

Stock options short selling and meme stocks? If you ask podcast hosts Braden Dennis 26 and Simon Belanger 36 young investors engaging in risky trades have it wrong.

Despite being young investors themselves their series the Canadian Investor Podcast does not endorse the kind of trading that is trendy among millennials.

“The reality is that neither of us have any interest in doing that whatsoever” Mr. Dennis said. “I try to own the best businesses on the planet and then hold them for a really long time. That’s basically it.”

The podcast recently topped the Apple charts for Canadian business podcasts and has proven particularly popular among young Canadians. Of the show’s one million listens the median listener age is 32 with listeners in their 30s being the largest demographic. Listeners in their 20s are the second-largest demographic followed by Canadians in their 60s in third.

Long-term holds are a simple approach but one that Mr. Belanger said was missing from the podcast world when they started their own show as a hobby two years ago.

“There were a lot of U.S.-centric podcasts out there but none specifically for Canadians” Mr. Belanger said. “Talking about Roth IRAs and 401ks I think it can be hard for Canadians to relate to that.”

Meanwhile they found there were enough Canadian companies and a sufficient difference between the RRSP and TFSA and American investment accounts to make a distinct podcast worthwhile.

Prior to hosting their series the pair were strangers who only knew each other through a social-media connection. While finishing his bachelor of engineering at the University of Guelph in 2016 Mr. Dennis hosted a part-time podcast where he interviewed authors who had written books of interest to him. Mr. Belanger heard an episode of the podcast and the pair connected over LinkedIn.

Several years later during the summer of 2019 Mr. Belanger was in Toronto for a pension conference near to where Mr. Dennis now lives and they decided to meet up for the first time at a bar downtown to talk about running a podcast together.

“We just had a drink chatted a bit and said ‘okay let’s give it a shot’ ” Mr. Belanger said.

The podcast’s tone is conversational with each episode discussing investment strategies company research and relevant market news. Ideal for investors who have at least a basic understanding of the markets the 45-minute podcasts feel dense with research.

The pair both describe their investing styles as largely fundamental: looking at long-term growth a few years or even a decade out. Developing a stock portfolio is more complicated than just picking stocks Mr. Dennis said: Finding good businesses requires patience and research.

This is where new investors make mistakes they said. On TikTok they see how young people at the beginning of their investment education are encouraged to buy meme stocks and take on undue risk.

The last two years have seen momentous growth in most of the world’s markets: To date the S&P 500 for instance has grown by more than 100 per cent since the lows of the early-pandemic crash in March 2020. This presents new investors with an unrealistic expectation of what markets will look like over the long term they said.

“What we find is that many new investors throw their entire portfolio in a company they’ve never heard of. The allure of making a lot of money quickly – I think that’s attractive for a lot of people. I think it’s just human nature” Mr. Belanger said.

In demonstration of their contrasting approach the hosts are open about their holdings. In a December episode the pair walked listeners through their whole portfolio weightings.

Among them are Canadian large-cap companies (Constellation Software Brookfield Asset Management Inc. Canadian National Railway The Home Depot Inc.) tech stocks (Google LLC Apple Inc. Amazon.com Inc.) payment platforms (Mastercard Inc. Visa Inc. Block Inc.) and some lesser known companies cryptocurrency and ETFs.

Mr. Dennis and Mr. Belanger say bitcoin makes up about 5 per cent and 20 per cent of their portfolios respectively.

“I started investing in bitcoin after the 2017 crash and have been dollar cost averaging since. It might seem like a large portion of my portfolio but it has become that over time because of the great returns it has provided me” Mr. Belanger said noting he was attracted by the cryptocurrency’s decentralized protocol and capped supply.

While Mr. Belanger did not disclose his returns Mr. Dennis estimates his portfolio up to November earned about 2 per cent better than the S&P 500 last year but was behind by 4 per cent in 2020.

After graduating Mr. Dennis worked for several years in manufacturing and renewable power before founding an investment research platform Stratosphere Technologies Inc. which now employs three people and runs out of Toronto.

Mr. Belanger from Chelsea Que. gained his experience through various human resources-roles and currently advises on pensions and retirement planning.

They don’t hold certified financial planner or chartered financial analyst designations but they believe that being self-taught investors makes them more relatable to a wide-ranging audience.

Mr. Belanger says that being a francophone also helps him relate to listeners whose first language is not English.

“There are other podcasts where if you don’t have a strong financial knowledge base it can be really intimidating. We try to explain everything as best as we can – we don’t try to assume that people necessarily know what we’re talking about” Mr. Belanger said.

Mr. Belanger also acknowledged that investing always comes with inherent risk – and balancing that risk is a learning process. When he was around 20 Mr. Belanger said he invested $2000 on a junior mining company – a lot of money for him at the time – and lost the entire amount when the company went bankrupt shortly after.

“It’s probably the best thing that’s happened to me because it taught me that I should always do my own research before investing in a company. That’s something we constantly say on our podcast” Mr. Belanger said.

When asked by listeners or friends for stock tips they say they refrain from naming individual companies. Instead they promote the power of compounding interest and encouraging new investors to take advantage of easy instruments such as index ETFs if even with a small investment to start.

“The biggest advantage younger investors have” Mr. Belanger said “is time.”

Designed by HDO Architecture the new building will include commercial space on the ground floor and total of 98 parking spaces four being ADA compliant and six for electric vehicles. The development will also feature 50 bicycle spaces plus an additional ten on the sidewalk. The building will also include a roof deck green roof and six added street trees.

The new building will feature an attractive industrial design taking cues from the site’s history as well as its present surroundings. Brickwork will cover the vast majority of the front-facing facade rising the entire height of the building interrupted only by large industrial-styled windows. Floor-to-ceiling windows on the ground floor when also paired with street trees will make a pleasant street presence as will the inclusion of a commercial space. The non-prominent faces of the building will see the usage of gray siding so as to reduce construction costs. The only dampening on the project’s design is the curb cut that is needed in order to provide access to the parking facilities as it creates a sizable cut on the sidewalk.

The most interesting feature of the project’s design however is the inclusion of a historic remnant of a diner that has been moved to the property. Once added the new shiny silver structure will be the centerpiece of the building’s facade and will be a very interesting and unique way of preservation that will make the development that much better allowing it to become something of a neighborhood landmark.

The building will replace a largely underused property with a somewhat rundown industrial building covering on half while a surface parking lot covers the other. In years past a beautiful old industrial building stood at the property and was a prime adaptive reuse candidate although it was torn down due to its blighted condition and left a surface lot to occupy its space which is an incredibly unfortunate turn of events. The new building’s facade is designed to resemble that of the former building. Additionally the structure will also unfortunately come at the expense of another historic industrial landmark in the area where a brick-clad structure will a triangulated roofline formerly stood. Although the building seemed to be in good condition to be renovated it admittedly was not the strongest piece of architecture on the surrounding blocks and its loss is not be too significant to the block.

It is great to see such a large-scale new development appear to be moving in forward in the area which is beginning to see increased development activity. Thanks to Wayne Junction situated just a short walk away frequent rail transit access is offered to multiple Regional Rail lines allowing for great amounts of density to be built in the surroundings. As such it is positive to see developers take advantage of this adding a large bulk of new residential units at the property while also adding a unique commercial space on the ground floor and has the potential to increase the desirability of this small sector of Germantown.

No completion date is known for the development at this time.

Three minutes later Harlen Graber collected a puck in front patiently waited then tucked one in.

Added Vetere: ”I think for us we say it before every game every game is a statement game. We show up every day like it’s the most important game of the year and they only get more important from here on out.”

The mother told police that Taylor was accompanied by another woman who asked for the child's name. The mother did not tell either of them the name she told police but the two women began to call it out according to the release.

Taylor told the mother that she had wanted to purchase a child for a long time. The mother told her to stay away from her child and waited for the two women to leave.

Outside in the parking lot Taylor confronted the mother once again asking to buy her child.

Heather Weedon has been charged with felony arson and misdemeanor retail theft according to a spokeswoman for the Cook County State's Attorney's Office. Additional information about her arrest wasn't immediately available.

According to Lansing authorities on Jan. 7 firefighters responded to the Walmart along Torrence Avenue and discovered ""two separate fire areas"" within the building.

Through an investigation police and fire authorities determined the fires were intentionally set and began searching for those responsible.

A similar incident was reported three days later when multiple fires occurred at the Meijer in Highland Indiana. According to police the fires were likely set as a distraction by shoplifters.

Following the incident authorities released surveillance photos of two potential suspects and announced a reward in hope of finding those responsible.

While Weedon has been charged in connection with the Walmart fire it's unclear if anyone has been arrested for the fire at the Meijer store in Highland.

He may still be in diapers but he's already spending big online.

""It is really hard to believe that he has done this but that’s what happened"" said dad Pramod Kumar.

The screen-savvy New Jersey toddler somehow managed to order close to $2000 worth of furniture online from Walmart. His mother Madhu Kumar had created a cart on her phone but never checked it out. When the furniture started being delivered this week she asked her husband and two older children: Who ordered this?

""I need one or two why would we need four?"" Madhu said.

Some of the packages barely fit through the front door. Turns out little Ayaansh was the one who bought accent chairs flower stands and other household items that his mother had been looking at for their new home in Monmouth Junction. The packages kept coming all week.

""He’s so little he’s so cute we were laughing that he ordered all this stuff"" his mom said.

Since he was born in April 2020 the youngest Kumar has watched his two older siblings and his parents work go to school and shop online all from home. And apparently he’s been paying close attention.

Ayaansh knows what he's doing too. Using an NBC New York reporter's phone he was able to close the calendar app send an email to the reporter's mother and then search through the contacts.

""Moving forward we will put tough passcodes or face recognition so when he picks up the phone he finds it in locked condition"" his dad said.

Pramod and Madhu are planning to wait until all the boxes arrive and then drive the items back to their local Walmart to return them where they have been told they will receive a full refund.

But the parents may keep a couple of things to remind them of their toddler’s first online shopping spree.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMipgFodHRwczovL2xhd2FuZGNyaW1lLmNvbS9jcmltZS90ZXhhcy13b21hbi1hcnJlc3RlZC1hZnRlci1hbGxlZ2VkbHktdHJ5aW5nLXRvLWJ1eS13YWxtYXJ0LXNob3BwZXJzLXNvbi1mb3ItNTAwMDAwLWJlY2F1c2Utc2hlLXdhbnRlZC1oaW0tYW5kLXNoZS13YXMtZ29pbmctdG8tdGFrZS1oaW0v0gGqAWh0dHBzOi8vbGF3YW5kY3JpbWUuY29tL2NyaW1lL3RleGFzLXdvbWFuLWFycmVzdGVkLWFmdGVyLWFsbGVnZWRseS10cnlpbmctdG8tYnV5LXdhbG1hcnQtc2hvcHBlcnMtc29uLWZvci01MDAwMDAtYmVjYXVzZS1zaGUtd2FudGVkLWhpbS1hbmQtc2hlLXdhcy1nb2luZy10by10YWtlLWhpbS9hbXAv?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Texas Woman Arrested After Allegedly Trying to Buy Walmart Shopper’s Son for $500000 ‘Because She Wanted Him and She Was Going to Take Him’: Reports,"A Texas woman shopping at a local Walmart last week reportedly wanted to buy something even the retail behemoth does not sell: another woman’s child. Rebecca Lanette Taylor 49 of Crockett was arrested after police say she offered a mother $500000 to purchase her son “because she wanted him” then continued to harass the woman and her family after her offer was summarily rejected The Messenger of Grapeland Texas reported.

The incident reportedly took place at a Walmart Supercenter located in the 1200 block of Eastern Loop 304 about two hours south of Dallas.

According to an affidavit of probable cause obtained by The Messenger an unidentified mother was waiting in line at the store’s self-checkout line with her two children. She was carrying her infant in a car seat carrier and her 1-year-old son was seated in a shopping cart. As she prepared to scan her items the mother was reportedly approached by Taylor who allegedly began “commenting on her son’s blonde hair and blue eyes” the affidavit reportedly said.

“[Taylor] asked how much she could purchase him for. [The mother] tried to laugh this comment off thinking Taylor was joking” the affidavit stated. “Taylor told her that she had $250000 in the car and she would pay that much for him. [The mother] told her no amount of money would do.”

The mother reportedly told police she demanded that Taylor get away from her and her son but claimed Taylor continued to persist. Taylor who was allegedly accompanied by another woman allegedly explained that she had been trying to purchase a child for a quite a while.

The situation only continued to devolve as Taylor’s companion allegedly asked about the boy’s name. The mother reportedly refused to give the child’s name but said the duo somehow learned the name. Both Taylor and her companion allegedly repeatedly called the little boy’s name.

The mother said she waited inside the store for both of the women to leave but was then allegedly accosted when she got to the parking lot. There Taylor is said to have once again approached the mother about buying her son — and this time she allegedly upped the offer price.

“Taylor began screaming at (the mom) saying if she wouldn’t take $250000 for him then she would give her $500000 because she wanted him and she was going to take him” the affidavit reportedly said.

Even after the mother reportedly locked both of her children in her car Taylor reportedly stood just behind the vehicle and continued to yell about wanting the child until the mother drove away.

Lt. Ahleea Price of the Crocket Police Department responded to the scene. After reviewing surveillance film from inside the store the lieutenant reportedly said the footage matched the mother’s story. Lt. Price obtained a name and address for Taylor and attempted to question the woman at her residence.

“She told me that she doesn’t like thieves then she stated I could speak with her attorney and to get off her ‘precipice.’ She slammed the door shut” Price reportedly wrote in the affidavit.

Taylor was taken into custody on Tuesday on one count of participating in the sale or purchase of a child which is a third-degree felony in Texas. She was reportedly booked in the Houston County Jail and her bond was set at $50000. Houston NBC station KPRC reported that Taylor posted that bond on Thursday.

Newsweek attempted to reach out to the local police department for comment but was unsuccessful.

(AP) — More jobs are coming to north Mississippi where Walmart has plans to build a new fulfillment center.

The company on Thursday said it is spending about $90 million to build a 1000000 square foot warehouse in Olive Branch that’s set to open in the spring. The new facility will store merchandise that is picked packed and shipped directly to customers Walmart said.

“Walmart is proud to welcome its newest fulfillment center to the city of Olive Branch as we continue to grow our national supply chain network and eCommerce capabilities in the mid-South” said Steve Miller senior vice president of supply chain operations for Walmart U.S.

The project will create 250 full-time jobs in the DeSoto County area which is part of the Memphis Tennessee metropolitan area.

“Hundreds of employees from our area teaming with Walmart to successfully operate this new fulfillment center speaks volumes about Olive Branch’s workforce potential and amenities” Mayor Ken Adams said.

In mid-December Bentonville Arkansas-based Walmart announced plans to construct a similar facility in Salt Lake City a week after unveiling a project for a 925000-square-foot automated fulfillment center in Lebanon Tennessee. The Salt Lake City facility is slated to open this summer followed by the Lebanon facility in the fall.

Walmart noted that its distribution centers focus on receiving storing and distributing products to stores whereas fulfillment centers handle e-commerce orders. Walmart currently operates two distribution centers in Mississippi.

“Northwest Mississippi is an ideal location for companies with extensive shipping needs like Walmart” said Laura Hipp interim director of the Mississippi Development Authority. “The region offers an abundance of transportation options as well as a dedicated workforce.”"

But alas: The free service for resort guests complete with baggage that showed up in one's room with no lugging and tugging on the Disneygoers' part ended earlier this year.

So what can parkgoers do if driving from and to the airport was not part of the Disney dream?

There are options – maybe not as magical or with Mickey or Minnie waving in the window but definitely available.

While the Express' goodbye was announced last year the final hurrahs happened in early January.

►'The Disney magic is gone' ... or is it?:Longtime fans weigh in on changes at Disney World

Pamela and Bill Skaar of Grand Prairie Texas are among those who will miss the Express but say they will be back at Walt Disney World as soon as possible. Their last ride on the Express was from the Saratoga Springs Resort and Spa to Orlando International on Jan. 8.

The Skaars became Disney Vacation Club members after a 2007 trip to celebrate their wedding anniversary.

""We began enjoying the convenience and 'magic' of being transported to and from the airport via the Magical Express buses"" Pamela a retired speech-language pathologist said.

""They would get our luggage for us and it magically appeared in our room at our resort just a few hours later! They also were beautiful Disney-themed buses complete with funny entertaining well-mannered drivers and cute Disney videos as we rode along to or from the airport.""

Now they say they'll take Mears Connect operated by Mears whose drivers navigated the Magical Express from 2005 until its farewell. But unlike Magical Express Mears Connect won't be free. Also at least for now Mears won't be picking up luggage for passengers and delivering it to their resort rooms. Guests will have to handle that on their own.

Still the Skaars will treasure the memory of that last trip on the service when they were the only two people on the bus and posed for photos with the driver.

""We have so many happy memories of using the Magical Express just the two of us and other times with our adult children and our grandchildren"" Pamela said. ""One trip years back we brought my sweet mother who is now passed on ... she rode the Magical Express with us and enjoyed WDW for the first time in her life in her 70s.""

Transportation to Walt Disney resorts options

For those needing a lift from the airport to Disney resorts here are some options.

Mears Connect offering Standard and Express options.

Cost for a one-way Standard shared-ride service is $16 each way for adults $13.50 each way for children.

For $250 travelers can book the Express direct-to-resort service for four passengers. Add $55 apiece for additional passengers. It could the site advises be a shared service.

For information and reservations: mearsconnect.com. For a private car you'll need a reservation at least a day in advance and for the shuttle 24 hours in advance. Cabs are also available through Mears 24/7. Passengers will have to stop by baggage claim before heading to the Mears location at Orlando International where they will board in Terminal B on Level 1 ground transportation level in the old Disney location.

Taxi Uber or Lyft: All of these options are available at Orlando International with choices including UberX UberXL and on the more expensive end Uber Black.

Sunshine Flyer: This direct-from-airport-to-resorts bus service hasn't kicked off yet – the launch is set for Feb. 1 – but shows promise for those looking for the kind of entertainment-filled offerings that endeared them to the Magical Express. Rather than Disney-centric it's being touted as reminiscent of rail travel in the 1920s complete with buses wrapped as locomotive or passenger cars and drivers and staff dressed as conductors and engineers.

Cost for adults is $17 for one-way and $34 for round-trip tickets. For children ages 3 to 9: $12.50 for one-way; $25 round-trip. Children younger than 2 may sit on an adult's lap for free. Get details sunshineflyer.com.

Car rental: While this can be the best option for those who want the freedom of having a vehicle at their disposal during a trip remember that along with not being entertained there are tolls along the way. On top of that there's the parking fee at Disney resorts up to $25 per night.

James Ruml 29 was subbing for a writing class Nov. 16 when three 11-year-old students watched as the teacher “leaned back in his chair stretched his legs wide open and began touching his genital area” Cook County prosecutors said during a livestreamed bail hearing Saturday. Authorities said it happened in the 4100 block of North Marine Drive which is where Walt Disney Magnet School is located.

Ruml then allegedly got up to walk around the classroom before stopping in a corner of the room where he continued touching himself according to prosecutors who noted that he was fully clothed the entire time.

Students told a teacher about the alleged incident two days later and the school notified police prosecutors said.

Ruml a Chicago resident has been a CPS substitute for three years according to his defense attorney Joseph Cavanaugh. There were no accusations that Ruml exposed himself or made any attempt to touch the students Cavanaugh said.

The substitute teacher turned himself in Jan. 20 and his bail was set at $75000 Saturday. Ruml was prohibited from contact with anyone under the age of 18 while his case is pending. He is due in court again Feb. 3.

The company and its subsidiaries may not be circling the drain yet but Warner Bros. is on an infirm plane at the moment PR-wise between the problems at DC Comics and Joss Whedon’s recent attempt at explaining himself and clearing his name.

RELATED: Joss Whedon Says Ray Fisher Is A Bad Actor Gal Gadot Misinterpreted His Comments In Response To Misconduct And Abuse Accusations On Justice League

Neither case is going right for those who would benefit and fans are rebelling even harder on Twitter. They got the hashtag #BoycottWB to trend into the top topics in the past week or so and more than that many have taken the side of Ray Fisher – who has made it more than clear he is no friend to the studio or Whedon.

He doesn’t like Geoff Johns either and takes every opportunity to call the comic writer and TV producer a racist.

RELATED: After Geoff Johns Returns To DC Comics For Flashpoint Beyond Ray Fisher Calls Him A Racist Ethan Van Sciver Defends Johns

Fisher also blames Johns and WB for enabling Whedon’s behavior and while forgiveness is divine it’s a long way off for the latter seemingly. Conversely Fisher is finding backup in the #BoycottWB movement if you can call it that.

Twitterers of the opinion Fisher really is standing up for racial injustice in the workplace are cropping up. One is the user @Spagggs who posted quite plainly “WB fired Ray Fisher for standing up against their racial abuse.”

RELATED: Willem Dafoe “Fantasized About” Inserting Himself Into Joker 2

No they’re not alone. Others are lining up to reply using the hashtag and adding their support.

Here’s what @BobDigi69 had to say about Cyborg’s reported arc in The Flash being cut out and Fisher getting fired: “Ray Fisher had a substantial role in the Flash and was fired and the movie reworked because he was a whistle-blower to abuse generated by people protected by the organization.”

A user named @inkedrescuer is perhaps the most fervent listing all the aspects of the DCEU WB interfered with which wasn’t limited to Justice League.

They altered everything they could about Zack Snyder’s vision and David Ayer to give us two very different cuts of two separate movies leaving one (the Ayer Cut of Suicide Squad) never to be seen.

RELATED: Ben Affleck Hints He Is Done With Batman After The Flash And Recalls Awful Experience On Justice League

In that post something else fans are rallying behind was pointed out – the drama Ben Affleck had to put up with.

Affleck recently explained it was the combo of Zack Snyder walking away when hit by a family tragedy and demands of putting up with the studio that took a toll on his personal life and ruined playing Batman.

Said @GonCruS for instance “#BoycottWB for pushing Ben Affleck to the edge #RestoreTheSnyderVerse.”

@Spagggs weighed in on this aspect of WB’s transgressions too. “#BoycottWB so actors don’t have to have to suffer the same experience that Ben Affleck had to go through” they wrote.

RELATED: Warner Bros. Announces New Films Will Release On HBO Max Just 45 Days After Theatrical Premiere Starting With The Batman

Some think the solution to make up for all the pain is to give DC its own studio with more autonomy similar to Marvel’s dynamic at Disney – the logic being that the Snyderverse has a more optimal chance of getting restored that way.

“We need this!” declared avowed Batfleck fan @GeorgeSeia.

In a reply @2013venjix saw the upside. “Give DC their independence and make WB their silent partner” they said.

RELATED: US Congress Has Anti-Trust Beef With Warner-Discovery Merger Which Could Negatively Impact CNN And DC Comics

If this arrangement took place it wouldn’t make much difference as WB isn’t doing anything too divergent from the comic label. The culture at DC has to change too for them to start listening to fans. It’s a lost art there more than it is at Marvel Disney WB or anywhere.

And speaking of listening to the fans Warner Bros. fumbled another major ball in the game of blockbuster franchise IPs by letting the continuation of Legendary Entertainment’s MonsterVerse slip through their fingers.

Despite the massive box office of Godzilla vs. Kong amid the dubious circumstances of a pandemic and combined worldwide grosses of four films over a decade Warner’s streaming contender HBO Max won’t be the home of the new Godzilla TV series in development.

That honor goes to Apple TV+ now that they managed to strike a deal to stream the show and this development is causing a lot of buzz. Unable to bask in it Warner is getting roasted on Twitter while they weather every other storm.

RELATED: Godzilla TV Series Set In MonsterVerse Coming To Apple TV Plus

Some theorize there is a reason believing Warner Bros. and Legendary aren’t getting along anymore making the latter party seek “greener pastures.”

Others identify the cause as Legendary wanting revenge for Warner’s protectionary maneuvers when finally releasing GVK in theaters and on streaming last year that kept Legendary from selling their film to Netflix.

Netflix has the bragging rights of airing the Skull Island animated series and looking at it now it appears this deal with the Kong-centered series was the first salvo.

RELATED: Netflix Announces Skull Island Anime Series Starring Kong And Set In The MonsterVerse

Then again in all fairness we don’t know the status of Legendary and Warner’s partnership but WB is certainly giving the impression they are allowing their biggest assets to die.

With all of the above going on time will tell what condition Warner Bros. is going to be in after the Discovery merger is finalized.

Morales who earned a UFC deal on an episode of Dana White’s Contender Series in 2021 was the first to absorb a knockdown strike – but he wasn’t the last. After he regained himself Morales unleashed havoc on Giles who struggled to stay upright but eventually found his way.

Giles did not stay upright for long however as another brutal Morales combination sent him back down to the canvas. As Giles grabbed hold of Morales’ leg he received dozens of punches to his head. Referee Mike Beltran saw enough and much to the dismay of Giles waved off the fight.

Waste Connections U.S. Holdings Inc. based in Texas has entered into a deal to purchase ABC Disposal and its sister companies a person with knowledge of the deal has confirmed to WBSM. The deal is expected to close sometime in February.

Michael Camara President of ABC Disposal and CEO of New Bedford Waste Services declined to comment when reached by email Friday night.

WBSM News received a tip about a supposed sale of ABC Disposal back on January 12; when reached that day by phone Camara dismissed the idea that the company had been sold.

New Bedford Waste Services Informed the Town of Rochester of the Sale

However a letter was sent by Camara to Rochester Town Administrator Suzanne Szyndlar on December 17 2021 to notify the town “of the pending sale of New Bedford Waste Services LLC to Waste Connections U.S. Holdings Inc. (or an affiliate thereof)” according to the letter.

WBSM News obtained a copy of that letter which was also stamped “received” by the Rochester Board of Health on December 21.

What Is New Bedford Waste Services?

According to the website for New Bedford Waste Services LLC the company was created by Camara “to comply with the new restrictions (on dumping of certain types of waste materials into landfills) and to continue to lead in the business of waste processing.”

The website states that “along with processing/recycling of construction and demolition debris New Bedford Waste Services is also permitted to transfer municipal solid waste for final disposal at various landfills and trash to energy plants. The ability to provide these services to Southeastern Massachusetts communities has benefited the various disposal companies and residents in the surrounding area.”

The company operates two plants: one in Rochester and one in Sandwich.

ABC Disposal Will Retain Its Employees and Management Team

According to the person with knowledge of the deal the New Bedford Waste Services sale will include ABC Disposal and all of its sister companies but that all of the employees and the entire management team will remain the same. The person said some of the Camara family will be staying on as well.

Michael Camara seemed to confirm this in his letter to the Town of Rochester stating that “one of (Waste Connections’) main goals for this market is to continue to acquire hauling companies” he wrote. “In fact one of my new responsibilities with WCI will be to work on those acquisitions.”

“I will continue to be around for some time” he wrote.

What Is Waste Connections?

In the letter Camara stated that Waste Connections “is the third-largest waste and recycling company in the United States and Canada” and that the company operates “in 46 states and through Canada.”

According to Dun & Bradstreet Waste Connections U.S. Holdings has 584 companies in its portfolio. Locally it lists Mega Disposal and Patriot Disposal both based in Seekonk as its only SouthCoast operations as well as operating three Rhode Island transfer stations in Pawtucket Johnston and Portsmouth.

It will also take over operations of New Bedford Waste Service’s facilities as well.

What Does the Sale Mean for the Rochester Facility?

Camara’s letter to the Town of Rochester stated that “as a condition of the sale the Rochester Host Community Agreement will be assigned to Waste Connections” and that it should benefit the town financially.

“As they add many more new companies to their portfolio there will also be a substantial amount of new volumes of municipal solid waste coming into the Rochester facility” he wrote. “This will greatly benefit the Town of Rochester with a substantial amount of new host fees.”

Waste Connections is already looking to upgrade the facility as well Camara wrote.

“A major investment will be made in the Rochester facility to improve baling capacity with a high performance baler” he wrote. “This baler will bale three times the volume per hour and the bale weights will improve from 2200 lbs. to 4500 pounds. Double the bale weights will improve storage capacity.”

ABC Disposal Has a Storied History But Also Some Controversy Over the Past Few Years

ABC Disposal Inc. has been owned and operated by the Camara family since 1967. In addition to offering residential and commercial waste hauling services the company also has numerous municipal contracts including the one for the City of New Bedford.

In May of 2018 the City filed a lawsuit against ABC Disposal over the company’s increase in recycling fees claiming that it violated the 10-year fixed-price contract between the two parties that runs until 2023. ABC countersued and stated that the increase in fees was necessary due to China’s changes in its recycling policies and what materials it would allow to be imported for processing. The jury ruled in the City’s favor in September 2021.

The Town of Plymouth terminated its contract with ABC Disposal over those same increased recycling fees in May of 2018.

In May of 2019 Zero Waste Solutions LLC – another sister company of ABC Disposal – opened its 103000-square foot recycling facility in Rochester.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMidGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lndhc2hpbmd0b25wb3N0LmNvbS9oZWFsdGgvd2hhdC1pcy13aXNoY3ljbGluZy8yMDIyLzAxLzIxLzgyZmUwNDg2LTc5MmQtMTFlYy1iZjk3LTZlYWM2Zjc3ZmJhMl9zdG9yeS5odG1s0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Perspective | Do you wishcycle? If so you're actually not helping to recycle.,"Wishcycling is putting something in the recycling bin and hoping it will be recycled even if there is little evidence to confirm this assumption. Hope is central to wishcycling. People may not be sure the system works but they choose to believe that if they recycle an object it will become a new product rather than being buried in a landfill burned or dumped.

The U.S. recycling industry was launched in the 1970s in response to public concern over litter and waste. The growth of recycling and collection programs changed consumers’ view of waste: It didn’t seem entirely bad if it could lead to the creation of new products via recycling.

Pro-recycling messaging from governments corporations and environmentalists promoted and reinforced recycling behavior. This was especially true for plastics that had resin identification codes inside a triangle of “chasing arrows” indicating that the item was recyclable — even though that was usually far from the truth. Only resins #1 (polyethylene terephthalate or PET) and #2 (high-density polyethylene or HDPE) are relatively easy to recycle and have viable markets. The others are hard to recycle so some jurisdictions don’t even collect them.

Wishcycling entered public consciousness in 2018 when China launched Operation National Sword a sweeping set of restrictions on imports of most waste materials from abroad. Over the preceding 20 years China had bought millions of tons of scrap metal paper and plastic from wealthy nations for recycling giving those countries an easy and cheap option for managing waste materials.

The China scrap restrictions created enormous waste backups in the United States where governments had underinvested in recycling systems. Consumers saw that recycling was not as reliable or environmentally friendly as previously believed.

An unlikely coalition of actors in the recycling sector coined the term “wishcycling” in an effort to educate the public about effective recycling. As they emphasize wishcycling can be harmful.

Contaminating the waste stream with material that is not actually recyclable makes the sorting process more costly because it requires extra labor. Wishcycling also damages sorting systems and equipment and depresses an already fragile trading market.

Huge waste management companies and small cities and towns have launched educational campaigns on this issue. Their mantra is “When in doubt throw it out.” In other words place only material that truly can be recycled in your bin. This message is hard for many environmentalists to hear but it cuts costs for recyclers and local governments.

We also believe it’s important to understand that the global waste crisis wasn’t created by consumers who failed to wash mayonnaise jars or separate out plastic bags. The biggest drivers are global. They include capitalistic reliance on consumption strong international waste trade incentives a lack of standardized recycling policies and the devaluation of used resources. To make further progress governments and businesses will have to think more about designing products with disposal and reuse in mind reducing consumption of single-use products and making massive investments in recycling infrastructure.

Korea produces over 20000 tons of food waste per day yet there is no authority that keeps track of what the waste consists of or how much is composted. Some food goes straight from storage to trash.At one supermarket in Seodaemun District western Seoul staff repeatedly toss food into a container that dries and grinds the waste before sending it off into the sewage. The container with a 200 liter (44 gallon) capacity is almost always full. Vegetables and seafood left on the shelves at the end of the day all go to waste. No one at the supermarket knows how much food is being thrown away.“Plastic used to pack [food] is recycled but frankly speaking no one thinks much about cutting down on food waste” said a worker at the supermarket.While many environmental activists focus on other issues like zero carbon emission or minimizing the use of plastic cutting down on food waste is seldom mentioned even after the central government set up a series of measures for it in 2010. In 2013 jobs related to food waste disposal and management were assigned to each regional government and district but many didn’t keep an eye on the issue.The amount of food waste has continued to grow. According to a report by the National Assembly Research Service the amount of food waste in 2019 was 21065 tons up 31 percent from 16032 tons in 2013. This accounts to the average person in Korea throwing away 407 grams of food every day.Food waste at food manufacturing facilities continuously went up from 2016 — from 1010 tons a day in 2016 to 1452 tons a day in 2019. One-fourth of food thrown away in Korea was tossed into the trash without ever making it to the table.“Food companies are less interested in cutting down on food waste than individual consumers” said research fellow Ju Mun-sol of Korea Environment Institute who specializes in sustainable consumption waste management and material flow analysis and led the research for the National Assembly Research Service’s report on food loss. “Also it is very unclear whether the waste from each of these companies is properly processed.”The increasing amount of food waste heavily relates to the recent increase in meal kits available on the market and food delivery services.For instance a chunk of fish in a meal kit may be precut to make the fillet rectangular throwing away the cut edges even though they are edible.“A change in consumer behavior has caused demand for conveniently packed food processed food and food delivery to rise and has made an impact on producing more food waste” said Ju. “There is a higher chance of [Korea] seeing more of such food waste in the future.”The real problem lies in that because there is no record of how much food is being disposed of whether it is being properly disposed of or its composition no government official knows where to begin to cut down on food waste. While state-run institutes can analyze how much food waste comes out of individual homes as they collect them the statistics for food waste coming from private food companies which usually hire a separate entity to process their food waste are long lost.At a buffet-style restaurant in Gangnam District southern Seoul three bins for food waste each with 120 liters of capacity practically fill up by 5 p.m. with untouched food from dinner the day before and lunch that day. Employees don’t know how much food waste collects each day as a private company comes over to pick up whatever the staff put out.Eight other large restaurants in Gangnam District and Mapo District western Seoul also do something similar.“Since the companies that pick up food waste say they compost it we have not thought much about cutting down on the waste we make” said the owner of a grill restaurant in Mapo District.The JoongAng Ilbo an affiliate of the Korea JoongAng Daily checked with 11 food companies in Korea but none said they keep track of how much food waste they make nor do they have any plan to cut down.“There are many leftover foods that are still [edible] but we don’t know how to make better use of them” said an official at a local food company. “We do try to cut down on the amount of food waste but we don’t keep any records of what’s left over.”Although the country's current waste control act requires companies that dispose of a large amount of food to provide plans to cut down on their waste in reality the companies are considered to have done their job as long as they file a copy of a contract they made with a registered waste collector. An official at one district office in Seoul confirmed that the contracts do get checked but they don’t require companies to submit their plan to cut down on their food waste.An Environment Ministry official said “Although we need to know the amount of food waste that has actually been composted or processed [for food waste management] it’s not easy to keep track unless each business files a report on how it deals with its waste.”Some businesses have started to focus more on making the most out of what they would normally throw away. One local company gathers rice bran and soy pulp from other food businesses in an attempt to make something entirely different an official with the company said.“Korea in general does not get the concept of food upcycling” said Hong Su-yeol director of a center that studies the circulation of resources and its social and economic impacts. “Food waste isn’t just waste but food resources for the future.”Hong added that policies on how to better use leftover food should be set up and local businesses should abide by that rule. Currently there is no rule on what to do with these leftovers.Heo Seung an interest group manager from Green Korea agrees that the priority is encouraging local businesses to keep records of its food waste. Then the government can use the data to come up with a feasible plan to reduce the amount.The Environment Ministry has not announced any new policy again this year but it did set up a goal to produce more biogas using food waste.“The government has shown its will to make food waste another resource yet over the past 10 years it never sent out a signal that Korea needs to cut down on food waste” said research fellow Ju of the Korea Environment Institute adding that the country needs to take a more systemic approach to make changes.The institute’s executive Kim Mi-hwa suggests raising the fee for disposing of food waste or giving incentives to companies who successfully cut down on food waste to the level they target to achieve.BY JEONG JONG-HOON PYUN GWANG-HYUN AND CHANG YOON-SEO [kjdnational@joongang.co.kr]"

Large parts of the Trans-Australian Railway which connects the eastern states to Perth have been flooded by heavy rain waters in South Australia.

The Australian Rail Track Corporation said the damage is still being assessed and an estimated restoration date is not yet known.

“Due to a slow-moving rain event in South Australia parts of the ARTC network between Adelaide and Tarcoola were flooded and operations have ceased” a statement read.

“Services between Adelaide and Perth and Adelaide and Darwin have been impacted. An estimated time for return to service is yet to be determined.

“Repair works are underway.”

Over 400km of the 2688km long railway line have reportedly been damaged by the flood waters.

Several trains have also been reported stranded on the track unable to pass through the damaged areas.

In photos parts of the track can be seen washed away as murky flood water surrounds the line.

In another photo a long stretch of the train track can be seen submerged in water covering the railway sleepers.

WA has already been hit with freight delays sparked by supply chain issues which has been compounded by panic buying at supermarkets.

Delays can be expected while workers repair the track.

A spokesperson for Woolworths said deliveries to WA stores which are already struggling due to “COVID-absenteeism” have been delayed following the floods.

“While there is currently reduced availability of some items we continue to have key essentials available and our teams are working hard to increase stock levels as quickly as possible” they said.

“We know this is frustrating and thank our customers for their patience. Our thoughts are with all communities who have been affected by flooding in recent days.”

A spokesperson for Coles said some products in WA might be “temporarily unavailable.”

“Due to flooding in parts of regional South Australia our rail transport deliveries to WA have been interrupted. We are working hard to get products through the network.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMib2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5vcnRoYW50c2xpdmUubmV3cy9uZXdzL25vcnRoYW1wdG9uc2hpcmUtbmV3cy9ub3J0aGFtcHRvbnNoaXJlLWRhcmstd2F0ZXJzLWRpc2FzdGVyLWJyaXRpc2gtNjUxNTk3MNIBc2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5vcnRoYW50c2xpdmUubmV3cy9uZXdzL25vcnRoYW1wdG9uc2hpcmUtbmV3cy9ub3J0aGFtcHRvbnNoaXJlLWRhcmstd2F0ZXJzLWRpc2FzdGVyLWJyaXRpc2gtNjUxNTk3MC5hbXA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,The Northamptonshire Dark Waters disaster in 'British Erin Brockovich' fight for toxic truth,"The bravery of 18 families fighting for justice for their children all born with debilitating defects provides the heartbreaking storyline of one of Northamptonshire's most astonishing tales.

It is an incredible story of pain struggle and justice and has been dubbed the ""British Erin Brockovich"".

The 11-year legal battle involved the families of 18 children who were born with defects after the dismantling of the Corby steel works spread toxic waste across the Northants town.

Doctors said the number of defects seen in the town was 10 times higher than expected for a town of 60000 people during the 80s following the closure of the huge factory.

Corby Borough Council eventually lost a court battle and provided an undisclosed financial settlement with 19 families affected by the toxic dust and sludge.

Here is their story.

The background

The Corby steelworks dates back to the 1930s with the establishment of the Stewarts & Lloyds production site and by the 1960s the town had grown to become one of the most heavily industrialised areas in the Midlands.

However by 1981 however the plant had become unprofitable and owners British Steel Corporation closed the site which was at that point one of the largest steelmaking operations in Western Europe.

It was then Corby Borough Council took on the huge task of dismantling and demolishing the colossal factory which covered around 680 acres.

As part of this project the council ordered tonnes of waste to be transported through populated areas to a quarry north of the site utilising up to 200 vehicle movements daily.

The toxic waste was carried in open lorries which meant that sludge was spilled over the roads and huge amounts of dust was released into the air.

The effect

Around the same time doctors noticed a peculiar change in birthing patterns which caused widespread concern.

They found that the rates of upper-limb defects in babies born in Corby were found to be almost three times higher than those of children born in the surrounding area and ten times higher than a town with a population of 60000 should expect.

Another aspect that concerned doctors was that in most cases there were no previous family histories of limb defect..

The demolition of the factory and the regeneration of much of the area was completed in 1997 - 25 years ago this year.

However it wasn't until the early 2000s that families affected by the defects went to court.

The court case

In November 2005 expert evidence was submitted to the High Court in London by the mothers of thirty children who claimed that during their pregnancies they were exposed to contamination from the waste removal operations.

They sought to bring a legal action to try to prove a link between the mismanagement of the toxic waste and the birth defects suffered by their children.

After reviewing the evidence presented by all parties to the case an order approved by the then Lord Chief Justice Lord Phillips of Worth Matravers gave the parents permission to pursue the claim against Corby Borough Council as a class action involving children born between 1985 and 1999.

That case again came to court in 2009 with 18 young people alleging that toxic waste dumped by Corby Borough Council was the cause of their deformities

All had serious disabilities including missing or underdeveloped fingers and deformities of their feet.

The case finally reached the High Court on 16 February 2009 - the culmination of a ten-year legal process by the families hoping for justice for what had happened.

Evidence was put forward describing how between 1985 and 1997 there was a possibility that expectant mothers could have been affected by toxic waste which could either have travelled by air as a consequence of dust or could have been ingested after landing on vegetables or other items.

One expert even described the air around the town as an ""atmospheric soup of toxic materials"".

An internal report prepared by Corby Borough Council was also uncovered raising the prospect of residents being exposed to high levels of zinc arsenic boron and nickel as a result of the reclamation works.

A separate report from the council’s auditor complained of incompetence and negligence by the council and said there was a ""cavalier approach"" to the operation.

The outcome

In his ruling presiding judge Mr Justice Akenhead said it was clear that the council had permitted toxic waste to disperse into the atmosphere.

He said: ""There was an extended period between 1983 and August 1997 in which Corby Borough Council was extensively negligent in its control and management of the sites which they acquired from British Steel and otherwise used.""

Following the trial the families' lawyer Des Collins said: ""Prior to the trial the council maintained that a thorough investigation had led it to the conclusion that there was no link between the reclamation work and the children's birth defects.

""It also maintained that had any convincing evidence been shown that the children had good claims then the council would have wanted to compensate them appropriately without going to trial.

""Today that link has been established and the evidence provided. The children now call upon the council to fulfil their pre-trial promises without delay.""

In response Corby Borough Council's Chief Executive Chris Mallender said: ""We are obviously very disappointed and very surprised at the outcome of this trial.

(Image: 2009 Getty Images)

""Our position has always been that there was no link between the reclamation work that was carried out in Corby in past decades and these children's birth defects. That is still our position.""

The settlement

On April 16 2010 the council released a joint statement with the families' solicitors announcing it had agreed a financial settlement and was dropping an appeal it had previously launched.

The financial terms of the settlement remained confidential and the agreement forbids disclosure of the financial arrangements.

It also included three children not covered by the original ruling.

WFC,Wells Fargo,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMicWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWNyaW1zb24uY29tL2FydGljbGUvMjAyMi8xLzIzLzg5Mi1zdW5kYW5jZS0yMDIyLXJldmlldy1qb2huLWJveWVnYS1hYmktZGFtYXJpcy1icmlhbi1icm93bi1lYXNsZXkv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,From Sundance: “892” Is Brilliant and Unflinching | Arts,"Much of the plot of “892” unfolds in a series of phone calls. Honorably discharged former U.S. Marine Brian Brown-Easley (John Boyega in a tour de force performance) has walked into an Atlanta-area Wells Fargo claiming he has a bomb in his backpack. In one of the film’s most taut phone exchanges Brian is demanding that he speak to a hostage negotiator. On the other end of the line they tell him to hold on. “I’ve been holding on” he says frustration bubbling out of his polite demeanor. “I’ve held on.”

“892” portrays Brian Brown-Easley as a man who held on until he felt he had no other option. The film is a tense devastating retelling of the real-life Brown-Easley’s fatal final day in 2017 when he barricaded himself and two hostages in the bank — not to rob it but to draw attention to the $892.34 disability check that the Department of Veterans Affairs had unjustly withheld from him. In the steady hands of first-time feature director Abi Damaris Corbin and writers Corbin and Kwame Kwei-Armah “892” shines a compassionate light on Brown-Easley bringing the almost Shakespearean tragedy to life onscreen with quietly effective acting and tremendous camera work.

The movie begins with Brian the night before he has resolved to hold up the bank. His anguish is already apparent as he runs out of phone credit to keep talking to his young daughter Kiah (an adorable London Covington) and makes preparations in the run-down Travel Inn where he is living. Once in the bank the mild-mannered Brian continually apologizes to his hostages his escalating panic beating through his grey sweatshirt. Boyega keeps Brian’s pain at the forefront even as law enforcement the press and the public slowly gather outside the bank and his anxiety hardens at points into quiet resolve.

While Boyega carries much of the film’s immense emotional weight in his clenched shoulders and close-up expressive face alone he is buoyed at every turn by outstanding supporting performances. Connie Britton makes a somewhat surprising cameo as an empathetic local news producer whom Brian calls and speaks with at length about his story. And as the two bank employees who remain trapped with Brian until the end Selenis Leyva and Nicole Beharie hit pitch-perfect notes of fear tinged with compassion for Brian as they watch him unravel and begin to understand his demands.

The scenes inside the bank have a theatrical quality — a three-person play comes to mind as the camera tracks Brian Rosa Diaz (Leyva) and Estel Valerie (Beharie)’s movements around the bank and each other often capturing the women’s watchful gaze in the background while Brian is on the phone with his family or the hostage negotiator. From the moment bank manager Estel realizes what Brian is about to do and begins ushering the rest of the bank’s customers out the door Beharie in particular is hard to look away from.

“892” also holds the poignant honor of featuring the late great Michael K. Williams’ final screen performance as chief hostage negotiator Sargeant Eli Bernard who bonds with Brown over their shared Marine background and connects with Brian’s ex-wife Cassandra (Olivia Washington) over FaceTime to update her on the situation. Williams brings gravitas and urgency to the scenes outside the bank and his subtly devastating performance prevents the film’s third act from losing steam.

“892” could be marketed as a thriller. But despite the film’s taut editing and unrelentingly intense tone there is very little suspense. Brian makes it clear from the outset that he does not expect to live through the day and he seems to have no intention of actually harming his hostages. As such the genre beats of the heist/hostage negotiation play out with more emotional tension than anything else unfolding like a prolonged telegraphed denouement of Brown-Easley’s life and the unjust hand he was dealt.

While the filmmakers take care to mention that Brown-Easley did indeed struggle with mental illness — on the phone Cassandra asks if he has taken his meds — it staunchly refuses to suggest that his actions were the result of his neurodivergence rather than a justified response to unjust circumstances.

Indeed the film takes direct aim at the bureaucratic wrongdoings of the Veteran Affairs Department which withheld the real Brown-Easley’s disability check for $892.34 on erroneous grounds. But the simmering indictment of “892” goes beyond one federal agency painting a portrait of a society whose failure to do right by those who fought for it is a symptom of its structurally racist unfeeling systems rather than an isolated problem.

At one point in the film Brian remarks that a man who previously tried to rob the same Wells Fargo branch and was arrested not killed must have been white; Estel and Rosa say nothing in tacit agreement. Outside the bank Williams conveys Sargeant Bernard’s indignance at the moments of disrespect toward him by white fellow officers despite his position of authority. And flashbacks show a VA employee (Miriam Silverman) tentatively offering Brian a callous pamphlet on “Homelessness and You” when he expresses that he will lose his housing without his disability check and then Brian’s violent arrest in the waiting room when he refuses to leave.

Film adaptations of tragic true stories can run the risk of heavy-handedness or oversentimentality. But ultimately “892” is unsparing and sincere — and like Brian’s story itself worthy of a wide audience.

That’s been true both for marquee acts like The Weeknd and Elvis Costello who have already released full-length albums this month as well as for a wide range of artists who have put out new songs teasing upcoming projects and tours.

Though the live music industry is again fraught with COVID-19 uncertainty due to the omicron variant with many tours being postponed others like Kacey Musgraves who plays the Wells Fargo Center on Wednesday and The War on Drugs who are at the Met Philly Thursday and Friday are carrying on.

It’s time then for digging into new music while looking ahead in hopes that the current COVID surge will soon peak and subside and fans can get back to relatively anxiety-free communal listening. Here are a whole lot of new sounds to get through these chilly weeks of winter.

Elvis Costello & the Imposters The Boy Named If. Any time an artist with such a significant oeuvre — this is the British songwriter’s 32nd album — puts out new music this good the temptation is to call it his best album since … when? 1978′s This Year’s Model? 1986′s Blood & Chocolate?

Instead let’s just say that Costello has been on a creative roll of late starting in 2018 with Look Now and continuing in 2020 with Hey Clockface and that The Boy Named If is clearly the best of the bunch.

The Boy Named If is a 13-track collection of thematically linked songs that hit hard from the opening thwack of Pete Thomas’ drums on “Farewell OK.” The album’s full title is A Boy Named If (And Other Children’s Tales) and Costello has explained in the album notes that “If” is the nickname a child gives to an imaginary friend “your secret self … the one you blame for the shattered crockery and the hearts you break even your own.”

Never fear though. You don’t need to follow the story to enjoy the songs which are uniformly strong as is Costello’s singing on the self-doubting “What If I Can’t Give You Anything but Love” and the particularly fetching “Paint the Red Rose Blue.”

The Weeknd Dawn FM. Last winter when The Weeknd announced his After Hours tour which was scheduled to play the Wells Fargo Center this coming April the jaunt named after the Canadian singer’s 2020 album was supposed to be a post-COVID arena tour pop celebration.

In the fall the Canadian singer born Abel Tesfaye canceled those dates and announced they would be rescheduled as (still-unannounced) stadium shows. The Weeknd’s rise to world-conquering Starboy (to cite his 2016 album title) was so complete it seemed that only stadiums would do. But that the shows remained unscheduled seemed a depressing reminder that the pandemic wasn’t going away.

The surprise release of Dawn FM this month put all that into perspective. It turned out that it didn’t make sense for The Weeknd to go on tour for a project from 2020 when he was sitting on a new album that’s the most impressive of his career.

Dawn FM is compelling in many intriguing ways starting with the album cover a digitally aged photo of the 31-year-old singer with a salt-and-pepper beard.

The album contains a spoken-word interlude from Quincy Jones recalling his mother who was diagnosed with schizophrenia being taken away to a mental hospital when Jones was 8. The super producer’s presence underscores a link between Tesfaye and Michael Jackson.

And along with ubiquitous collaborators like Calvin Harris and Max Martin the album’s “Here We Go … Again” which features Tyler the Creator is cowritten with Bruce Johnston the 79-year-old member of the Beach Boys.

Dawn FM which has topped the Billboard album chart since its release is also a concept album. It’s structured as a long listen to a mythical R&B radio station (hosted by Jim Carrey who provides intermittent voice-overs) with the singer-driver stuck in traffic on the way to his presumed death.

But like The Boy Named If Dawn FM carries its narrative loosely. The album works as a collection of melodic freestanding songs that reach back to 1970s disco and 1980s R&B shot through with the just the right measure of 2020s paranoia.

Along with Costello and The Weeknd the new year has also seen the release of a handful of other worthy full-length efforts.

Chan Marshall the sultry voiced singer who records as Cat Power released Covers with interpretations of Frank Ocean Iggy Pop the Pogues and Jackson Browne. Her January date at the TLA has been rescheduled for April 17.

Odd Future rapper Earl Sweatshirt has released Sick! a 24-minute mini-album that is a return to form expertly internalizing pandemic anxieties. And John Mellencamp’s Strictly a One-Eyed Jack is the Indiana rocker’s first album in five years. It’s notable for its solid selection of spare unsentimental mortality-facing songs three of which feature Bruce Springsteen with the frisky standout being “Did You Say Such a Thing.”

Here’s a look at highly anticipated projects due in the coming weeks:

Mitski Laurel Hell. The sixth album by indie-rock singer Mitski Miyawaki is the follow-up to her acclaimed 2018 Be the Cowboy. Mitski has released four songs from the album so far all of which draw power from her trademark mix of emotional tension and tactical reserve. The latest of which is “Love Me More” which she has said was influenced by hearing Mike Oldfield’s “Tubular Bells” in the 1973 horror movie The Exorcist. Laurel Hell is out Feb. 4 and Mitski plays the Franklin Music Hall on March 25.

Shamir Heterosexuality. The Philly indie artist’s new album is being billed as “the first to confront his queerness explicitly.” The songwriter’s pop-savvy skills are clearly apparent on his new single “Reproductive” which follows previously released songs “Cisgender” and “Gay Agenda.” Shamir opens for Courtney Barnett on Feb. 4 at the Met Philly and Heterosexuality is out Feb. 11 on his AntiFragile label.

The Delines The Sea Drift. Fans of literary-quality short-story-like songwriting and divinely understated soul singing can rejoice: There’s a new Delines album coming your way. The Sea Drift is the follow-up to 2019′s superb The Imperial. The Portland Ore. band features the songwriting of novelist and former Richmond Fontaine leader Willy Vlautin and the subtle vocals of Amy Boone. Due out Feb. 11.

Spoon Lucifer on the Sofa. Has there been a more consistent never-faltering band working in any genre over the last 20 years than Spoon? The Britt-Daniel-led Austin Texas quartet have shared two typically economical and enticing new songs in “Wild” and “The Hardest Cut.” Lucifer on the Sofa is out Feb. 11 and Spoon play the Fillmore Philly on April 15.

Robert Glasper Black Radio III. Genre-splicing jazz-R&B-hip-hop pianist and composer Robert Glasper is set to release the third part of the trilogy which began with 2011′s Black Radio which won a best R&B Grammy the following year. For the new single “Black Superhero” Glasper assembled an all-star cast to perform with The Roots on The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon including Rapsody BJ the Chicago Kid Philly’s own DJ Jazzy Jeff and poet Amir Sulaiman. Black Radio III is out Feb. 25.

Soul Glo Diaspora Problems. The West Philadelphia band Soul Glo has signed to storied Southern California punk label Epitaph Records. The “revolutionary hardcore” quartet of singer Pierce Jordan guitarist Ruben Polo bass player G.G. Guerra and drummer T.J. Stevenson has provided a first taste of the album with the raging “Jump!!

The 33-year-old father suffered from PTSD and was frustrated that his disability checks — totaling $892 — were being withheld by the Department of Veterans Affairs.

The movie had its Sundance Film Festival premiere on Jan. 21 with The Hollywood Reporter review praising lead actor John Boyega‘s “ability to reflect with poise and command the competing often incongruent layers of a man most of us will never know.”

Boyega joined the project after Jonathan Majors who was originally cast to play Easley had to drop out due to scheduling conflicts. “I was pretty much relaxing after spending time with family and then I got a call from my agent about this project” remembers the actor. (Prior to this Boyega had abruptly exited the filming of Netflix feature Rebel Ridge.) 892 was co-written by Young Vic artistic director Kwame Kwei-Armah who cast Boyega in his first acting job in the 2009 play Seize the Day years before he landed the role that would make him a household name in the Star Wars galaxy. “He put this story in front of me years ago but scheduling didn’t allow us to do it. So it came full circle” explains Boyega.

Abi Damaris Corbin a Boston native whose own father was a U.S. military veteran having fought in Vietnam with the Navy was making her feature debut on the project. Boyega and Corbin begin rehearsals almost immediately over Zoom with only a handful of weeks prior to 892’s Los Angeles production start date. “It was definitely a 180” remembers Boyega. “Especially at the time I didn’t have the intention of working so soon.”

An abandoned bank in L.A.’s San Fernando Valley stood in for the Wells Fargo where much of the film takes place. “It was like a stage play” says Corbin of the production. “It was nonstop.” Much of 892 which also stars Connie Britton Selenis Leyva and Nicole Beharie sees Boyega acting opposite a phone as Easley makes calls to his ex-wife his daughter a local television news producer and a hostage negotiator.

The negotiator is played posthumously by late actor Michael K. Williams. (Williams passed away in September at 54.) Corbin highlights Williams’ dedication to the story remembering the filming of a scene that was proving particularly difficult to land. “We were at like take 18. And I’m like ‘Mike we got the pieces. We’re good.’ He’s like ‘Abi let me go one more'” says the director. “We knew between the two of us that this was something that we couldn’t punt.”

That commitment to telling Easley’s story was a driving force for those working on the indie production says Corbin. Boyega would come to set on his days off to do line readings for the actors who were meant to be talking to Easley on the phone. “He was in the car in 106-degree weather on the phone for every actor or hiding in a corner because there was no place else to fit” she says.

“I like to say there are some roles where you can use elements of yourself to help prompt your knowledge of the role and then there are some roles that you just did not go through and you have gotta act” says Boyega. Playing Easley was the latter for the star who did have to take a forced break from the character after he tested positive for COVID-19 during the shoot. “I had like a few weeks off to recover and then came back and finished it off” he recalls. “That really worried me because we’re in a streak like getting into the meat of it. And then it happened and I was like ‘Damn I’m gonna lose the flow.'”

Before scripting Corbin and Kwei-Armah reached out to Easley’s wife Jessica and daughter for their blessing in making the movie but also to learn more about the man who would be at its center. Boyega met with the family over Zoom after they had watched the film where he says they voiced their support of his performance. The actor notes “When you go and do the work and you circle back it’s always in hopes that they appreciate and support what you are doing.”

While 892 is based on a 2018 Longreads article little is available about Easley outside of contemporaneous news reports. The team behind 892 hopes that this will change with their movie which is a part of the fest’s U.S. Dramatic Competition lineup and is seeking distribution. Says Boyega “This is Bryan’s legacy here and now. This is part of the same spark that made him go is that back; this movie is created from that same spark.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnN0YXRlcHJlc3MuY29tL2FydGljbGUvMjAyMi8wMS9pa2UtZGlvZ3UtbGVmdC1hc3UtMTcteWVhcnMtYWdvLWJ1dC1oaXMtbGVnYWN5LXdpbGwtcmVtYWluLWZvcmV2ZXLSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Ike Diogu left ASU 17 years ago but his legacy will remain forever - The Arizona State Press,"After three years with Sun Devil Hoops from 2003-05 ASU legend Ike Diogu was sick to his stomach the day he took the next step to get to the NBA. ASU had been his home and he didn't want to leave.

Since that day in 2005 Diogu has played nine seasons in the NBA with six different teams competed in the 2012 and 2016 Summer Olympics with the Nigeria national basketball team and spent the last 10 years playing with numerous overseas teams most recently signing with Zamalek SC of the Egyptian Basketball Super League on Jan. 16.

Diogu has enjoyed a long fulfilling career of basketball across the world — but it all started when former ASU head coach Rob Evans gave him a chance.

ASU was the first big-time school to offer Diogu a scholarship while he was barely going into his junior year of high school.

""At the time the head coach was coach Rob Evans and he just really saw something in me that nobody else saw"" Diogu said. ""At the time he offered me a scholarship going into my junior year in high school and if I go back and look at my stats and look at how I was I don't know how he offered me a scholarship at that point but for some reason coach Evans saw something in me.""

It was an easy decision for Evans once he and former ASU assistant head coach Tony Benford went out to see him play in Dallas where he played on the same Amateur Athletic Union team as former NBA all-stars Chris Bosh and Deron Williams.

""He (Benford) said 'Coach I really like this kid Diogu' and so I said 'Let's fly in and take a look at him and watch him work out'"" Evans said. ""So we went in there and watched the AAU team work out and I told him I said 'Man I think he's the best one of them.""

Diogu would go on to win Pac-10 Freshman Player of the Year in 2003 then ending his ASU career as Pac-10 Player of the Year in 2005. Throughout his college career Diogu averaged an outstanding 21.4 points and 8.8 rebounds per game.

""The thing I always tell people is I came in with no expectations. I didn't expect to me a one-and-done guy or anything like that"" Diogu said. ""I really just wanted to come in and have a good career and whatever happens happens. So that's kind of the mindset that I took and luckily I was able to have a couple of good seasons and the rest is history.""

Diogu was traded a few times throughout his career in the NBA and in 2012 he got the option to either sign a 10-day contract with the NBA or move to play overseas in China. Evans told him he no longer has anything to prove in the NBA.

""China is a very interesting place it's a nice place. It's very different. Coming from the NBA you realize that no league is quite like the NBA"" Diogu said. ""There's no equipment room. Normally if you need something you go to an equipment room and the equipment manager gives you want you need. That's all out the window once you start playing overseas. You are literally going back to square one.""

Diogu now 38 realizes his playing days will be done sooner rather than later and once he is done he plans on turning his attention to the Nigerian National Team. Specifically he wants to help build up the youth program with the national teams.

""I think it's something I've always wanted to do just because I know the large talent pool that Nigeria has"" Diogu said. ""I kind of think with my expertise and the amount of popularity that I have over there I'll be able to do some really good and positive things for the youth.""

Kyle Dodd an ASU basketball announcer and former teammate of Diogu was a senior when Diogu was a freshman at ASU. To this day what stands out to Dodd is the type of person Diogu was then versus who he is now.

""I tell people all the time as good as he's been on the floor and his career he is that good of a person off the floor"" Dodd said. ""Nothing but good things to say about Ike and he's honestly one of the better human beings I know.""

Evans shared a story about when he was talking to NBA teams about Diogu before he was drafted telling them the person they see then would be the same person they see 10 years later.

""They said 'no money changes these guys.' I said money won't change Ike"" Evans said. ""That's just who he is. That's the way he has been raised.""

Diogu's jersey was raised to the rafters on Jan. 15 when ASU played University of Colorado cementing ASU as his home and legacy forever.

That means drug companies will need to focus less on the selling and more on the science. And they’ll need real-world data to prove their drugs work as well in the “messy setting of everyday life” as they do in the clinic a new Accenture survey of 120 oncologists in the U.S. and Germany suggests.

“The clinical trials that are the basis for your promotional materials—those are just your ticket to play” said André Dahinden a managing director of global precision oncology in Accenture’s Life Sciences division. Oncologists are asking “What do these medicines really do in reality?”

RELATED: Don't spam us healthcare professionals plea as they seek quality over quantity from pharma marketers

The report found 65% of oncologists want pharma reps to be able to discuss real-world data with them; more than half (51%) said they “will need more discussion” on real-world data from reps in the future.

The report also suggests machine-assisted decision-making where technology is employed to match patients with suitable treatments will increasingly trump sales reps when it comes to doctors' cancer drug decisions.

When asked what will shape treatment decisions 10 years from now 66% of oncologists picked “technology-driven recommendations based on data” more than scientific societies (57%) discussions with peers and key opinion leaders (26%) and interactions with sales reps (23%).

“I think that’s very remarkable and has very big implications for pharmaceutical companies” said Dahinden.

When it comes to how oncologists want to get their information 90% chose either face-to-face or virtual meetings with pharma—with the preferred format depending on the reason for the meeting. And unless they're discussing a specific patient they overwhelmingly prefer to meet in groups.

Smartphone- or tablet-based apps also ranked highly with 88% of oncologists preferring those channels while the least-preferred channels were websites (56%) print (35%) and out-of-office meetings like medical congresses (27%).

Based on the survey the report suggests pharma companies should think about adding science-savvy employees to their customer-facing teams as well as creating a network of experts and peers with varying levels of expertise that doctors can tap for information.

With the number of cancer drugs and drug combinations growing exponentially it’s less likely a single sales rep can answer all of a doctor’s questions said Dahinden. The need for more scientific guidance is especially true for community practice oncologists who are working outside the realm of specialized cancer centers he added.

Dahinden calls it “ecosystem solutioning"" versus a marketed-oriented approach where the best-promoted brand wins.

“You’re enabling [doctors] to apply precision oncology rather than just pushing medicines promotionally.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxlZ2FjeS5jb20vdXMvb2JpdHVhcmllcy9uZXdzb2JzZXJ2ZXIvbmFtZS9jaGFybGVzLW1lZXNlLW9iaXR1YXJ5P2lkPTMyNjAxOTA20gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Charles Meese Obituary (1941 - 2022) - Raleigh NC - The News & Observer,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.legacy.com/us/obituaries/newsobserver/name/charles-meese-obituary?id=32601906 on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxlZ2FjeS5jb20vdXMvb2JpdHVhcmllcy9uZXdzb2JzZXJ2ZXIvbmFtZS9jaGFybGVzLW1lZXNlLW9iaXR1YXJ5P2lkPTMyNjAxOTA20gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMidWh0dHBzOi8vbWVkaWNhbGRpYWxvZ3Vlcy5pbi9uZXdzL2luZHVzdHJ5L3BoYXJtYS8zMy1kcnVnLXNhbXBsZXMtZmFpbC10by1jbGVhci1jZHNjby10ZXN0LTItZGVjbGFyZWQtbWlzYnJhbmRlZC04NzUzNNIBeWh0dHBzOi8vbWVkaWNhbGRpYWxvZ3Vlcy5pbi9hbXAvbmV3cy9pbmR1c3RyeS9waGFybWEvMzMtZHJ1Zy1zYW1wbGVzLWZhaWwtdG8tY2xlYXItY2RzY28tdGVzdC0yLWRlY2xhcmVkLW1pc2JyYW5kZWQtODc1MzQ?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,33 drug samples fail to clear CDSCO test 2 declared misbranded,"New Delhi: In its latest drug safety alert the apex drug regulatory body the Central Drugs Standard Control Organization (CDSCO) flagged 33 medicine batches for failing to qualify for a random drug sample test for the month of December while two drug samples have been declared misbranded.

You may have spent a lot of time and money researching the various GPUs CPUs RAM and RGB-enabled cooling fans so don’t skimp when it comes to your storage and potentially create a bottleneck in your system every time it tries to read or write to your drive.

Having the best SSD for gaming will affect your experience as much as the best graphics card since it’s responsible for loading and unloading your data and could mean the difference between waiting a few seconds or waiting a few minutes to load your data. Fortunately investing in a great storage drive is not going to break the bank. You’ll be able to find plenty with a decent amount of storage space for a reasonable price. In short it’s an easy inexpensive upgrade so you should get the best one you can get your hands on.

One drawback though – you’re limited by what your motherboard is compatible with. M.2 SSDs would be the immediate recommendation particularly for data access-intensive tasks like video editing since they can plug right into the motherboard.

With that said though SATA SSDs are a bit outmoded in this day and age plenty of users just don’t have newer M.2 compatible motherboards. Considering how long SATA SSDs have been around with the best hard drives being around even longer even the least expensive ones have pushed their data transfer capacity as far as they can go. That means that even if you have to go with a SATA option instead of a M.2 SSD the best gaming SSDs are going to give great performance for the price.

Regardless of whether you’re rocking one of the best motherboards around with loads of M.2 connections or are using a SATA connection do yourself and that best gaming PC you’ve invested so much in and buy the best gaming SSD that you can for your budget and configuration.

If you're looking for great value when building a new gaming rig then the Adata XPG SX8200 Pro SSD is one of the best gaming SSDs you're going to find.

It has respectably-high sequential read and write speeds that hold their own against the WD Black SN750 and Samsung 970 EVO Plus. It also has outstanding durability with an MTBF rating of 2000000 hours and a TBW score of up to 1280 at 2TB - the highest of the PCIe 3.0 M.2s on the list - and 160 at 256GB. It also has a 5-year warranty so no matter the capacity you buy it will keep hustling along even if it's a tad bit slower than the rest.

Where it does fall short compared to the SN750 and the 970 EVO Plus - by a good bit in fact - is its random access speeds which are a little under half as fast though the XPG SX8200 Pro is still more than fast enough for all but the most meticulous BIS builders out there.

It's also crazy affordable as you move up to larger capacities beating out the SN750 by about $100/£80/AU$140 and the 970 EVO Plus by about $160/£130/AU$240 at the 2TB capacity - great if you have a large game library and you want to move everything over to an NVMe SSD.

If you're looking for the best gaming SSD for your set up you're going to want to take a look at the WD Black SN750 NVMe SSD. It has excellent performance overall with fast sequential read and write speeds though not the fastest and it has significantly higher random access speeds than the XPG SX 8200. It falls short of the 970 EVO Plus's random access speeds but not by much.

As for durability it has an MTBF of 1750000 hours a TBW of 1200 at 2TB and a 5-year warranty so you can expect to get a lot of useful life out of this SSD. If you can spend a little more money you can get a model with a built-in heatsink for some extra heat management that should help extend that useful life even more. Unfortunately if you want one with a heatsink that option is only available on models with a capacity of 500GB and over.

The WD Black SN750 NVMe SSD also has a great capacity-to-price ratio lagging behind only the XPG at higher capacities and matching its price at 1TB if you don't go with the heatsink option. It comes in a little bit less than the Samsung 970 EVO Plus at every capacity with or without the heatsink so the WD Black SN750 is a perfect compromise between the speed of the 970 EVO Plus and the durability of the XPG SX8200.

3. Samsung 970 EVO Plus Fastest performance of the PCIe 3.0 M.2s Our expert review: Specifications Capacity: 250GB to 2TB Memory type: 3D MLC NAND Interface: M.2 PCIe 3.0 x4 Max seq. read speed: Up to 3500MB/s Max seq. write speed: Up to 3300MB/s Heatsink: No Mean time between failures: 1500000 hours Terabytes written (250GB/2TB): 150/1200 Today's Best Deals View at Amazon (1TB) View at Dell (1TB) View at Best Buy (Black) Reasons to buy + Fastest speeds for a PCIe 3.0 M.2 on the list + In-house memory and controller hardware Reasons to avoid - Bit more expensive than competition - Lowest durability for a PCIe 3.0 M.2 on the list

The Samsung 970 EVO Plus has some of the fastest sequential read and write speeds of any PCIe 3.0 M.2 SSD out there making it an obvious contender for the best gaming SDD among the M.2s. Its random access speeds are also the fastest of the PCIe 3.0s on the list making it easily the winner of the PCIe 3.0 bracket in terms of raw power.

The downside is its durability. While not made of glass by any means the 970 EVO Plus has the lowest durability as measured by MTBF rating only 1500000 hours which puts it behind both the XPG SX8200 and the WD Black SN750 by 25% and 12.5% respectively. Its TBW rating at 2TB is 1200 matching the SN750 but at 256GB it scores a rather low 150 the lowest of the three PCIe 3.0 M.2s on the list. It does come with a 5-year warranty though so it's on par with its competition as far as that goes.

It doesn't come with an option for a built-in heat sink so any heat it generates will have to be bled off using your case's fans or other cooling solutions. It does have something called Dynamic Thermal Guard technology to help regulate the SSD's core temperature though as well as a hardware heat spreader and a nickel-coated controller to mitigate heat build-up. While not quite a heatsink it's not nothing.

Of all the M.2 SSD's on this list the Samsung EVO Plus is the most expensive in some cases (like the XPG SX8200) by a good margin. If you have the money to spend you want the fastest SSD your money can buy and you don't have a PCIe 4.0-compatible motherboard then the Samsung EVO Plus is very likely the SSD for you.

4. Corsair Force MP600 Best gaming SSD for speed and durability - if it fits your board Average Amazon review: ☆ ☆ ☆ ☆ ☆ Specifications Capacity: 500GB to 2TB Memory type: 3D TLC NAND Interface: M.2 PCIe 4.0 x4 Max seq. read speed: Up to 4950MB/s Max seq. write speed: Up to 4250MB/s Heatsink: Yes Mean time between failures (500GB/2TB): 1700000 hours Terabytes written (500GB/2TB): 850/3600 Today's Best Deals View at CORSAIR (1TB) View at Newegg View at Amazon (1TB) Reasons to buy + Blazing fast read/write speeds + Aluminum heatsink comes standard + Durability is out of this world Reasons to avoid - Needs a PCIe 4.0-compatible motherboard

The Corsair Force MP600 is far and away the fastest gaming SSD on this list. Add to that its durability lapping the other M.2 SSDs listed above several times over and an aluminum heatsink as a standard feature all things being equal there shouldn't be a contest as to which was the best gaming SSD on this list. But there's a mighty big caveat to the Corsair Force MP600's dominance.

When some consumers don't even have an M.2 slot on their motherboard even fewer have PCIe 4.0-capable motherboard at the moment so the number of people who can actually use this SSD is still rather smaller.

The SSD's performance is also due entirely to its PCIe 4.0 interface (which has roughly double the data bandwidth of the PCIe 3.0) and the Corsair Force MP600 doesn't actually come close to utilizing the full potential of the PCIe 4.0 standard. Manufacturers are starting to roll out their new PCIe 4.0 M.2 SSDs soon enough and many of the big names like Samsung and Western Digital are going to push PCIe 4.0 much further than the Corsair Force MP600 does at the moment.

But ""a better component is coming out soon"" is hardly the kind of thing to stop a determined builder so if you do have a compatible motherboard and you don't want to wait for SSDs to be released that fully harness PCIe 4.0's potential then the Corsair Force MP600 is definitely the SSD you want right now.

When it comes to a SATA III SSD the best you're going to find in terms of raw performance is the Samsung 860 Pro. With sequential read and write speeds at the very limit of what SATA III can handle you can definitely expect this SSD to handle whatever data access task you throw at it as fast as possible.

Where it really shines however is its random access speeds and capacity. Other SATA III SSDs can read and write sequentially at the same speeds as the 860 Pro but the 860 Pro edges out just about everyone else when it comes to random read and write speeds which make up the majority of data access operations you're likely going to perform.

And while the 860 Pro has among the lowest MTBF ratings of the SSDs on this list the 860 Pro's TBW ratings are phenomenal with its 4TB SSD scoring the highest of all with 4800. Add a 5-year warranty on top of all that and you have a SATA III SSD that will last you at least long enough until you finally break down and make the jump to an M.2 SSD.

Expect to pay for that durability however. The 860 Pro costs nearly twice the dollars-per-GB as you would for the competition with the maximum capacity 4TB SSD costing almost $1000/£800/AU$1500 about $460/£375/AU$675 more than a comparable WD Blue 3D NAND SSD.

6. WD Blue 3D NAND SATA III Fantastic size-to-price ratio for gigantic game libraries Average Amazon review: ☆ ☆ ☆ ☆ ☆ Specifications Capacity: 250GB to 4TB Memory type: 3D TLC NAND Interface: SATA III Max seq. read speed: Up to 560MB/s Max seq. write speed: Up to 530MB/s Mean time between failures: 1750000 hours Terabytes written (250GB/2TB/4TB): 100/500/600 Today's Best Deals View at Amazon (1TB) View at Newegg (Blue) View at Walmart (1TB) Reasons to buy + Up to 4TB capacity + Great price-to-capacity ratio Reasons to avoid - Random access speeds fall short of 860 Pro - Lowest TBW rating of all SSDs on the list

One of the major advantages of a SATA III SSD over the M.2 is its potential capacity. While most M.2s top out at 2TB the WD Blue 3D NAND SSD maxes out at 4TB matching the Samsung 860 Pro as the highest capacity SSD on the list.

Where it does better than the rest is its capacity-to-price ratio especially when compared to a comparably-sized 860 Pro. In terms of cost-per-TB the WD Blue 3D NAND comes in about $90/£72/AU$132 less than the Samsung 860 Pro.

If you have a massive game library that can't all fit on an M.2 or if an M.2 isn't an option for your motherboard then the WD Blue 3D NAND might be the best gaming SSD if you really need a large capacity drive but can't afford a higher capacity Samsung 860 Pro.

However the WD Blue 3D NAND does have a major drawback. While its sequential read and write speeds are comparable to Samsung's 860 Pro the WD Blue falls behind the random read and write speeds by a noticeable margin.

“Well can we go on the iPad then?” is the next request. Then when they’re informed that no we didn’t bring it comes “Can I go on your phone?” There is a look of confused disbelief on my children’s faces when I explain that there’s no internet no computer not even a phone signal and that in fact we’re not going to be looking at screens of any sort for our entire week-long stay.

They are young enough to not immediately kick off and storm out but I imagine the scene would be rather different if they were teenagers.

Doing a digital detox wasn’t my main motivation for escaping to this remote hideaway – the thrilling scenery and sense of isolation are the big draws – but the lack of wifi is a huge bonus. Though my children are only six and eight their predilection for screen-based entertainment is increasingly tiresome. They may not yet have their own mobiles or tablets but the shows they like are streamed online they long for free rein on YouTube are desperate to join in the school craze for FitBits and adore “doing funny faces” – creating long strings of emojis on my phone to text to their friends (or rather their friends’ parents who are bombarded with messages of 200 watermelons). Most of their homework is done online. The digital world encroaches. Putting a complete non-debatable stop to it for a while feels essential.

I’m not alone in craving this. January’s flood of wellbeing-related travel publicity contains more mentions of digital detoxes than ever with tour operators such as G Adventures predicting it as a huge trend exacerbated by lockdowns. All that Zooming digital home-schooling and Netflix-bingeing made it seem like every aspect of our existence was lived online. Many of us feel screen-sick desperate to disconnect.

My family’s antidote in recent years has been to escape to various off-grid Cumbrian cottages: this is our second stay at National Trust-owned Bird How which is on a quiet lane that ends at the next farm. It is basic. The mattresses are hellish – a detail much lamented in the visitors’ books – and there’s no bathroom only a sani loo in a cobwebby space beneath the cottage accessed from the outside (no fun at 3am in torrential rain) and a shower bag that you fill from the kitchen tap (there is hot water and electricity) and hook up outside in view of the occasional rambler.

All of this creates a sense of adventure of course and with no other building in sight it feels like you have this phenomenal valley to yourself.

After their initial shock the kids get by without watching Avatar: The Last Airbender with surprising ease. We hang out in the wild garden through which a small stream trickles with novels and colouring books and eat on a picnic bench under the tree. We go hiking and my daughter embraces wild swimming throwing herself into freezing Eskdale pools secret canyons in neighbouring Duddon valley and any filthy-looking moorland pond.

At night we watch for bats and the bright headlamps of drivers tackling the terrifying Hardknott Pass above: they sometimes bob slowly down in reverse when they lose their nerve.

As the week goes on complaints about the lack of screens are more easily quashed by the suggestion of a game of Uno or a walk to the Brook House Inn for ice-cream.

The surrounding fields come into their own for imaginary play even if it is TV-inspired – I spend a huge amount of time pretending to be wildlife presenter Steve Backshall chasing rare animals – but at least we’re tearing down grassy slopes and scrambling along streams in the process.

My partner and I take turns to go out running and on one of mine up a bracken-choked path on the valley’s opposite flank I call across to the others barely visible at the cottage. I’m overjoyed to catch their hoots of response on the wind so take off my jumper and wave it madly like a flag rewarded by the blur of red cloth their ant-sized forms wave back. This rudimentary communication not unlike that used by Roman soldiers stationed nearby at Hardknott Fort 2000 years ago gives me a burst of happiness no number of Instagram likes could match.

It may be tougher to convince older children and teenagers that a spell with no wifi is a good thing but growing awareness of the mental-health benefits of switching off studies of the detrimental effects on adolescent brains of social media and overuse of technology and the way wellbeing is in vogue may make them less resistant than you might expect. Many have embraced mindfulness yoga and veganism – why not this?

When our tech habits are so deeply ingrained we can’t rely on flaccid promises to use our phones a bit less. Going somewhere like Bird How means there’s no choice. Perhaps like dry January we must force these experiences on ourselves. A cold turkey digital detox can’t be argued with especially when it comes with such appealing trimmings.

Text Vanessa Hsieh

Look anyone who knows me personally knows I am loath to write a defence of a man who has demonstrated behaviour generally ascribed to the archetype of a fuckboy but the targeted attack of said man – better known by his internet-given moniker West Elm Caleb – has got way out of hand. What started as a light-hearted take on an unfortunate but not uncommon dating story posted to TikTok has since spiralled out into a hashtag that now has 32.9 million views at the time of writing sparking endless Twitter threads articles NFTs (I wish I was joking) and even suggested PR marketing strategies. As women across NYC figured out they were all talking to the same 6”4’ guy who designed furniture for West Elm and routinely ghosted them all #WestElmCaleb became shorthand for every shitty behaviour ever exhibited by a man while a rabid trial-by-internet turned the real Caleb into a pariah of NYC dating overnight. Set upon by a relentless mob who exposed photos and personal details in their pursuit to get him fired or worse even I – whose own fumble through the minefield of London dating has me teetering on the precipice of misandry – felt for the poor bastard at the eye of the storm.

Therein lies the crux of the problem with the furore surrounding West Elm Caleb that he – as many seem to have forgotten – is an IRL person. Through narratives constrained by character limits and three-minute videos the real Caleb has been flattened and fed back to an audience thriving off this concept of West Elm Caleb a kind of softboi everyman and thus an easy metaphor for all mens’ dating sins. Powered by an algorithm that loves to sleuth TikTok mobilised as it would to catch a cheater or report a true crime story unionising the girls of NYC against one common enemy. Girlboss energy run amok the “yasss queen” vibe of the posts and comments actively encouraging the harassment of an otherwise unremarkable guy was alarmingly dissonant. In our urgency to make like the girls of John Tucker Must Die who “don’t get mad get even” by orchestrating the downfall of the film’s titular fuckboy we are ignoring that this isn’t actually a movie and what we say and do has real-life repercussions. The same guilt those girls feel when they realise devising the calculated heartbreak of an albeit dishonest but ultimately human person who will like all of us make mistakes is what should be in our minds – as well as contextualising this against the ways the world has changed since the film came out. Made in 2006 when Facebook and Twitter were still in their infancy and when Instagram and TikTok were barely a blip in their creators’ minds none of the hijinks and attempts at public humiliation in John Tucker would have the permanence and reach they would now have. West Elm Caleb’s behaviour while bad should be understood as symptomatic of a wider dating hellscape misshapen by apps and social media – forces that have similarly skewed our perception of “just” punishment for him. TikTok where this story originated is a platform built on our increasing performance of reality where users are positioned as creators adopting “TikTok voice” (an even more deranged evolution of YouTuber voice) to narrate clips of situations played for maximum entertainment value. In this there is no room for nuance: humour is parroted verbatim morphing into misinformation at best malign intent at worst. “I don’t give a fuck if this man lives or dies” @kateglavan jarringly “jokes” at one point while delivering her own West Elm Caleb receipts later posting a video to clarify her tone. People with no connection to the original situation are presented on the same For You Page with little to no context feeding the app’s insatiable appetite for “tea” or drama without much thought for the IRL implications. This dystopian presentation of “fact” doesn’t help to hold people accountable for their actions it just further destabilises the landscape where we should be able to learn by trial and tribulation. Navigating the pitfalls of knowing someone intimately is hard enough without our young dumb mistakes haunting us forever online

Now R&B music royalty the Temptations have launched a major campaign to commemorate this special milestone which began in June 2021 and runs through June 2022. Helping with the celebration is the legendary Smokey Robinson who along with producer Narada Michael Walden group member Ron Tyson and founding member Otis Williams have written songs for the anniversary album Temptations 60 to be released on January 28. With numerous line-up changes over the years Otis Williams is the sole surviving original member of “The Classic Five”:

Paul Williams (1939-1973)

David Ruffin (1941-1991)

Eddie Kendricks (1939-1992)

Melvin Franklin (1942-1995)

Williams reflected “I’ve been blessed to take this journey with Shelly Berger my manager and dear brother and with all my brothers – the Temptations. Now to be the last one standing from the classic line-up can be hard sometimes but I know God left me here for a reason and that was to continue to share with new generations of fans the great music that we started back in that two-story house in Detroit known as Hitsville USA.”

Though not an original member Dennis Edwards (1943-2018) was ushered in as a replacement after the firing of David Ruffin. During this time there was also an ushering in of something new for the Temptations: a new era branching from strictly smooth ballads to a funk psychedelic sound and producing megahits like “I Can’t Get Next to You” “Ball of Confusion” and the megawatt hit “Papa Was a Rolling Stone.”

Last year the Temptations kicked off their year-long campaign: a 50-city concert tour the remastering of music videos including their collaboration with singer Rick James on the single “Standing on the Top” and the October reopening of the Imperial Theatre for the Broadway musical Ain’t Too Proud: The Life and Times of the Temptations based on Otis Williams’ personal journey. Williams who received an honorary degree of Doctor of Humane Letters from Stillman College in 2006 added “Reaching this milestone in my career hasn’t always been easy but it’s gratifying to know that our fans have always been there every step of the way.”

Perhaps one of the most fascinating aspects of the celebration is the three-part YouTube documentary series on the group. Chapter 1: The Beginning is out now and offers insight into the group as well as the early history of Motown Records.

Smokey Robinson who is also featured in the docuseries explains “At that time nobody was paying us. I mean all the other record companies the national record companies they paid you if they wanted to. And if they didn’t want to they didn’t especially if you were Black. I mean whatever they felt like giving you they may give you a car rather than giving you your royalty money.”

Otis Williams delved deeper by recalling childhood memories. “When you are raised by two wonderful grandmothers down South all I would listen to was gospel. When the Temps first got together we would open up our rehearsals singing gospel because when you sang gospel you better know what you’re doing or leave it alone. Because those brothers and sisters that were singing gospel when I was growing up listening they hit the spirit.”

Officially the celebration ends in June 2022. However it may pick back up with an event honoring Otis Williams’s 80th birthday come October 30th. Though the new album Temptations 60 features mostly modern-day Temptation members it should be a reminder of what the legendary institution always represented. Smooth distinctive harmonies backed by a body-swaying toe-tapping finger-snapping beat. As for the docuseries all the nostalgically cool footage alone will place longtime fans back on “Cloud Nine.”

‘Huawei welcomes a selection of top-of-the-class students to their 2021 University Challenge’ the invitations read. The company added that the technology would be used for ‘business intelligence’ and ‘security services’.

The invitation to the ‘hackathon’ as Huawei described it was aimed at data science students and was relayed by Oxford’s careers service just a few weeks before Christmas. When one student questioned whether it was appropriate for the careers service to be passing this on when Huawei’s technology was implicated in the repression of the Uyghurs in Xinjiang she received a perfunctory reply. ‘We offer an impartial service’ it said and it was up to students whether they wanted to engage or not. It referred her to the terms and conditions of the service.

It is hard to say what was the most shocking part of the incident. The audacity of a company with close links to the Chinese Communist Party which is barred from Britain’s 5G telecoms networks on security grounds? Or the apparent indifference of Oxford University? But it is just one example of the brazen way in which entities linked to the CCP are able to trawl for information and technology in Britain with few questions asked.

The word Qingbao in Chinese means both ‘intelligence’ and ‘information’ and it neatly encapsulates the unique nature and breadth of a China’s vast spying system which combines formal and informal techniques both overt and covert to obtain new intelligence. There is often a fine line between theft and the voluntary transfer of know-how and China has pushed the latter to the limit. Over the years the CCP has built a comprehensive system for spotting and acquiring foreign technologies by multiple means.

Many Chinese partners make little attempt to hide their affiliation with the CCP or military

China’s cyber spies are one face of this system and have hacked the computers of western companies on an industrial scale. The targets closely align with the advanced technologies identified by the CCP as those in which it wants to lead the world.

Most popular Jane Robins Harry and Meghan’s desperate rebrand

In one operation I was told about while researching a book on Chinese surveillance hackers penetrated a US oil company by infecting the online menu of a local Chinese restaurant where systems engineers ordered their takeaways. When the engineers clicked on General Tso’s chicken they got a lot more than sweet crispy meat.

The scale of the hacking is breathtaking. America’s Office of National Counter Intelligence Executive described Chinese actors as the ‘world’s most active and persistent perpetrators of economic espionage’ While General Keith Alexander then head of US Cyber Command and the National Security Agency once famously described America’s loss of intellectual property and other industrial information through cyber espionage as ‘the greatest transfer of wealth in history.’

Despite its scale the tradecraft is often sloppy. Hackers frequently leave behind digital fingerprints which can be traced back to China. Last year Britain joined the US EU Australia and other allies in accusing Beijing of working with criminal groups to breach Microsoft’s email systems which affected tens of thousands of companies and public sector organisations worldwide. The coordinated condemnation was unprecedented.

In its 2021 annual report Britain’s National Cyber Security Centre which is part of GCHQ said cyber ‘incidents’ were running at a record level and that Covid-19 vaccine research had become a prime target for hackers. ‘China remained a highly sophisticated actor in cyberspace with increasing ambition to project its influence beyond its borders and a proven interest in the UK’s commercial secrets’ it warned. MI5 chief Richard Moore said that China is now his organisation’s single biggest priority.

China’s principal espionage agency is the Ministry of State Security the Guoanbu which is responsible for foreign and counterintelligence and ranks among the world’s largest intelligence agencies. The People’s Liberation Army has parallel organisations. Intelligence work is closely coordinated with the United Front Work Department (UFWD) which concentrates on influence operations and which has been vastly expanded under Xi Jinping. Christine Lee who was outed last week by MI5 as a Chinese agent was allegedly working for the UFWD.

Where the Guoanbu has recruited conventional agents it has tended to concentrate on people of ethnic Chinese heritage from whom it thinks it can demand loyalty. It has been accused of using LinkedIn to trawl for potential agents seeking to lure them to China for meetings about ‘well paid’ opportunities before recruiting them.

But conventional agents tend to have a back seat in China’s intelligence set-up for the simple reason that its informal methods have been so fruitful. This is particularly the case in higher education. It makes little sense to steal or buy when gullible universities can be persuaded to give away sensitive information free of charge. In this way much of China’s intelligence work is done by an informal network of academics students or business people who help the CCP as and when they can. This work might be at a commercial or technological level – or as with Ms Lee it might involve the broader peddling of influence. This presents an enormous challenge to British intelligence agencies as it falls below the bar of current espionage laws.

China has established a network of ‘dual-use’ friendship and cultural organisations. Within higher education Confucius Institutes ostensibly teach the Chinese language while the China Students and Scholars Association is concerned with the welfare of Chinese students the biggest single group of foreign students at British universities. Yet both have been accused of peddling propaganda spying on students and intimidating critics. Internationally they have been investigated and sanctioned but continue to be given free rein in the UK.

Another preferred method of intelligence gathering has been through joint research centres or funding research projects. Research collaborations between the UK and China increased by 115.6 per cent between 2013 and 2019. There were 15623 such collaborations in 2019 making China Britain’s biggest research partner after the US and Germany and the fastest growing partnership.

Many Chinese partners make little attempt to hide their affiliation with the CCP or military and British universities have shown little curiosity or transparency about often opaque sources of funding. Cambridge University has accepted millions of pounds from the Chinese government to set up a ‘smart cities’ research centre in the city of Nanjing which it describes as its ‘most ambitious’ Chinese collaboration to date. ‘Smart city’ tech may well improve urban lifestyles but in Xi Jinping’s China that same technology is also enabling hitherto unseen levels of surveillance and repression.

It should be remembered that a raft of security laws in China mean that companies and researchers are required to cooperate with the state’s intelligence agencies when asked. ‘Civil-military fusion’ the obligation of researchers to share their findings with the security apparatus has even been written into the constitution.

Late last year it was reported that China was massively expanding its ability to mine western social media including Facebook and Twitter for information on potential foreign targets. This seems like a chilling extension of China’s intelligence reach but it does raise another issue – one of digestion. China’s intelligence operations have been likened to a vast vacuum cleaner hoovering up everything and anything they can – often dubbed the ‘thousand grains of sand’ approach.

A better way of describing it is a layered system with various degrees of formality and multiple techniques. But that still presents the challenge of making sense of the vast amounts of data generated even with machine learning. Ultimately it is not raw data but analyses that make workable and applicable intelligence and the Guoanbu is not thought to have strong analytic capabilities.

There are some encouraging signs that the world is growing aware of the risks. British athletes preparing to travel to Beijing for the Winter Olympics have been offered temporary phones for use while there out of fear that the authorities could install spyware to extract private information or track their future activity. For the same reason Western business executives visiting China now routinely take throwaway laptops and burner phones. It is a pity that sort of vigilance is not being displayed closer to home with Britain’s intelligence agencies seemingly in despair at the lack of awareness of potential risks in sensitive industries and research centres."

He was 70 years old. Born in Newark New Jersey Vincent graduated from Niagara University in 1973 and received an MBA from Fordham University in 1987.

Vince had a long and highly successful career as a retirement actuary human resources consultant and client relationship director stretching over 40 years. He was a principal at A.S. Hansen a managing director and principal at Mercer and an executive account director at Willis Towers Watson. His coworkers recalled Vince as “the person everyone wanted to listen to.” Many wrote about his client relationships that were strong and enduring built on openness trust and integrity. They added how they admired his calm under pressure and enjoyed his one-liners and his dry wit. “He really was one of the very best — in every way. I counted on his advice input equanimity and good humor.”

Vin lived a peaceful and content life married Marie Rubino (née Megaw) in 1983 and moved to Riverside a section of Greenwich where they spent nearly 39 years raising their three sons Peter David and Stephen. Vin enjoyed kayaking biking playing guitar and learning about the world as an avid reader and self-taught Chinese speaker. His happiness was marred only by the death of his 33 year old son Peter in January 2021 but Vin found comfort in the family’s closeness. In the rare moments when he talked about Peter’s passing he displayed a sense of quiet introspection and hints of acceptance.

Vin will be remembered for many things – his humor positive attitude and strong intellect. His steadfastness stands out most of all. Vin was an excellent father husband and trusted advisor. He is survived by his wife Marie his two sons David and Stephen his sister Fran Tosti and brother Frank and extensive family members. He leaves behind a large network of friends and coworkers who carry on his memory. A memorial service will be held later this spring.",,,,,,,,,,,,

The Las Vegas-based casino giant is quietly shopping its Wynn Interactive unit — operator of the WynnBet online gaming app — and has slashed the asking price to $500 million after floating a $3 billion valuation less than a year ago a source close to the situation told The Post.

The fire sale comes less than six months after Wynn was publicly readying a splashy spring launch for WynnBet signing up NBA legend Shaquille O’Neal as a brand ambassador. O’Neal even sold his minority stake in the Sacramento Kings NBA team so he could work closely with Wynn without breaking the league’s gambling rules.

5 Outgoing CEO Matt Maddox has expressed reservations about WynnBet’s customer acquisition costs. AP

“I am so excited to take WynnBet to new heights” O’Neal said in an August press release. “Mobile sports betting is having a major moment and I believe that WynnBet will be a powerful force in the industry.”

A few months later in November however Wynn said it was scrapping plans it disclosed in May to merge Wynn Interactive with Austerlitz Acquisition Corp. — a blank-check company owned by Bill Foley the billionaire owner of the Las Vegas Knights.

In addition to creating a public company with a $3.2 billion valuation the deal would have armed WynnBet with $640 million in cash for marketing. After revealing that the app was on track to burn $100 million in both the third and fourth quarters outgoing CEO Matt Maddox signaled he wasn’t interested in throwing good money after bad.

“The market is really not sustainable right now” Maddox said on a Nov. 10 earnings call. “Competitors are spending too much to get customers. And the economics are just not something that we’re going to participate in.”

5 WynnBet faces stiff competition from longer-established wagering platforms like DraftKings. AP

Shortly thereafter Morgan Stanley analysts said they valued WynnBet at $700 million adding that they only expected the app to win a 2.5% share of the North American market.

Meanwhile FanDuel and DraftKings which together control a majority share of the online sports-betting market have lately dangled credits as high as $1000 to sign up new members. Caesars has likewise staged aggressive promotions in New York despite a crushing state tax rate of 51% on online gaming revenues.

On Friday the New York Gaming Commission said mobile sports betting was off to a brisk start in its first week with more than $600 million in bets taken by Caesar’s FanDuel DraftKings and BetRivers. Gaming analysts said that the massive haul was partly the result of “heavy promotion from the operators.”

Wynn has a New York online betting license but hasn’t yet launched its service.

“I personally am surprised at the level of promos we are seeing considering the 51% tax rates” said Barry Jonas an analyst at Truist. “I think it has to tone down long-term if there is any hope of seeing profitability in the state.”

It’s a long way from last spring when online sports betting companies were trading as high as 25 times projected revenues as tech investors including Cathie Wood’s Ark Invest hyped their stocks arguing that the pandemic was poised to create an explosion in mobile gaming.

Now even the highest-valued among them are trading closer to six times. DraftKings the largest listed pure-play sports-betting company went from trading in the mid-$50s in May to the low $40s in November. On Friday its shares closed at $19.46.

A tipping point Jonas said was when DraftKings in September made an unsuccessful $20 billion offer for British bookmaker Entain indicating it wanted to gain more exposure outside the newer US market.

5 Talk about a gamble: It costs as much as $500 to acquire an online gaming customer one source tells The Post. AP

A Wynn spokesman said the company wouldn’t comment on what he called market speculation and rumor. “We were clear on our last earnings call about the current highly competitive nature of the online sports betting market and our desire to operate that business in way that will actually create long-term shareholder value” he said in a statement to The Post.

Meanwhile banking sources said the most logical suitors for Wynn Interactive which in addition to WynnBet owns Wynn Slots and BetBull are Fanatics and Penn Interactive. But neither has displayed clear interest sources added.

That doesn’t mean a deal won’t happen. David Katz a gaming analyst at Jefferies notes that most players claim the taxes and promotions however punishing haven’t surprised them.

5 DraftKings’ plummeting share price should give the industry pause. AP

“The operators are constantly telling us they have the mathematical models that give them the intelligence that they are spending money wisely — and the Street doesn’t believe them” Katz said. “The way the Street sees the future has changed in the last three to six months — there was certainly a lot of enthusiasm but the winds changed swiftly.”

A key question analysts say is whether the steep promotions will start to pay off soon. Katz estimates that it costs $300 to $500 on average to acquire an online gaming customer.

“I don’t think anyone knows how sticky customers are” Katz said. “Time will show who is right.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiS2h0dHBzOi8vY2EubW92aWVzLnlhaG9vLmNvbS9odW50ZXItZmllcmktd2lzaGVzLXJvY2tzdGFyLWRhZC0yMTEyNTUzMDAuaHRtbNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Hunter Fieri Wishes 'Rockstar' Dad Guy Fieri a Happy Birthday: 'You Are a Legend',"Guy Fieri and son Hunter Fieri (L) attend the 2016 NASCAR Sprint Cup Series Awards at Wynn Las Vegas on December 2 2016 in Las Vegas Nevada.

The idea of this glamorous set up has most probably been brought to the forefront of our minds thanks to the James Bond franchise with a tuxedo’d Bond bringing his flirtatious nature preference for a particular drink and a heavy dose of drama to a night at the casino.

Of course some of us may want to embody this oh-so glamorous vibe when we hit the casino floor next (sans the poisonings and the like that the plots include) and with the sheer number of casinos that are spread across the world it can be tricky to know where to go for the best Bond-inspired experience.

The films take inspiration from existing casinos and there are plenty of highly sophisticated resorts to visit that certainly embody all it is that the films and Bond himself emanate. From glitzy Las Vegas to opulent Monaco to magnificent Macau we teamed up with Profit Squad the place where you’ll find all online casino reviews to narrow down the top five Bond-esque casinos in the world that you can head to for a suave and sophisticated experience.

Xcel the state's largest electricity provider recently excised the new gas plants opposed by clean energy and environmental groups from its long-term power generation plan. State regulators start hearings on the plan this week.

But the move is an effort to get the long-stalled plan approved not an abandonment of the gas ""peaking"" plants. The company maintains the plants — which would operate only when the grid is strained — are critical to keeping electricity flowing.

""To really have safety and reliability for our customers we need these [gas plants] as an insurance policy"" said Christopher Clark Xcel's president for Minnesota and the Dakotas.

Clean energy and environmental groups have roundly opposed any new gas plants saying they're not needed as battery technology and pricing improves. (Batteries store electricity to be discharged onto the grid).

""You can provide all of the reliability and capacity services that you need with batteries"" said Allen Gleckner lead director for clean electricity for research and advocacy group Fresh Energy in St. Paul.

The Minnesota Public Utilities Commission (PUC) this week is slated to take up Xcel's Integrated Resource Plan which lays out the company's long-term power generation plans. Investor-owned electric utilities must file such master plans every 18 months or so.

Xcel's latest plan — filed in May 2019 and updated last year — is packed with significant changes. It calls for Xcel to exit coal power in eight years with the respective early closures of its Allen S. King plant in Oak Park Heights in 2028 and Sherco 3 in Becker in 2030.

The PUC has already approved the early closures of Xcel's Sherco 2 and Sherco 1 two coal plants in Becker respectively in 2023 and 2026.

Clean power and environmental groups have all lauded Xcel's coal plant closures. But there's been much rancor over the role of natural gas generators in Xcel's fleet.

Xcel's 2019 resource plan initially called for a roughly $800 million 800-megawatt gas plant in Becker which would effectively replace one of Sherco's three big coal generators. The gas plant was so contentious that Xcel successfully lobbied the legislature in 2017 to allow it to bypass the normal PUC approval process.

However Xcel dropped the Becker gas plant in June a move hailed by clean energy groups. At the same time Xcel announced plans to build two smaller gas plants — one each in southwestern Minnesota and North Dakota — at less than half the cost of the Becker plant.

Both would be ""peaking plants"" designed to run only when the grid is stressed by peak electricity demand — on very cold or very hot days for instance.

The peaking plants one of which would be in Lyon County and the other near Fargo would run about 6 % of the time according to Xcel. The Becker gas plant would have operated 80 to 90 % of the time.

The peaking plants ""are not a resource that will add significant carbon"" Clark said.

However the plants — which would come online in the late 2020s — could have lifespans that surpass 2050 the year that Xcel has committed to become a carbon-free electricity producer.

Xcel would build the gas plants to also burn hydrogen — a fuel free of carbon emissions — as well as ""renewable natural gas."" Still there are technical barriers that hydrogen must surmount while renewable gas supplies aren't likely to be plentiful.

Gas has been viewed as a ""bridge fuel"" to full-scale renewable power. It's generally been cheap for years courtesy of the U.S. fracking boom. And gas-fired plants emit half the carbon dioxide of coal generators.

But clean power groups increasingly say renewable power particularly solar coupled with a fleet of grid batteries for storage is cheaper and just as reliable as a new gas plant including Xcel's planned peakers.

Several organizations — including Fresh Energy the Sierra Club and the Minnesota Center for Environmental Advocacy (MCEA) — contend that Xcel's long-term power modeling overprices battery storage and limits its deployment particularly in tandem with solar.

""The forecasts are completely at odds with actual pricing"" said Fresh Energy's Gleckner.

In a PUC filing the Sierra Club said Xcel ""baked"" the peaking plants into its modeling. ""Xcel's reliability analysis is biased towards gas generators and against renewable and storage resources"" the filing said.

Xcel has defended its modeling. Clark said Xcel is open to more battery deployment if it sees ""better prices"" but said batteries are not an adequate substitute for the gas peaking plants.

""On the coldest day of the year — on days when we don't have sun or we don't have wind — we need to make sure we can provide energy to our customers"" Clark said. ""Batteries cannot provide the kind of reliability — the insurance policy — we need on our system.""

In a recent PUC filing Xcel disclosed an agreement with clean power groups on key issues for its resource plan. (The groups are Fresh Energy MCEA the Union of Concerned Scientists and the Clean Grid Alliance. Three labor unions also gave support.)

They agreed that the PUC need not decide now on the Lyons County and Fargo peaking plants.

But they also agreed to direct the PUC to find that by the late 2020s Xcel will likely need an additional 800 megawatts of ""generic firm dispatchable"" power — for example production that can be turned on and off. It could be from gas plants or batteries — or a combination of both.

While the clean energy organizations agreed with Xcel's plans to extend the federal license of its Monticello nuclear power plant by ten years to 2040 the utility did agree to do a ""deeper analysis"" of battery storage and hydrogen in its next resource plan due in 2023.

Xcel considers its nuclear plants in Monticello and near Red Wing to be crucial — and constant — sources of carbon-free power as its coal plants close.

The agreement with Xcel is like a ""truce"" heading into the PUC hearings Gleckner said.

Clean energy groups aren't backing down on demands that Xcel beef up its grid with batteries. And Xcel is ""not saying they are giving up on the [gas] peakers by any means"" Gleckner said.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZXJpbmtsaXZlLmNvbS9uaGwvaG93LXdpbGQtcGxheWVycy1sZWFybmVkLWFib3V0LXBhY2tlcnMtcGxheW9mZi1sb3NzLXNrb2wtY2hhbnQtYXQteGNlbNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,How Wild players learned about Packers' playoff loss -- 'Skol' chant at Xcel,"ST. PAUL -- With the Minnesota Wild and Chicago Blackhawks locked in a heated battle on Saturday night at Xcel Energy Center there was a noticeable crescendo in the crowd during a relatively mundane moment of the game.

It started as a low murmur built to tempered cheer then erupted into a deafening roar.

On the Wild bench rookie winger Brandon Duhaime turned to veteran winger Marcus Foligno to ask if he knew what was going on.

“I was like ‘I don’t know'” Foligno said. “I knew the Vikings weren’t playing.”

With the NFL playoffs in full swing though Foligno knew the rival Green Bay Packers were playing the San Francisco 49ers in the divisional round. Initially Foligno thought the Packers might have won their matchup and were moving on to the NFC Championship Game.

Then he heard the “Skol” chant.

Usually a mainstay at U.S. Bank Stadium for Vikings home games fans busted out the “Skol” chant on Saturday night at Xcel Energy Center to celebrate the fact that their biggest rival had been knocked out of the NFL playoffs.

” I was like ‘OK (the Packers) lost'” Foligno said. “That was pretty funny.”

Asked if he realized what was going on winger Jordan Greenway cracked a smile.

“I was on the bench trying to figure it out” Greenway said. “I didn’t realize it right away. But it was funny to see that that was going on. Just a great atmosphere out there.”

Oh Captain My Captain

After missing more than a month with a lower-body injury — the same ailment that sidelined him earlier this season — captain Jared Spurgeon returned to the lineup on Saturday night and didn’t miss a beat. He was strong in both ends and chipped in with a pair of assists as the Wild earned a 4-3 overtime win over the Blackhawks.

“He’s just so intelligent” coach Dean Evason said. “He just makes such sound reads. If you see him make a bad pinch let us know. Not only that. He stepped right in with his leadership qualities when things were a little sideways. He was verbally talking to the group the entire time of what we had to do. Just slipped right back into his leadership role.”

Between the pipes

It looks like goaltender Cam Talbot will return to the lineup on Monday night at the Xcel Energy Center. He’s missed the past few weeks with a lower-body injury and fellow goaltender Kaapo Kahkonen has filled in admirably in his absence.

That next man up mentality has been a strength of the Wild for much of this season.

“If someone gets hurt some other guys step up” veteran winger Mats Zuccarello said. “And Kaapo has really stepped up. He’s played unbelievable for us and helped us win a couple of games. He’s been great.”

I’m not suggesting it’s a good thought but it’s a thought. Given the success and attention that the “Winter Classic” brought to Minnesota it might be time for the “Summer Classic.” Not the All-Star game…been there done that. I’m talking about something unique creative. Something really unique and creative could be a cage-match between Rob Manfred and someone who really disliked him (a lottery would have to be applied). But that seems mean-spirited.

How about “somewhat” unique and creative and slightly less prone to blood-letting? How about a real Summer Classic? A Baseball game in July in the Xcel Energy Center. I believe a hockey arena’s dimensions are 200 feet by 85 feet. This would mean that a home run could happen by either hitting what would normally be a lazy pop up to the infield…and the shallow infield at that or at most a shallow pop fly to the outfield. Pitching of course would be at a premium. The winning team would have to limit the opposition to something under several dozen runs and any player making an out would suffer no small degree of humiliation and shame.

Depending upon where home plate was situated playing either first base or third base would undoubtedly require hockey goalie like protective equipment. I mean I’m not looking for this to hurt anyone…although the name “Manfred” keeps popping into my head. But I digress.

I’m not suggesting it be played on ice…that would be simply be a novelty and crazy….of course it would be artificial turf which as we all remember from the Metrodome (with fondness mostly) was sometimes kind of a novelty and at times simply crazy. Who can forget the outfielders waiting for that first hop on a Texas League “single” to come down while Carlos Gomez or all too often someone from an opposing team kept on flying around the bases. I mean it was crazy but it was our crazy. Singles became doubles. Doubles became triples. Triples became…well…outs much of the time but no need to attack past third base coaching decisions.

As with many things we can mock our past just as we can make fun of our own families but others need to back off and allow us a certain level of respect…I mean it’s only funny if we say it. The Winter Classic was quintessential Minnesota. Temperatures at zero or below. Enthusiastic fans casting caution to the wind as they cheered their team…and in the end…the Minnesota team lost. It was truly a classic. Baseball might want to learn from it.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMic2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNpZXJyYWNsdWIub3JnL21pbm5lc290YS9ibG9nLzIwMjIvMDEvbmF0dXJhbC1nYXMtbm90LWNsZWFuLWVuZXJneS1pdC1zLWNsaW1hdGUtZW5kYW5nZXJpbmctbWV0aGFuZS1nYXPSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,“Natural” Gas is Not Clean Energy - It's Climate Endangering Methane Gas,"To avert the worst impacts of the climate crisis we need to transition away from burning fossil fuels and move to 100% clean renewable energy. As we make big decisions in how we generate electricity provide heat to our homes and businesses and build our transportation system we can’t afford to build new fossil fuel infrastructure that will continue our dependence on fossil fuels - coal oil and so-called “natural” gas.

The fossil fuel industry really wants us to believe that ""natural gas"" is clean. The truth is that ""natural gas"" is primarily methane — a potent and dangerous greenhouse gas. It is more accurately called methane gas or fossil gas.

Our climate can’t afford methane gas

In the most recent climate report from the IPCC (Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change) methane was highlighted as a particular concern “because it has an outsized impact on the climate. The gas makes up a tiny fraction of our atmosphere — CO2 levels are more than 200 times higher. But in the first 20 years after release methane is around 80 times more powerful than CO2 at trapping heat in Earth’s atmosphere.”

Methane gas is burned in electricity-generating power plants and industrial processes and for home heating cooling and cooking. 2 out of 3 homes in Minnesota use methane gas for heating. When methane gas is burned it releases CO2 (and other air pollutants) into the atmosphere.

Methane gas is also released directly into the atmosphere during extraction (primarily through fracking in the US). A significant amount of it also leaks into the atmosphere when it is transported by pipelines. Using satellite imagery scientists are finding that more methane gas is leaking into the atmosphere than we have been estimating and much of the leakage is not being counted at all.

Methane gas is also released during oil extraction and if there isn’t a way to capture the methane it is “flared” or burned releasing CO2 into the atmosphere.

So why is it viewed as “clean”?

The fossil fuel industry has spent a lot of money to sell us lies about methane gas including promoting unsafe gas stoves placing pro-fossil fuel ads on social media and google and downplaying negative health effects of gas appliances.

Industry talking points also rely on comparing methane gas with coal. When burned methane gas releases about half of the CO2 and much less of other air pollutants than coal. However that doesn’t account for the methane gas leakage during extraction and transportation which makes the climate impact about the same for a coal or gas plant. But comparing methane with coal is missing the point entirely; methane gas isn’t currently competing with coal it’s competing with clean energy! And wind solar batteries electric stoves and electric heat pumps can cost-effectively replace methane gas without emitting climate or other air pollutants.

Are there other risks to methane gas?

Methane gas is not clean healthy or affordable.



In addition to exacerbating climate change burning gas releases other air pollutants like nitrogen oxides that impact people’s health and environment. While NOx is damaging on its own — causing coughing wheezing asthma attacks reduced lung function and respiratory inflammation — it also reacts with other chemicals in the air to form ozone.



Burning gas in homes for home heating (gas furnaces) and cooking (gas stoves) exposes people to pollutants linked to serious health risks including decreased lung function asthma attacks nervous system damage heart attacks strokes cancer and death.



Two-thirds of the methane gas used in the US is extracted through fracking a process that pollutes air and water contributes to climate change and induces earthquakes. Check out Sierra Club’s Fracking 101 Video.



Methane gas is a danger to all communities risking public health environmental devastation and climate disruption. But building new gas infrastructure is a particular danger to communities of color who bear a disproportionate burden from pipeline construction and the other consequences of fossil gas.



Fossil gas is more expensive and will be harder on MN’s pocketbooks than renewables. By retiring gas and investing heavily in renewables we can unlock a thriving clean energy economy for the long-term. Energy from sources like wind and solar power resources we produce right here in our own state are already cheaper than producing energy from new fossil gas plants.

Are we still investing in new methane gas infrastructure in Minnesota?

Unfortunately yes.



Despite widespread support and movement towards 100% clean electricity in Minnesota Xcel Energy and Minnesota Power are still proposing building NEW methane gas plants and the Rochester Public Utilities Commission is also considering building a new gas plant.



At the same time gas utilities continue to invest in the gas system for homes and businesses. Despite announcing a climate pledge last year CenterPoint Energy Minnesota’s largest gas utility is planning a $1.7 billion gas pipeline expansion (nationally) and is fighting efforts to curb fossil fuel reliance at the local level. Gas utilities like CenterPoint are also promoting fuels like “Renewable Natural Gas” as climate friendly alternatives to gas so they can justify continued investments in the gas system despite the limited opportunity and high cost.

Unlike dogs who will vocalize and even try to communicate with their owners if they are in pain severe pain in cats can be harder to detect and may go unnoticed for longer said one of the app's developers Dr. Paulo Steagall.

""Pain is indeed quite difficult to recognize in cats because of their particular behaviour even by animal health professionals"" said Steagall who is a professor of anesthesia and pain management at the University de Montreal's (UdeM) Faculty of Veterinary Medicine. ""It's a big challenge on a daily basis.""

Cats true to form may be more independent and aloof than dogs if they feel pain which may delay detection of a problem. Changes in the animal's behaviour such as changes in attitude or posture may alert the owner said Steagall.

The app uses a pain scale (the ""Feline Grimace Scale"") developed at the UdeM's Faculty of Veterinary Medicine to help owners determine if their pet is in pain.

The owner simply observes the cat from a distance when it is awake and quiet and notes five criteria: ear position eye opening muzzle tension whisker position and head position. Depending on the answers provided the app may suggest contacting the veterinarian.

As for the veterinarians since the tool reveals the degree of pain felt by the cat it allows them to determine if they should administer a painkiller.

The app assesses acute pain not chronic pain said Steagall who The Canadian Press caught up with in Hong Kong where he will be teaching at City University for the next year.

""It's also an ethical issue to make sure animals are not in pain"" he said.

The app also allows the owner to take a photo of their pet and send it to their veterinarian. The photo can also be sent to the University of Montreal's research group to contribute to the development of feline welfare Steagall said.

The Feline Grimace Scale app was developed with funding from the company Zoetis and with the collaboration of Quebec-based Vertisoft. It is available for free on Android and iOS platforms in French English and Spanish.",,,,,,,,,,,,
