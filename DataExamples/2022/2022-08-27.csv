History Of Blaine

Long before the immigrants arrived Dakota and Ojibwe Indians hunted in the region that would eventually become Blaine. Speculators started hiring squatters to acquire land in the 1850s. Andrew More bought land in 1855 and was the only person who most likely resided in the municipality. The first known permanent resident of Blaine was Phillip Laddy an Irishman who arrived in Blaine in 1862 and lived close to the lake that today bears his name Laddie Lake. From roughly 1862 until his passing in 1872 he farmed there. When George Wall Joseph Gagner and some other settlers moved there around 1870 the neighborhood started to expand. In 1877 the township became formally constituted. While farming contributed to the rise of many other villages in Anoka County the sandy soils and numerous wetlands in Blaine turned away would-be farmers keeping it a prime hunting ground. After World War II Blaine's growth slowed down although starter home communities started appearing in the city's southern section.

CONOR McGREGOR took aim at sparring partner-turned-rival Paulie Malignaggi in a video on Instagram.

The 34-year-old UFC ace was being put through his paces as he worked the pads next to his luxury €3 MILLION luxury yacht.

He posted a video of the workout to Instagram not missing the chance to take a pope at the American ex-pro boxer.

He said: ""I’m the Magic Man f*** malinaggi [sic] and the lot of them.""

Malignaggi was a temporary sparring partner of McGregor's in the build up to his 2017 exhibition against Floyd Mayweather.

Their feud began when an image of Malignaggi left on the canvas made the headlines with McGregor claiming he put him to the floor.

The American was left furious with the statement and wanted to make it clear that he was pushed to the ground.

A video later emerged that showed Malignaggi taking a few blows to the face in the 12th round before hitting the ground.

Malignaggi stormed out of Team McGregor but Mayweather later claimed that he was using his 'friend' to spy on McGregor's camp.

Their rivalry very nearly led to the two meeting in the middle of the boxing ring.

Malignaggi called the Irishman out for a boxing match while the same man turned down any chance of meeting the former UFC champ in the octagon.

Five years later McGregor referenced the inciting moment of the feud on Twitter.

Back in March after Malignaggi insisted that YouTuber-turned-boxer Jake Paul would knock McGregor out he returned in kind.

The Irishman shared an image of him standing above the 41-year-old who was sprawled across the canvas.

Captioning the upload he simply stated: ""I left you like a little seesaw.""

MAC IN ACTION

The Notorious is currently on the sidelines after suffering a gruesome broken leg at the hands - or feet - of Dustin Poirier last July.

While it is highly unlikely that he will ever step across the ring from Paulie he has been heavily linked with a rematch with Floyd Mayweather.

In the meantime however he will be embarking on an excursion into Hollywood after being cast in a remake of the 1989-classic 'Road House'.

The subway first opened in 1865 and is located on the edge of Crystal Palace Park under the Crystal Palace Parade.

It has fallen into disrepair over decades ending up on Historic England’s ""at risk"" register.

Plans to restore the Crystal Palace subway were unanimously approved on January 11.

It is one of the last original Crystal Palace structures and Bromley Council says it is “much loved by the community.”

It even has its own dedicated Friends’ group which coordinated a community-led initiative to make access to Crystal Palace Subway safer and to open it for community use.

The subway's new exterior will be made from glass and stainless steel and the gable enclosed with Corten steel.

Funding for the project has been provided Historic England the City of London Strategic Investment Pot and contributions from the Friends of Crystal Palace Subway.

The east Courtyard has had timber frames constructed to allow for further works to soon commence on the subway’s arches and barrel vault.

In Autumn work will commence on a new courtyard roof for the Victorian subway which will be visible from Crystal Palace Parade.

The restoration works on the Grade II* listed structure are being carried out by contractors DBR Limited who were appointed by Bromley council earlier this year.

Partners on the project include Historic England and Friends of Crystal Palace Subway who have been involved throughout this special project.

The London Borough of Southwark continues to be a project partner for the subway restoration.

Bromley councillor Yvonne Bear Executive Councillor for Renewal Recreation and Housing said: “This stunning Victorian structure really demonstrates the incredible international importance of this historic Park through the glimpse it gives us into the former Crystal Palace and the amazing experience visitors would have had upon entering the park when it first opened.

“I am delighted that the specialist restoration works are now well underway and a big thank you to our valued partners for their support in getting us to this point.

“I look forward to seeing the subway returned back to use in these magnificent surroundings which is just one aspect of the council’s vision to regenerate this beloved park.”

Ian Harper Heritage at Risk Architect at Historic England said: “It is very pleasing that working with the London Borough of Bromley and their funding partners we are now repairing this remarkable surviving subway and ticketing hall.

“Skilled craftsmen and apprentices will see the Victorian brickwork restored and roof replaced to create a new sustainable facility in the park for enjoyment by the local community.”

A spokesperson for the Friends of Crystal Palace Subway said: ""Ten years ago the 'friends' organised their first open event at the subway supported by Bromley Council.

“The backing from local communities and businesses along with volunteer support over the last decade has been central to the success of this project.

“It will be an emotional moment for a great many people to see the subway restored to a usable condition.""

As deadly drugs like fentanyl pour across President Biden’s open borders the Governor reiterated that the State of Texas is working to fight the epidemic and announced new initiatives to combat the opioid crisis. Governor Abbott also announced his support for passing a law that would ensure dealers who provide drugs laced with deadly opioids are charged for murder when their product poisons innocent Texans.

“Even though some of the friends and family members we have honored here tonight are no longer with us they are never gone” said Governor Abbott. “Sadly this is a phenomenon that can be prevented if we all work together and if our federal government gets serious about protecting its citizens by securing our border. Substance abuse is a lifelong battle for many. We should muster every tool and every effort to help our fellow Texans negotiate the perils of addiction and emerge drug-free and healthy.”

Addressing the crowd of more than 300 Governor Abbott noted that in Texas nearly 1700 fentanyl-related deaths were reported in 2021 alone. As part of an ongoing effort to combat the epidemic the Governor signed a law last year that increases criminal penalties for making or distributing fentanyl.

Governor Abbott announced new initiatives to combat drug overdoses in Texas such as expanding access to opioid overdose treatment Narcan so that more Texans have access to the lifesaving drug and exploring a coordinated statewide substance abuse recovery program. The Governor also presented M-COPE with a proclamation recognizing August 31 as International Overdose Awareness Day.

Prior to addressing event attendees Governor Abbott met with M-COPE Directors Sarah Hall Sherry Barton Kathy Posey and Kimberly Rosinski who have each lost a son due to accidental overdose to discuss their organization's ongoing efforts to combat drug overdoses and help those who have lost a loved one to overdose. The Governor was joined at the event by Montgomery County Judge Wayne Mack County Lieutenant Brian Luly and County Sheriff Rand Henderson.

Texas has bused nearly 9000 asylum seekers to New York City and Washington DC in recent months as part of Gov. Greg Abbott’s effort to highlight his criticism of the Biden administration’s immigration policies.

In a statement Friday Abbott’s office said Texas has bused more than 7400 migrants to DC since April and more than 1500 migrants to New York City since August 5.

“The busing mission is providing much-needed relief to our overwhelmed border communities” the statement said. “Operation Lone Star continues to fill the dangerous gaps left by the Biden Administration’s refusal to secure the border.”

A fierce critic of the Biden administration’s immigration policies Abbott began sending hundreds of willing migrants on buses to DC earlier this year as an affront to the administration. Abbott’s office has said that “to board a bus or flight a migrant must volunteer to be transported and show documentation from DHS.”

New York City has received record numbers of migrants this week and more buses are expected a spokesperson for the mayor’s Office of Immigration told CNN on Saturday.

Mayor Eric Adams and other city officials have previously accused Abbott’s administration of forcing asylum seekers onto buses bound for New York City and not coordinating with city officials on the transfer of people. Earlier this month city officials said intake centers were already overwhelmed with more than 4000 people since a surge that began in May.

“It’s unimaginable. Come to a country and your first visit here someone is throwing you out as the Governor of Texas is doing then trying to navigate this complex country to deliver your services” Adams said at an unrelated press event earlier this month.

Department of Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas told CNN on Thursday that Abbott’s efforts to bus migrants to DC and New York is throwing the federal system for processing migrants “out of whack” and criticized the governor for not coordinating with federal authorities.

Mayorkas said it’s “problematic” when an official like Abbott works “unilaterally.”

“That lack of coordination wreaks problems in our very efficient processing” Mayorkas told CNN in Eagle Pass while he was at the U.S.-Mexico border on Thursday adding that it’s making the work of DHS “more difficult.”

Mayorkas criticized Abbott for not working with destination cities.

“These cities have certain capacities” he said. “They have infrastructure to address the needs of migrants and we need to calibrate the movement of people according to their capacity and their efficiencies. And that is not being done.”

Mayorkas said his department has reached out to Abbott to seek better coordination but Abbott has not responded."

Adobe Stock | Olindana

Sure you could pick any old apple during your next farm visit…but why not pluck these native apple varieties for a taste of the Hudson Valley?

What is it about our apples that make them so irresistibly delicious? It could be that the Hudson Valley is the birthplace of commercial orcharding. “It started here with Dutch settlers in the early 1600s—they put in a lot of effort over the next 200 years to develop commercial production” says Craig Cavallo co-author of American Cider and co-owner of Rhinebeck’s Golden Russet Café and Grocery. “We have a warmer climate than elsewhere in the Northeast so the fruit ripens faster and can get to market and into the hands of consumers faster.”

That tradition has deepened its roots as heirloom varieties and new ones offer up bushels of options. The season may well be longer than you think too. “It starts in late August with Ginger Golds and goes into November with Granny Smiths” says Holly Brittain one of the owners of Rose Hill Farm and Ferments in Red Hook. When you hit farmers markets this fall or head to an orchard to pick your own peck try these native varieties:

August

GINGER GOLD Likely to be the first apple you taste since they ripen in late summer Ginger Golds are big bright yellow crisp and sweet. Ideal in salads or served sliced.

MCINTOSH Juicy tangy tender: The McIntosh is a favorite for good reason. Discovered by John McIntosh in 1811 they are typically red on one side and green on the other. Use any which way!

PAULA RED If there was a popularity contest for apples the Paula Red might win. It was found in Michigan in the late 1900s where the farmer responsible named it after his wife. Pro tip: this tart juicy variety sells out quickly.

September

CORTLAND This cross between McIntosh and Ben Davis apples debuted in 1898 and was named after its birthplace Cortland County. Semi-sweet juicy and delicious this multi-tasker is great cooked up in applesauce and apple pies as a salad ingredient—or simply sliced.

CRIMSON CRISP This exceptional apple described as having hints of melon orange and spice is the brainchild of the Perdue Rutgers and the University of Illinois cooperative plant breeding program. It’s a delightful snack.

EMPIRE Named after its home state the Empire was created by Cornell University in 1966 and it marries the sweetness of a Red Delicious with the tang of a McIntosh. Great for any use you can think of.

ESOPUS SPITZENBURG These date back to pre-Revolutionary times and were supposedly Thomas Jefferson’s favorite. Fishkill Farms says some of their trees came from Jefferson’s Monticello estate! This crisp sweet-tart apple can be eaten out of hand or if you’re game to try making cider this one’s perfect.

GALA Red-gold beauties developed in New Zealand that are a favorite with kids.

GOLDEN DELICIOUS This yellow-skinned apple is actually not the first cousin of the Red Delicious. It’s a honey-sweet fruit that’s great for making apple sauce or enjoyed on its own.

HONEYCRISP Available in early September Honeycrisp apples were produced from a crossbreeding program of Macoun and Honeygold apples in the 1960s to develop winter hardy cultivars with high fruit quality. Honeycrisps tend to be sweet-tart and juicy.

IDA RED This firm tart apple is prized for everything from charcuterie boards to baking into breads and pies. What’s in a name? It was developed in Idaho and you can guess what color it is.

JONATHAN An oldie but goodie: The thin-skinned sweet-tart crisp Jonathan is a classic American heirloom apple. Legend has it that it was discovered in the early 1800s by one Jonathan Zander. (When you have a Jonagold or Jonamac you know that a Jonathan is somewhere in its lineage.) Good for snacks and cooking.

RED DELICIOUS A seedling discovered in Iowa in 1875 led to the classic Red Delicious which sadly has lost some of its charm in commercial production. See how good a snack this can be when you pick one fresh.

SHIZUKA Look out Honeycrisps: Shizukas are giving you some competition. These big golden apples which hail from Japan enjoy universal love for their sweet taste.

STAYMAN WINESAPS An heirloom variety that apple cognoscenti adore the Stayman Winesap originated in Kansas in 1866. As the name hints they have an almost wine-like flavor and dense juicy flesh. Try them sliced on a cheeseboard.

SWEETANGO Another bit of agricultural magic the SweeTango descends from the Honeycrisp and inherited the “little bit sweet little bit tart” genes and super-crisp texture.

BALDWIN Considering its vibrant red and green coloring and tart flavor it’s no wonder the Baldwin was one of the most popular apples from 1850 until WWI. Today it’s beloved for baking and eating fresh—and how well it keeps.

BRAEBURN The Braeburn is no New York local—it was first cultivated at Braeburn Orchard in New Zealand in the 1950s. With its generous size red- and yellow-streaked skin tangy taste and flesh that doesn’t release too much moisture when baked Braeburns are prized for baking.

EVERCRISP Another creation of agricultural research the Evercrisp is a bit of an “ugly duckling apple” says Tenley Fitzgerald VP of Marketing at Yes! Apples which partners with 50+ New York apple-growers to promote and sell their fruit. “Get past the way it looks and it eats so well!”

FUJI Sweet hard and crisp Fujis are a Japanese apple with roots in the U.S. dating back to the mid-1900s. Perfect as a snack.

GOLDEN RUSSET Firm flesh with a tart (some say pineapple-y) taste this Russet—meaning rough-skinned versus smooth red perfection—causes some to shun it but it’s delicious for out of hand eating and it’s a cider-making staple.

NORTHERN SPY This jumbo apple dates to the early 1800s and was named after a character in the dime-store novel The Northern Spy. Tart and firm with a slightly pear-like flavor heed the saying “When baking a pie use a spy.”

ROME Found in Rome (Ohio not Italy) in 1816 these tart apples hold their shape and tang well making them A+ for sautéing and serving with porkchops or tucking them into a grilled cheese.

GRANNY SMITH You may think of this Jolly Rancher-green fruit as being crazy-tart but “the acidity mellows when fully tree-ripened to create a balanced flavor” says Brittain. This crisp apple is ideal for cooking and eating on its own.

Stop by September’s Catskill Conductors Clambake where Sullivan County business owners are reviving a centuries-old tradition.

Save September 10 for one heckuva good time in Livingston Manor. The owners of barbecue hotspot The Smoke Joint are hosting the 2nd Annual Catskills Conductors Clambake—and the menu is so good you’ll be planning a visit back for 2023’s Labor Day Weekend.

What is a Conductors Clambake you ask? The celebration dates to the turn of the century when the Valley played a pivotal role in supplying dairy products to New York City. Transporting dairy by train was big business. The conductors of the O&W railroad decided to show their gratitude by throwing an annual clambake for farmers—charging 75 cents in 1905 for all you can eat.

The Smoke Joint team (Ben Grossman Jennifer Grossman and Craig Samuel) decided to revive the celebration last summer—and boy it was a major success. “The Clambake represents an acknowledgment of our historic roots an appreciation of our current blessings and a faith in a future that is better and brighter because of what we can do together” says Jennifer Grossman.

This year they anticipate thousands of visitors at the Clambake held on historic old airport grounds on Little Beaverkill Creek. “We’re serving all New York-sourced items” says Samuel. “Long Island Little Neck clams with local potatoes and sweet corn.” There will be shrimp too. You can also dig into their signature BBQ plus craft cocktails.

There will be live music as well as artisans and vendors selling craft brews baked goods jewelry toys and more.

Join the fun on Saturday September 10 12–7 p.m. 431 Old Route 17 Livingston Manor; on-site parking is available. Entry fee: $2.

She was 91.

The veteran R&B singer passed away at her home in Los Angeles on Thursday (Aug. 25) her nephew Kevin John told The Detroit News. A cause of death had not been revealed at press time.

More from Billboard

“We loved her and she was a kind person” Kevin John said of his aunt who was the older sister of R&B star Little Willie John.

In addition to being the first solo female artist signed to Motown (then Tamla) Mable John also recorded hit songs for Stax Records and she was a singer in Ray Charles’ Raelettes backing band.

John was born on Nov. 3 1930 in Bastrop Louisiana. The oldest of nine children she and her family lived in the South before moving to Detroit in the early 1940s. As a teenager John took a job with the Friendship Mutual Insurance Company founded by Bertha Gordy the mother of then-aspiring music producer Berry Gordy.

“He became my vocal coach my manager and within a couple of years my record producer” John recalled to author Susan Whithall according to Motown Classic’s website.

Gordy later arranged John’s professional musical debut at Detroit’s Flame Show Bar where she opened for Billie Holiday in 1959. John became the first solo female act to sign with Gordy’s Tamla Records in 1958. The label became Motown two years later.

During her stint with the legendary music company John recorded blues songs including “Who Wouldn’t Love A Man Like That” “Actions Speak Louder Than Words” “No Love” “Looking for a Man” and “Take Me” with background harmonies by The Temptations.

John left Motown in the mid 1960s to join Stax Records in Memphis where she teamed up with with the songwriting team of Isaac Hayes and David Porter for her 1966 hit “Your Good Thing (Is About to End)” which reached No. 6 on Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs and No. 95 on the Billboard Hot 100. The popular song was later recorded by Lou Rawls Etta James Bonnie Raitt and others.

After releasing a handful of singles on Stax John departed the label to became the musical director and a singer in Ray Charles’ Raelettes backing band where she collaborated on dozens of songs during her decade-long stay.

John eventually left the music business and became a minister founding Los Angeles’ Joy Community Outreach which assists with feeding and clothing the homeless. She made her onscreen debut as a veteran blues singer in John Sayles’ 2007 film Honeydripper and was featured in the Oscar-winning documentary 20 Feet From Stardom.

According to zero-waste minimalist Kennedy practicing sustainable living doesn’t mean depriving yourself. It just requires a little creativity! In this episode of In The Know: Extreme Minimalists Kennedy shares how she became an eco-minimalist who produces almost zero waste.

Kennedy was inspired to become a zero-waste minimalist while traveling the globe in 2018. “I ended up in a couple different underdeveloped countries and literally moments after getting off the plane you cannot breathe and you just see heaps and heaps of trash” she tells In The Know. “And this was not just any trash. This trash looked very familiar to me. Brands that I’ve used in my own life. When I saw that I had this wake-up moment.”

Kennedy immediately began thinking about ways to reduce the amount of waste she produced. “Basically I just came up with ‘Well if I don’t buy anything I don’t have to throw anything away’” she recalls.

Nowadays Kennedy practices her zero-waste lifestyle by being careful about what she purchases. “So my goal when I go to the grocery store is to bring home a very minimal amount of packaging” she explains. “So I head straight to the bulk section to get all my dried pantry goods.”

Before purchasing anything Kennedy thinks about whether it is something she truly needs and whether it can be reused or recycled. “I do not buy anything new ever unless it’s absolutely necessary” she explains. “And then when I do need to buy something that’s new I always make sure it’s biodegradable or compostable and it won’t end up in a trash can.”

Kennedy also runs a shop from her home selling a variety of eco-friendly products including toothbrushes and soaps. “If you were to order something from my shop it always comes in a compostable box” she says. “Our packing peanuts unlike other companies are not made from plastic they’re actually made from corn starch so they’re 100% edible. It reminds me of a Cheeto puff without the cheese.”

Kennedy has a few simple tips for anyone considering a zero-waste lifestyle. “What I encourage people to do is of course one no impulse buy” she says. “Two when you do need to buy something look for the sustainable alternative and you’ll find them. They exist. No product no corporation no company has any sort of hold on my happiness.”

On the cancer prevention side Dr. Klosky focuses on developing and testing interventions designed to promote human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination among children who are cancer survivors. For example he currently has a U01 (HPV PROTECT) which allows him to conduct multi-site trials that examine the effect of medical provider counseling vaccine recommendation and collaborative planning for vaccine initiation and whether this helps increase rates of HPV vaccination. As a clinical health psychologist Dr. Klosky wants to know the cognitive and emotional drivers of vaccine uptake and other cancer prevention/promoting behaviors as a means of helping cancer survivors remain cancer free in the future. He recently finished a phase two trial which examined the immunogenicity and the safety/tolerability of the HPV vaccine in survivors of childhood cancer and learned that the HPV vaccine generally behaves in the same way in childhood cancer survivors as compared to the general childhood population in the U.S. who has never had cancer.

When describing the rationale behind HPV PROTECT Dr. Klosky notes a common misconception where oncologists think the primary care doctors are managing the HPV vaccine series in their survivor patients and vice versa. Should HPV PROTECT work he can scale it up and have oncologists weave this intervention approach into their practice and get kids protected earlier. Dr. Klosky says survivors of child cancer are at a higher risk for experiencing HPV-related complications post infection (including second cancers) potentially due to immune compromise which may occur secondary to cancer treatment. Dr. Klosky hopes to figure out why parents of survivors are less likely to initiate the HPV vaccine for their children and then develop/test interventions to address this health need.

On the cancer control side Dr. Klosky studies fertility preservation. In childhood cancer survivors about 50% of males and 20% of females are at risk for infertility. Do cancer patients want to preserve the ability to be a biological parent in the future? Dr. Klosky and his team study familial decision-making and predictors of fertility preservation among children and adolescents newly diagnosed with cancer. He frequently considers psychological and socio-environmental factors in this process and their role in why adolescents do/do not decide to pursue fertility preservation. Butter understanding these factors is particularly important as survivors consistently rank parenthood in their top three life goals as cancer survivors.

Dr. Klosky became passionate about psycho-oncology as a kid in Memphis because he was neighbors with an oncologist and heard stories about the children and families he treated. He says he knew he wanted to be a scientist-practitioner and that pediatric psychology has both the clinical and research features that provide an ideal career balance for him. He says hearing stories of families on treatment or end of life had a significant impact on him and he continues to be inspired by the courage of the patients and families he treats.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNpLmNvbS9jb2xsZWdlL2FsYWJhbWEvYmFtYWNlbnRyYWwvd2h5LWFsYWJhbWEtYmFjay1ob3N0aW5nLXNlYXNvbi1vcGVuZXJzLWFsbC10aGluZ3MtY3fSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Why Alabama is Back Hosting Season Openers: All Things CW,"It'll probably be a long time before the Crimson Tide plays another neutral-site opener and what oddsmakers say about Alabama players.

The last time the University of Alabama football team opened a season at Bryant-Denny Stadium there were four main story lines heading into the game.

1) Junior-college transfer Duron Carter was cleared academically and the wide receiver was finally on the Crimson Tide roster (of course he never played a game for Alabama).

2) Nick Saban had yet to announce a starter between sophomore AJ McCarron and redshirt freshman Phillip Sims saying “It’s out of fairness to them that both guys get an opportunity in this game.” (McCarron end up being a three-year starter).

3) Barrett Jones moved to left tackle but would play in three different spots during the opener (he won the Outland Trophy at left tackle and a year later he moved to center and won the Rimington Trophy).

4) It was Alabama's first game after the April 27th tornado.

There were remembrances a moment of silence thank you ovations for emergency rescue workers and ribbons strategically placed on helmets and on the field at Bryant-Denny Stadium.

The Crimson Tide subsequently dismembered Saban's alma mater Kent State 48-7.

The tornado recovery was obviously the most important thing that day but it was also a transition point in Alabama's scheduling approach. Three years previous the No. 24 Crimson Tide had opened the 2008 season with an impressive win against No. 9 Clemson 34-10 in the 2008 Chick-fil-A Kickoff Classic.

The game had huge ramifications and even ended up on the cover of Sports Illustrated.

Among them:

• It signaled to college football that a new era had arrived with Saban at Alabama.

• It launched the Crimson Tide's undefeated regular season a run that carried through the 2009 national championship and sparked a dynasty that's still going with additional titles in 2011 2012 2015 2017 and 2020.

• It marked the beginning of the end for Tommy Bowden at Clemson which would promote Dabo Swinney mid-season.

• Finally high-profile neutral-site games we suddenly in vogue and everyone wanted Alabama.

It made sense and was like adding a bowl game on the front end of the schedule played in NFL stadiums or in settings where championship games are hosted. A marquee opponent could be used as offseason motivation for the players plus it always looked good to recruits.

Saban used it to his full advantage.

Overall he's 15-0 in season openers at Alabama. The Crimson Tide has outscored its opponents 610-176 in those games and outgained the opposition 6658-3273.

That's an average score of 40.67-11.7 and yards differential of 443.9-218.2.

Just one opponent managing to be within two touchdowns (West Virginia in 2014).

2021 Miami at Atlanta W 44-13 5

But things have changed and Alabama has gone back in the other direction of signing high-profile home-and-home series with the biggest programs  often for Week 1 or 2

The lineup includes Texas this year and next Wisconsin (2024 and 2025) Florida State (2025 and 2026) West Virginia (2026 and 2027) Notre Dame (2028 and 2029) Georgia Tech (2030 and 2031) Virginia Tech (2034 and 2035) and Arizona (2032 and 2033). It also signed Oklahoma but it and Texas are getting ready to join the SEC.

Part of the change was to appease the fan base which coveted more high-profile home games. Too often the Bryant-Denny schedule was a couple of strong SEC games a couple of league games that weren't expected to be close and three non-conference games that didn't excite anyone.

While the facility was given a $107.17 million update that was completed before the revamped 2020 season began and is still slated for yet another renovation as part of the third and final phase of the Crimson Standard (10-year $600 million initiative) maximizing those opportunities became a priority.

Financially the neutral-site games weren't as appealing either. Granted the payout grew from the $4.17 million combined that Alabama and Clemson got in 2008 to the $6 million the Crimson Tide landed eight years later to face USC in Arlington Texas. It crushed the Trojans 52-6 but a good part of the rewards were offset by traveling costs and logistics.

Finally the matchups were becoming increasingly difficult as interest from other programs waned. In 2019 the Chick-fil-A Bowl scheduled Alabama against Duke and the outcome was a predictable rout.

So no more neutral-site openers for Alabama at least not for a while.

Consequently the biggest indicator of how things have changed since that Kent State game is with this statistic for next week's home opener. Alabama is paying $1.91 million to Utah State the third-highest total for a visiting team in NCAA history.

• Alabama athletic director Greg Byrne told WVTM 13 that the athletic department is hiring four licensed social workers to support student-athlete mental health. “Our biggest issue [since COVID] has been mental health issues with our student-athletes. The isolation the challenges that came along with that were significant and we’re still dealing with that today.”

• Deion Sanders and Saban are back on good terms and they recently shot another Aflac ad to raise money for their favorite respective causes. When Sanders was asked about Saban's latest contract during SportsCenter he said: “Coach Saban is our magna cum laude [of coaching]. He is our guy. You would not have questioned Michael Jordan and you don't question LeBron [James] when they are given a contract of this status.

“Every opportunity I get to sit with him on this wonderful Aflac set I'm gleaning from him just some of the fruit and nuggets he's able to spit to me. I’m happy. Well deserved. … I wish I wouldn’t catch anyone saying anything about the contract Saban has warranted. He is the G.O.A.T.”

• Eddie Jackson is a player to watch this season. Under coach Matt Eberflus and coordinator Alan Williams the Bears made him more of a free safety again after drafting Penn State safety Jaquan Brisker in the second round and moving Jackson back off the line of scrimmage. The Bears hope he'll be more like the player in 2018 who had seven takeaways. Chicago lead the league that year with 36 but had 19 in 2019 (22nd) 18 in 2020 (25th) and 16 last season (26th).

• Tua Tagovailoa and Jalen Hurts were extensively asked about each other this week as the Dolphins and Eagles held joint practices prior to their preseason finale on Saturday.

“Dude’s a hard worker” Tagovailoa said on Hurts. “In the weight room in the classroom on the field like dude had to be the first into the weight room had to be the first out onto the field.”

He added: “It really tells you how he goes about his life. It tells you about how he kind of sees things how he looks at things. Obviously he’s a competitor. Never wants to be less.”

As for Hurts ...

• If you were wondering how former Alabama walk-on Keelan Cox fared during his first game with Wyoming he unfortunately didn't play during the 38-6 loss to Illinois. The defensive end who was moving up the depth chart is out for the season after suffering a fractured right hip in practice similar to the injury Tagovailoa suffered.

5 Things That Got Our Attention This Week

1) Out of the Ordinary?

If Bryce Young has a subpar year Alabama fans may be quick to blame Dr. Pepper’s Fansville ad campaign. Last year was the first time it included an active player as Clemson quarterback DJ Uiagalelei signed an NIL deal. Obviously it didn't go so well which has to make one wonder if Young stumbles if a new ad campaign may be ""Just What The Dr. Ordered.""

2) The next level in NIL?

The Los Angeles Times reported that football powerhouse St. John Bosco announced that the entire team can participate in an NIL deal with KONGIQ Sports Performance and is believed to be the first high school team-wide agreement in history.

Dan Wolken of USA Today suggested it could “open the floodgates to something much bigger” and he's probably correct.

Here's the question here: What happens when sponsors get involved and start trying to steer prospects to college football programs they do business with?

3) Still making up the deficit

Minnesota's director of athletics Mark Coyle reminded everyone of something regarding the Big Ten media rights agreement:

""During the pandemic we finished with a loan of about $21.5 million that we still have to pay back. I think people have forgotten about that. That's why this media deal is a big part of our program as we move forward. ... Obviously we knew this new media deal would be coming and that it was going to have an impact on our program. But there are things we have to take care of in-house as we look at that media deal and how it will help us compete in the best conference in the America.""

Meanwhile the pandemic is still ongoing. Even at Alabama the number of covid cases has sharply been on the rise since students returned to campus.

4) Missouri with the blues

Missouri athletic director Desiree Reed-Francois said that the department was understaffed by about 30 percent when she arrived in Columbia in 2021 and morale was low.

“Change can be challenging to a team that was already doing two jobs per person"" she told the St. Louis Post-Dispatch. ""And then all of a sudden you have change in leadership. That’s challenging. You have a pandemic. That’s challenging. So I wanted to make sure I listened. But we have clear-cut expectations. We gave folks opportunities but in the end we have to do what’s right for Mizzou. And we have to build a high-performing culture.”

She noted that as of last week Mizzou was 84 percent fully staffed to its pre-pandemic numbers.

5) Mo' money

Remember the recent $450 million expansion of Kyle Field which bumped capacity up to 102500?

Texas A&M is at it again and announced 23 new south side suites at the stadium which come with their own level in the south end zone private access up and down the elevators and an operable glass wall to open up the suite towards the field.

The suites will be ready in time for the first game of the 2023 season.

Rule changes

A quick reminder on some of the changes made for the 2022 season:

Targeting Carryover Appeal: In games that have instant replay when a targeting foul occurs in the second half the carryover penalty (of sitting out the first half of that player's next game) will be eligible for further appeal.

Deceptive Injury Timeout: Schools and conferences will be able to report questionable scenarios to the national coordinator of officials who will review and provide feedback. However any penalties levied would be up to the conference office or school involved.

Blocking Below the Waist: It may only be done by linemen and stationary backs inside the tackle box.

Sliding: If a ball carrier simulates a feet-first slide the runner is to be declared down at that spot.

Defensive holding: It will still be a 10-yard penalty but with an automatic first down.

Did you Notice?

• Tennessee athletic director Danny White congratulated Allen Greene on getting out of Auburn. ""Congratulations @AGreeneIV for getting the heck out of a crazy situation for greener pastures! I admire how you managed that chaos with class & integrity” White wrote on Twitter. “Look forward to seeing your next chapter!” Greene was hired by Auburn from Buffalo in Jan. 2018.

• SI’s Preseason College Football All-Americans

• Saturday's Week 0 matchups included one that was of special interest to us former SI/FanNation analyst Jim Mora Jr. making his debut with UConn against Utah State. The Huskies had a 14-point lead after the first quarter but starting quarterback Ta’Quan Roberson went down with a knee injury and they eventually took a 31-20 loss.

We say congratulations to Mora anyway for successfully getting back to his first love in football coaching and to Utah State we'll see you next week at Bryant-Denny Stadium.

• Finally it only seems appropriate to acknowledge the passing of Hall of Fame quarterback Len Dawson this week. Years ago when I was just starting out as a sports journalist I had the chance to meet and interview Len about his fight with prostate cancer. He was one of the most personable and friendly sports personalities that I ever met and will be missed.

Ed Uehling’s parents hosted out-of-town guests for many years before Airbnb came into existence.

But it doesn’t look as if he’ll be able to follow in his parents’ footsteps thanks to new rules being implemented by the county.

Uehling’s parents first began lodging visitors in the early 1950s when there were fewer hotel rooms compared to the thousands along the Strip. Today Uehling is a landlord who depends on short-term rentals that fetch a rate of around $220 a night. He fears without a short-term rental income he’ll need to raise the rent of tenants at his other units to make ends meet.

Property owners seeking to generate income through short-term rentals are fighting the state and Clark County to be allowed to rent their properties through popular online vacation rental companies like Airbnb and Vrbo.

It appears to be an uphill battle.

The Greater Las Vegas Short-Term Rental Association filed a lawsuit on Aug. 2 against the state for the legislature’s 2021 passage of Assembly Bill 363 authorizing the regulation of short-term rentals as well as against Clark County which is starting the process of licensing a limited number of homes intended for rental next month.

AB363 reversed a ban on short-term rentals in unincorporated Clark County but set parameters on their placement. Rentals were already legal within the city limits of Las Vegas Henderson and North Las Vegas.

The 1200-member GLVSTRA headed by association co-founder Jacqueline Flores contends the state law and ordinances regulating rentals are unconstitutional because they overstep homeowners’ property rights.

“Clark County has the most restrictive STR ordinance in the nation” Flores said in an interview.

“The lawsuit we filed was our last alternative because state and local officials just went too far to the point where their regulations require these homeowners to give up some of their Nevada and U.S. constitutional protections in order to be allowed to operate. And the regulations include some of the highest fines and punishments of up to $10000 and jail time for simply renting for less than 31 (consecutive) days” she said.

Lucrative endeavor

Guests pay an average of $223.68 a night to stay at an Airbnb here according to a study released earlier this month by London-based online retailer Inkifi. The company contends those are the highest rental rates in the world.

Eight of the world’s most expensive cities for Airbnb rentals are in the United States and by comparison the average daily rate for hotels on the Strip and in downtown Las Vegas was $162.60 a night for the first seven months of 2022.

The Inkifi study says there are 11336 Airbnb rentals available in Southern Nevada.

Flores says that’s about right — but she disputes that Las Vegas Airbnb rentals are the most expensive citing a study earlier this year by real estate data firm Mashvisor.

Mashvisor reported the leading Airbnb rental rates are in Malibu California at $895 a night. Las Vegas rates don’t even make the nation’s top 50 with its rates.

Regardless Flores says homeowners in Southern Nevada should have the ability to rent their homes and rooms especially as inflation squeezes the local economy.

Because homeowners work to keep their properties in top shape she said they create jobs for maids handymen plumbers landscapers and contractors.

Restrictions go too far

Flores said the association is not opposed to regulation or the taxes and fees that would be applied to licensed rentals. But members say county regulations go too far and are designed to minimize the number of available rentals. By Flores’ calculations about 80 percent of homeowners who use their properties for commercial lodging would be put out of business under the county’s rules.

Some of the restrictions include:

■ The total number of rentals can’t exceed 1 percent of the housing inventory.

■ Once a pool of eligible prospective licensees is established during a six-month period that would begin Sept. 13 a lottery conducted by a third party would occur to see which homeowners would get short-term rental licenses.

■ Short-term rentals cannot be within 1000 feet of each other.

■ They also can’t be within 2500 feet nearly a half mile of a resort property or land designated for a resort.

This last restriction means homeowners like Uehling would be forbidden from having a license because his property is within 2500 feet of Virgin Hotels Las Vegas.

Fingers pointed at resorts

Most short-term rental owners are laying the blame on the resort industry.

“The (Clark County) Commission is anti-small business and anti-entrepreneurs and the hotels get to dictate what we can do” Uehling said. “It just shows how the industry is ripping us off.”

Uehling said his short-term rentals are ideal for youth athletic teams who come to Las Vegas for tournaments because players can stay under one roof prepare their own food and not loiter around the Strip.

It also serves families waiting for their new homes to be built and those displaced by disasters like fires and flooding.

County officials say they’re only enforcing mandates established by state law. They say the purpose of enforcing their rules is to prevent noise trash and an overabundance of vehicular traffic in residential neighborhoods. They say they receive hundreds of complaints from residents who say those staying in nearby rentals are too rowdy.

Portland Oregon-based Airbnb last year imposed its own ban on parties in the state threatening to remove violators from its website.

“In advance of Memorial Day Weekend we want to make clear that those violating Airbnb’s rules in Las Vegas or throughout Nevada risk suspensions or bans from our platform and even potentially legal action” Airbnb spokeswoman Ruthie Wabula wrote at the time.

Representatives of the Nevada Resorts Association were reluctant to comment on this story because of the litigation brought by the GLVSTRA against the state and county.

But a Resorts Association spokeswoman said “The association didn’t engage on the (county) ordinance since it complied with state law.”

GLVSTRA’s Flores said the Resorts Association lobbied for the passage of AB363 through the bill’s architect Assemblywoman Rochelle Nguyen D-Las Vegas.

“Assemblywoman Nguyen gave the resort hotel lobbyist front-and-center access to speak freely and without any time restrictions in front of the Assembly Revenue Committee where the lobbyist spoke against (short-term rentals) and demanded strict regulations for us” Flores said. “That was the most shocking thing that happened. I think if the lobbyist hadn’t done her speech through videoconferencing and would have instead shown up in person they would have rolled out a red carpet for her.”

Nguyen did not return a request for comment.

Another hiccup

Las Vegas resident Johnny Dortch also a member of GLVSTRA has a different obstacle in his bid to be licensed.

Dortch said the county is requiring him to tie into county-maintained sewer lines except his house on an acre near Las Vegas Boulevard South and Chartan Avenue five minutes south of the South Point has its own well to provide water and its own septic system to manage sewage.

The nearest county sewer line is 840 feet from his home. With installation costs of $250 to $300 per linear foot tying into the sewer system would cost him $210000 to $252000 just for the materials. He believes other expenses could put the bill as high as $280000.

“This isn’t sensible regulation it’s protectionism” Dortch said of the county’s rules. “They only care about ensuring the least amount of homeowners get licensed.”

Dortch and Uehling were among the association members who kicked in $5000 to fund the legal challenge against the state and county.

Dortch said he’s counting on the lawsuit to be successful.

He accused the county of “gaslighting” the community — saying short-term rental problems are worse than they are. He promised a campaign of “controlled chaos” with the county if the lawsuit doesn’t go his way.

“We are not going to take this lying down and I hope the county knows this” Dortch said. “There are a lot of homeowners that are not going to play this game with them. And if they think that because we’re going into their courts … that that’s going to stop us from being able to run our business with their illegal regulation they have another thing coming.”

The Little Rock Board of Directors on Sept. 6 will review a draft ordinance on short-term rental properties requiring owners to apply for a special use permit and agree to a yearly safety inspection before leasing their homes.

Short-term rentals homes which property owners rent out to vacation-goers or visitors have been a recent debate for cities across the state. While some people believe these properties are the future of short-term lodging those opposed argue that they can disrupt neighborhoods and raise safety concerns.

Jamie Collins the city of Little Rock director of planning and development said the city hasn't implemented a short-term rental policy in the past. While Little Rock already regulates bed-and-breakfasts this is the first time it's addressed online marketplaces like Airbnb and Vrbo he said.

Planning Commission Member Robby Vogel said Little Rock has ""monitored"" the issue since online short-term rentals first became popular.

Founded in 1995 Vrbo now has more than 2 million homes available for short-term rental. Airbnb entered the market in 2008 and has since grown to reach 6 million listings worldwide.

The city's Planning Committee first began drafting an ordinance on short term rentals in 2019 but the pandemic interrupted the process Vogel said.

[SHORT-TERM RENTALS: Read the proposed ordinance » arkansasonline.com/828rentals/]

This year the new group members including Vogel resumed the work.

During three community meetingsVogel said the group heard from property-owning residents who were willing to follow the rules for short-term rentals but felt the guidelines weren't clear.

Vogel said the draft ordinance aims to be both simple and comprehensive.

""The biggest thing I heard was 'Let's make this simple'"" Vogel said. ""'Let's not make it so hard that the average person is dissuaded from going through the proper steps to register their dwelling as a short-term rental.'""

To conform to current standards short-term rental property owners in Little Rock must apply for either of two designations Vogel said. If an applicant lives on the property and will rent it out on a less than monthly basis the applicant must file for a bed-and-breakfast designation. If not living on the property the applicant must seek a planned development commercial designation with a variance he said.

If passed all short-term rental property owners will seek a special use permit regardless of whether they live on the property. New applicants for a special use permit must be approved by the Planning Commission and the Board of Directors according to Vogel.

The draft ordinance also allows current short-term rental property owners six months to have their residences inspected and converted to the special use designation Vogel said.

""The city wants people to be compliant and licensed and know what's going on and have communication with the owner of the property."" Vogel said. ""So if there is an issue the city knows who to get a hold of and can track and measure if this property is becoming an issue.""

Hillcrest resident and neighborhood association vice president Toni Johnson said she believes short-term rentals can be a ""really good thing for Hillcrest.""

While she said she can't speak for the residents' association altogether Johnson told the Democrat-Gazette that short-term rental guests are ""looking to experience the immediate community"" and walk to the neighborhood's businesses and restaurants.

In a historic neighborhood like Hillcrest many homes have outbuildings which are separate from the home but still on the property. She said from a historic preservation standpoint she's happy to see the outbuildings being renovated because they're often underutilized and not cared for properly.

Johnson said she believes residents will put money into their outbuildings when they know they can make income.

In addition Johnson said these property owners are aware of ""what's going on in their backyards"" which settles any concerns that Airbnb and Vrbo allow their hosts to become absentee landlords.

""When someone is not around"" Johnson said. ""That's when [short-term rentals] become nuisance properties.""

Johnson said she only had one reservation with the draft ordinance. She said she's not sure how city employees will be able to inspect every property.

Guests already review short-term rentals online after their stays Johnson said which she described as a ""self-review"" process. Because future guests won't choose to stay at the lowest-rated homes Johnson said she sees the short-term rentals as taking care of themselves.

She said the city could instead focus its budget on yearly reviews for the long-term rental properties in the neighborhood which she said don't have any code enforcement.

Vogel said he's writing to the Board of Directors to ask that the funds raised from the application process be used to pay for an employee to inspect each property.

However he also said he cannot speak to the long-term rentals mentioned by Johnson.

""Since the applicants for short term rentals will be seeking a business license and remitting taxes the [Little Rock] planning department is the logical department to take on the inspection duties"" Vogel said. ""It should in my opinion be given staff to help assist with the process.""

Ruth Bell a member of the Pulaski County League of Women Voters said her organization supports most of the processes outlined in the draft ordinance. Their only addition would be a density limit meaning that new short-term rental properties wouldn't be approved within a certain distance from one another.

The concern comes from short-term rentals essentially being vacant properties when they're not in use Bell said. To preserve neighborhood integrity it's important to have a low number of vacant homes she said.

Overall though Bell said the League of Women Voters is happy to see the city looking to regulate short-term rentals.

""We think what they have proposed so far makes all the sense in the world"" Bell said. ""It's a way of life that's here to stay. I can't argue with that.""

After deliberating for about seven hours at the end of a weeklong trial jurors returned a guilty verdict in Chesterfield Circuit Court against John Harvey Howard 63 in the disappearance and murder of his then-girlfriend Linda Lunsford. She was a 38-year-old mother of five working at Walmart at the time.

A sentencing date was not set. Howard who had been released on bond before the trial was allowed to remain free pending sentencing. He has no prior criminal record has been compliant with his release conditions and will remain living with a daughter in Arizona until sentencing.

Howard’s conviction marks the third time in a little over six years that the Chesterfield Commonwealth’s Attorney’s Office has succeeded in prosecuting men for killing their girlfriends without bodies being found. The other cases were in 2016 and 2017.

The Howard case may have been more challenging due to the time that passed since the victim disappeared.

A no-body homicide case has two main hurdles: proving the victim is in fact deceased and proving the victim’s death was the result of a homicide. Examination of a body usually provides significant direct evidence of a crime.

In cases where no body is recovered there can be no autopsy no photographs of injuries or clothes among other things. Under those circumstances prosecutors must present a large amount of circumstantial evidence rather than the direct forensic evidence that jurors typically expect to see.

Chesterfield Commonwealth’s Attorney Stacey Davenport and defense attorney Greg Sheldon both declined to comment on the trial and its outcome citing a gag order barring them from commenting on the case until its conclusion. Chesterfield Circuit Judge Lynn Brice imposed the order in late March after concerns arose about pre-trial publicity stemming from a news release that Davenport issued about her trial preparations.

Aside from sentencing one potentially significant issue in the case that remains to be decided is a defense motion to strike the evidence in the case. Before the jury began its deliberations Howard’s attorney asked the judge to strike the prosecution’s evidence on grounds that it is insufficient as a matter of law to sustain a conviction.

Brice did not immediately make a ruling opting to take the motion under advisement. A hearing will be held on the matter.

Lunsford suddenly disappeared on Dec. 26 1996 after she and Howard finished their shifts at the Walmart just off Midlothian Turnpike in Chesterfield. Her Nissan Sentra was found in front of the Food Lion store in the Village Marketplace Shopping Center just west of Walmart. Lunsford and Howard had a contentious on-and-off relationship.

After years of investigation Howard was indicted May 17 2021 on a first-degree murder charge and arrested the following day with help of the U.S. Marshals’ Service Capital Area Fugitive Task Force. At the time of his arrest Howard was living in the 17500 block of Pouncey Tract Road in Hanover County. He was unemployed and had no assets to hire an attorney aside from a $186 retirement check he receives monthly.

In Chesterfield’s earlier no-body murder cases prosecutors convinced a jury in April 2016 that there was enough evidence to convict Michael Anthony Edwards — the former boyfriend of Altria executive Leyla Namiranian — of her death even though there was no direct forensic evidence tying him to the crime.

The victim’s journal which included entries on Namiranian’s relationship with Edwards — along with a wealth of other circumstantial evidence — proved sufficient for jurors to convict Edwards of second-degree murder in her April 2012 disappearance and death. He received a 30-year prison term.

Nineteen months later Dr. John E. Gibbs III a former Sheltering Arms physician who made no effort to find his longtime girlfriend after she disappeared on June 7 2014 was found guilty of her murder. An abundance of circumstantial evidence convinced jurors that Gibbs killed and hid the body of Zulma L. Pabon then 26 who was a nurse at Bon Secours St. Francis Hospital. He was sentenced to serve 50 years in prison.",,,,,,,,,

Amazon's purchases of One Medical and iRobot are worrying antitrust advocates and privacy experts.

Its business model is built on collecting data from customers and competition antitrust experts say.

A huge market share and ability to buy competitors make Amazon ""sort of unstoppable"" a data privacy expert told Insider.

Amazon's recent multi-billion dollar purchases of One Medical and iRobot have spurred concerns from legislators antitrust advocates and privacy experts but the company's sprawling business model — and reputation of surveilling consumers and competition alike — makes the company almost unstoppable. It's ""like the mythical Hydra where you cut off one head and two more grow in its place"" one data privacy expert told Insider.

Every step of the way from its beginnings as an alternative to brick and mortar bookstores to snatching up over half of the online retail market Amazon has relied on surveillance to dominate the competition according to Evan Greer director of the nonprofit advocacy group Fight for the Future.

""People tend to think of Amazon as an online marketplace but really Amazon is a surveillance company"" Greer told Insider. ""[E]very aspect of their profit is derived from their ability to amass and leverage data.""

Amazon's surveillance of its employees is well-documented from its ""time off task"" metric that measures productivity to monitoring its delivery drivers with AI cameras. Such strict standards that employees report being scared to take bathroom breaks lest they fall behind drivers and warehouse workers have reported.

Watching the competition — and you

Consumer data is especially valuable — a 2019 Forbes report indicated it's the most valuable to businesses — and Amazon makes extensive use of it.

Every click on the website whether you decide to purchase an item or not collects data on consumer behavior and tells the tech giant if you check reviews or price shop before completing a purchase and which ads you interact with in addition to details like your payment information and address.

""Amazon has all this data available"" Greer told The Guardian. ""They track what people are searching for what they click what they don't. Every time you're searching for something and don't click you're telling Amazon that there's a gap.""

The data Amazon has access to is not limited to its retail site. The tech giant can also collect information about what movies and television you watch on its Prime video platform what books you read or listen to with its ownership of GoodReads and Audible what podcasts you listen to through Wondery what games you play on Twitch your online browsing history through Eero wi-fi systems and even what groceries you buy through Whole Foods and Amazon Fresh locations.

Of the top 10 US industries by GDP (information manufacturing non-durable goods retail trade wholesale trade manufacturing durable goods healthcare finance and insurance state and local government professional and business services and real estate) The Guardian reported Amazon has a finger in all but real estate.

""This all works together because Amazon is trying as best they can to funnel information about its customers' lives about their spending habits about their eating habits sleeping habits their shopping habits"" Ron Knox a senior researcher and writer for the Institute for Local Self-Reliance — an anti-monopoly nonprofit that gives tech assistance to community businesses — told Insider. ""They're tracking all this data so that they can better sell us things. That's what Amazon wants to do that's what its monopoly is based on.""

The impact of surveillance capitalism

The companies and services Amazon owns have long prompted concerns about data privacy. For instance the Ring doorbell camera (acquired by Amazon for $1 billion in 2018) which records activity outside of consumers' homes partners with thousands of police departments. The company has shared recordings with law enforcement without warrants in some cases Politico reported.

The ever-listening Echo which acts as a personal home assistant and responds to voice commands allegedly collects data without users' consent to target ads. Its recordings can be used in court.







Recent purchases of One Medical and iRobot which creates Roomba robotic vacuums mean Amazon has information available about consumers' health care and will soon have the ability to map the inside of their homes. These purchases — totaling $5.6 billion in acquisitions within three weeks of each other — expand Amazon's reach into consumers' daily lives.

""It goes so far beyond what we typically think of when we talk about like surveillance capitalism like scary ads and algorithms etc"" Greer told Insider. ""We know they sell devices that record audio and video in and around our homes and offices and schools and hospitals and abortion clinics and therapists' offices. So the extent to which Amazon is conducting surveillance in almost all of its activities it's hard to overstate.""

Amazon declined Insider's request for an interview or to answer questions regarding data privacy concerns.

'They're absolute killers'

""Amazon it's sort of like the mythical Hydra where you cut off one head and two more grow in its place"" Greer said when asked what could be done to stop the company's sprawling growth.

The company uses data from its marketplace retailers and competitors to further add to its value currently estimated at $1357.19B.

""They are killers"" Jason Boyce the founder of Avenue 7 Media an agency that helps sellers maneuver the Amazon marketplace told Insider. ""They're absolute killers they have no conscience when it comes to going in and eating up as much market share as possible.""

With its massive warehouse infrastructure and ability to manufacture branded products Amazon has developed a strategy of undercutting small businesses' prices — creating Amazon-brand knockoffs of hot selling items offered by smaller retailers at a lower price — that has led to a widespread fear of ""death by Amazon.""

""The way that Amazon engages and kind of copy and kill self preferencing where they're basically leveraging their business place surveillance to edge out small businesses makes it impossible to compete with the products that they market on their own platforms"" Greer told Insider.

The legal case against Amazon

Along with data collection issues come antitrust concerns as Amazon buying up market share weakens consumer privacy protections.

Though Amazon has not been labeled as a monopoly by the Federal Trade Commission it does hold 56.7% of the market share for purchases made online and uses its massive mergers and acquisitions to maintain market dominance. When a company has a true monopoly it has no competitors and has the ability to raise prices indefinitely giving consumers no alternative and curbing innovation so new products aren't introduced to the market.

""The piece for people that's hard I think for people to understand is is the scale of monopoly power and abuse and that the harm of Amazon data collection is not just the added up individual harm of the surveillance of the ring cameras"" Greer said. ""It's the way is that all of those pieces then kind of coalesce into a company that is becoming sort of unstoppable and threatens to gobble up almost every traditional institution that we rely on — from web hosting to hospitals and the entire medical industry to books to the auto industry.""

Creating a ubiquitous business was part of the original plan founder Jeff Bezos set forth when creating the platform in 1994. Early Amazon employees were quoted in a 2012 Forrester report saying Bezos' ""underlying goals were not to build an online bookstore or an online retailer but rather a 'utility' that would become essential to commerce.""

Two tech antitrust bills — S. 2992 and S. 2710 which propose rules that would prohibit dominant digital platforms like Amazon from discriminating against competitors restrain self-preferencing business practices and ensure consumers have access to competitive app ecosystems — are currently making their way through Congress in part as a response to Amazon's growing market share.

Chalk up another failure in health care for Amazon one of the ultimate market disruptors. First its much-hyped effort with JPMorgan and Berkshire Hathaway to reform health care Haven ended its short life. Now Amazon Care its effort to tackle telemedicine and primary care for the employer market on a national basis – which Amazon itself trumpeted as gaining more and more clients – is being shut down.

Is that all the proof we needed of what many people have said over the years: health care is just harder to disrupt than most industries?

watch now

Maybe not though maybe it is a signal of a change in the approach to how Amazon will attempt to gobble up more health industry market share. The shutdown of Amazon Care may come back to a simple choice that companies especially those with a lot of cash have to make when it comes to breaking into new markets: build or buy? For some health-care industry watchers it's no surprise that Amazon Care is going away as a stand-alone entity. When Amazon made the decision in July to acquire primary care company One Medical  which does what Amazon Care was hoping to ultimately do on a national basis it was the writing on the wall that something was going to change. And for a cash-rich company looking for opportunities to buy into a stock market that had pushed down the value of recently public health companies – One Medical had traded as high as $58 in 2021 and Amazon announced plans to buy it for $18 a share – Amazon may have been more opportunistic than anything else in plotting the next stage of its future in health. Buying into a market where it wants more share and where it requires a physical presence isn't new to Amazon nor is being opportunistic in the timing. As Amazon's acquisition of Whole Foods reaches the five-year mark it's worth remembering that Amazon's shares went up in value as much on the day it announced the acquisition of Whole Foods as the purchase price for the then-troubled high-end grocer. ""It's not surprising they're shutting it down"" said Sari Kaganoff general manager of consulting at Rock Health which invests as a VC in health start-ups and has a health advisory and research arm. ""Their vision always was to have a primary care integrated solution and now it will have a better solution than what they could build"" Kaganoff said.

It was a little surprising maybe that Amazon announced the shutdown before the One Medical deal even closed but One Medical has many more markets many more offices and many more companies that are clients than Amazon ever did (it had to boast about signing up Whole Foods which it owns as a client for Amazon Care). Maybe also surprising: it didn't wait to rebrand One Medical as part of Amazon Care. PillPack its acquisition in the pharmacy space still has a brand but is now folded within Amazon Pharmacy. By Amazon's own account Amazon Care was a failure at least in the terms conveyed in the internal memo provided to the press about the shuttering. There's no doubt it struggled with the problem of building up an in-person care component nationwide staffing up in a sector where it has limited history and getting corporate customers to sign on. While telemedicine is a nice have it's not a full health-care solution and Amazon would have had to ramp up investment considerably to build a true national hybrid health-care practice with sites and physicians and clinics. In the end let's say Amazon Care was a test run for a business and once Amazon learned enough to know what it wanted in the long-term it bought the better company at a time when its value was depressed. ""I don't think they failed because One Medical is great"" Kaganoff said. Amazon learned a lesson that has influenced the fortunes of many health disruptors in recent years: it's hard to make a stand-alone startup work in the sector — even if you're one of the richest companies in the world — consolidation is increasingly the way to go. ""Amazon Care was no different than any other stand-alone health startup in terms of needing to be consolidated"" Kaganoff said. ""They played around with it a bit"" she added enough to know their ambitions remain validated on the market but just not the way there. ""One of the ways we've worked towards this vision for the past several years has been with our urgent and primary care service offering Amazon Care. During that time we've gathered and listened to extensive feedback from our enterprise customers and their employees and evolved the service to continuously improve the experience for customers. However despite these efforts we've determined that Amazon Care isn't the right long-term solution for our enterprise customers"" the internal memo said. While Amazon's health-care efforts in recent years have been associated with direct battles to unseat recent health disruptors (e.g. Amazon Care vs. Teladoc ) Wall Street analysts have said the market should worry more about Amazon making a string of acquisitions that speak to broader aims. That's what seems to be happening. Amazon isn't done yet pushing its cash around in buying more in health-care with recent headlines reporting it is among bidders for Signify Health  which has an overlap with the Iora Health business of One Medical focused on a more complicated Medicare-centric market than standard national care practices.

It's clear Amazon still plans to be a formidable player in the health-care space. It can leverage its ability to personalize its offerings connect to its pharmacy and ultimately pose a threat to many other retail giants aiming to upend healthcare. Walmart acquired telehealth company MeMD in 2021; CVS  which already offers telemedicine through a deal with American Well  is another rumored bidder for Signify; and Walgreens has VillageMD and is opening up hundreds of offices in markets around the country. That retail disruption is only going to grow for a bottom-line reason. When you look at the share of wallet from consumers to employers the health-care market is a big part of spending. Amazon is already in almost every chunk of the wallet maybe not banking (though it does have credit cards). What's the biggest chunk of the market they are not in? ""It's healthcare and they already have so many things consumer-health oriented it just makes sense to go big in health care"" Kaganoff said. When Haven — which disbanded after three years — debuted to much fanfare people thought the combined might of Berkshire Hathaway JPMorgan and Amazon could result in a significant driving down of costs throughout the health-care system that Warren Buffett has called a tapeworm on the national economy. And that's still part of the story. Anything Amazon does is partially about driving down cost and driving up efficiency. ""Better care at a lower cost"" is what Cano Health CEO Marlow Hernandez told CNBC last week is the paradigm shift for all players in the space. Amazon's consumer internet business may be the ultimate in transactional disruptors but the transactional system of health care is under threat and people don't want to treat it like just another form of retail. ""What patients have been demanding is that integrated platform where they can build relationships and no longer be a number"" Hernandez said. That's referred to as value-based care — and maybe it is a sign of just how messed up the U.S. health-care system is that ""value"" for patient is a novel idea — and it is leading to a lot of consolidation. Hernandez projects the primary care market will grow from $1.8 trillion to $3.7 trillion by 2030. And that speaks to the underlying aim for any big company like Amazon and its rivals. ""I think it's just market share"" Kaganoff said. The end of Amazon Care did seem abrupt. But as Amazon moves from primary care into more complicated care and potentially even chronic care – and combines pharmacy and over-the-counter medication with all its offerings – everyone from private health start-ups to Teladoc to retail competitors and health-care incumbents should continue to worry. Amazon Care's failure may have come at a cost and may have come as a surprise even to some within Amazon but what the company ultimately is buying and building off may still make it the stronger disruptor.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZvcmJlcy5jb20vc2l0ZXMvcGF1bHRhc3NpLzIwMjIvMDgvMjgvYW1hem9ucy1ub3QtYnV5aW5nLWVhLWJ1dC1zaG91bGQtaXQtc2hvdWxkLWFueW9uZS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Amazon's Not Buying EA But Should It?

The company will now be selling its fitness equipment (aside from its Bike+ machine and Tread treadmill) and apparel on the retail giant's website.

“From a fundamental standpoint I think it opens up a new door into Peloton's distribution strategy” MKM Partners Managing Director of Internet & Capital Markets Rohit Kulkarni said on Yahoo Finance Live (video above). “They have always sorted out their own warehouses their own kind of stores and their own website. Amazon is the largest distributor of all e-commerce products. So I think this is a very big positive step for Peloton. No matter how you cut it this takes the company forward.”

Following the announcement shares of Peloton soared more than 20% though the stock lost all of those gains after the company's disappointing fourth-quarter earnings results which missed analyst expectations.

Kulkarni still sees ""a lot of possibilities"" for the future of Peloton with its Amazon deal.

Peloton CEO Barry McCarthy ""has shown a lot of signals that he's willing to take risks with the model with the business model with distribution with the content and everything around it"" Kulkarni said. ""He's essentially completely doing the Apple Card in a way that Peloton could be a big home run from here on out. The way I feel about what Amazon and Peloton can do together — I think there's no better set of consumers than Prime subscribers.""

Peloton could bring 'halo' to Amazon

The pandemic brought on an exponential increase in demand for Peloton’s bikes but as vaccines became available and COVID restrictions faded the company faced major headwinds.

The stock reached a high of $162.72 in December 2020 but since the beginning of 2022 it's off more than 71%. Currently the stock is trading at less than $11 a share.

According to Kulkarni Amazon is the perfect partner for Peloton which is gaining more market share in the health and fitness industries. The two companies previously worked together on Amazon Web Services (AWS) meaning a working relationship already exists.

With Amazon wanting to further its reach into health and fitness ""there's no better company than Peloton with a brand name"" Kulkarni said. ""So I feel more positive for Peloton right now but there could be a halo coming to Amazon too.""

Aside from the access to Prime subscribers he said there are other short-term benefits to the partnership that could help Peloton's financials.

Story continues

""Peloton is holding on to a lot of old inventory"" Kulkarni said. ""Now they can put that old inventory into Amazon warehouses. That helps them with the near-term costs. On top of that I think Peloton is also offering free delivery as well as free setup. They started charging for that back in January. Now when it comes to Amazon they're trying to eat up that cost.""

Peloton bikes are now available on Amazon. (Photo: Amazon)

MKM currently maintains a ""neutral"" rating on Peloton stock but that could change if the company develops a sustainable unit business model Kulkarni said.

""When they make a bike when they want to ship it from overseas and when they want to get it to your door the dollar they spend to make a bike they're spending more to actually get it to your door"" he said. ""That's not sustainable in my opinion. They're dropping the price of the bike and hence their gross margins are shrinking ... They're somewhere in between right now.""

Very Frupid

""Frupidity."" ""Swag Bucks"" (and/or ""Swaggies""). ""CRaP."" According to Insider these are a few of the silly annoying and/or stupid words forced upon Amazon employees.

We're not saying we expected more from notoriously cringe Bezos king of both being the worst and importantly labor issues. And okay making employees use frivolous words or phrases doesn't rank among the worst allegations against Amazon — but some of these phrases do toe some seriously thin ethical lines.

Make Rate

To clarify neither ""frupidity"" (the combination of ""frugal"" and ""stupidity"") ""Swag Bucks"" (Amazon's version of internal Monopoly money given to employees to be spend with the company) nor ""CRaP"" (shorthand for Can't Realize a Profit referring to sub-$15 items like water bottles and paper towels that don't generate revenue) are related to questionable workplace practices. They're just dumb.

But take the term ""Hire to Fire"" which according to Insider refers to Amazon's notoriously brutal firing quotas. Managers have admitted in the past that they face so much pressure to ensure employee turnover that they often hire new talent with the only goal of letting those folks go shortly thereafter — and it apparently happens so often that the company has a word for it.

""We might hire people that we know we're going to fire"" one unnamed manager told Insider last year ""just to protect the rest of the team.

That's small fish though compared to ""make rate"" a term said to measure whether employees are keeping up with their ""stow rate"" which refers to Amazon's absolutely brutal productivity demands — you know the ones so extreme that workers have been known to pee in bottles on the warehouse floor so as to not get fired for bathroom breaks. And perhaps unsurprisingly ""make rate"" and ""stow rate"" are just two of several company terms that refer to Bezos' penchant for turning employees into productivity stats and churning through as many workers as possible.

There are several more words on Insider's list and to be be fair it's common for major corporations to promote goofy company slang. But in Amazon's case cutesy names for bad behavior doesn't make those practices any better — if anything it makes them that much worse. Gotta say the S-Team's OV isn't looking too great from here.

The agreement with Delta’s Propel program the airline’s pilot-career pathway was finalized earlier this month and comes seven months after Skyborne announced a new partnership with United Airlines’ Aviate program.

Skyborne also has established partnerships with: SkyWest Airlines the nation’s largest regional carrier; Endeavor Air which operates as a Delta Connection; and Envoy Air a wholly owned subsidiary of American Airlines and formerly known as American Eagle Airlines.

In addition the academy has agreements to train pilots for two charter airlines.

“It’s certainly good for business” Ed Davidson managing director of Skyborne’s Vero Beach flight school said of the partnerships. “It increases our top-line revenues and it’s always nice to have those relationships especially at a time when airlines need more pilots.

“Delta is a great addition to our stable” he said.

Delta’s Propel program launched in 2018 to identify select and develop the next generation of pilots is designed to take candidates through to their commercial and certified flight instructor ratings on their path to becoming a first officer.

According to a statement from Delta Propel is a highly selective program that provides current Delta employees who have worked for the company for at least three years with a transition opportunity and the support to pursue a career as a commercial airline pilot.

To qualify candidates must have a private pilot’s license and at least 100 hours of flight time.

Only a select few are chosen each year. They are then given a defined path timeline to become a Delta pilot and five-year leave of absence to complete their training.

After being trained by Skyborne and working no more than 42 months at a Delta Connection carrier Propel participants may transition to a pilot position at Delta Airlines.

“This program will allow Delta to continue to invest in its people tapping into their passion for aviation and the strength of the Delta culture” the company’s statement reads.

Davidson said Propel candidates can expect to spend 30 to 40 weeks at the academy where they’ll train in single-engine Piper Warrior aircraft.

“Every aspect of our training is designed to prepare cadets for airline operations in terms of core knowledge and decision making flight deck procedures and professionalism” Davidson said.

Apparently Skyborne’s global reach and commitment to filling the cockpits of major commercial carriers has drawn the attention of industry leaders.

“Skyborne has the level of professionalism and training rigor we look for in our flight school partners” Delta Propel program manager Kelvin Mason said.

While the Skyborne flight training remains the same the programs offered by each airline is different Davidson said adding that some carriers pay for cadet training and others make conditional job offers.

He said he expects the academy to have as many as 200 candidates on campus by the middle of next year and 300 by the end of 2023.

“We’ve been progressing at a pretty good rate” Davidson said.

Earlier this year after the academy’s agreement with United was announced Skyborne Chief Executive Officer Lee Woodward said the partnerships with major carriers produced a “significant rise in applications.”

Skyborne which was founded at the Gloucestershire Airport in the United Kingdom in 2018 has quickly earned an international reputation as one of the most respected commercial-pilot training schools in the industry.

Skyborne purchased Flight Safety Academy in Vero Beach in May 2021.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiRmh0dHBzOi8vdGhlcG9pbnRzZ3V5LmNvbS9kZWFscy9jaGlsZS1wcmVtaXVtLWVjb25vbXktYWFkdmFudGFnZS1taWxlcy_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Premium economy and AAdvantage deals to Santiago Chile,"It's not every day there are affordable options for getting to Chile particularly when flying in a prime seat. That's why we were excited to learn about options for both starting in just a few months.

During the first several months of 2023 American Airlines has some great premium economy deals departing from a couple of key cities. Meanwhile if you've got a haul of points or miles – and not even that big of a haul – you can book award flights to the South American nation's capital city at a fraction of the miles you'd normally have to redeem.

Scott's Cheap Flights was the first to point out the great premium economy deals on flights from the West Coast to Santiago International Airport (SCL) beginning in early 2023. The site offers premium memberships that flag economy deals starting at $49 annually or $199 for premium economy and business class deals.

TPG also noticed you can book flights from a long list of U.S. cities to Santiago using AAdvantage miles for a nice discount compared to American's award chart at 40000 miles round trip for main cabin itineraries.

There's any number of great reasons to fly to Santiago whether you're hoping to experience all the culture the city has to offer or branch out and visit other parts of the country from the Andes to the Chiloe Archipelago and Patagonia region.

When it comes to the premium economy deals to Santiago we took note of round trips that came in at around $1000. American has availability in that range for premium economy round trips between February and July 2023 out of Los Angeles International Airport (LAX) and Seattle/Tacoma International Airport (SEA).

Just about all of these itineraries involve a stop at Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport (DFW) and then a longer-haul flight between DFW and Santiago aboard one of American's Boeing 787 Dreamliner aircraft.

Interestingly the same deals do not seem to be available for nonstop flights out of DFW; from there and a number of other major U.S. cities premium economy round trip tickets fall in the $1200 to $1600 range during that time period which is still a decent savings compared to what you'd often pay for premium economy seats to Santiago.

Meanwhile if you're not flying from Los Angeles or Seattle there's a decent chance there's strong award availability to Santiago in main cabin.

Taking a look at American's award calendar for round trips originating in New York check out the month of April. For almost the entire month you can get flights for 20000 AAdvantage miles each way.

AMERICAN AIRLINES

That's a discount of about a third compared to the standard award chart pricing model under which flights to ""South America Region 2"" which includes most flights to Chile go for 30000 miles each way. That means for the round trip you're saving about 20000 miles round trip – a savings worth about $354 according to TPG's points and miles valuations.

Here are just a few of the routes and prices we found:

Los Angeles to Santiago for $997 in premium economy on American

Seattle to Santiago for $1007 in premium economy on American

Los Angeles to Santiago for 40000 AAdvantage miles in main cabin on American

Seattle to Santiago for 40000 AAdvantage miles in main cabin on American

New York to Santiago for 40000 AAdvantage miles in main cabin on American

Miami/Fort Lauderdale to Santiago for 40000 AAdvantage miles in main cabin on American

Taking a look first at a premium economy itinerary here's just one of many options you have at your disposal if you're looking to tap into this southern California availability during the first several months of 2023. This trip out of Los Angeles involves an afternoon flight to Dallas/Fort Worth. Then after a brief layover it's a nine-and-a-half-hour overnight haul on a Dreamliner to Santiago. You'll get to Chile early the next morning.

On the return trip it's another redeye flight north to DFW and then a mid-morning flight from Texas to the west coast.

GOOGLE FLIGHTS

Like many of the itineraries you'll find to Santiago the best options out of Seattle involve a stop at DFW and the same itinerary between American's base city and South America.

GOOGLE FLIGHTS

As mentioned there's also widespread availability for 40000 miles round trip and not just from L.A. or Seattle.

For New York area travelers this April itinerary involves a late afternoon flight from LaGuardia Airport (LGA) to DFW and then the aforementioned flight aboard a 787 to Chile. After the connection at DFW on the return trip you'll actually land at Newark/Liberty International Airport (EWR) on this itinerary and then catch a train back to the city.

AMERICAN AIRLINES

South Florida travelers have options at 40000 miles out of Miami International Airport (MIA) or Fort Lauderdale/Hollywood International Airport (FLL). This Fort Lauderdale itinerary similar to the New York option kicks off with a late afternoon departure to DFW. After the long-haul flight on the return trip you'll land back in Fort Lauderdale just after 11:00 a.m.

Bottom line

Whether you have the ability to depart from a West Coast city and take advantage of great premium seating deals to Chile or have 40000 AAdvantage miles in your account there are a variety of options available for getting to Chile in early 2023.

DALLAS — Read this story and other North Texas business news from our content partners at the Dallas Business Journal

Dallas Fort Worth International Airport officials want to move forward with long-term planning for a long-awaited sixth terminal after putting the project on hold for the last two years because of the pandemic.

The airport informed investors that it submitted a $27.8 million capital spending request to the airlines in May to cover the design cost for Terminal F according to roadshow documents from a bond issuance earlier this summer. The request marks the airport’s first step in restarting the highly anticipated project.

“The note in our bond documents is to notify investors that we would like to proceed with the long-term planning of Terminal F” airport spokesman Francisco Rodriguez said in a statement. “DFW Airport is committed to informing our investors of potential capital projects as it would have a material impact on the airport’s debt outlook. We have not received airline funding approval for Terminal F. We look forward to continuing discussions with the airlines regarding Terminal F.”

Terminal F originally announced in May 2019 would have been DFW’s most significant infrastructure project in decades. The terminal estimated at the time to cost upward of $3 billion would have been located south of Terminal D and added up to 25 gates.

When the pandemic hit in 2020 and slammed the travel industry the airport put the project on pause. CEO Sean Donohue said in April 2020 that the timing of the project and the size of the terminal would need to be “revisited.” Airport officials have remained mum about the project ever since.

The request to the airlines comes amid a recovery for the travel industry. The major airlines have seen passenger demand boom and fares have spiked. Fort Worth-based American Airlines Group Inc. the dominant carrier out of DFW reported record revenue in the second quarter and a return to profitability. The airport itself has also experienced a turnaround exceeding pre-pandemic passenger traffic totals for the first time in April. DFW also exceeded pre-pandemic numbers in May and June.

Earlier this month DFW’s board of directors approved a $1.2 billion operating budget for fiscal 2023 representing a 13% increase from the current fiscal year. The airport estimates 78.3 million passengers will come through in fiscal 2023 up 9.5% from the outlook for the current year.

DFW needs approval from the airlines for spending from a joint capital account as part of use agreements. The airport remains mired in negotiations over new use agreements with 28 passenger and 29 freight airlines. The current use agreements expired in September 2021 but the airport and airlines have a month-to-month extension while they negotiate a new long-term agreement.

American Airlines (Nasdaq: AAL) has more than 80% market share at DFW and stands to benefit from a new terminal. The carrier also has to ensure it grows in a cost-effective way which means the project is almost surely at the center of the use agreement negotiations.

“DFW is American’s largest hub and a central gateway to our extensive international and domestic network” AA spokesman Matt Miller said in a statement. “We are grateful for our long-term partnership with the airport and proud to have led the growth that has propelled DFW to become the second busiest airport in the world. We continue to work with DFW to finalize a new lease agreement and capital plan that will set the stage for American and DFW to continue to grow – in a prudent and cost-effective manner – for years to come.”

While DFW can use Terminal F-related spending as a bargaining chip the airport controls landing fees. During the budget discussions Chief Financial Officer Chris Poinsatte said DFW does not plan to impose a rate increase on the airlines in the first quarter. However he said the airport has scheduled a rate increase set to go into effect in January.

The airport has given about $300 million in federal relief money — about three-quarters of its total — to the airlines for rate relief. Currently airport officials plan to use federal relief money in 2023 for inflationary impacts on capital projects."

It provides heat and light pumps water and fuel refrigerates food and breathes life into our TVs computers and phones. So it is no surprise the North American electric grid which creates moves and delivers our electricity is considered the most critical part of our critical infrastructure. What is surprising is the nature of the grid itself: a hodge-podge of public and privately-owned half-century-old tech that is increasingly vulnerable to severe weather cyber-attacks and even physical assaults. As we first reported earlier this year no government agency not even the Department of Energy is truly in charge of protecting it. One attack nine years ago was a wake-up call for industry and government alike.

On the night of April 16 2013 a mysterious incident south of San Jose marked the most serious attack on our power grid in history.

For 20 minutes gunmen methodically fired at high voltage transformers at the Metcalf Power substation. Security cameras captured bullets hitting the chain link fence.

Jon Wellinghoff: They knew what they were doing. They had a specific objective. They wanted to knock out the substation.

At the time Jon Wellinghoff was chairman of FERC the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission a small government agency with jurisdiction over the U.S. high voltage transmission system.

Bill Whitaker: You were concerned enough that you flew out there?

Jon Wellinghoff: That's correct. And I took two other individuals who train special forces U.S. special forces. They train people to actually attack infrastructure.

Jon Wellinghoff

And what the former commandos found looked familiar. They discovered the attackers had reconnoitered the site and marked firing positions with piles of rocks. That night they broke into two underground vaults and cut off communications coming from the substation.

Jon Wellinghoff: Then they went from these vaults across this road over into a pasture area here. There were at least four or five different firing positions.

Bill Whitaker: No real security?

Jon Wellinghoff: There was no security at all really.

They aimed at the narrow cooling fins causing 17 of 21 large transformers to overheat and stop working.

Jon Wellinghoff: They hit them 90 times so they were very accurate. And they were doing this at night with muzzle flash in their face.

Someone outside the plant heard gunfire and called 911. The gunmen disappeared without a trace about a minute before a patrol car arrived. The substation was down for weeks but fortunately PG&E had enough time to reroute power and avoid disaster.

Bill Whitaker: If they had succeeded what would've happened?

Jon Wellinghoff: Could've brought down all of Silicon Valley.

Bill Whitaker: We're talking Google Apple; all these guys--

Jon Wellinghoff: Yes yes. That's correct.

Bill Whitaker: Who do you think this could have been?

Jon Wellinghoff: I don't know. We don't know if they were a nation state. We don't know if they were domestic actors. But it was somebody who did have competent people who could in fact plan out this kind of a very sophisticated attack.

The grid is a sprawling target. There are actually three in the U.S.: the eastern western and Texas has its own. Most of us rarely notice substations. There are 55000 across the country each housing transformers the workhorses of the grid. Inside these massive metal boxes raw electricity is converted to higher or lower voltages.

Should a transformer explode like this one in Manhattan during Superstorm Sandy the system is designed to trigger a localized grid-preserving blackout. But if several sections of the grid go down at the same time the shutdowns can cascade like dominoes. That's what set off the great Northeast Blackout in 2003 leaving 45 million Americans without power. A few months before the assault on Metcalf Jon Wellinghoff of FERC commissioned a study to see if a physical attack on critical transformers could trigger cascading blackouts.

Jon Wellinghoff: It was actually a very shocking result to us that there's very few number of substations you need to take out in the entire United States to knock out the entire grid.

Bill Whitaker: Knock out the entire grid?

Jon Wellinghoff: That's correct.

Bill Whitaker: How many would it take to knock out putting the entire country in a blackout?

Jon Wellinghoff: Less than 20.

The report was leaked to the Wall Street Journal. It found the U.S. could suffer a coast-to-coast blackout if saboteurs knocked out just nine substations.

Bill Whitaker: You are relaying this in a very measured way. I would think this would be quite alarming.

Jon Wellinghoff: It was alarming. There's no question. It is alarming.

Dr. Granger Morgan

After the Metcalf attack FERC pressed the utilities to harden defenses at their most critical substations – erect walls and sensors to prevent similar attacks – there's now a wall around Metcalf. But many substations remain vulnerable targets like one we found in southern California that serves more than 300000 customers - huge transformers protected by a chain link fence.

Dr. Granger Morgan: Anybody who knows about power systems knows that the the grid is physically spread all over the countryside. There are a lot of places that are vulnerable.

Dr. Granger Morgan is a Carnegie Mellon University professor of engineering who chaired three National Academy of Sciences reports on the power grid for the U.S. government – the most recent in 2021. An earlier report on terrorism was classified for five years.

Dr. Granger Morgan: We simply made a strong case that the grid was physically very vulnerable.

Bill Whitaker: Why was there a specific report on terrorism and the grid?

Dr. Granger Morgan: There were concerns about the possibility that a terrorist organization could attack the grid. And around the world there have been a fair number of attacks on grids.

They have attacked with bombs planes and drones. Russia's cyber attack on Ukraine's grid in 2015 knocked about 60 substations offline leaving 230000 people in the dark. The U.S. secretary of energy has said Russia could do the same thing here.

Dr. Granger Morgan: In the report we did on the resilience of the power system we did argue that we needed an organization probably DOE and Department of Homeland Security to systematically look at all the kinds of vulnerabilities we have and then begin to figure out who could address each. In terms of resilience issues there's nobody in charge. I mean there's no single entity that has responsibility for everything.

Mike Mabee: The U.S. electric grid is the largest machine in the history of mankind. It is a marvel of modern engineering. No one person owns or controls it. It's actually 3000 different companies both public and private sector that own or operate little pieces of the electric grid.

Mike Mabee is an Iraq war vet a former cop and a self-taught grid security expert. By day he works for the government. In his spare time he uncovers public information electric utilities would rather not see the light of day and publishes them on a website called ""Grid Security Now."" He is both fascinated and horrified by the grid.

Mike Mabee

Mike Mabee: I think everybody needs to be as alarmed as I am. We've had disasters in the past but they've generally always been regional in scale. What we've never had is a national-scale blackout which is completely possible under some known threats such as the cyber threat the physical security threat or even extreme weather. And the U.S. public is completely unprepared to survive without the electric grid for any period of time whatsoever.

So when he moved to Texas two years ago he prepared for the worst installing solar wind and battery power.

Mike Mabee: The whole system's 48 volts.

Mabee's family survived last winter's deadly storm hundreds of Texans perished.

Mike Mabee: And the deaths were largely due to hypothermia carbon monoxide poisoning because when people got cold they would do things like go into their car in the garage to try to stay warm.

Mabee has become a thorn in the side of the federal government and utility companies.

Mike Mabee: I filed a complaint about supply chain cybersecurity. I filed a complaint about physical security. I filed a complaint about the Texas blackout.

Bill Whitaker: The government and the industry. They think you're an annoyance?

Mike Mabee: I've been termed a ""grid security gadfly"" which I wear that as a badge of honor.

One frequent target: the Department of Energy. Mabee told us the grid information the DOE puts out is confusing and dispersed. He said he spends hours trying to make sense of it all.

Mike Mabee: There is a requirement that they report electric disturbance events. But the data from the Department of Energy is so bad. So you know I took it upon myself to do some data crunching. And what I found is that 38% of the electric disturbance events in the United States are due to physical attacks against the electric.

Bill Whitaker: 38%? That's a lot.

Mike Mabee: So in the past decade there have been over 700 physical attacks against the U.S. electric grid.

Many are copy cats of the Metcalf assault. In 2016 an eco terrorist in Utah shot up a large transformer triggering a blackout. He said he'd planned to hit five substations in one day to shut down the West Coast. In 2020 the FBI uncovered a white supremacist plot called ""lights out"" to simultaneously attack substations around the country.

Dr. Liz Sherwood-Randall and Anne Neuberger

Dr. Liz Sherwood-Randall: We're seeing planning to disable the delivery of power to the American people.

Dr. Liz Sherwood-Randall is President Biden's homeland security advisor. We met with her and Anne Neuberger deputy national security advisor for cyber. They told us the administration's infrastructure plans should help secure the grid but acknowledge the threats are real.

Dr. Liz Sherwood-Randall: We have physical threats to the grid. We have natural threats to the grid. We have cyber threats to the grid.

Neuberger came to the White House from the secretive National Security Agency where she battled Russian hackers in cyberspace.

Bill Whitaker: You said that you've been talking to private utility companies around the country about the potential for a cyber attack. What are you telling them?

Anne Neuberger: We're sharing with them some of the context regarding how Russia and other countries use cyber in crisis or conflict. We've actively downgraded intelligence. We've taken any information we have about malicious software or tactics that the Russian government has used shared that with the private sector with very practical advice of how to protect against it.

Bill Whitaker: Isn't the problem that when it comes to the grid there's nothing like the FAA or the Food and Drug Administration or the Securities and Exchange Commission? There's no one overall agency overseeing these you said 3000 different utilities across the country?

Dr. Liz Sherwood-Randall: We don't have one system. We have several grids. We also have individual energy ecosystems in regions and states. And that's part of our strength because the resources for energy are different in different regions. And we have to acknowledge that we're not going to have a one-size-fits-all system.

Bill Whitaker: You call it one of our strengths. But it also seems to be one of our vulnerabilities.

Dr. Liz Sherwood-Randall: Well in my view we can't impose the regulations that would-- you would be suggesting as a federal government. We can set standards and we are setting standards in a variety of arenas.

Carnegie Mellon's Granger Morgan says what government industry and law enforcement are doing doesn't meet the magnitude of the threat.

Dr. Granger Morgan: What we need at this point is to get the White House to put all the key players together in a room to identify the biggest vulnerabilities and then take steps to reduce them.

Bill Whitaker: I'm surprised that's not being done.

Dr. Granger Morgan: It has not been done. And it needs to happen now.

President Joe Biden has called for 50% of all cars sold in the United States to be electric by 2030. The Inflation Reduction Act aims to help that goal by including a $7500 tax credit to encourage Americans to buy electric cars.

In a July 19 2022 House hearing Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg lauded Biden’s goal as possibly bringing cost-saving technology to rural communities and fighting the climate crisis.

U.S. Rep. Thomas Massie R-Ky. however countered that he was ""alarmed"" at ""the naiveté"" in Biden’s proposal given the current electric grid’s capacity to accommodate electric cars. He asked Buttigieg whether more Americans charging electric vehicles would strain the grid.

Massie a Massachusetts Institute of Technology engineering graduate practices a green lifestyle living off the grid on solar panels and a Tesla battery. He even made a movie describing his quest for energy independence that won the 2018 Anthem Film Festival Audience Choice Award. In the hearing he told Buttigieg he’d been driving electric cars for 10 years.

Massie then asked Buttigieg how much electricity a charging electric vehicle might take compared with a running refrigerator five times or 25 times.

Buttigieg said 25 times.

""It’s actually 50 (times) at the instantaneous moment but over the course of a year … the average American household would use 25 times as much electricity for their electric car as they would use for their refrigerator if they had 100% percent adoption"" Massie said citing U.S. Energy Department numbers for households and vehicle ownership.

One hundred percent adoption would mean two electric cars per U.S. household.

We wondered whether Massie’s comparison is accurate. We emailed Massie asking for a source of his information but got no response. We also emailed the Transportation Department for Buttigieg’s input but got no response.

Comparing electric cars with refrigerators is imperfect and complicated said Harrison Neuhaus of Climate Nexus a communications group highlighting climate change’s impacts.

For example electric cars can be charged with one of three different chargers two used at home that charge the batteries at different rates.

""EV models can be very different — depending on the battery you have you may need to charge less or more to get the same amount of driving range. So we need to rely on averages"" Neuhaus wrote in an email to PolitiFact. (Climate Nexus is collaborating with PolitiFact as part of a grant to cover issues related to climate change.)

Charging an electric car such as a Nissan Leaf takes about twice as much annual energy as a refrigerator according to a 2017 document from the U.S. Energy Department. Using Massie’s example then swapping out two gasoline-powered cars for two EVs would use around four times as much electricity annually as a refrigerator. However that document relies on 2009 data for refrigerators from the U.S. Energy Information Administration.

The Energy Department also estimated that one electric vehicle requires 3.8 megawatt hours per year of energy generation. A standard U.S. home refrigerator of 20 to 25 cubic feet uses 400 to 1000 kWh per year or between 0.4 MWh and 1 MWh. Using those numbers we calculated that a single EV would use between 3.8MWh and 9.5MWh more energy annually than a standard home refrigerator.

More:Fact-check: Can electric vehicle fires be extinguished with water?

Philip Krein a research professor at the Grainger Center for Electric Machinery and Electromechanics at the University of Illinois said our numbers were ""generic"" and open to assumptions ""but are fair.""

Because Massie referred to households having two EVs rather than one the figures we arrived at would be doubled. So two electric vehicles would use 19 times as much energy as the refrigerator on the high end of the estimate and 7.6 times more on the low end.

Not an apples-to-apples comparison

That’s less than Massie’s claim. However if a household uses EVs more than average or has a smaller (or larger or older and less efficient) refrigerator than average those numbers would fluctuate.

Krein also pointed out other factors: In a household with two EVs ""one is likely to be used almost entirely for commuting and the energy use for it will be much lower;"" and refrigerators are fairly low in electrical use compared with other appliances such as air conditioners.

Because there are so many variables there is no way for anyone including Massie to make an apples-to-apples comparison.

What about Massie’s notion that charging electric cars en masse would overstrain the grid?

Matthew Klippenstein an engineer at the Canadian Hydrogen and Fuel Cell Association who led an EV rebate program at Plug In BC said there are many ways to prevent that.

More:Fact-check: Did France give electric cars to civil servants?

""Long before charging becomes a threat to the grid utilities will coordinate with charging networks or with customers directly to streamline this stuff"" Klippenstein said. ""If any utility doesn’t do that that’s not the fault of EV drivers it’s the fault of utility management.""

He added that automakers are also working to enable car owners to feed the grid as they’re plugged in a process called bidirectional charging. This would help ease grid strain.

Also Krein added electric cars and refrigerators consume electricity differently.

""Not surprisingly an electric car is a bigger grid load than a household refrigerator"" said Krein.

""(And) nationally at least 28% of all U.S. energy consumption goes to transportation. Total national energy consumption drops when transportation moves to electrical form.""

Experts have affirmed that the rollout of EV use doesn’t pose a risk to the electrical grid. James Morris editor of the independent electric vehicle website WhichEV wrote that the chances that all Americans would charge their cars at once are ""infinitesimally low.

""Their arguments seem to assume that nobody ever drives their car and just charges it all the time"" he wrote in Forbes magazine in November 2021.

Bearskin Farms east of Little Rock is installing one of the largest solar projects on a farm in Arkansas in a bid to gain some control over the farm's energy costs at a time when solar energy may be more accessible than ever in agriculture.

Renewable energy -- a priority in the recently passed Inflation Reduction Act -- is growing in Arkansas' agriculture sector as more farmers turn to energy sources like solar to power everything from fans in a poultry house to grain drying bins and well pumps.

The act which was signed into law by President Joe Biden on August 16 is described as an effort to combat climate change evident scientists say in the numerous reports of severe and often unpredictable weather that U.S. farmers face.

Bearskin Farm owner Lambert Marshall is installing a 2-megawatt solar array composed of 4500 panels that will produce about 3.6 million kilowatt hours annually at his farm in Lonoke and Pulaski counties.

Cotton corn rice soybeans and wheat are grown on the farm and solar energy will be used for irrigation grain drying and storage of crops.

""Bearskin won't be completely reliant on solar energy; in more rural areas of the farm electric irrigation equipment is not viable"" Marshall said.

""We hope to continue to convert more of our irrigation equipment to electric to lessen our environmental impact.""

Farming is a capital-intensive business Marshall said. ""Our farm uses a lot of energy producing and drying our crops"" he said.

""We think solar with help stabilize and lower our energy costs over time. Bearskin's solar array will have the capability and size to help generate significant savings for the farm.""

Renewable energy accounted for only 10% of electricity generated in Arkansas last year according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration but solar power generation is growing in Arkansas and accounted for a tenth of the state's renewable electricity generation last year 18 times greater than in 2016.

The USDA announced on Wednesday $121 million in investments to combat climate change in socially vulnerable communities in 49 U.S. states with funding from the Inflation Reduction Act.

Arkansas recipients received nine Rural Energy for America Program (REAP) Renewable Energy and Energy Efficiency grants totaling $127721 to help pay for installation of solar panels or LED lighting.

North Little Rock-based company Seal Solar is installing the array at Bearskin Farm and also installs solar power systems for agriculture residential and other projects across the state.

""The main thing we're seeing is farmers business owners and everybody else is just wanting to have control"" Seal Solar's co-founder and president Heather Nelson said. ""Solar gives farmers the ability to now have control over their electricity costs. It allows them to budget better.

""It allows them to deliver a [return on investment] on something that was just a sunk cost in the past.""

STATE LAW SUPPORTED

Arkansas farmers who produce solar energy can use net metering to offset their electricity costs.

Act 464 of 2019 allows utility customers who generate their own solar energy and produce an excess to send the extra power to their utility for a credit on their bills. The law also raised the limit for commercial customers of electric utilities with solar projects from 300 kilowatts to 1000 kilowatts.

The state Public Service Commission which regulates utilities posted new net-metering rules for solar development on June 1 2020. The rules allow existing agreements between utilities and non-metering customers to remain or be grandfathered in for 20 years or until 2040.

Farmers may have multiple meters tied to wells grain bins houses shops or barns and net meter aggregation allows them to build one solar project and tie all their meters together Nelson said.

Farmers with net metering will get a one-to-one credit for the energy they produce and send to the utility's power grid which is applied to their monthly electricity bill Arkansas Advanced Energy Association Executive Director Lauren Waldrip said.

""We design the [solar power] project based on 12-month usage and then once it's constructed we submit a list of those meters to the utility in the order in which the client would like the energy produced off their solar to offset those accounts"" Nelson said.

""They will rank those and once a year they're allowed to go back to the utility and change that order.""

Retired row crop farmer Tom Jacobs from DeWitt was the first to adopt solar power on a farm in Arkansas.

""The way I looked at it when I put [solar panels] in was -- it was like I was buying my own generator and I was buying a piece of farm equipment"" Jacobs said. ""I was going to see what my payback on that equipment was. It's been about eight years and the net amount that I paid for it well I will have saved that much on energy costs"" he said.

Jacobs supplements his electricity with solar energy from 84 panels that generate roughly 25000 watts to power grain drying bins a farm shop and a tenant house.

""At the time that we put that in Entergy was asking for a rate increase ... and this was a way of locking in the rate because we were going to be grandfathered in"" Jacobs said.

""Since it was going to be swapped one-for-one every kilowatt I produced whether I used it on my farm or it went to my neighbor then I got credit for that when I needed it during drying season or at one of my other places"" Jacobs said adding this was supposed to cover 70% to 80% of the farm's usage.

Act 464 also allowed third-party financing of solar projects which was intended to help tax-exempt organizations and government entities that wouldn't otherwise qualify for federal tax incentives to put in solar panels.

It allowed those entities to utilize solar by allowing them to sign lease agreements with third parties that install solar power projects. The state Legislature also passed Act 507 in 2019 which allowed government entities to issue bonds for energy savings projects. School districts may also participate.

This act allowed energy performance contracts to extend past 20 years if the project is guaranteed to last that long and if the project's useful life is more than 20 years.

POULTRY FLOCKS TO SOLAR

When certain factors line up solar energy is highly beneficial for the energy-intensive poultry production industry Poultry Federation President Marvin Childers said.

Poultry growers can use solar to generate electricity to power poultry houses which use fans to meet cooling requirements for broiler chickens.

Approximately 20.5 million chickens are processed in Arkansas weekly and poultry accounts for 50% of Arkansas's agricultural cash receipts Childers said. To determine whether solar energy makes sense Childers said farmers should first determine what energy provider's territory their operation is based in whether it's Entergy an electricity cooperative or a municipality.

""We know there are some banks that are providing 100% financing and I think if all of those line up to me it's almost a no-brainer for poultry farmers"" Childers said. Waldrip recommended farmers also get multiple quotes from different developers. Farmers may have varying returns in terms of cost savings as well she said.

Nelson said solar energy will deliver a return on investment for Arkansas farmers.

""When we started doing this years ago the longest warranty [for solar energy] you ever saw was 25 [years] and now its 30 so the technology is getting better and the warranties are getting longer"" Nelson said.

Childers said it may take some time to see a return on investment for solar panel installation costs but as long as farmers generate enough energy for a farm's needs they will have lower energy costs.

Farmers can utilize land that might be low-yield in terms of crop production for solar panels to offset their utility costs Nelson said.

Some Arkansas landowners are also engaging with solar energy on larger scale by setting up power purchase agreements.

""Some farmers will sell that power not to a utility necessarily but maybe to Amazon; we know Amazon has a couple projects set up in eastern Arkansas"" Waldrip said.

""That's why aggregation is so important because it doesn't have to be in the same location.""

NEW CLIMATE LAW

Costs to install solar in the U.S. have dropped by more than 60% over the last ten years though supply chain and shipping issues related to the pandemic and trade instability led to some price increases according to the Solar Energy Industries Association.

The Inflation Reduction Act package increases an existing energy investment tax credit to 30% for solar projects to include projects installed this year through the end of 2032.

The tax credit is also extended to battery storage technology.

Standalone energy storage systems such as lithium batteries are eligible for the 30% tax credit Nelson said.

""This means if you install a battery-only system or if you add batteries to your solar [power] system in the future they will qualify for the 30% tax credit"" Nelson said.

""Storage capacity needs to be at least 5 kilowatt hours for commercial and 3 kilowatt hours for residential.""

There is also an additional 10% tax credit for selling electricity generated by community solar projects to low-income individuals.

There is an additional 10% tax credit for using domestically produced hardware for a project.

Solar projects established in former ""energy communities"" can also get an additional 10% tax credit.

""There are ways to get a 40% to 50% solar tax credit for commercial projects"" Nelson said. ""Such as using American-made components and locating the project in a low-income community or on a brownfield. Projects over [1 megawatt] must meet additional labor guidelines"" she said emphasizing the company recommends customers refer to tax professionals for verifying tax-related solar concerns.

Nelson said direct pay should also be an option for solar projects commissioned in 2023 for tax-exempt nonprofit and municipal customers.

""Direct pay means the federal government will reimburse a tax-exempt organization at least 30% of the total cost of the system"" Nelson said.

Rural Energy for America Program funding could also see a boost because of the Inflation Reduction Act Nelson said.

Waldrip said the Act is also expected to promote domestic manufacturing which could generate millions of jobs in the U.S.

""A lot of these projects are required to use domestically sourced inputs specifically steel"" she said.

View the current offers here.

There's no question that credit card rewards are constantly evolving and becoming more valuable than ever before. However it's not just unique perks such as dining credits Uber credits and automatic elite status that set cards apart — it's also how they physically look.

Following Chase's highly successful launch of the Chase Sapphire Reserve in 2016 there's been a rapid rise in metal cards on the market as issuers compete to offer the most eye-popping designs. And it isn't just premium credit cards with these sleek new looks — even some low- and no-annual-fee credit cards have been getting spiffy makeovers.

Cool-looking cards make for a great conversation starter. Although this factor shouldn't be reason enough to apply for a credit card (head to our best travel credit cards guide if you need help with that) today we're going to take a look at the prettiest cards currently available.

(Notably missing from this list are invitation-only cards like the titanium-crafted Centurion Card from American Express and J.P. Morgan Reserve Card.)

Bottom line

Issuers want you to feel proud when handing over your credit card to merchants. Despite most cards on this list being made of higher-end materials than plastic I believe that the most important trait of a good-looking card is if it shuns the standard design of the name and account number on the front rather than what it's made out of. After all wallets with too many metal cards become heavy and difficult to open and close — first-world problems I know.

As a reminder although the prettiest cards are often also the most rewarding looks shouldn't be a determining factor when applying for new cards. We have plenty of resources here at The Points Guy such as our best travel credit cards guide and monthly roundup of limited-time and new welcome offers which you can refer to if you need help deciding which credit card to apply for next.

In a letter widely published on social media the presidents of Mexico Colombia and Bolivia said they backed Fernandez de Kirchner two days after a federal prosecutor requested she get a 12-year jail sentence if found guilty. She is charged with defrauding the state and involvement in a scheme to divert public funds while president from 2007 to 2015.

“This persecution aims to remove Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner from public political and electoral life as well as to bury the values and ideals she represents with the ultimate goal of implementing a neoliberal model” reads the letter.

The letter was also signed by Argentine President Alberto Fernandez who said on Monday she was a victim of a “judicial persecution.”

Center-left President Gabriel Boric of Chile did not sign the letter while Pedro Castillo of Peru retweeted it late Wednesday with the message “My solidarity with the vice president of sister republic Argentina.”

Fernandez de Kirchner one of the country’s top political figures leads the most hardline wing of the center-left Peronist coalition that has governed Argentina since the end of 2019.

The verdict and potential sentence will be decided by a judge which could take months according to local media which could affect the chances of the ruling party in the presidential election at the end of 2023.

She could appeal any decision possibly delaying the final verdict for years.

Now comes reports that her ex-financial adviser didn’t make sure the TV talk show host was financially protected. This comes from a Williams’ former attorney who spilled the beans to Page Six.

NEW YORK NY – FEBRUARY 27: Wendy Williams is seen walking in SoHo on February 27 2020 in New York City. (Photo by Raymond Hall/GC Images)

The ex-attorney LaShawn Thomas told Page Six that Wells Fargo financial adviser Lori Schiller is trying to “muddy the waters” by allegedly contributing to a false narrative that Williams’ son charged $100000 to her American Express card without her knowledge.

Twenty-two-year-old Kevin Hunter Jr. a University of Miami student denied the claims in a statement telling the U.S. Sun “I vehemently deny any allegations of unauthorized use of my mother’s American Express card. This is a false narrative perpetuated to justify freezing her accounts.”

Schiller no longer works for Williams but is entangled in her lawsuit against the bank for control over her accounts.

Williams went public earlier this year while on a unending hiatus from her former show “The Wendy Williams Show” that she could not access her accounts at Wells Fargo. The bank had filed court documents claiming Williams needed to be placed under a guardianship. In turn Williams charged that her former manager Bernie Young used “my American Express card to hire an attorney to file a petition against me.” She also said Schiller and “Wells Fargo has this guardianship petition about keeping me away from my money.”

Thomas told Page Six that she didn’t think Wells Fargo should be making decisions about Williams’ life.

“No bank should have the authority to do that. No one attempted to gain access to any of Wendy’s accounts. The Wells Fargo adviser and [former manager Bernie Young] were the only people with access. … They left Wendy to die” she said.

She added that when Schiller made the decision to freeze Williams’ account she left the former shock jock without access to money. Williams has had to use her American Express to pay for her day-to-day living expenses.

“The real issue is that Wells Fargo through their adviser refused to grant Wendy access to her own accounts; this includes the right to check her balance” Thomas said.

“Instead [Schiller] locked Wendy out of all of her accounts” Thomas claims. “[Schiller] restricted all access to every single account. Wendy was even restricted from going to the bank and personally withdrawing funds. … Wendy a woman who has worked hard for her wealth was left penniless” the statement adds.

Thomas also defended Hunter explaining that he coordinated all of Williams’ appointments “cooked and cleaned for his mothe. He absolutely loves his mother without question and no one should place any blame or allegations of wrongdoing at his feet.”

Page Six reached out to Williams’ rep who said the former radio host had no response. And Schiller didn’t respond to Page Six’s request for comment. A spokesperson for Wells Fargo did deny “any allegations of improper actions with respect to Ms. Williams’ accounts.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNwb3J0c2tlZWRhLmNvbS9iYXNrZXRiYWxsL25iYS0yazIzLWZyZWUtMzVrLXZpcnR1YWwtY3VycmVuY3ktaGVyZS1uZWVkLWRv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,NBA 2K23 Free 35k Virtual Currency: Here is what you need to do!,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.sportskeeda.com/basketball/nba-2k23-free-35k-virtual-currency-here-need-do on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNwb3J0c2tlZWRhLmNvbS9iYXNrZXRiYWxsL25iYS0yazIzLWZyZWUtMzVrLXZpcnR1YWwtY3VycmVuY3ktaGVyZS1uZWVkLWRv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen

It was March 2020—the beginning of the pandemic—and so he called a government help line. He was told that he might have the coronavirus and that he should stay home. But without leaving the house for a test Hernández couldn’t get proof of his illness—and without that proof he had no excuse for not coming into work. A week after he got sick he said his company fired him. (The firm cited “insufficient” job performance as the motive.)

Alone and newly jobless during lockdown Hernández who was thirty-two at the time considered his life. He was an engineer with expertise in the automotive industry so finding a new position wouldn’t be difficult. But he didn’t want just any new job. He wanted to work for a company that treated workers decently. His girlfriend who lived in the Basque region of northern Spain suggested that he consider a position within a group of worker-owned coöperatives there called Mondragon.

The Mondragon Corporation as it’s known is a voluntary association of ninety-five autonomous coöperatives that differs radically from a conventional company. Each co-op’s highest-paid executive makes at most six times the salary of its lowest-paid employee. There are no outside shareholders; instead after a temporary contract new workers who have proved themselves may become member-owners of their co-ops. A managing director acts as a kind of C.E.O. within each co-op but the members themselves vote on many vital decisions about strategy salaries and policy and the votes of all members whether they are senior management or blue-collar count equally.

When individual coöperatives do well their members share in the profits. When times are hard the coöperatives collectively support one another sharing funds and reallocating workers among themselves to preserve jobs. During the pandemic workers at many Mondragon co-ops voted to temporarily reduce their own salaries or hours until markets recovered; people who felt sick were trusted and encouraged to stay home. The treatment Hernández said he received when he was fired would be almost impossible within Mondragon since worker-owners must vote to dismiss one another and this can occur only in cases of very severe misconduct.

Worker-owned coöperatives are often considered both idealistic and inefficient; the model is seen as suitable mainly for upscale grocery stores or boutique bakeries in progressive towns. At a 2019 conference the economist Larry Summers characterized co-ops as intrinsically sleepy and short-sighted. “When you put workers in charge of firms and you give them substantial control over the firms” he said “the one thing you do not get is expansion. You get more for the people who are already there.” And yet Mondragon is not a sleepy grocery store. Its collection of co-ops employs around eighty thousand people and seventy-six per cent of those who work in manufacturing co-ops are owners. One makes bicycles at an industrial scale; others make elevators or produce huge industrial machines used in the production of jet engines rockets and wind turbines. Mondragon’s businesses include schools a large grocery chain a catering company fourteen technology R. & D. centers and a McKinsey-like consulting firm. In 2021 the network brought in more than eleven billion euros in revenue. The collective enforces five hundred and five types of patents and employs about twenty-four hundred full-time researchers. It also owns subsidiaries in countries including China Germany and Mexico and competes effectively in international markets winning contracts from firms such as General Electric and Blue Origin. The odds are good that key elements of something within a hundred feet of you—an espresso maker a gas grill a car—were made at Mondragon.

“We are a kind of mirror for conventional companies and in it they do not see a very beautiful image” Ander Etxeberria Mondragon’s director of coöperative dissemination told me as we drove between co-ops in the Basque country. A slender affable man who speaks many languages Etxeberria is essentially a professional explainer of Mondragon to its roughly two thousand annual visitors. It was a warm spring afternoon and he rolled down the windows and gestured to the passing countryside as we drove. A flock of sheep clustered on a hillside above the squat rectangular headquarters of a precision-machine-tooling co-op. We passed a bank a language-instruction school a grocery store a factory—each owned by its workers.

Mondragon’s network of co-ops many clustered along Spain’s Deba River has managed to survive nearly seventy years of capitalism’s creative destruction. Its persistence suggests that there are fairer and more sustainable ways of doing business. But whether a version of its model could be replicated outside of one beautiful region of northern Spain is an open question debated within Mondragon and beyond. The collective has a unique history and its density powers a rare feedback loop in which coöperative values shape institutions which then reinforce the same values spiralling outward to define an entire way of life. Mondragon is an inspiring and successful experiment. Will it ever be repeated?

The town of Mondragón in a green river valley surrounded by the Cantabrian mountains is home to some twenty-two thousand people. A medieval city occupies the town center with stone archways that soar over cobbled streets and a medieval Gothic church in a central square. The remains of José María Arizmendiarrieta the Catholic priest who founded the Mondragon coöperatives are buried inside.

Born in 1915 Arizmendiarrieta lost an eye in a childhood accident; mobilized during the Spanish Civil War but unable to take part in the fighting he still served as a Basque-language journalist for a publication opposed to the Nationalists led by Franco. He was arrested by Franco’s forces and spent a month in prison before being released. After the war he became a priest and was assigned by the Church to the town of Mondragón in 1941 when he was twenty-five.

He found that the area’s economy was deeply impoverished with virtually no middle class and that its society had been fractured by civil war. He mobilized citizens to launch civic and cultural initiatives including a soccer field a medical clinic and a housing complex for workers. Since the early twentieth century a locksmithing factory in Mondragón had been employing local boys who sometimes started at the age of fourteen clocked fifty-hour weeks and had few prospects without further education. Upon arrival Arizmendiarrieta began using the local Catholic Action center to educate young workers through study circles which met in a converted seventeenth-century palace. In 1943 Arizmendiarrieta created a technical school; students there worked at the factory in the morning and attended classes in the afternoon. Eventually he selected a group of promising workers who in the evenings began pursuing long-distance degrees in engineering. By 1956 five members who had finished their degrees left their factory jobs to launch a coöperative company that produced kerosene heaters. More industrial co-ops began appearing throughout the valley drawing workers from the technical school and collaborating with one another to share expertise. Thus was born the Mondragon experiment.

The growth of the co-ops followed a pattern. An obstacle would confront local workers and a new co-op would be created to overcome it. When in 1958 the Spanish Ministry of Labor excluded the new worker-owners from the national social-security system arguing that they were not eligible for workers’ benefits because they were also part-owners Arizmendiarrieta created an internal pension and health-care system that was itself organized as a coöperative; it still exists today supplying sick leave parental leave a generous pension unemployment benefits and medical insurance to Mondragon’s worker-owners. (The Spanish government has long since revised its position and provides coverage for co-op members in addition to that offered by Mondragon.) To meet the need for affordable financing Arizmendiarrieta organized a coöperative bank.

On my first afternoon in Mondragón Etxeberria and I walked into the dark interior of the church beside the central square. I could hear a choir rehearsing a hymn. Etxeberria pointed to the tomb of Arizmendiarrieta on one side of the central aisle. A stack of pamphlets lay beside it and I took one; it was part of a campaign to canonize the priest whom it described as “the apostle of coöperation.”

I stood for a while absorbing the atmosphere. (The Mondragon Corporation has no official position on the canonization campaign but Arizmendiarrieta is venerated even among the secular.) I saw that the pamphlet included a suggested prayer to Arizmendiarrieta and information on whom to contact if it were answered. I walked back out into the sun.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZ2h0dHBzOi8vZm9yZWlnbnBvbGljeS5jb20vMjAyMi8wOC8yNy9pbnRlcm5hdGlvbmFsLXJlbGF0aW9ucy10aGVvcnktc3VnZ2VzdHMtZ3JlYXQtcG93ZXItd2FyLWlzLWNvbWluZy_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,International Relations Theory Suggests Great-Power War Is Coming,"This week thousands of university students around the world will begin their introduction to international relations courses for the first time.

This week thousands of university students around the world will begin their introduction to international relations courses for the first time. If their professors are attuned to the ways the world has changed in recent years they will be teaching them that the major theories of international relations warn that great-power conflict is coming.

For decades international relations theory provided reasons for optimism—that the major powers could enjoy mostly cooperative relations and resolve their differences short of armed conflict.

Realist IR theories focus on power and for decades they maintained that the bipolar world of the Cold War and the unipolar post-Cold War world dominated by the United States were relatively simple systems not prone to wars of miscalculation. They also held that nuclear weapons raised the cost of conflict and made war among the major powers unthinkable.

Meanwhile liberal theorists argued that a triumvirate of causal variables (institutions interdependence and democracy) facilitated cooperation and mitigated conflict. The dense set of international institutions and agreements (the United Nations the World Trade Organization the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty etc.) established after World War II—and expanded and depended on since the end of the Cold War—provided forums for major powers to work out their differences peacefully.

Moreover economic globalization made armed conflict too costly. Why quarrel when business is good and everyone is getting rich? Finally according to this theory democracies are less likely to fight and more likely to cooperate and the major waves of democratization around the world over the past 70 years have made the globe a more peaceful place.

At the same time constructivist scholars explained how new ideas norms and identities have transformed international politics in a more positive direction. In the past piracy slavery torture and wars of aggression were common practices. Over the years however strengthening human rights norms and taboos against the use of weapons of mass destruction placed guardrails on international conflict.

Unfortunately nearly all of these pacifying forces appear to be unraveling before our eyes. The major driving forces of international politics according to IR theory suggest that the new Cold War among the United States China and Russia is unlikely to be peaceful.

Supersonic jets fly over a Russian statue.

Let us begin with power politics. We are entering a more multipolar world. To be sure the United States is still the world’s leading power according to nearly all objective measures but China has risen to occupy a strong second-place position in military and economic might. Europe is an economic and regulatory superpower in its own right. A more aggressive Russia maintains the largest nuclear weapons stockpile on Earth. And major powers in the developing world—such as India Indonesia South Africa and Brazil—are choosing a nonaligned path.

Realists argue that multipolar systems are unstable and prone to major wars of miscalculation. World War I is a classic example.

Multipolar systems are unstable in part because each country must worry about multiple potential adversaries. Indeed at present the U.S. Defense Department frets about possible simultaneous conflicts with Russia in Europe and China in the Indo-Pacific. Moreover U.S. President Joe Biden has stated that the use of military force remains on the table as a last resort to deal with Iran’s nuclear program. A three-front war is not out of the question.

Wars of miscalculation often result when states underestimate their adversary. States doubt their opponent’s power or resolve to fight so they test them. Sometimes the enemy is bluffing and the challenge pays off. If the enemy is determined to defend its interests however major war can result. Russian President Vladimir Putin likely miscalculated in launching an invasion of Ukraine incorrectly assuming that war would be easy. Some realist scholars warned for some time that a Russian invasion of Ukraine was coming and there is still the possibility that the war in Ukraine could spill across NATO’s borders turning this conflict into a direct U.S.-Russia conflagration.

In addition there is the danger that Chinese President Xi Jinping might miscalculate over Taiwan. Washington’s confusing “strategic ambiguity” policy as to whether it would defend the island only adds to the instability. Biden has said he would defend Taiwan but his own White House contradicted him. Many leaders are confused including possibly Xi. He might mistakenly believe he could get away with an attack on Taiwan—only to have the United States intervene violently to stop him.

Moreover after several U.S. presidents have threatened “all options on the table” for the Iranian nuclear program without backing it up Tehran might assume that it can make a dash for the bomb without a U.S. response. If Iran is mistaken in doubting Biden’s resolve war could result.

Russian President Vladimir Putin Chinese Defense Minister Wei Fenghe and Russian Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu watch a parade.

Realists also focus on shifts in the balance of power and worry about the rise of China and the relative decline of the United States. Power transition theory says that the fall of a dominant great power and the rise of an ascendant challenger often results in war. Some experts worry that Washington and Beijing may be falling into this “Thucydides Trap.”

Their dysfunctional autocratic systems make it unlikely that Beijing or Moscow will usurp global leadership from the United States anytime soon but a closer look at the historical record shows that challengers sometimes start wars of aggression when their expansive ambitions are thwarted. Like Germany in World War I and Japan in World War II Russia may be lashing out to reverse its decline and China may also be weak and dangerous.

Some people might argue that nuclear deterrence will still work but military technology is changing. The world is experiencing a “Fourth Industrial Revolution” as new technologies—such as artificial intelligence quantum computing and communications additive manufacturing robotics hypersonic missiles directed energy and others—promise to transform the global economy societies and the battlefield.

Many defense experts believe we are on the eve of a new revolution in military affairs. It is possible that these new technologies could like tanks and aircraft on the eve of World War II give an advantage to militaries that go on the offense making war more likely. At a minimum these new weapons systems could confuse assessments of the balance of power contributing to the above risks of miscalculation.

China for example is leading in several of these technologies including hypersonic missiles certain applications for artificial intelligence and quantum computing. These advantages—or even the false perception in Beijing that these advantages might exist—could tempt China to invade Taiwan.

A Ukrainian serviceman holds a weapon.

Even liberalism a more optimistic theory in general provides a reason for pessimism. To be sure liberals are right that institutions economic interdependence and democracy have facilitated cooperation within the liberal world order. The United States and its democratic allies in North America Europe and East Asia are more united than ever before. But these same factors are increasingly sparking conflict on the fault lines between the liberal and illiberal world orders.

In the new Cold War international institutions have simply become new arenas for competition. Russia and China are infiltrating these institutions and turning them against their intended purposes. Who can forget Russia chairing a meeting of the United Nations Security Council as its armies invaded Ukraine in February? Similarly China used its influence in the World Health Organization to stymie an effective investigation into COVID-19’s origins. And dictators vie for seats on the U.N. Human Rights Council to ensure their egregious human rights abuses escape scrutiny. Instead of facilitating cooperation international institutions are increasingly exacerbating conflict.

Liberal scholars also argue that economic interdependence mitigates conflict. But this theory always had a chicken-and-egg problem. Is trade driving good relations or are good relations driving trade? We are seeing the answer play out in real time.

The free world is recognizing that it is too economically dependent on its enemies in Moscow and Beijing and it is decoupling as fast as it can. Western corporations pulled out of Russia overnight. New legislation and regulations in the United States Europe and Japan are restricting trade and investment in China. It is simply irrational for Wall Street to invest in Chinese technology companies that are working with China’s People’s Liberation Army to develop weapons intended to kill Americans.

But China is also decoupling from the free world. Xi is prohibiting Chinese tech firms from listing on Wall Street for example because he doesn’t want to share proprietary information with Western powers. The economic interdependence between the liberal and illiberal worlds that has served as a ballast against conflict is now eroding.

Democratic peace theory says democracies cooperate with other democracies. But the central fault line in the international system today as Biden explains is “the battle between democracy and autocracy.”

To be sure the United States still maintains cordial relations with some nondemocracies such as Saudi Arabia. But the world order is increasingly divided with the United States and its status quo-oriented democratic allies in NATO Japan South Korea and Australia on one side and the revisionist autocracies of China Russia and Iran on the other. One does not need a stethoscope to detect the echoes of the free world’s conflict against Nazi Germany fascist Italy and imperial Japan.

Iranian Russian and Chinese warships take part in a joint military drill.

Finally constructivist arguments about the pacifying effects of global norms were always plagued with doubts about whether these norms were truly universal. As China engages in genocide in Xinjiang and Russia issues bloodcurdling nuclear threats and castrates prisoners of war in Ukraine we now have our gruesome answer.

Moreover constructivists might note that the democracy versus autocracy cleavage in international politics is not simply an issue of governance but of ways of life. The speeches and writings of Xi and Putin are often ideological rants about the superiority of autocratic systems and the failings of democracy. Like it or not—we are back in a 20th-century contest over whether democratic or autocratic governments can better deliver for their people adding a more dangerous ideological element to this competition.

Fortunately there is some good news. The best understanding of international politics may be found in a combination of theories. Much of humanity prefers a liberal international order and this order is only made possible by the realist military power of the United States and its democratic allies. Moreover 2500 years of theory and history suggest that democracies tend to win these hard-power competitions and autocracies flame out disastrously in the end.

Unfortunately the clarifying moments that bend history in an arc toward justice often only emerge after major-power wars.

Let’s hope that today’s incoming students are not reminiscing at their graduation ceremonies about where they were when World War III began. But IR theory gives us plenty of reasons to be concerned.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMihAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5jYnNzcG9ydHMuY29tL21sYi9uZXdzLzIwMjItbGl0dGxlLWxlYWd1ZS1iYXNlYmFsbC13b3JsZC1zZXJpZXMtc2NvcmVzLXJlc3VsdHMtYXMtaGF3YWlpLWJlYXRzLWN1cmFjYW8tZm9yLWNoYW1waW9uc2hpcC_SAYgBaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuY2Jzc3BvcnRzLmNvbS9tbGIvbmV3cy8yMDIyLWxpdHRsZS1sZWFndWUtYmFzZWJhbGwtd29ybGQtc2VyaWVzLXNjb3Jlcy1yZXN1bHRzLWFzLWhhd2FpaS1iZWF0cy1jdXJhY2FvLWZvci1jaGFtcGlvbnNoaXAvYW1wLw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,2022 Little League Baseball World Series: Scores results as Hawaii beats Curacao for championship,"Hawaii powered its way to the 2022 Little League Baseball World Series title on Sunday afternoon defeating Curacao 13-3 in Williamsport Pennsylvania. Hawaii representing the United States' West region had a dominant run in the 20-team tournament. The team from Honolulu Little League outscored opponents 60-5 and went 6-0. Hawaii defeated Tennessee in the United States title game on Saturday.

Curacao from the Caribbean region won the international championship against Chinese-Taipei but fell short Sunday. Hawaii hit back-to-back home runs to lead off the home half of the first inning and then put up seven runs in the third inning to blow the game open. This is the fourth Little League World Series title for a team from Hawaii and the second in the last four competitions.

The Little League Baseball World Series celebrated its 75th anniversary in 2022 and the event had international participants for the first time since 2019. The 2020 LLWS was canceled because of the COVID-19 pandemic. Only U.S. teams were allowed to participate in 2021 when Taylor North Little League from Michigan won the championship. Fans were also welcomed back in the stands this year as only a limited number of family members were allowed in 2021 for COVID-19 safety precautions. The MLB Little League Classic was held on Sunday Aug. 21 with the Orioles defeating the Red Sox.

On the fateful day of September 11 2001 radical Islamist outfit Al-Qaeda led by Osama bin Laden struck terror in the heart of the United States of America.

A total of 19 terrorists hijacked 4 different jetliners with the intention to carry out targeted suicide attacks. Their motive was to hit prominent buildings inflict maximum damage and cause mass casualties.

As part of their sinister plan the Los Angeles-bound American Airlines Flight 11 was hijacked by 5 Al-Qaeda terrorists. Led by terrorist Mohamed Atta they took control of the flight mid-air. The hijacked plane was then manoeuvred to crash into the North Tower of the World Trade Centre (WTC) at 8:46 am (US Eastern Time). The collision severely impacted the North Tower between 94th and 99th floor leading to a whopping 1600 deaths.

Originally built in 1973 the 1368 feet building suffered a progressive collapse. “The extraordinary robustness and redundancy of the building’s structural system meant that although a giant gash now ran across much of the north wall — severing no fewer than 35 of that wall’s 59 columns — the structure managed to redistribute the load to undamaged columns on either side of the opening maintaining its integrity” read a report by PBS.

However after standing tall for 102 minutes the North Tower came crashing down at 10:28 am (US Eastern Time). Leslie Robertson the structural engineer behind the WTC project told BBC that a possible jetliner crash was accounted for during the construction of the building.

However he regretted that the original design did not take into consideration the impact of fuel spillage from such a crash. “We had designed the project for the impact of the largest aeroplane of its time the Boeing 707. The 767 that actually hit the WTC was quite another matter again” Robertson emphasised.

He added “First of all it was a bit heavier than the 707 not very much heavier but a bit heavier. But mostly it was flying a lot faster. And then of course with the 707 to the best of my knowledge the fuel load was not considered in the design and indeed I don’t know how it could have been considered.”

Another jetliner United Airlines Flight 175 hijacked by Al-Qaeda terrorists crashed into the 1362 feet South Tower of the World Trade Centre at 9:03 am (US Eastern Time) on September 11 2011. It caused massive damage between the 77th and 85th floors.

The second attack took place just 17 minutes after American Airlines Flight 11 rammed into the North Tower. However the high-rise building collapsed within 56 minutes at 9:59 am (earlier than the collapse of the North tower). It led to the deaths of an additional 900 people.

Health impact of the Twin Tower collapse

Although the official death toll of the 9/11 attack stands at around 3000 thousands of survivors and first responders continue to suffer from lung diseases and other ailments. This is due to the exposure to the construction rubble and air-borne toxic chemical mix in the aftermath of the collapse of the Twin Towers.

“The destruction of the twin towers incinerated glass computers heating and air conditioning systems fluorescent lighting and other electrical equipment steel cement and drywall as well as human remains. The dust and smoke contained asbestos fibre heavy metals polyaromatic hydrocarbons and dioxins among other poisons” read a report in Lancet.

There have been more than 2000 deaths which have been linked to exposure to World Trade Centre Dust (WTCD). Reportedly about 1000 first responders of the September 11 attacks have been diagnosed with cancer since that fateful day.

The police firefighters and volunteers who inhaled the chemical fumes thick dust and smoke arising from the collapsed Twin Towers are 30% more prone to developing cancer than the general population.

Professor Brian W. Christman shared “Some of the firefighters who were first responders had the heaviest dust exposure. The NYC Fire Department has performed spirometry (i.e. lung function testing) longitudinally with 13 years of follow-up.”

He added “Some firefighters’ lungs aged the equivalent of 10-12 years in the first weeks to months following the attack from the dust they breathed. Those who smoked did even worse.”

Demolition of ‘Twin Towers’ in India

On August 28 using controlled demolition the Supertech Twin Towers named Ceyane and Apex in Noida were demolished at around 2:30 PM. The preparations for the demolition were going on for seven months including one month of planning and six months of onsite preparations.

The demolition was executed using 3700 KGs of explosives and it was carried out by two companies named Edifice Engineering and Jet Demolitions a South African company that holds expertise in such demolitions.

The total cost of the demolition was around 20 crores. The water sprinklers were activated within minutes of the demolition to settle the dust as soon as possible and reduce its impact on the neighbouring areas.

While the authorities race to mitigate the long term effects of the dust from this demolition we wait and see how successful they were with their planning.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRyYXZlbG9mZnBhdGguY29tL3RoZS10b3AtNS1jb3VudHJpZXMtd2hlcmUteW91cmUtbW9zdC1saWtlbHktdG8tZ2V0LXNjYW1tZWQv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,The Top 5 Countries Where You're Most Likely To Get Scammed,"Post may contain affiliate links; we may receive compensation if you click links to those products.

It's true travelers can get scammed everywhere even in Europe and other traditionally safe destinations especially when it's their first time going abroad and they haven't quite got the hang of it yet. Nevertheless there are five specific destinations where the risk of being deceived is higher and more caution is thus advised.

Going abroad and immersing yourself in a different culture can be an incredible experience but it surely does not come without its own set of challenges. On the downside most of the time your knowledge of the local language and customs will be limited and this inevitably leaves you more susceptible to scams – even online.

For that reason you may want to read up on the data compiled by the online trading platform InvestinGoal on the number of scams reported across a number of countries in 2021 ahead of boarding your flight:

5. Turkey

Continent(s): Europe Asia

Number of scams in 2021: 1938900

Turkey – officially Turkyie – is the fifth country with the highest number of online scams in the world. When planning a visit travelers are urged to book their flights and leisure activities through reliable websites as credit card cloning and data theft are much more common in Turkey compared to other European or Asian countries.

More specifically the online fraud ratio is 23 per 1000 people but it's worth noting that's only limited to cyber crimes. Sadly other types of scam have been widely reported in Turkey such as friendly shopkeepers kindly offering ‘free' samples you're later coerced to pay a fortune for and taxi drivers operating on inflated fares.

4. Russia

Continent(s): Europe Asia

Number of scams in 2021: 5330000

While we do not see tourism resuming in Russia anytime soon due to its aggression against Ukraine this cross-continental behemoth has captivated visitors for centuries having spawned novelists like Tolstoy and Dostoevsky and being a home to the Bolshoi Theater. Notwithstanding its cultural prestige Russia is the fourth most corrupt nation on this ranking.

There are currently 37 scams per 1000 people in Russia with Americans being among those affected. In fact the U.S. Department of State has dedicated an entire section of their website to internet dating scams in Russia; additionally visitors are told to beware of ‘bogus police officers‘ and unlicensed tour operators charging extortionate fees.

3. Mexico

Continent: North America

Number of scams in 2021: 5500000

America's favorite Mexico charts at an undesirable number 3. This corroborates other findings that in the short time span of three years travel scams have increased by more than 200% in one of the country's most popular beach spots. As it seems ghost agencies selling fake vacation packages are largely to blame for the reputational damage.

With 427 scams per 1000 Mexico is the only North-American country to make the top five in spite of the Government's latest pledge to fight crime more actively. Whether it's the targeting of vulnerable tourists online or Cancun's well-documented record of taxi scams Mexico still has a long way to go in becoming a fairer society.

2. India

Continent: Asia

Number of scams in 2021: 120000000

The runner-up India registers a whopping 87 per 1000 people more than double the figures of Mexico and Russia. Beyond the internet where shady operators sell the usual fraudulent packages visitors can get ripped off at unofficial ‘tourist offices' taking higher-priced cabs from the airport and falling victim to India's trademark ‘hotel switch' scam.

Additionally the U.S. lists ‘crime' and ‘terrorism' as two other reasons why Americans should not let their guards down when visiting India and maintain a high level of situation awareness transiting areas marked my conflict (e.g. along the border with neighboring Pakistan). Women may also be at a particularly high risk of danger when traveling alone.

1. Brazil

Continent: South America

Number of scams in 2021: 125410052

Crowned the Scam King by a large margin Brazil had a rate of 590 scams per 1000 people in 2021 a staggering 503 points ahead of India and an even farther 567 from number-five peaking Turkey. Although India has a population of 1.38 billion and Brazil only 212.6 million the latter still surpasses the South Asian giant in total incidents.

This may be South America's top rated sunny destination with 4650 miles of coastline and a myriad of incredible off-path places ready to be explored but traveling the continent-sized country requires careful planning in advance and a deeper knowledge of Brazilian culture. Furthermore robbery and violence remain a huge concern.

Bottomline

While InvestinGoal's data does not inform how many of these online scams have affected tourists or were related to travel specifically the research is a clear indication of countries where the practice is widespread irrespective of its nature. In Mexico and Turkey for instance tourism makes up a significant part of their GDP making this specific sector extremely profitable for criminals.

Hence in order to avoid getting scammed and having your vacation ruined when traveling to any of the above countries make sure you:

Always book leisure/tour activities via a licensed operator

Avoid making a flight or hotel reservation through a local travel agency you've never heard of or whose online reviews aren't good

Use Uber or official taxi apps where they're available (to be extra safe double check the driver's score )

) Pre-book airport and/or intercity transfers online in advance

Keep a low profile when visiting overly touristy sites where scammers and robbers are known to act ( never flash jewelry or other valuables unnecessarily)

or other valuables unnecessarily) Keep an eye on your personal belongings when approached by a random stranger however friendly they seem

when approached by a random stranger however friendly they seem When in need of help as a visitor or seeking information find the nearest tourist reception center

“We need to not be afraid right now to try stuff” he says. “If we do nothing that’s failure. We don’t have 20 more years to do this. It’s time to throw the bowl of spaghetti at the wall and see what sticks.”

As a community leader Bruchez is the liaison between many other local ranching families and TNC. TNC’s ongoing work with the community to develop better ways of growing crops involves multiple ranches whose participation is key. “It wouldn’t be possible without someone like Paul in the community” explains Derwingson. “He’s the point person for our on-the-ground projects.”

Learning how to get by with less water won’t be easy. The ecological impacts of the changing climate are complex as are the political aspects of sharing water fairly among different states industries and populations—all while leaving enough water in the river for nature.

“That’s why we need partners in the ranching community with the state and federal governments with the universities and more” Derwingson says. “It will take everyone with a stake in the system to solve this puzzle.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZ2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJsb29tYmVyZy5jb20vb3Bpbmlvbi9hcnRpY2xlcy8yMDIyLTA4LTI4L2NlbnRyYWwtb3JlZ29uLWlzLXRoZS1mdXR1cmUtb2YtdGhlLWFtZXJpY2FuLXdlc3TSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,The Future of the American West Is in Central Oregon,"Why did this happen?

Water Smartweed (Polygonum amphibium)

By Walter Fertig

Plants that occur in wetland habitats typically specialize in either growing on waterlogged but not flooded muddy soils or in the water itself (either submerged or floating on the surface). Relatively few plants are able to grow under both conditions. One such species is the Water smartweed (Polygonum amphibium) which true to its Latin epithet is an amphibious plant. It has been quite successful naturally colonizing much of North America Europe and northern Asia and has been introduced to Mexico South America and southern Africa.

Thick spikes of bright pink flowers borne on a thick naked stalk above the alternate oval leathery green leaves characterizes water smartweed. When growing on land the stems are erect to decumbent and densely pubescent (as are the leaves) and the leaf blades have sharp-pointed tips. Plants growing underwater have glabrous (hairless) stems leaves and blunt-tipped leaf blades. In the past these two different growth forms were described as separate species though research has shown that the extreme variability between forms is dampened by a nearly continuous set of morphologically intermediate plants.

Polygonum is a large and variable genus of 65-250 species depending on how taxonomists define the genus. In recent years taxonomists have been splitting the group into smaller more natural segregate genera. Water smartweed belongs to one such segregate genus Persicaria along with 100 other Polygonum species with spike-like flower clusters. The genus name Persicaria comes from the resemblance of the leaves of many species to those of Peaches (Persica in Latin).

Water smartweeds have a long history of human use. Several Plains Indian tribes used the species as a food source while other groups derived medicines from the roots stems and leaves. The term smartweed is thought to be a more sanitized version of the original word “arsmart” for the use of the plant in medieval times to relieve itching and swelling of the human posterior. More recently scientists in England have found that Water smartweeds growing in old gold mine tailings can accumulate trace amounts of gold into their tissues at levels significantly higher than expected from background levels. Some have suggested the plant could be used as a bioassay of useful minerals or to clean up badly polluted sites.

Just how warm it will get will depend on how quickly we can reduce carbon emissions and how sensitive the climate proves to be but average global temperature increases of between 2 and 3 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial norms seem most likely with some regions experiencing much worse extremes.

Nonetheless Americans are responding to these forecasts by moving in large numbers to some of the hottest driest and most vulnerable parts of the country.

According to an analysis published earlier this month by the Economic Innovation Group 10 of the 15 counties last year were in the water-strained Southwest. Since 2012 an additional 2.8 million people have moved to counties that spent the majority of the past decade under “severe” to “exceptional” drought conditions.

Leading the way in growth was Maricopa County in Arizona home to Phoenix a desert metropolis that receives more sunshine than any other major city on Earth — and averages more than 110 days with highs of at least 100°F. Average temperatures in Phoenix are already 2.5°F hotter than they were in the middle of the last century which helps explain why there were 338 heat-associated deaths last year in Maricopa County.

Despite that — and despite worse to come — the population in Maricopa increased by 14 percent over the last decade to nearly 4.5 million people. A similar pattern is at work in states like Florida and South Carolina that experience high storm and flood risk or in states like Colorado and Idaho that face major wildfire risk. Altogether according to an analysis from the real-estate site Redfin the 50 US counties with the largest share of homes facing high climate and extreme weather risk all experienced positive net migration on average between 2016 and 2020.

On the flip side the 50 US counties with the biggest share of homes facing the lowest climate and extreme weather risk like Onondaga County in upstate New York largely experienced net negative migration during the same years on average.

This bears repeating: Faced with growing costs from extreme weather disasters and the certain reality of a warmer and more disrupted future Americans have been responding by not only moving toward riskier areas but also moving away from safer ones.

Americans move for climate not climate change

What should we take away from this?

One while Americans do care about climate change when it comes to the major decisions they make it tends to rank far down on national priorities.

Gallup regularly polls Americans about what they consider to be the most important problem facing the country. In July 3 percent of Americans polled said that “environment/pollution/climate change” was the most important problem behind inflation the government abortion immigration racism crime and high oil/fuel prices among other concerns. And while the most important issues tend to fluctuate based on what’s happening in the news climate change has consistently ranked fairly low.

In other words there’s a reason the Inflation Reduction Act was called the Inflation Reduction Act.

Two given that economic concerns tend to rank so highly among Americans it shouldn’t be surprising that cost of living is a much bigger driver of where people want to live than fear of climate change or disasters. Places like the Southwest and Texas aren’t just hot dry and vulnerable to climate change — they also tend to be much cheaper to live in than coastal cities in blue states.

According to Redfin’s data of the 50 counties that had the largest share of homes facing high heat and storm risk more than 50 percent had a median home sale price that was less than half the national average at the time. Williamson County in Texas which includes parts of fast-growing Austin has the highest heat risk in the US yet it’s also the county that has seen the biggest population increase since 2016.

It’s not true that if you’re looking for a cheap place to live your only choices are deserts and floodplains. Can I interest you in Syracuse New York or Cleveland Ohio — two cities considered to be climate havens where housing is relatively cheap?

Probably not. Population in either city has dropped significantly from its earlier peak which is also true for other northern climate havens like Buffalo. (Although Buffalo just recorded its first population increase since World War II — Josh Allen fever maybe?)

What the fast-growing cities of the Southwest have going for them is just that: growth. That means more jobs and a better chance at economic mobility all while paying much less for housing than in high-wage cities on the coast. For many Americans that’s worth the trade-off of worsening heat waves and other extreme weather.

One last thing: Americans apparently just prefer it hot. A 2009 survey from Pew Research found that 57 percent of Americans preferred to live in a warmer climate compared to 29 percent who preferred a colder one. And the rise of remote work is only likely to give more people the ability to pick where they want to live.

More housing or more climate migrants

I doubt we’re going to slake Americans’ apparent thirst for as much sunshine as possible. (Though honestly as someone who prefers it at least chilly you can keep your Phoenix weather.) But unless we want a future where ever more people are in the path of ever greater climate change and weather disruptions we’ll need to make it less expensive to live in places that aren’t subject to heat waves or droughts or wildfires.

California is one example. The state’s horrific wildfires have been producing climate migrants in recent years in part because the fires can consume whole towns and in part because there’s no real way to adapt to the constant threat of smoke and destruction.

Yet people keep moving to wildfire-prone areas of the state — and often staying even after a fire destroys their home — in part because the perennially restricted housing supply in the state makes it virtually impossible to live anywhere else. A report last year found that between 1990 and 2010 half of all new homes constructed in California were built in the wildland-urban interface the zone most vulnerable to wildfire risk in part because anti-development regulations elsewhere simply make it easier and cheaper to build there.

Fighting climate change first and foremost means reducing carbon emissions but it will also require decades of adaptation — and that includes housing policies that can steer people away from those parts of the country that are already at risk by making it cheaper to live in safe areas.

This doesn’t mean that Americans can’t or shouldn’t ever move to hot dry places in the country. In their own way desert metropolises only exist because of technological adaptations to their extreme climates — population growth only truly took off in the Sunbelt after the advent of air conditioning in the second half of the 20th century. But continuing that growth in a hotter and drier 21st century will require much more than just massive AC units.

Cities like Phoenix and Las Vegas have taken major steps to get more use out of less water banking aquifers reducing waste and recycling wastewater. In Phoenix total water use is actually less than it was in the early 2000s even as its population has continued to grow and the average resident used 29 percent less water in 2019 than in 1990. Southern Nevada as well has reduced overall water use even while adding hundreds of thousands of people.

It won’t be easy though and the more extreme climate conditions become the more difficult it is to adapt. Lake Powell and Lake Mead — the two biggest artificial reservoirs in the US which help supply water to 40 million people — are now at just around 27 percent of capacity. Poorer residents are less able to afford the air conditioning that can make desert heat bearable while agriculture — which accounts for the vast majority of water consumption in the American West — will keep draining dwindling supplies.

If we’re truly going to adapt to extreme weather we’ll need to make climate havens cheaper and more attractive. And if you’re in the market for a move give Buffalo a thought! It has new apartments new jobs even new people along with something that will become increasingly rare in the future: snow.

The pretty cloudless blue skies over perfectly manicured lawns represent an ugly reality for California’s Las Virgenes Municipal Water District as it grapples with the historic megadrought ravaging the American West.

Despite a lack of any measurable rain in months the carpet of lush green grass likely means homeowners are either not getting the message about the dire need for water conservation or they are ignoring the warnings.

But now the water district has found a way to get customers’ attention. When customer service representatives are working in the different neighborhoods they keep an eye out for any water restriction violations. And for repeat offenders officials are trying something new: adding water restrictors to the pipes which sharply reduce the home’s water supply.

Lawns of the rich and famous

The District covers some of the most sought-after real estate in Southern California northwest of Hollywood and Beverly Hills including areas along the Ventura Freeway.

Las Virgenes imports all of its water from the State Water Project which pipes runoff from the northern Sierra Nevada mountains to Southern California. However at the end of winter the snowpack was just 4% of normal forcing unprecedented restrictions. Las Virgenes is only getting 5% of its requested water supplies this year.

“We’re having to supplement the water that we have been getting from the State Water Project” said Mike McNutt public affairs and communications manager for Las Virgenes who added the district is pulling water from its Las Virgenes Reservoir its stash for emergency needs just south of Thousand Oaks.

Right now McNutt confirmed it is 72% full; at full capacity it is a six-month supply. “We’ve had to take significant measures to curb water usage in order for us to ensure that there’s long-term water reliability meaning moving into the fall and winter” McNutt noted.

Nearly all of California is in severe or worse drought (the highest three designations) per the latest US Drought monitor. Several severely deficient years of rain and snow have punctuated a 20-year long megadrought scientists say is being fueled by warmer and drier conditions brought on by climate change.

When the grass being greener isn’t a good thing

In light of the shortage and the prolonged drought Las Virgenes has mandated residents cut their outdoor watering by half as required by the unprecedented order from its distributor the Metropolitan Water District of Southern California.

Outdoor watering makes up 70% of most customer’s water usage the water district says so cutting down on irrigation can have a huge impact on conservation.

“They are only allowed to water one day a week outside Tuesdays and Thursdays depending on whether your address ends with an odd number or even number” McNutt explained. On top of that each set of sprinklers can only be on for eight minutes. “It helps maybe keep some of the grass alive if people want to still continue to have lawns but they are brown.”

CNN rode along with Las Virgenes senior field customer service representative Cason Gilmer as he looked for wasted water. When he and his team drive around the coverage area they keep an eye out for water where it shouldn’t be – on sidewalks and running down streets into gutters – or outdoor irrigation on when it should be off.

“When it’s in our face and the sprinklers are going off at noon on Wednesday it’s an easy target for us” Gilmer who noted most customers seem to be doing their part now. “This street in particular was very very green two months ago.”

Along the ride the number of homes with vibrant green grass were outnumbered by brown lawns. Some lawns have been replaced with turf and others have been painted green.

Neighbors can rat on each other celebrities included

If anyone from the water district spots water waste they can leave a door tag to let the homeowner know they are not in compliance and what they need to do. They also send mailers. The water district also fines abusers resulting in charges which can reach thousands of dollars depending on the size of the infraction.

But the affluent haven of Calabasas inside the water district’s territory is home to many A-listers with deep pockets. Some of those household names – celebrities musicians and athletes – have used far more water than they should have according to recent data.

People like Kevin Hart Dwyane Wade and according to the Los Angeles Times Kourtney Kardashian as well as sister Kim.

None replied to CNN’s request for comment. However in a statement to the Times Wade and his wife actress Gabrielle Union said they have “taken drastic steps to reduce water usage in accordance with the new city guidelines and have since we moved into our home.”

Las Virgenes said all of those celebrities are in good standing now.

“Those specific celebrities have been working very closely with the district. They do want to do the right thing … in order to achieve a much more efficient water usage tier” McNutt said.

A disastrous megaflood is coming to California experts say and it could be the most expensive natural disaster in history

And when fines are not enough it’s time to bring in the restrictor

With so many wealthy residents Las Virgenes has learned some customers respond more to losing water than they do losing money.

“We try to get public education and notification and stuff about drought out there but a lot of people throw the mailers away. They ignore it” said Gilmer who created a simple yet effective way to get users’ attention one gallon at a time. “I call it a bit of a last resort.”

The water restrictor is a slim circle of food grade stainless steel with a small hole in the middle which fits right into the offending customer’s water meter which technicians can usually access right on the street since the meters are district property.

“This particular restrictor will give you around one gallon a minute. Normally a three-quarter-inch meter is 25 to 30 gallons a minute. So at 25 to 30 gallons a minute you can run your dishwasher and run your sink and have somebody in the shower and maybe even have your irrigation on and nobody knows the difference” Gilmer explained. “With the restrictor in … your sink works fine. Your shower works OK. Your irrigation will not work. It just won’t supply the amount of water that’s demanded.”

Gilmer even tried it at his own house to see what it was like having his water restricted.

“The big part was that you can’t do two things at once. So if I was in the shower and my wife tried to do dishes my shower was done. I just got out” Gilmer said with a slight smile. “My wife demanded I take it off after a day and a half.”

California drought could cut state’s hydropower in half this summer

After a customer uses more than 150% of their water allocation four times they will be in line to get the flow restrictor installed. Las Virgenes says about 1600 connections or just more than 7% of its customer base falls into this category.

“It’s not meant to be punitive” McNutt said. “It’s meant to tell people … this drought is incredibly serious and what we need you to do is do your part.”

McNutt added Las Virgenes is leading by example in California as it is “using these flow restriction devices for conservation purposes.”

“We’re kind of leading this charge moving forward of how do we get people to stop using so much water with the advancement of climate change.”"

The project will need 7000 construction workers. But currently experts say there is a national shortage of people working in the industry.

The semiconductor manufacturer Intel announced the $20 billion project earlier this year. When its two factories open in 2025 near Columbus they are expected to employ 3000 people with an average pay of around $135000.

But first the area must be developed and the semiconductor factories have to be built.

Labor leaders and state officials say Central Ohio does not have 7000 extra construction workers. Currently projects in the area include a large Hilton hotel in the capital Columbus and a $2 billion addition to The Ohio State University’s medical center. Also drug maker Amgen is planning to build a $365 million biomanufacturing plant not far from the Intel factory. Biomanufacturing uses biological systems to make medicines food and industrial products.

To win the project Ohio officials offered Intel support equal to about $2 billion including 30 years of reduced taxes.

Building is expected to go faster after Congress approved a spending law last month that aims to help the semiconductor industry and increase scientific research in the United States. The law gives more than $52 billion in support to the semiconductor industry. It also provides a 25 percent tax credit for companies that invest in computer processor plants in the U.S.

“One of Intel’s top reasons for choosing Ohio is access to the region’s robust workforce” the company said. “It will not be without its challenges but we are confident there is enough demand that these jobs will be filled.”

Federal government information says there are about 45000 construction workers in central Ohio. That number increased by 1800 from May 2021 to May 2022 which suggests a shortage given current and future demands.

“I don’t know of a single commercial construction company that’s not hiring” said Mary Tebeau. Tebeau is with the Builders Exchange of Central Ohio a construction industry trade group.

Including overtime pay for skilled tradespeople could hit $125000 each year said Dorsey Hager of the Columbus Building Trades Council.

Jon Husted is Ohio’s lieutenant governor. He said the Intel project is so big it will involve people who did not consider construction jobs before.

“When you’re willing to pay people more to do something you will find the talent” he said. Talent is a word to describe skills or people who have skills.

Will there be enough homes?

Some workers in the home construction industry will likely move to the building construction jobs. The change will likely reduce the limited supply of homebuilders said Ed Brady of the Home Builders Institute a trade group.

Ed Dietz of the National Association of Home Builders explained that reductions in the number of homebuilders risk a housing shortage. He said a shortage could slow the economic development that Intel is trying to create.

Dietz asked “How do you attract those business investments if you can’t also provide additional housing available for the growth in the labor force?”

The population of Central Ohio is expected to reach 3 million by 2050. That rate would require 11000 to 14000 houses built each year. That estimate came before Intel’s project was announced said Jennifer Noll. She is with the Mid-Ohio Regional Planning Commission. In 2020 the region was able to build only 11000 homes.

“We know we’ve got some work to do as a region” Noll said.

“People want to offer money or give something in return but a Commissioner cannot accept anything.”

His role involves any kind of witnessing or signing of documents and he also assists the Gardaí carrying out their duties by signing summonses when necessary.

“To hold the post you have to be nominated and cleared through vetting and there has to be an opening – a need for that service – where you live.”

Brian’s role is to take statutory declarations witness signatures on documents if required by various authorities and sign certificates and orders under various legal acts.

“I don’t offer any kind of legal advice or get involved in any kind of legal argument. The Peace Commissioner’s role is not about that” he said.

As to how someone who needs a passport form or an affidavit signed can get hold of him Brian is very happy to have his phone number – 087 6577023 – in the public arena.

As per sources the Army is looking to procure around 480 Futuristic Infantry Combat Vehicles (FICV) to replace its traditional BMP-2 — the Soviet-era amphibious infantry fighting vehicle acquired by the Army in the 1980s. An Acceptance of Necessity (AoN) for the platform is expected to be accorded in the next Defence Acquisition Council (DAC) meeting.

Sources further said that the modalities for procuring Nag Missile Systems (NAMIS) for the Recce & Support (Tracked) Battalions and Infantry Combat Vehicle Command (ICV Comd) as the Command & Control platform are being drawn up. Last month the DAC accorded amendment to AoN for 13 NAMICA and 293 Nag missiles. The DAC then had also granted AoN for 177 ICV Comd.

As part of the modernisation plans the Army is also planning to procure 105 new Wheeled Armoured Fighting Vehicles (Wh AFV) to replace BRDMs which are combat reconnaissance patrol vehicles. In June the AoN for 105 Wh AFV and 1080 ATGMs was granted by the DAC.

Other procurement plans include getting new Wheeled Infantry Combat Vehicle (Wh ICV) for Standard Mechanised Infantry Battalions (Wheeled) and Light Armoured Multi-Purpose Vehicle (LAMV) with greater mobility and protection for Recce Platoon which will replace the existing modified Maruti Gypsy. The RFI for this was floated last month.

Additionally existing equipment with the Mechanised Infantry are also being heavily upgraded with contemporary technologies. For instance the BMP-2 is being upgraded for enhanced night-fighting capability which will include Thermal Imager based Driver Night Sight and Commander Thermal Imaging (TI) Sight for the driver and the commander of the BMP-2.

The Army is also looking at various indigenous options as it plans to buy a range of contemporary third generation Fire and Forget ATGMs for enhanced firepower and is in the process of acquiring Canister Launched Loiter Munition System to be integrated on BMP-2/ Carrier Mortar Tracked (CMT) chassis so that they can take out targets beyond visual range.

Other planned upgrades include acquiring anti-drone capability to engage aerial targets mini UAVs See Through Armour Autonomous Combat Vehicle and Artificial Intelligence-based Integrated Surveillance for enhancing its ISR capabilities.

The Mechanised Infantry and the Armoured Corps are working on a joint project for getting Integrated Surveillance & Targeting System (ISAT-S) on BMP & Tank chassis.

Sources said multiple projects are also in the pipeline for “better survivability modern navigation aids effective communication and critical operational logistic requirements of Mechanised Infantry in the battlefield”.

“A twin approach has been adopted for the Mechanised Infantry which includes replacing vintage equipment with futuristic platforms and capability enhancement of existing equipment through upgrades” a defence source said.

Capability Of ZORAWAR:

“It will have equal firepower as the present tank including missile firing. The power to weight ratio will make it very agile” sources in the security establishment said. “The project is moving very very well. The Acceptance of Necessity (AoN) from the Defence Acquisition Council is expected next month” a source stated. The recent experiences along the northern borders have shown that armour equipment profile is one of the most prominent factors in defining the operational capability of land forces a source said while noting that China has inducted a large number of state-of-the-art medium and light tanks. “This increased threat on the northern borders is likely to remain a threat in the foreseeable future” the source said.

Can operate in varying terrain:

Zorawar is designed to operate in varying terrain from high altitude areas and marginal terrains to island territories. It will be highly transportable for rapid deployment to meet any operational situation and feature niche technologies including Artificial Intelligence (AI) drone integration active protection systems and a high degree of situational awareness officials said. Officials noted that while the large tank fleet consisting of T-72 and T-90 tanks is useful in gaining tactical surprise over the adversary they are heavy tanks primarily designed for operations in the plains and in desert terrains and face certain limitations at high altitudes or when deployed in the marginal terrain of the Rann of Kutch the source cited earlier said.

It’s Necessity:

It is an operational necessity to procure a lighter tank to overcome the limitations and design and develop it indigenously the source said. “The adversity which the world supply chain has experienced in defence-related component supplies due to the Russia-Ukraine war has impacted both the manufacturing and sustenance of the foreign fleet of tanks that India is presently holding” the source said. The project which has already received in-principle approval is planned to be procured under the ‘Make-I’ acquisition category of the Defence Acquisition Procedure (DAP)-2020 in line with the ‘Make in India’ initiative. The agile ‘Zorawar’ will improve the Indian Army’s operational capabilities especially in the northern borders.

Apple privacy

There's the perception that Apple as a company has a hard-line stance against advertising and complaints have sprung up that its ad ventures are hypocritical. However the truth is more complicated than that.

The Cupertino tech giant has gone toe-to-toe with companies like Facebook in the past over invasive advertising platforms. At the same time Apple has been growing its own small advertising business.

Those two goals are not at odds with each other. More than that Apple's own advertising endeavors aren't a signal that the company is going to become more like Meta or Google going forward.

Apple isn't against ads — it's for privacy

It's easy to think of Apple as a company sternly in opposition to modern advertising as evidenced by its apparent campaigns against the primary revenue drivers of companies like Facebook.

However that isn't the truth at all. Apple isn't against advertising. Instead it has debuted features aimed at preventing a very specific type of advertising model: ads based on invasive data collection. It's the kind of revenue model that Meta formerly known as Facebook was built on.

Apple's App Tracking Transparency — which Facebook loudly campaigned against — allows customers to ask apps not to track them across other websites and services. It doesn't block data harvesting outright it only puts the power back in the hands of consumers.

Apple isn't against advertising it's against invasive tracking to target ads.

This is objectively a good thing for online privacy. Even if a user has no problem handing out mountains of data to Meta Google or another company there are reasons to be suspicious of invasive advertising.

Meta's own history with data storage and collection is shaky. The company has been hit for sharing data without user consent.

Facebook has also violated laws related to getting permission from users before harvesting certain types of data such as biometric information.

Apple's own ads business

Apple is slowly growing its own first-party advertising business while also increasing the privacy for its users. It's important to remember that those two goals are not in opposition to each other.

The iPhone maker has long been in the advertising market even if its own offerings have been small. You might think of Apple advertising as a program executed from the mind of Tim Cook but you'd be wrong. Steve Jobs himself launched the iAd platform in 2010 with the stated goal of taking 50% of the mobile ad market.

That endeavor largely failed and Apple's current first-party ad placement business is still in its nascent stages. But it's growing.

The company current allows developers to place ads in search results on the App Store. Soon it'll allow for other ads throughout its app marketplace — and elsewhere across its platforms.

Apple Search Ads are an example of a first-party paid ad placement.

At first glance Apple might seem hypocritical for tamping down on the ads business of Meta while growing its own. Apple's ads business is built differently however.

Apple doesn't track users and it doesn't use highly targeted advertising metrics. That means the ads that are shown to you in the App Store aren't based on sensitive information like your religion policies or health data. There's also no comprehensive profile of you on Apple's platforms.

Although this ad strategy may seem like it's good for consumers and bad for businesses wanting to advertise Apple has released data suggesting that privacy-preserving ad tech results in the same performance as highly targeted ads.

So again Apple isn't against advertising. It just prefers user privacy while still hosting ads.

First-party ads

As a massive technology company Apple understands the advertising business from both a first- and third-party perspective. Apple places ads from other companies on its platforms but it also runs its own advertising campaigns.

Apple's own ads have been exceptionally well-executed from its famous iPod commercials to more recent award-winning ad spots. Over the years Apple's ads have changed in tone to focus more on hardware. However they've always been consistent.

Apple has used its own ads and commercials to highlight privacy features.

There are also of course the ""Privacy. That's iPhone"" ads. You could see an ad for a product meant to cut down on targeted advertising as an oxymoron but it illustrates that Apple isn't against advertising — it's only against highly targeted ads based on invasive data collection.

The point of this is that Apple understands advertising from an advertiser's perspective. It's a for-profit company that wants to sell products so Apple isn't and will never be against advertising.

Apple has made some missteps in its first-party advertising to be sure. Earlier in 2022 for example it appeared to experiment with placing first-party ads for its original podcasts in Apple Music — a platform clearly touted as ad-free.

However no company is going to be perfect. That's especially true given the scope and breadth of the products and services that Apple makes. The important part is that even though it's a trillion-dollar tech giant it hasn't (perhaps hasn't yet) succumbed to the temptation to harvest and sell truckloads of data about its users to whoever will pay for it.

Privacy should be a choice

Companies like Meta will argue that its products are democratic and free because of their extensive data collection practices and that Apple's own products are only ""for the rich."" Despite the obvious wrongness of the latter statement which is more intended to generate an emotional response than be an actual argument there's more to it than even that.

It's true that harvesting mountains of data on users and then using that data to target advertising is lucrative. It's also true that this revenue model allows for subsidized use of social media platforms and services.

However a balance must be struck. Making your platform accessible to a wide range of people is an admirable goal but that shouldn't — and must not — come at the cost of the fundamental human right to privacy.

Facebook is notorious for its invasive tracking.

This is especially true because access to mountains of consumer data can be dangerous. Highly targeted ads and expertly tuned algorithms can fuel a range of issues including the spread of misinformation and hate speech.

Apple has long understood this. Its pro-privacy stance — rare among tech giants — stretches back to the era of Steve Jobs.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMijgFodHRwczovL3d3dy5idXNpbmVzcy1zdGFuZGFyZC5jb20vYXJ0aWNsZS9pbnRlcm5hdGlvbmFsL2FidXNlLW9mLXBvd2VyLXVzLWxpa2VseS10by1wcm9iZS1hcHBsZS1vdmVyLWFudGktbWFya2V0LXByYWN0aWNlcy0xMjIwODI3MDAyNDlfMS5odG1s0gGSAWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJ1c2luZXNzLXN0YW5kYXJkLmNvbS9hbXAvYXJ0aWNsZS9pbnRlcm5hdGlvbmFsL2FidXNlLW9mLXBvd2VyLXVzLWxpa2VseS10by1wcm9iZS1hcHBsZS1vdmVyLWFudGktbWFya2V0LXByYWN0aWNlcy0xMjIwODI3MDAyNDlfMS5odG1s?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Abuse of power: US likely to probe Apple over anti-market practices,"After taking on Meta (Facebook) and Google with antitrust lawsuits the US Department of Justice (DOJ) is reportedly drafting an antitrust case against Apple alleging that the company ""abused its market power to stifle smaller tech companies including app developers and competing hardware makers"".

According to a report in the Politico citing sources the Justice Department is ""in the early stages of drafting a potential antitrust complaint against Apple"".

""Various groups of prosecutors inside the DOJ are assembling the pieces for a potential lawsuita and the department's antitrust division hopes to file suit by the end of the year"" the report said.

Both DOJ and Apple did not comment on the report.

However the Justice Department is yet to make a firm decision on ""whether or when to sue Apple the world's most valuable public company"".

It is still possible ""no case will be filed"".

If filed it will be the first antitrust lawsuit by the DOJ against Big Tech under the US President Joe Biden's administration.

European antitrust watchdogs have filed antitrust cases against Apple over its App Store fees and the iPhone's treatment of tap-to-pay technology.

The Justice Department has been investigating Apple since 2019 over allegations that it abused its market power to stifle smaller tech companies.

In May a US judge denied Apple's appeal to dismiss an amended antitrust lawsuit filed by the creator of Cydia an app store for jailbroken iPhones.

Cydia developer Jay Freeman first filed a lawsuit against Apple in 2020 alleging that Apple ""has wrongfully acquired and maintained monopoly power"" in iOS app distribution and payments.

Freeman shut down the Cydia store in 2018.

Meanwhile Epic Games the maker of Fortnite game challenged Apple for its stand that third-party app stores would compromise the iPhone's security.

Last year a US judge ruled in the Epic Games v. Apple district court case that Apple did not have a monopoly in the relevant market.

Shares of Tesla (TSLA -2.04%) have shot up by nearly 15000% over the past decade as the disruptive company established itself as the leading player in the electric vehicle (EV) space.

That remarkable upward run has brought Tesla's market capitalization to $930 billion as of this writing making it the sixth-largest public company in the world. Apple (AAPL -0.69%) meanwhile is the world's largest company with a market cap of nearly $2.7 trillion. Tesla has a long way to go if it's going to catch up to the iPhone maker. Could the EV leader manage it by 2030?

Tesla is growing at a faster pace than Apple

Starting from a far smaller base Tesla's market cap has increased at a much faster pace than Apple's over the past decade.

The eye-popping growth of Elon Musk's company isn't too surprising as it operates in a market that is still taking off. Apple on the other hand reaps nearly half of its revenue from selling smartphones the market for which has already matured.

For instance in 2021 sales of EVs doubled year over year to a record 6.6 million units according to the International Energy Agency. The impressive growth has continued in 2022 when 2 million EVs were sold in the first quarter alone -- a 75% jump over the prior-year period. On the other hand according to research firm Gartner smartphone sales increased by 6% in 2021. On the one hand that small increase brought unit sales to 1.43 billion devices. On the other the industry has run into trouble in 2022 with sales down 9% year over year in the second quarter due to a combination of oversupply and inflation.

The respective health of the EV and the smartphone markets is naturally reflected in Tesla's and Apple's latest results. Tesla's total revenue shot up 43% year over year to $16.9 billion in the second quarter. Adjusted earnings jumped 57% year over year to $2.27 per share driven by fatter margins. Tesla's non-GAAP operating margin was up 358 basis points over the year-ago quarter to 14.6% thanks to an increase in the average selling price of its vehicles.

Apple's growth was nowhere near that rapid but that's not surprising given its massive scale. For its fiscal 2022 third quarter which ended June 25 Apple's revenue increased 2% year over year to $83 billion. That was nearly five times Tesla's revenue. With a sales base that huge even a multibillion-dollar top-line gain would translate into a small increase in percentage terms.

But at the same time it is also worth noting that the pace of growth in Tesla's end market is far greater than is occurring in Apple's end markets. That's where Tesla's advantage lies.

Can the EV specialist eclipse the world's largest company by the end of the decade?

Sales of EVs are expected to grow at a rapid pace through 2030. AlixPartners estimates that a third of all vehicles sold by 2028 will be EVs with the proportion increasing to 54% by 2035. That would be a big jump over the first quarter of 2022 when EVs accounted for 10% of global vehicle sales. With overall vehicle sales expected to jump to 122.8 million units in 2030 from 85.3 million units in 2020 Tesla's addressable market is set to increase rapidly.

Meanwhile the global smartphone market is expected to clock 7.6% annualized growth through 2030. That pales in comparison to the 29% annualized growth expected in EV sales through the end of the decade. Tesla therefore is in a solid position to grow its revenue and earnings at a faster pace than Apple through 2030.

Not surprisingly analysts expect Tesla's earnings to grow at an average of 45% annually over the next five years a pace that it could sustain beyond that given the market opportunity ahead of it. Apple is expected to clock annual earnings growth of 9.5% over the next five years. This explains why The Future Fund an Australian wealth fund anticipates that Tesla's market capitalization will hit $4 trillion in 2030.

All this indicates that Tesla could keep growing its market capitalization at a faster pace than Apple over the next eight years as it has done in the past and that could make this electric vehicle play more valuable than the iPhone maker by 2030.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiY2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZhc3Rjb21wYW55LmNvbS85MDc4MTc3OS93aGF0LXRoZS1vcGVuLWFwcC1tYXJrZXRzLWFjdC1tZWFucy1mb3ItdGhlLWZ1dHVyZS1vZi1iaWctdGVjaNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,What the Open App Markets Act means for the future of Big Tech,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.fastcompany.com/90781779/what-the-open-app-markets-act-means-for-the-future-of-big-tech on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiY2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZhc3Rjb21wYW55LmNvbS85MDc4MTc3OS93aGF0LXRoZS1vcGVuLWFwcC1tYXJrZXRzLWFjdC1tZWFucy1mb3ItdGhlLWZ1dHVyZS1vZi1iaWctdGVjaNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen

The production of a metal replica using our process consists of four steps: master structure fabrication replication using the Glassomer nanocomposite glass transformation via heat treatment of the nanocomposite and finally metal casting. Figure 1 illustrates the workflow schematically. The production of a master structure requires a free shaping method with an optical surface finish. We fabricated the master structure using 2-photon polymerisation which is a 3D printing technology capable of printing photoresins with a resolution of down to 100 nm2526 and a surface roughness in the single nanometre range23 (see Fig. 1a). The printed template is subsequently replicated into polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) (see Fig. 1a). The PDMS is capable of casting features down to 500 nm27 and is transparent to light down to 280 nm. As illustrated in Fig. 1b the liquid nanocomposite is poured on the PDMS-Replication mould and cured by UV light at a wavelength of 365 nm resulting in the so-called “green part”. If necessary the green part can be further post processed using conventional subtractive polymer shaping technologies28. The green part is subsequently converted into transparent fully-dense fused silica glass via thermal debinding and sintering at a maximum temperature of 1300 °C as previously described28 (see Fig. 1c). The Glassomer L50 nanocomposite has a solid loading of 50 vol% which results in an isotropic linear shrinkage of 20.6% during the sintering process. For the metal casting the fused silica replication is embedded in a phosphate-bonded embedding material (see Fig. 1d). Before casting the melting chamber is flushed twice with nitrogen. The melting of the metal takes place under vacuum (10−1 bar) preventing the formation of oxide layers which can lead to defects in the casted metal surface. While pouring the liquid metal a nitrogen overpressure of 3 bar is generated in the casting chamber which ensures conformal replication from the embedded fused silica replication.

Replication quality and characterization

We have successfully used this process for the replication of high-temperature melting metals such as bronze (1050 °C) brass (1020 °C) and cobalt-chromium (1440 °C). All of these temperatures are below the softening point of fused silica which is 1665 °C29. In terms of processing properties bronze offers very good castability at moderate melting temperatures. Furthermore bronze is relatively corrosion-resistant and has a high thermal conductivity which makes it a material of choice for variothermal injection moulding830. Similarly brass has good processing properties but can also be nickel-plated without pretreatment which results in a considerable increase in hardness31. The cobalt-chromium alloy was chosen as a casting material because of its significantly higher hardness32. All three metals could be replicated from the sintered fused silica replication and demoulded to form injection-moulding compatible metal inserts. No release agent was necessary to remove the metal replications from the fused silica mould as the metal does not bond with the fused silica components. The fused silica moulds were used only once for the metal casting this was to ensure that a consistent quality of the metal replications could be achieved. Using high-temperature metals is of great importance for the subsequent injection moulding process since these can withstand both the repeated temperature changes and due to their higher mechanical strength and the stresses of the moulding process. In order to determine the minimum feature resolution for each metal type lines-and-space structures were produced and replicated using the described method (see Fig. 2). The lines are tapered having a width between 30 µm (bottom) and 3 µm (top) and a height of 23.5 µm in the master structure. The structures were characterized in each replication step using white light interferometry (WLI). Figure 2a shows the cross-sections of the investigated master structure (black) the fused silica replication (blue) and the respective replicated metal replications (red yellow green). The minimum feature resolution was determined by the minimum width of the generated metal structures measured by WLI. As shown in Fig. 2a the minimum feature resolution is 5.2 µm for bronze 7.5 µm for brass and 5 µm for cobalt-chromium. The difference in size between the master structure and fused silica replication is due to shrinkage during the sintering process. The measured shrinkage from the master structure to the fused silica replication is 20.9%. This is illustrated in Fig. 2b c where a lens is shown as a master structure with a diameter of 8.91 mm and as a fused silica replica with a diameter of 7.04 mm. This value is in good accordance with the calculated shrinkage of 20.6% (see supplementary material). The shrinkage from the fused silica replication to the metal insert was measured to be 2.0% 2.3% and 1.8% for bronze brass and cobalt-chromium respectively. The overall shrinkage from the master structure to the metal insert is thus 22.60% 22.85% and 22.45% for bronze brass and cobalt-chromium respectively. It is important to note that the solidification shrinkage of metals is a complex phenomenon3334 that can only be predicted to a limited extent. It is therefore necessary to assess this shrinkage experimentally. Due to the mismatch of thermal expansion coefficients of fused silica and metals there is a risk of the fused silica being enclosed by the molten metal. As commonly employed in replication processes demoulding chamfers can be included in the design of the master structure in order to prevent this problem. To allow for high-resolution replication of polymeric components using the metal moulds the shrinkage during the fused silica sintering process and the metal replication process needs to be compensated in the fabrication of the master structure. Depending on the manufacturing method used to fabricate the master structure this process related shrinkage must be taken into account as well. In order to investigate the achievable surface quality metal inserts were prepared from an unstructured fused silica surface. Without further post-treatment a surface roughness of 2 nm (R q ) was measured using atomic force microscope (AFM) for the sintered fused silica components28. The achievable surface roughness in the casted metal inserts are measured to be only slightly higher with 8.0 nm 9.0 nm and 11.0 nm (R q ) on an area of 100 µm² (see Fig. 2e Supplementary Fig. 1a–c) for bronze brass and cobalt-chromium respectively. A total of nine measurements was carried out at different positions and different sized areas in order to assess the surface quality across a large lateral area. Using the WLI on a larger area (350 × 350 µm2) the surface roughnesses were found to be 35 nm 28 nm and 31 nm (S q ) for bronze brass and cobalt-chromium respectively. Vickers hardness was measured for all three metals to evaluate the wear resistance of the moulds during the injection moulding process4 (see Fig. 2f). Common industrially employed moulds for plastic injection moulding of optical components are made from tooling steels with around 510–560 in Vickers hardness (HV)68. According to literature values in the range of 120 HV are expected for the casted bronze35 and brass36 components. Our measurements showed a value of 151 HV for bronze and 157 HV for brass and thereby exceed the literature values slightly. For the significantly harder cobalt-chromium dental alloy 445 HV was measured which is only slightly lower than the values expected from commercial tooling steels. As higher hardness values are desirable for injection moulding tools to extend the tool’s service life time hardening techniques such as quenching or precipitation hardening are commonly employed which are unfortunately not accessible for copper-based alloys such as bronze and brass. However an alternative is electroplating with hard nickel a technique which achieves hardness values above 500 HV according to literature31. We thus coated casted brass metal moulds with a 70 µm layer of hard nickel achieving a hardness value of 670 HV. Similar hardness values of 667 HV were achieved for nickel plated cobalt-chromium metal inserts. The Ni coating must be considered in the design depending on the used plating technique and the layer thickness.

Injection moulding

In order to assess the injection moulding compatibility of the casted metal inserts we prepared bronze metal inserts with a dot matrix structure. The metal inserts were produced using the outlined process followed by injection moulding in a commercial injection moulding system (Arburg Allrounder 370 S 500–100) as shown schematically in Fig. 3a. Figure 3b shows the assembled mould used for injection moulding with polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) (see Fig. 3c). To analyze the durability of the metal insert more than 2000 PMMA components were produced and measured using WLI. Figure 3d shows the cross-section of the manufactured and used metal insert (black graph) the first manufactured polymer replica (red graph) and the 2000th polymer replica (blue graph). The cross-section shows no notable change after 2000 replication cycles (for further information see supplementary section).

Process variants

To demonstrate the applicability of the replicative metal moulding technique various structures from nature and technology with a size from several cm to structures of a few µm were replicated (see Fig. 4 a–e). These were moulded in PDMS directly from existing objects no master structure produced by 2-photon polymerisation was used. Bionic structures like the wing of a cicada or a human fingerprint could be directly replicated using the metal casting process (see Fig. 4a b). Feature sizes in the range of several tens of micrometres were replicated successfully into cobalt-chromium and brass. Further we show the successful replication of refractive and diffractive microoptical elements. Figure 4c shows a microoptical lens array with lens diameters of 30 µm in brass. The sample in Fig. 4c shows a surface defect resulting from a contaminated fused silica surface. Defects of this nature can be avoided by working under clean room conditions. Figure 4d shows diffractive line-and-space structures with line widths between 5 and 25 µm in bronze. Figure 4e shows the mirror surface finish replicated from an unstructured fused silica part without post treatment after casting in bronze brass and cobalt-chromium using the described process. A further modification of the process also allows the direct production of a 3D-Mould from the polymer nanocomposite as schematically depicted in Fig. 4f. This allowed the direct production of moulds in the nanocomposite polymer for metal casting without the use of a master structure via 3D-Printing. After sintering the printed mould can directly be filled with liquid metal resulting in a metal part like shown in Fig. 4g in bronze brass and cobalt-chromium. The lines created by the 3D-Printing process can be seen in the metal as shown again in Fig. 4i j.

In this paper we demonstrated a replicative manufacturing process allowing rapid and cost-efficient production of metal inserts for polymer replication with low surface roughness using a replication technique. We have shown that high-temperature metals like bronze brass and cobalt-chromium can be successfully shaped with a feature size down to 5 µm and single nanometre surface roughness. The inserts were successfully used in industrially-established polymer injection moulding instruments generating thousands of components. This process thus enables the flexible and cost-efficient production of metal inserts with low surface roughness by a replication process for tool based manufacturing like injection moulding or hot-embossing bypassing the common problems of classical tool manufacturing such as high per-mould costs and processing times commonly associated with the high costs of classical moulding tools.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiL2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmV1cmVrYWxlcnQub3JnL25ld3MtcmVsZWFzZXMvOTYyNjU10gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Weaving atomically thin seams of light with in-plane heterostructures,"Tokyo Japan – Researchers from Tokyo Metropolitan University have developed a way to produce high quality monolayers of a selection of different transition metal dichalcogenides which meet over an atomically thin seam. By coating this layer with an ion gel a mixture of an ionic liquid and a polymer they could excite light emission along the seam. The light was also found to be naturally circularly polarized a product of the customizable strain across the boundary.

Light-emitting diodes (LEDs) have become ubiquitous through their revolutionary impact on nearly all forms of lighting. But as our needs diversify and performance demands grow there is still a clear need for even more power efficient solutions. One such option involves the application of in-plane heterostructures where ultra-thin layers of different materials are patterned onto surfaces to produce boundaries. In the case of LEDs this is where electrons and “holes” (mobile voids in semiconducting materials) recombine to produce light. The efficiency functionality and scope of applications for such structures are determined not only by the materials used but by the dimensions and nature of the boundaries which has led to a great deal of research into controlling their structure at the nanoscale.

A team of researchers led by Associate Professor Yasumitsu Miyata of Tokyo Metropolitan University Assistant Professor Jiang Pu and Professor Taishi Takenobu of Nagoya University have been investigating the use of a class of materials known as transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs) a family of substances containing a group 16 element from the periodic table and a transition metal. They have been using a technique known as chemical vapor deposition to controllably deposit elements onto surfaces to create atomically thin monolayers; much of their work has been to do with how such monolayers can be varied to create patterns with different regions made of different TMDCs.

Now the same team have succeeded in significantly refining this technology. They redesigned their growth chamber so that different materials could be moved closer to the substrate in a set sequence; they also introduced additives to change the vaporization temperature of each component allowing for optimized conditions for the growth of high-quality crystalline layers. As a result they succeeded in using four different TMDCs to create six different types of sharp atomically thin “seams.” Furthermore by adding an ion gel a mixture of an ionic liquid (a fluid of positive and negative ions at room temperature) and a polymer a voltage could be applied across the seams to produce electroluminescence the same basic phenomenon underlying LEDs. The customizability of their setup and the high quality of their interfaces makes it possible to explore a wide range of permutations including different degrees of “misfit” or strain between different TMDCs.

Interestingly the team discovered that the boundary between a monolayer of tungsten diselenide and tungsten disulfide produced a “handed” form of light known as circularly polarized light a direct product of the strain at the seam. This new degree of control at the nanoscale opens up a world of possibilities for how their new structures may be applied to real devices particularly in the field of quantum optoelectronics.

COM and COT were successfully synthesized under the optimized reaction conditions obtained from our previous studies5253. The FTIR spectra of the newly prepared polyols are shown in Fig. S1. As stated in the supporting information the chemical structures of the synthesized COM and COT are consistent with the results of our previous studies5253. The hydroxyl values of CO COM and COT measured according to the ASTM D1957-86 standard were 160 270 and 380 mg KOH g−1 respectively.

Structural analysis of the SSPCMs

The chemical structures of the synthesized SSPCMs were analyzed by FTIR spectroscopy and the results are presented in Fig. 1. The disappearance of the isocyanate peak at 2265 cm−1 in all the SSPCM spectra indicates that the PUs were successfully synthesized. The newly formed absorbance bands at 3341 and 1539 cm−1 correspond to the N–H stretching and amide vibration within the PU bond respectively. The FTIR analysis did not show a significant difference in the spectra in terms of the functionality of the crosslinker or the type of isocyanate.

Crystalline structure analysis of the SSPCMs

The crystal structures of the SSPCMs were analyzed by XRD analysis and the results are presented in Fig. 2. Two strong diffraction peaks were detected in all the SSPCMs spectra indicating that the SSPCMs had crystalline structures. PEG is known to exhibit sharp diffraction peaks at 19.1° (120) and 23.3° (032) implying that it is a semi-crystalline polymer with high crystallinity. The XRD patterns of the SSPCMs also showed peaks at 19.1° (120) and 23.3° (032) suggesting that the crystallinity of SSPCM is dominated by crystallinity of PEG. Compared to the XRD pattern of PEG the SSPCMs had a lower peak intensity and a broader full width at half maximum. The crosslinked structure formed by hyperbranched polyols partially confined the PEG chain which led to a decrease in the degree of crystallinity. Meanwhile a significant difference in the degree of crystallinity was observed depending on the isocyanate type used. For PEG the peak corresponding to the (032) plane in the XRD pattern had a higher intensity than that to the (120) plane. However for the SSPCMs prepared using MDI the intensity of the peak corresponding to the (032) plane decreased; for the SSPCMs prepared using HDI the crystal structure of the pristine PEG was retained as the functionality of the crosslinker increased. The reduced intensity of the peak corresponding to the non-equatorial (032) plane of the SSPCMs prepared using MDI implied that thinner PEG lamellae and tilt of the PEG chain in the lamellae were generated with the formation of the crosslinked structures54. This was more prominent for the SSPCMs prepared using MDI because the rigid benzene ring further confines the PEG chain41.

For further analysis of the crystal structure of the synthesized SSPCMs the crystal morphologies of the pristine PEG and the SSPCMs were recorded through POM and the results are shown in Fig. 3. All SSPCM samples demonstrated cross-extinction patterns caused by polarized light. As shown in Fig. 3a the crystal of pristine PEG grew to several millimeters in size while the synthesized SSPCMs demonstrated a decrease in the crystal size because the crosslinked structure limited the motion of the soft segment. The crystal structure remained unchanged when the temperature of the SSPCMs was raised to the phase transition temperature. However as the temperature reached the transition point the crystal structure began to disappear and eventually no crystal features could be observed in the POM image (Fig. 3e and i). As shown in Fig. 4 the SSPCMs remained in the solid state even at a high temperature close to the phase transition temperature. The solid–liquid phase transition did not occur in all the synthesized SSPCMs even at temperature higher than the transition point.

Phase transition properties of the SSPCMs

DSC analysis was performed to examine the phase transition properties of the synthesized SSPCMs. The five consecutive DSC scans after heating and cooling of the pristine PEG and SSPCMs are presented in Figs. S2 and 5 respectively. For the pristine PEG the solid–liquid phase transition resulted in very sharp exothermic and endothermic peaks in the range of 20–70 °C. The DSC scans for all SSPCMs also exhibited distinct exothermic and endothermic peaks suggesting that the SSPCMs had reversible thermal storage and release properties. A consecutive heating–cooling test was performed to verify the potential reusability of the SSPCMs. The DSC thermograms remained unchanged during the test. The phase transition properties based on the five consecutive DSC scans are summarized in Table 2. The exothermic and endothermic enthalpies of all SSPCM structures were significantly lower than those of the pristine PEG. This implies that the heat storage and release capacities of the synthesized SSPCMs were lower than those of the pristine PEG. The solid–solid phase transition of the SSPCMs is due to the transformation of the PEG soft segment from a crystalline to an amorphous state. The PEG chains in the SSPCM structures were strongly confined to a finite interspace because of the crosslinked network formed by the hyperbranched crosslinker. Thus the crystallization of the PEG chain was limited and certain PEG chains were prevented from crystallization in the phase transition process. Therefore the crystal domain of the SSPCMs was reduced compared to that of the pristine PEG resulting in reduced heat storage and release capacities. These inferences are supported by XRD analysis and POM results previously discussed in this study.

Regarding the influence of the functionality of the crosslinker on the changes in the SSPCMs endothermic enthalpy the degree of latent heat for both MDI- and HDI-based SSPCM followed the order; CO < COM < COT. Studies have revealed several factors that influence the SSPCM phase transition properties including soft segment content by weight crystalline state of the soft segments and steric hindrance of the crosslinking points. With an increase in the functionality of the crosslinker the synthesized SSPCM can accommodate more PEG thereby increasing the latent heat storage capacity. For better understanding of the phase transition properties of the SSPCMs on the basis of the functionality of the crosslinker the relative latent heat efficiency was calculated using the following equation:

$$\eta = \frac{{{\Delta }H_{m.SSPCM} }}{{{\Delta }H_{m.PEG} \times \omega_{PEG} }} \times 100$$

where \({\Delta }H_{m.SSPCM}\) and \({\Delta }H_{m.PEG}\) indicate the melting enthalpies of SSPCMs and the pristine PEG respectively and \(\omega_{PEG}\) is the mass fraction of PEG in the SSPCM. Table 2 presents the relative latent heat efficiency of the SSPCM. The \(\eta\) value indicates the influence of the framework structure where higher values suggest less heat loss of the PEG in the SSPCM. Both MDI- and HDI-based SSPCMs exhibited \(\eta\) values in the order of CO > COM > COT suggesting that the increased level of steric hindrance caused by the increased crosslinking density led to an increase in the number of soft segments that cannot form the crystal structure during the phase transition process.

Considering the influence of the isocyanate type on the endothermic enthalpy of the SSPCMs the latent heat of the HDI-based SSPCM was higher than that of the MDI-based SSPCM when an identical crosslinker was used. The \(\eta\) value of H.CO H.COM and H.COT were shown to be increased by 3.0% 3.8% and 3.5% respectively compared to M.CO M.COM and M.COT which is due to the presence of a rigid benzene ring in MDI that prevents PEG crystallization.

The analysis of the phase transition properties of the SSPCMs by DSC demonstrated that using hyperbranched polyols led to an increase in latent heat efficiency although the relative latent heat efficiency decreased due to an increase in the crosslinking density. Steric hindrance arising from the structural characteristics of isocyanate is another factor influencing the latent heat efficiency of the SSPCMs.

The results of the crystalline structure and phase transition property analyses confirmed that the synthesized SSPCMs exhibited repetitive heat storage and release characteristics without any leakage. The phase change mechanisms of the SSPCMs crosslinked with CO and COT are shown in Fig. 6. The crosslinked networks formed by the CO-based hyperbranched polyols served as the molecular framework which prevented the dissolution and flow of the PEG soft segment. Compared with the CO-based SSPCM the COT-based SSPCM exhibited higher thermal energy storage and release efficiencies because a greater amount of the PCM material can be integrated into it. Additionally Table 3 listed the comparison of phase change properties of the H.COM and H.COT with those of other crosslinked polymeric SSPCMs in the literature. As clearly shown in the tabulated data the latent heat capacity of the SSPCMs synthesized in present work is higher than the most of SSPCMs reported earlier 404155565758596061626364.

Thermal reliability of SSPCM

To verify the thermal stability of the SSPCMs an accelerated thermal cycling test (100 cycles from 0 to 100 °C) was performed. Even after the 100th thermal cycle no weight reduction was observed in the SSPCMs which indicates that they exhibit thermal reliability even after repeated use within the phase transition temperature range. This result verified the applicability of the SSPCMs as PCM materials.

Figure 7 shows the FTIR results for the SSPCMs after 100 cycles of the thermal cycling test. The initial FTIR curves for the SSPCMs are represented by dotted lines. Even after 100 cycles of the thermal cycling test the FTIR curves for the SSPCMs displayed almost identical shapes and locations of the absorption peaks suggesting that neither thermal decomposition nor structural changes occurred during repetitive thermal cycling.

Figure 8 shows the five consecutive DSC heating–cooling scans for the SSPCMs after the 100-cycle thermal cycling test; the phase transition characteristics are listed in Table 4. All the SSPCMs demonstrated distinct exothermic and endothermic peaks even after thermal cycling test and exhibited with a relatively uniform thermal behavior. These results confirmed that the SSPCM structures retained their reversible heat storage and release properties. However the melting enthalpies decreased for all samples and the degree of reduction of relative latent heat efficiency varied based on the isocyanate and crosslinker types. Figure 9 shows the initial relative latent heat efficiency of the SSPCMs followed by the final relative latent heat efficiency and the degree of reduction in the relative latent heat efficiency after thermal cycling. MDI-based SSPCMs exhibited a greater decrease in efficiency than HDI-based SSPCMs. Regardless of the isocyanate type the reduction of efficiency gradually became smaller as the crosslinker functionality increased; M.COT and H.COT demonstrated reductions by 4.1% and 3.3% respectively. Thus hyperbranched polyols are feasible for use as crosslinkers for the production of highly efficient and durable SSPCMs.

TGA was performed to evaluate the thermal stability of the SSPCMs; the results are presented in Fig. 10. The weight of the pristine PEG and SSPCMs remained unchanged up to approximately 280 °C implying that the SSPCMs were highly stable in the phase transition temperature range facilitating TES application. Moreover all the SSPCMs exhibited thermal decomposition at temperatures higher than those for the pristine PEG which can be attributed to the crosslinked molecular structure of the SSPCMs. The derivative TGA curves in Fig. 10b shows that the SSPCMs exhibited two phases degradation behavior in contrast to the phase 1 thermal degradation behavior of the pristine PEG. Phase 1 is marked by the thermal degradation of the urethane bonds in the SSPCMs whereas phase 2 is represented by the degradation of PEG3765. Also the maximum decomposition temperature of all the SSPCMs was higher than that of PEG exhibiting the outstanding thermal stability of the SSPCMs.",,,,,,

The present cost of living crisis unfolds in a context in which some of the very richest and most powerful capitalist interests are raking in huge profits while at the same time the most terrible levels of hardship and suffering are being imposed on hundreds of millions of people across the world.

The international grain trade is a particularly dreadful example of a wild feast of profit making that is taking place against a backdrop of literal famine. ‘Food prices have surged more than 20% this year according to the UN Food and Agriculture Organisation’ and this is leading to appalling consequences. ‘About 345 million people are experiencing acute food insecurity according to the World Food Programme compared with 135 million before the Covid-19 pandemic.’

Blatant profiteering

As this situation unfolds four companies that have dominated the grain trade for decades ‘have seen record or near-record profits or sales.’ They are all confident that this bonanza is going to continue and even intensify over the next two years. The Archer-Daniels-Midland Company Bunge Cargill and Louis Dreyfus are referred to as the ABCD and they are estimated to control between 70% and 90% of the grain trade across the world.

The killing that these companies have been making in this situation is quite remarkable. Archer-Daniels-Midland brought in the highest profits in their entire history during the second quarter of this year. Bunge registered a 17% increase in sales revenues in the same quarter. ‘Cargill reported a 23% increase in revenues to a record $165bn (£140bn) for the year ended 31 May.’ ‘Dreyfus reported profits for 2021 up by more than 80% on the previous year as revenues rose by nearly a quarter to $1.62bn.’

It is hard to see how any decent minded person could fail to be revolted by such blatant profiteering in the midst of a global cost of living crisis that is impacting the lives of hundreds of millions of people and generating conditions of outright starvation in some countries. Mainstream NGOs are calling for a windfall tax to be imposed on companies that ‘are clearly capitalising on the reduced supply and increased demand further exacerbated by commodity trading.’

A spokesperson for Bond a network of international development charities points out that “When supply is significantly lower than demand it gives space for price increase. But this is also exacerbated by speculative stock markets since wheat and other commodities are traded on stock markets and therefore prices fluctuate.” Oxfam suggests that “There are fears that speculation could be a driver in food price rises. Anything that causes hunger and starvation is immoral.”

The grandees of the grain trade are of course not the only ones who have buried their heads deep in the trough without any regard for the human cost. The supply shocks that have beset the global economy generated by the impacts of the pandemic and compounded by the Ukraine conflict have lent themselves to shameless price gouging and profiteering by others who are in a position to take full advantage of the situation.

Looking on as ‘the US’s biggest oil companies pumped out record profits over the last few months as Americans struggled to pay for gasoline food and other basic necessities’ even the far from radical Joe Biden felt compelled to declare that “Exxon made more money than God this year.” Indeed that company last month ‘reported an unprecedented $17.85bn (£14.77bn) profit for the second quarter nearly four times as much as the same period a year ago and Chevron made a record $11.62bn (£9.61bn). The sky-high profits were announced one day after the UK’s Shell shattered its own profit record.’

The big pharmaceutical companies have also been front rank profiteers throughout the pandemic making vast gains from the production and distribution of vaccines as political leaders ensured their ‘intellectual property rights’ would be protected. This has led to a global regime of ‘vaccine imperialism’ that has ensured that people in the poorest countries have been left unprotected and that the risk of new and more lethal variants of the virus has been needlessly compounded. It is the starkest case possible of profits being put ahead of human need.

If we consider the massively wealthy individuals who have been the most enthusiastic participants in this feast matters become even more revealing. Oxfam reported at the beginning of this year that during the pandemic ‘The world’s ten richest men more than doubled their fortunes from $700 billion to $1.5 trillion —at a rate of $15000 per second or $1.3 billion a day.’ This tiny group of billionaires

‘now have six times more wealth than the poorest 3.1 billion people.’ Oxfam with a distinct note of bitterness concludes that ‘Billionaires have had a terrific pandemic.’

Destructive greed

It is of course entirely true that the present inflationary instability within global capitalism is being greatly exacerbated by the efforts of major capitalist interests to maximise their profits in the face of the crisis. It is also fully justified to speak of a ‘profit price spiral’ and to dismiss the claim that is being used to justify class war interest rate increases that wage increases are the force that is driving inflation. Yet it is also important to understand that this is all very far from a situation where robust profits are being generated by productive investment in a stable and expanding capitalist economy. On the contrary we are dealing with the most parasitic and destructive forms of wealth generation conceivable.

In assessing the prospects for some easing of the inflationary impacts Michael Roberts looks beyond the present round of price gouging and considers the actual state of capitalist economies. He concludes that ‘productivity growth has been slowing towards zero in the major economies for over two decades’ and offers some reasons why this is so.

Firstly he points to ‘slowing investment growth in productive (ie value-enhancing) sectors compared to unproductive sectors (like financial markets property and military spending).’ At the same time ‘behind this decline in productive investment is the long-term decline in the profitability of such investment compared to investing in financial assets and property.’

This ability of well placed capitalists and speculative players to drive up prices doesn’t speak to any return to stability or economic health for global capitalism but rather highlights the destructive greed that marks the present period. It represents an approach that is neither rational nor sustainable and that puts those raking in such gains on a collision course with the working class populations they are so ruthlessly gouging.

It is indeed glaringly obvious that the reckless ‘let them eat cake’ arrogance of the profiteers is reaping what it has sown.

The Queen rapstress deservingly accepted the 2022 Michael Jackson Video Vanguard Award on Sunday (Aug. 28) at the Prudential Center in Newark N.J. Not only was Nicki honored she also co-hosted the ceremony alongside Jack Harlow and LL Cool J.

As members of her die-hard Barbz fanbase presented her with the honor Minaj made her way to the stage before giving her acceptance speech. “Let me tell you something” she started. “I never ever in my life have written a speech and today I jotted something down on my phone. First of all I wanna say to everyone in here God bless you.” Nicki then went on to speak about her come-up and her recent endeavors like her forthcoming Greatest Hits album.

She continued with her phone in her hand “I wanna thank the key people that inspired my flow.” She went on to name her influences and those who gave her big opportunities including Lil’ Wayne Jay-Z Kanye West Foxy Brown Rihanna Drake Beyonce and Madonna. Later in the show she added the names Diddy Fergie Big Fendi Taylor Swift and more to that same list.

Nicki also paid respect to her late father who tragically died last year and thanked the Barbz for their continued support. She also mentioned that she wished Michael Jackson and Whitney Houston had been alive to witness her moment in which she playfully referenced part of Houston’s acceptance from the 2001 BET Awards.

Before receiving the honor Minaj blessed the stage showing the world exactly why she is considered one of Hip-Hop’s living greats. With a high-energy all-pink dolled-out performance the 39-year-old delivered her biggest hits including “Romans Revenge” “Monster” “Beez In the Trap” “Chun-Li” “Moment For Life” “Super Bass” and “Anaconda.” Sporting her signature pink hair an ombré pink skater skirt sequin corset top and black boots Nicki switched into a tasteful pole ensemble and performed her newest single “Super Freaky Girl.”

To add to her VMA accolades Nicki took home the Moon person for Best Hip-Hop Video for “Do We Have A Problem?” featuring Lil Baby for the second time. She scored the same award in 2011 for “Super Bass.” Besides her nominated music video with Lil Baby Nicki released her Rick James-sampled single “Super Freaky Girl” which debuted at No. 1 on Billboard’s Hot 100 and the Streaming Songs chart her first No. 1 since 2014’s “Anaconda.”

And for good reason. Underwood just shared an Instagram photo dump that gave everyone an inside look at her performance at the Iowa State Fair and her thighs are beyond chiseled as she belts her heart out.



""Soooo many cool shots from the @iowastatefair !! This crowd was insanely loud!!!! Thanks to all who came out to party!!!"" the 39-year-old country star captioned the post.

Underwood shared some mid-air shots glimpses of her most passionate notes and a look at the massive (and completely filled!) stadium proving that fun was had by all at the state fair that night.

Fans were eager to chime in. One follower called her performance ""the best show of my life! most fun ive had in a long time!!!!"" Another fan commented ""Powerful pipes and a pair of legs to match 💪🔥❤️."" ""Those legs though… #goals"" a third wrote. Talent and strength!

While a good singing voice is more luck-of-the-draw Underwood's sculpted legs came from dedication and training. The singer works out with her trainer almost every day or whenever her schedule allows. ""If I can work out seven days a week—which doesn’t happen but if I can—I’m going to” she told Women's Health.

Her trainer Eve Overland described Underwood's commitment to her fitness routine as a lifestyle. ""Working out and staying healthy is just a way of life for Carrie. It is who she is what she does"" Overland told Shape adding that ""working out is self care and her me time.""

Underwood and Overland incorporate both upper body and lower body exercises into their workouts. ""Most commonly we will work with opposing muscle groups so she gets a lot of frequency with lower-body exercises without overworking it on any given day. This approach has contributed to her amazing strength as well as sculpted physique"" Overland said per Shape.

Some of Underwood's favorite leg exercises include squats lunges and deadlifts her trainer noted. She also does lateral band walks leg press machine [reps] hamstring curls and cable straight leg kickbacks so her booty is just as definitely just as toned as her legs.

“I swear I use butt muscles to hit notes sometimes” Underwood told Women's Health. Given the action shots from her shows I'm not at all surprised that a Carrie Underwood performance is a total-body workout!

When it comes to her diet Underwood told WH that her perfect balance is 45% carbs 30% fat and 25% protein.

The singer will start her day with a tofu or egg-white scramble toast berries and coffee. She often enjoys a Tofurky sandwich with tomato avocado red onion spinach and mustard for lunch and snacks on a green smoothie or protein bar throughout the day. For dinner she eats roasted veggies and vegan chicken.

Why Short Interest Matters

Short interest is the number of shares that have been sold short but have not yet been covered or closed out. Short selling is when a trader sells shares of a company they do not own with the hope that the price will fall. Traders make money from short selling if the price of the stock falls and they lose if it rises.

Short interest is important to track because it can act as an indicator of market sentiment towards a particular stock. An increase in short interest can signal that investors have become more bearish while a decrease in short interest can signal they have become more bullish.

“Mr. Kellyanne Conway celebrating my Victory in 2016!” Trump posted Thursday.

One photo showed Conway wearing a “Make America Great Again” hat with his wife former top Trump adviser Kellyanne Conway and another showed him filming Trump with a crowd of supporters.

Conway who announced his divorce from Kellyanne Conway last year has become a frequent Trump critic.

While Kellyanne Conway remained loyal to Trump throughout his time in office he went on to fund The Lincoln Project with several other Republicans who were opposed to Trump and looking to keep him from securing a second term.

Since then the two have been battling it out on air and online criticizing one another. Conway a conservative lawyer has frequently commented on Trump’s web of legal battles.

In an interview last Thursday Conway dismissed Trump’s claims that he was not sleeping in court after reporters noticed Trump appeared to doze off during his hush money trial in New York.

Conway slammed Trump’s reputation for not arriving to Trump Tower before 11 a.m. as well as the at White House because he “wasn’t an early riser.” The court is requiring the former president to be in-person early in the morning.

In January Trump walked out of the courtroom when closing arguments began in his defamation case against writer E. Jean Carroll.

Now he must sit in court and restrain his comments because of a gag order and Conway said he doesn’t think Trump has the “complete ability to control himself.”

Buckley who paused to battle back tears as he spoke added “The role that he cherished most was husband and father.” Rubin is survived by his wife Leslie and four children.

“This is the moment when Sam would know exactly what to say” Buckley said. “These are the kinds of stories that he excelled in and (would) say the right things about someone and put someone’s life into perspective.

“… This station is filled with great sadness. A shock to all of us. He was here yesterday with all of us and then called in sick and then we learned the news this afternoon. So we’re not really sure what the circumstances are. … That’s what we know at this point is that Sammy is gone.”

TMZ reported that Rubin suffered a fatal heart attack Friday morning. A KTLA source told Variety that Rubin died at his home in Brentwood.

“Sam lived life to the fullest” Buckley said. “We don’t know exactly what happened but we know that it was sudden because he was here yesterday.”

KTLA reporter/anchor Eric Spillman also a longtime fixture at the station called into the KTLA afternoon newscast and said “I just can’t believe that we’re reporting this. It is such a shock.”

“Personally he was one of my best friends” Spillman said. “We worked together every day for 33 years.”

KTLA technology reporter Rich DeMuro wrote on X that he is “in absolute shock.” He posted a picture of himself with Rubin and wrote “Thinking the most of your family right now. So sorry. Morning news in Hollywood will never be the same without you.”

KTLA posted on X: “KTLA5 is profoundly saddened to report the death of Sam Rubin. Sam was a giant in the local news industry and the entertainment world and a fixture of Los Angeles morning television for decades. His laugh charm and caring personality touched all who knew him. Same was a loving husband and father the roles he cherished the most. Our thoughts are with Sam’s family during this difficult time.”

During his celebrated career Rubin — an Occidental College graduate —collected multiple Emmy Awards and a Golden Mike and Los Angeles Press Club awards for best entertainment reporter as well as a lifetime achievement award from the Southern California Broadcasters Association.

He was also a founding member of the Broadcast Film Critics Association the organization behind the Critics’ Choice Movie Awards an event Rubin hosted in 2013.

Rubin was also the owner of the SRE Inc. television production company which according to his KTLA biography has produced more than 200 hours of broadcast and cable programming including the talk show “Hollywood Uncensored” and the “Live From” red carpet shows.

He was also known for his charitable efforts annually promoting the Bay to Bay bike ride from Orange County to San Diego to raise funds for multiple sclerosis research.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiQmh0dHBzOi8vZGVhZGxpbmUuY29tLzIwMjQvMDUvbm90LWRlYWQteWV0LWNhbmNlbGVkLWFiYy0xMjM1OTExMTMwL9IBRmh0dHBzOi8vZGVhZGxpbmUuY29tLzIwMjQvMDUvbm90LWRlYWQteWV0LWNhbmNlbGVkLWFiYy0xMjM1OTExMTMwL2FtcC8?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,‘Not Dead Yet’ Canceled After 2 Seasons At ABC,"After two seasons ABC has canceled the Gina Rodriguez-led and executive-produced comedy series Not Dead Yet.

Written by Casey Johnson and David Windsor Not Dead Yet centers on newly single and feeling-old Nell Stevens (Rodriguez) a self-described disaster who works to restart the life and career she left behind 10 years ago. A once-successful journalist Nell put her career on hold to help her fiancé get his restaurant off the ground. Following their breakup she takes the only job she can get – writing obituaries – which at first seems like a step backward but ultimately might be exactly what she needs to move forward.

Hannah Simone Lauren Ash Rick Glassman Joshua Banday Angela E. Gibbs Jesse Garcia and Brad Garrett also star.

When the show premiered in early 2023 it was ABC’s most-watched comedy debut in more than 4 years. However the ratings didn’t stick in Season 2. Deadline’s Editor-in-Chief of TV Nellie Andreeva wrote of the show last month “The single-camera Not Dead Yet is heavily on the bubble. Its ratings have been soft making for some bleak prospects though the series starring Gina Rodriguez is said to have its supporters internally and could potentially find a spot next season based on ABC’s scheduling needs.”

ABC comedies that will continue include Abbott Elementary and The Conners the latter of which will conclude following a shorter 6-episode Season 7.

This is the second ABC show starring a Latina lead that will not return for a new season following the cancelation of the Jaina Lee Ortiz-starrer Station 19. However the network did renew the Ramon Rodriguez-led series Will Trent for a third season. Alongside NBC’s Lopez vs. Lopez from George Lopez Mayan Lopez and Debby Wolfe—which was renewed for a third season this week—Will Trent is only the second Latino-led project on network TV.

More than three-fourths of the respondents have been using microservices.

In the foreign market microservice architecture is used by such giants as Twitter Facebook Amazon Spotify Uber Google. Netflix estimates that it uses around 700 microservices to control each of the many parts making up the entire Netflix service: one microservice stores what shows you have watched one deducts the monthly fee from your credit card one takes a look at your viewing history and uses algorithms to suggest a list of movies that you will like.

So what is actually Microservice Architecture?

A new user of MSA (Microservice Architecture) at first exclaims “I studied these microservices back in my early student days” and they are partly right but only partly.

Let us find out why but first of all let us look at some key concepts.

MSA is a method of creating software products by developing modules that are independent of each other. Each part of the application is responsible for doing specific discrete tasks and can be changed or extended without adding new features in the others. The services communicate with each other through messages.

A system with MSA is strong and independent. According to this idea such a system no longer needs to consider scalability since it can run on different technology stacks and fix its errors easily. This approach allows faster development and flexibility in providing support.

In practice this may seem to be an overloaded and rather fragile construction entangled in itself and its connections. To efficiently manage the cascade of microservices as a single organism requires a sufficiently high qualification and seamless work to coordinate this “hive”. Such systems are difficult to understand and require a special attention to the architecture including from analysts.

Macrocosm of Microservices

To get a better understanding of microservices let us compare or even oppose them to a large monolithic software system.

Unlike a monolithic system each microservice implements its own function has its own database and in some cases uses its own technology stack.

Let us focus in detail on the most important features of microservices.

They are small in size and responsible for a minimal individual functionality. If we look for an analogy this is one piece of the Lego set that is used to create the Millennium Falcon.

A microservice architecture is the embodiment of High Cohesion patterns: high cohesion and low coupling. A microservice has to be an independent component i.e. a unit with code that can be replaced or updated independently.

Low coupling means that any change to one service should not affect the others. To achieve such an approach you must ensure that each service knows as little as possible about each other.

Defining the microservice boundaries is the most important step. This will affect the rest of the service's life and will also have a serious impact on the team responsible for it.

One of the most well-known techniques of splitting into microservices is to determine the business capabilities of an application and create one microservice for each of them. Business capabilities are functions that will be available to users when they use the application.

For example “Order creation management” is transformed into a separate order creation service and “Payment management” – into a separate independent payment microservice that can be built into dozens of platforms.

One of the most important tasks is to be able to correctly identify the smallest independent business function which in the future can be transformed into a separate microservice and to explain the rationale for that decision. In the beginning it may be difficult but everything comes with experience and in the future it will not require significant effort.

To minimize errors when defining the boundaries you need to think about them first. Therefore Monolith First is a generally justified approach in which the system is developed first in a traditional paradigm and then when established areas appear they are decomposed into microservices.

The important thing is that the benefits from splitting should exceed the amount of complexity from revising these boundaries.

This approach to the incremental formation of a set of microservices is similar to the iterative development used in Agile also called Evolutionary Design.

Design Principles for Services in a Microservice Architecture

On the very surface in large-scale projects there is a methodological issue of transition to microservices.

In short it is caused by:

Different product design principles that bring chaos to understanding how the microservice hive works.

Different priorities and focuses – in which it is not clear where why and when to move.

Different understandings of customer needs. This is a significant problem because the product is implemented specifically for the customer otherwise why does the customer need it at all?

These problems can be solved by introducing non-architectural design principles for services in a microservice architecture which systems analysts can rely on in their work.

So declaring unified criteria of service delivery quality and performing actions for closing the needs of external or internal customers will allow systems analysts to clarify and simplify interactions when agreeing on quality criteria for services with a microservice architecture. It will make it easier to systematize the existing chaos.

There are six time-tested principles that service owners need in order to define and agree on quality criteria. These principles are important to other systems analysts and process engineers when they develop and modify services.

Let us go over them in more detail and begin with the “Know Your Customer” principle.

Each service must know their suppliers (service Before) and consumers (service After or a Customer). Changes to the service must be coordinated with the internal consumer the supplier.

For example if you are a general product service for parent capital you should definitely understand that the consumer is a Mortgage Stream and the supplier is the Pension Fund. The design should take into account all the wishes/requirements of the Mortgage Stream within a set of attributes or a list of processed documents as well as the demands of the bank customers themselves on the issues of the parent capital which may not be addressed immediately but may be affected in the near future. Therefore when planning microservice development these issues are better to consider at the start.

Now let us look at the “Watch Your Health” principle. It means that the service owner should monitor the declared quality criteria and identify deviations and their causes. The company should build unified standards of quality metrics for monitoring microservices.

Monitoring is crucial. When it comes to microservices in order to respond in a timely manner to possible roadblocks during integration or in operation it is necessary to attach at minimum a high-level monitoring tool such as Grafana Kibana to microservices and it is better to tackle this issue systematically. Otherwise neither support specialists nor highly skilled developers will be able to quickly figure out the causes of a number of problems that may arise.

The “SMART Digitization” principle means that the service owner should strive to promote the service in all possible channels of interaction with the customer.

One thing that should be clear is

what exactly it is that you want to achieve

how you are going to measure the result

how the goal is expected to be achieved if at all.

Suitability of the goal.

The moment in time by which the goal must be achieved (or the task accomplished).

Systems analysts always need to weigh the risks and make the managers focus on the economic feasibility of rolling out potential features. The omnichannel nature of the implemented solution i.e. the mutual integration of isolated communication channels into a single system to ensure seamless and continuous communication with the customer has to be taken into account.

The “Maximization of State-Through Processing” principle says that microservices do not create duplicate documents and attributes they eliminate duplicate data and they populate data for the process automatically from the source wizard.

In simpler terms the implementation of checklist items results in removing duplication of work minimizing human error of manual data entry and automating data enrichment from other services through various integrations as the microservice database itself is limited and not dependent.

The “Secure-by-Design” principle implies that the service owner tries to ensure security at all stages of the production process – from inception of the service to its decommissioning.

This helps to avoid situations when for example the status model of the master system and a microservice do not match which brings a host of problems de-synchronizing the process.

The “Evolve Together with the Artificial Intelligence” principle means that the microservice owner seeks to leverage AI capabilities to create intelligent services.

We are all moving with the times and today the use of AI including recommendation systems and other cool things to create automatic recommendations on how to improve the service for customers has become normal. But to understand whether you can use the AI capabilities right now you need to give clear answers to the questions on the checklist. If you can check all the items it is time to think about adding certain AI features to the service which will make it more popular for the customers and improve quality.

Life Hacks to Make Working with Microservices Easier

One of the challenges of working with a huge number of microservices is the need to organize and systematize them. Otherwise you could simply end up drowning in various unrelated names of microservice APIs and it would take virtually forever to search for answers in tons of documentation what is what and how to link them all.

An important thing that will greatly facilitate reflection of the relations in the documentation is the correct naming of the API services which will make life and versioning support much easier.

This approach can address this challenge and provide clear answers to a number of important questions. I suggest you keep this approach in your collection of useful information.

What next?

We’re done with theory. If you still have questions about the microservice architecture I’m ready to answer them in the comments section.

In the next article we’ll move on to the practical part of working with microservices from the perspective of systems analysts.",,,,,,,,,,,,

And apparently he’s ready to christen it with a good ol’ fashioned house party!

(You thought we were going to make a Progressive ad joke didn’t you?)

Mayfield and head coach Matt Rhule spoke to reporters following Friday night’s preseason finale against the Buffalo Bills. First up was Rhule who had plenty to say about his starter’s first shot at extended action in the 21-0 victory.

“I think the biggest thing is—I guess he’s played two preseason games—he’s protected the ball kept the ball out of harm’s way” Rhule said. “At the same time not afraid to make aggressive throws. The corner route he threw to Chuba [Hubbard] was an aggressive throw. The play he made on Shi [Smith] was outside the X’s and O’s. I think we have a good feel for it. At the same time like he’s just getting started in this offense. He’s just getting started like ‘Hey what can I do?’ That’s what excites me is I think he has a lot of room to grow.”

Mayfield later agreed with that sentiment stating he’s comfortable with his knowledge of the system and just needs to implement it on the field. He was also excited at the prospect of just being on said field this regular season when the games and the atmosphere become a bit more real.

“Obviously the rain delay wasn’t very friendly to our fans” Mayfield said of his first outing at Bank of America Stadium. “But it was a good experience for us. Obviously two weeks from now it’s gonna be the real thing. So get a little first taste of it. But ready for that stadium to be full capacity and rockin’.”

So . . . will he rock Cleveland come Week 1?",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMihAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5wb3N0LWdhemV0dGUuY29tL2xpZmUvZ29vZG5lc3MvMjAyMi8wOC8yOC9iYW5rLW9mLWFtZXJpY2Etc3R1ZGVudC1sZWFkZXJzLWNoaWxkcmVucy1tdXNldW0tZ29vZG5lc3Mvc3Rvcmllcy8yMDIyMDgyMTAwODfSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Bank of America student leaders spend the summer improving Children's Museum,,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZ2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZvcmJlcy5jb20vYWR2aXNvci9wZXJzb25hbC1maW5hbmNlL2NvbnN1bWVyLWNvbmZpZGVuY2UtaW5jcmVhc2VzLWJ1dC1zcGVuZGluZy1kZWNyZWFzZXMtMi_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Americans Shy From Spending As Inflation Woes Continue – Forbes Advisor,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Max restarts limit reached for url: https://www.forbes.com/advisor/personal-finance/consumer-confidence-increases-but-spending-decreases-2/ on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZ2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZvcmJlcy5jb20vYWR2aXNvci9wZXJzb25hbC1maW5hbmNlL2NvbnN1bWVyLWNvbmZpZGVuY2UtaW5jcmVhc2VzLWJ1dC1zcGVuZGluZy1kZWNyZWFzZXMtMi_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnB5bW50cy5jb20vbmV3cy9lY29tbWVyY2UvMjAyMi9ldHN5LXJlcXVpcmVzLXVzLXNlbGxlcnMtdG8tdmVyaWZ5LWJhbmstYWNjb3VudHMv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Etsy Requires US Sellers to Verify Bank Accounts,"Etsy will be requiring sellers on its platform to either self-verify their bank accounts or do it through a another platform so as to comply with anti-money laundering regulations Reuters wrote Friday (Aug. 26).

This has been a sticking point for sellers — several told Reuters that the recommended method would include providing financial technology platform Plaid with their banking username and password.

Etsy also reportedly provided an option to self-verify though some found it “tedious.”

Plaid last year agreed to pay $58 million to settle a case alleging it had used peoples’ financial information without consent. But the company has said it’s looking to provide a “secure experience” for users.

One seller critiqued Etsy for having a “history of less-than-stellar communication and customer service contributes to a general lack of trust in Etsy.” A transaction fee increase at the site also provoked negative reactions earlier in the year. And some users have said they may quit the platform over the various issues.

Etsy didn’t immediately respond to a PYMNT request for comment.

Even with the derision though Etsy reported 6 million new buyers in Q2 and a 10% increase in revenue in spite of the current economic conditions PYMNTS wrote.

The company said the rate of new buyers was “meaningfully elevated” from pre-pandemic levels. CFO Rachel Glaser said the revenue for the quarter had come from changes the company made such as the transaction fee increase along with adding Depop and Elo7 to its brand portfolio.

And CEO Josh Silverman said the results from that quarter showed that Etsy had kept up with the gains it made during the pandemic.

“Despite facing headwinds caused by macroeconomic and geopolitical factors we believe the improvements we’ve driven in customer experiences across the Etsy marketplace and our House of Brands coupled with continued focus on our ‘Right to Win’ strategy will enable us to unlock the enormous long-term opportunities we see ahead” he said.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUmh0dHBzOi8vY3lwcnVzLW1haWwuY29tLzIwMjIvMDgvMjgvYmFuay1vZi1jeXBydXMtYXQtbWVyY3ktb2YtcHJpdmF0ZS1lcXVpdHktZmlybS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Bank of Cyprus 'at mercy' of private equity firm,"Government rushes to pass bill to prevent takeover of systemic bank

The government is faced with a race against time to ensure it has the legal power to prevent the possible takeover of the Bank of Cyprus Holdings (BoCH) by the US private equity firm Lone Star which it views as “a serious threat”.

“This is a private equity firm that wants to buy a systemic bank with a wealth of assets on the cheap for a quick return and this could pose a serious threat to the economy” a top official at the finance ministry told the Cyprus Mail. BoCH has a whopping 45 per cent share of the Cyprus banking market.

Although three buy-out proposals were unequivocally rejected by the board of BoCH in the previous three months Lone Star have until the end of September to make more offers a possibility that cannot be ruled out.

A bill setting up a legal framework for examining direct foreign investment was sent to the attorney-general’s office for processing before the summer and is expected to be tabled in the legislature for approval as a matter of utmost urgency. The bill is based on an EU regulation that has been implemented in all but three member-states (Greece and Cyprus are two of them) since 2019.

The law would give the government the authority to decide whether a direct foreign investment could threaten national security or public order and block it. Investment in a ‘sensitive’ sector such as banking and particularly in a systemic bank could also be blocked under this law.

Whether it will be passed in time to prevent a takeover of the Bank of Cyprus will depend on the political parties. Lone Star has a September 30 deadline for submitting a binding offer. It had submitted three conditional non-binding proposals to the board so far.

In an announcement issued by the board of BoCH on 19 August immediately after a report in Bloomberg about Lone Star’s proposals which had been kept secret until then confirmed it had received three proposals. The first on May 5 offered €1.25 per BoC share the second on May 25 offered €1.38 and the third on July 8 raised the price to €1.51.

After the second proposal the equity firm made an approach on June 16 according to the announcement seeking a meeting regarding execution considerations relating to the second proposal but the board “unanimously rejected this further approach and request for engagement”.

Despite the board’s refusal to meet Lone Star a third proposal was made in July. Sources in Cyprus speculated that the equity firm was behind the Bloomberg report which forced the bank to go public because it wanted to make shareholders aware of its offer. Once the possible takeover is made public both sides are entitled to talk to the shareholders which is what Lone Star wanted.

On the day the BoCH issued its announcement its share price closed at €1.175 but by last Wednesday it had moved up to €1.29 although it fell marginally afterwards. The rise in the share price could be partly attributed to the takeover proposal.

One former executive of the bank said: “if they had offered me as a shareholder €1.51 per share which was at €1 at the time I would sell because it is a 50 per cent mark-up on the price especially as the bank had not paid dividends for years.”

He added that the final price offered could be attractive to shareholders especially investors that held large packages of bank shares. “There is the possibility that shareholders do not agree with the board’s stance.”

For the BoCH board aside from Lone Star issuing what it considers a low price there were other issues at stake.

“In addition to fundamentally undervaluing the company and its future prospects the board believes that the proposal from Lone Star does not adequately address the complexities of completing a transaction to acquire the Bank of Cyprus given its strategic importance to Cyprus” it said in its August 19 announcement.

It was confident in the company’s future prospects and remained committed to “delivering its strategy of becoming a stronger safer and more focused institution capable of further supporting the recovery of the Cypriot economy”.

This is how the government sees the bank’s role and opposes it coming under the control of a private equity fund that would be looking to make a quick return on its investment regardless of how this could affect the Cyprus economy.

“If it were the Bank of America or Barclays that were offering to buy the bank it would be different and no major cause for concern” said the finance ministry official explaining that “you cannot have the country’s economy at the mercy of an individual running a private equity firm.”

Lone Star was founded by John Grayken in 1995 and has organised 21 funds with aggregate capital commitments amounting to more than $85 billion. It specialised in buying distressed assets.

Its investment approach according to its website is to “seek investment opportunities in markets that have suffered an economic and/or banking crisis resulting in a dislocation in asset pricing and value opportunities.”

It seeks to capitalise on market conditions in which among other things “financial institutions’ balance sheets are under pressure and there is a need to dispose of high volumes of assets to manage capital deleverage and build liquidity.”

“The short termism of private equity companies is understandably a big worry for the government” said an economics professor at the University of Cyprus. “Banks have a long-term horizon usually of 10 years whereas funds generally take a shorter-term view of between three and five years.”

Evdokimos Xenophontos a former executive and director of the BoCH was more scathing about Lone Star. “Systemic banks should not be controlled by single individuals or oligarchs who naturally will promote their own personal interests.”

He pointed out that after the invasion of 1974 it was the Bank of Cyprus which helped the recovery of the devastated economy because it accepted as its moral responsibility to help the country.

These are different times. The professor of economics pointed out that these are not good times for banks with inflation at 10 per cent and the European Central Bank (ECB) insisting on keeping interest rates close to zero. “How will banks make profits in these conditions” he asked pointing out that economic conditions could lead to many BoCH shareholders wanting to sell.

Low profitability has been a problem for some time now said a retired bank executive who believes Lone Star considers the BoCH price-to-book ratio very attractive. The BoCH capitalisation is at less than 40 per cent of its net asset value he explained making it a target for equity firms that see this high price-to-book ratio as an opportunity for a quick return

This explains why the BoCH board in its announcement cited its financial advisors (Goldman Sachs and HSBC) who concluded that the Lone Star proposal “fundamentally undervalues the company and its future prospects”.

The board reiterated “the guidance given in May 2022 including delivery of a return on tangible equity of greater than 10 per cent in 2024 and subject to performance and relevant approvals a return to dividend distributions from 2023 onwards.”

What happens in the next month will be of critical importance as Lone Star has until the end of September to make a binding offer. One source with long experience in takeover practices believes Lone Star could make a couple more non-binding offers in September (binding offers are made once due diligence has been carried out) to test the resolve of the board and to encourage shareholders to support the sale.

“If Lone Start returns with an offer of €2 per share I suspect the owners of big packages of shares might be ready to sell because they would not be prepared to wait a few more years in the hope the share price would reach this level” said the same source.

The three biggest shareholders of the Bank of Cyprus which is incorporated in Ireland and traded on the London Stock Exchange and Cyprus Stock Exchange are Lamesa Investments (9.27 per cent) Carval Investors (8.75 per cent) and Senvest Management LLC (7.79 per cent) which bought approximately three million shares over the previous three months.

Business analysts expect there will be at least one more offer made by Lone Star before the end of September now that it is entitled to appeal directly to shareholders. It would not have made the takeover bid public if there were no such plans.

If the bill that would allow the government to block a takeover is not passed it could still be stopped by the ECB’s Single Supervisory Mechanism (SSM) which has the ultimate say on the acquisition of a systemic bank. For any acquisition of 10 per cent or more of a systemic bank’s shares approval of the Frankfurt-based banking supervisor is necessary.

For this approval to be given first the buyer is subjected to the ECB’s ‘fit and proper’ assessment which examines a range of issues related to the buyer’s activities. Once approved the buyer would have to submit a three-year business plan to the Central Bank of Cyprus. Although the central bank does not have the final say on this its recommendation would be conveyed to the to SSM which takes the decision.

No acquisition can be completed without SSM’s approval so even if Lone Star offers a price that is attractive to shareholders it does not mean the deal would go through. Of course the takeover might not even have to be assessed by the SSM if the parties approve the EU harmonisation bill on time giving the government the legal power to stop it."

The city was founded in the first century by the Romans who used its natural hot springs as a thermal spa. But a dip in those steaming waters in an elaborately engineered underground temple dedicated to Minerva goddess of healing is off limits to visitors who wander through the historic site today.

At the Cleveland Pools however you can once again take the plunge. This equally impressive water complex was built in 1815 and continuously used for bathing until 1984. Following a nearly £10-million restoration the complex believed to be the oldest surviving outdoor public swimming pool in the United Kingdom reopened to the public in the fall. Its main attraction is a large curvilinear pool originally reserved for male bathers who had been banned from swimming nude in the adjacent river.

Cleveland Pools can only be reached on foot through the scenic trails of a quiet residential cul-de-sac which contributes to its somewhat secret status. Travelling there takes you through layers of Saxon medieval and Tudor architecture and most notably neoclassical Palladian buildings constructed during the 18th century under the reign of George III. Accented with honey-coloured limestone pediments and Corinthian pilasters these landmarks give the city its distinctive glow even in the pouring rain.

The direct 90-minute train from London Paddington means that Bath population 100000 sees a significant influx of visitors particularly for weekend getaways. Many of those tourists come to town to experience the waters and the historic cityscape to follow in the literary footsteps of Mary Shelley (who wrote much of her landmark gothic Frankenstein while attending lectures in town) and Jane Austen (who lived here briefly) and to hop between filming locations of Netflix’s blockbuster Regency-era series Bridgerton. Lately the city is also becoming a destination for fans of a branch of contemporary British design that’s anchored in history.

Bath’s influx of weekenders also includes more than a few hen and stag parties which is why during my visit in October I opted to stay in Bathwick. It’s a quiet area on the opposite bank of the River Avon and only a 10-minute stroll across neoclassical Pulteney Bridge from the bustling city centre. I enjoyed coming and going along Great Pulteney Street a wide formal avenue flanked by the unspoiled Georgian architecture of luxurious terraced townhouses.

At its east end is the Holburne Museum. Doubling as the stately residence of Bridgerton’s formidable Lady Danbury in real life it’s the onetime home of Sir Thomas Holburne a lifelong collector of quirky miniatures old masters and objets d’art he later bequeathed to the city. A recent exhibition was devoted to painter Gwen John whose reputation only emerged out the imposing shadow of her artist brother Augustus and lover Auguste Rodin after her death in 1939.

Great Pulteney Street is only one of the city’s architectural set pieces. The Circus a round residential street of townhouses from 1754 is another masterpiece of graceful urban planning. Its streetscape overflows ornamentation in the forms of friezes decorative emblems and triglyphs. The curving Palladian façades of nearby Royal Crescent overlook the vast Royal Victoria Park lawn. Among them No. 1 is the city’s most prestigious address housing a museum styled entirely in the Georgian manner (and doubling as another Bridgerton backdrop the Featherington family’s abode).

The Assembly Rooms referenced by Austen was one of the legendary dance halls at the heart of aristocratic socializing in her day and it still drips with crystal chandeliers and ornate mouldings. During a visit you can practically hear the gossiping ghosts of socialites past. At the nearby Jane Austen Centre those ghosts are in fact real-life guides costumed in Regency garb who lead tours in character.

All this history – and occasional kitsch – forms the groundwork for the contemporary designers galleries and quirky shops that draw on the city’s heritage values. Nowhere is this more in evidence than at the influential design boutique Berdoulat. Based in Margaret’s Buildings a historic pedestrian street lined with independent design shops Berdoulat is Patrick Williams’s architectural design practice which specializes in period building restoration. It’s also the three-storey Georgian shopfront he co-founded with his wife Turkish and Bulgarian photographer Neri Williams.

The wood countertops brass scales and antique apothecary jars are heirlooms just as Berdoulat’s many tableware and interior accessory collaborations with local artisans will eventually become. From cutlery baskets by Bath’s Willow pottery to canelé-shaped ceiling fixtures by Devon ceramicist Feldspar all its pieces are designed in collaboration with regional makers. The simple refectory tables lipped bowls and oak egg racks highlight craft and epitomize beautility the latest buzzword for functional home essentials in modest materials.

As someone who thrills at the archaic terminology of estate interiors – think “boot rooms” “butler’s pantries” and anything featuring the word “scullery” – the new DeVOL Kitchens showroom tucked in the corner of a historic building block nearby is a twofold pleasure. The firm specializes in (and popularized) handmade kitchen furniture inspired by historic home aesthetics that fuse classic unfitted Georgian and farmhouse styles with modern conveniences. The copper worktops Shaker wainscotting aged brass taps slatted plate racks and fluted marble bib sinks of the three atmospheric showroom kitchens are swoon-worthy – and could easily have been plucked out of any of the high-ceilinged townhouses on the street.

Niche bookshop and publisher Persephone Books sits next door in the Edgar Buildings. It was established 25 years ago to excavate a more recent history: neglected works (mostly by women) from the mid-20th century. As much as I adore Austen Persephone is the reason I’ve come to Bath: a pilgrimage to the bookshop that has unearthed so many of my favourite reads. The publisher’s attention to design detail rivals that of its neighbours. The vestibule and fixtures are done up in the same signature dove grey as its books each with individual endpapers reproducing period textiles and wallpapers chosen to complement the material. A period upholstery fabric for example lines an edition of the once-forgotten 1938 charmer Miss Pettigrew Lives for a Day by Winifred Watson that is Persephone’s perennial bestseller.

Among the cluster of well-curated art and antique shops up the hill Francis Gallery is set inside another of these heritage-listed Georgian townhouses with wood furnishings and plinths in tonal shades of ecru arranged like a living space. Korean-Canadian founder and director Rosa Park grew up in Vancouver. Prior to opening the gallery (which also has an outpost in Los Angeles) to present the work of emerging international artists she created Cereal an acclaimed indie magazine about travel and lifestyle. The space is as warm and understated as her magazine pages with diffused lighting like something out of a Hammershøi painting adding to the moodiness of the ghostly Krista Mezzadri monotype prints on show when I visited.

Retracing my steps to explore an area around the railway station I took the invigorating waters of a different kind at Bath Botanical Gin Distillery & Herbal Apothecary the passion project of medical herbalist Sue Mullett. As a one-woman operation its hours are limited but I stopped by at just the right time to sample the micro-distillery’s offerings of boozy small-batch tonics inspired by traditional apothecary tinctures. Mullett’s crisply refreshing No.1 Gin is the only authentically Bath-produced gin and every wax-sealed bottle comes out of the copper still that is the petite room’s centrepiece. It is yet another example of how Bath’s modern sense of craft and culture flourishes because of the reverence for the city’s history.

Professor Joanne Baxter sat down with Q+A with Jack Tame to explain her journey to leadership of a top medical school.

“What I believed to be an exceptionally good thing that ought to be understandable and considered quite appropriate for us as a society was not thought of in the same way by a number of people or some people. So I learnt not to get complacent.”

She also explored the recent controversy around admissions to medical school for people from disadvantaged and minority backgrounds.

Baxter told Tame that it’s been very easy for people to underestimate another’s potential.

“They look at background factors and make an assumption about what your destiny is or ought to be"" said Baxter.

""And yet I see so many amazing young people who have incredible potential but it's not shown up in the fact that they've been to the best schools or the flashest school or had the backgrounds that have had them on trajectories into university.""

""Many of them come with stories of similar stories – someone really noticed their potential or they happened to have in their school an approach to actually really working with students.”

She’d like to see a medical workforce that more accurately reflects the population it is caring for.

“We have to remember that only between 2% and 5% of most of our health professionals in New Zealand registered health professionals are Māori and medicine has only just gone clocked over 4% of doctors in New Zealand being Māori.""

""So even with increases to the point where we're getting about 20% of our students being Māori and Auckland similar we're still not touching the sides.”",,,,,,,,,,,,

Favorable guidelines for the use of capnographs issued by several government agencies are significantly supporting the capnography equipment market revenue. Capnography devices are widely used to monitor the amounts of end-tidal CO2 (EtCO2) in patients' breathing gases. These medical gadgets are also used to confirm that an endotracheal intubation was effective. The rapid improvement of technology in these gadgets has enabled the capnography devices market size and share to grow at a quick pace. Capnography is an effective method for improving a patient's ventilatory state during prehospital care and transport. As a result capnographs are regarded as life-saving non-invasive gadgets because they detect various potentially harmful conditions early on. In the absence of ventilatory alterations a sudden reduction can suggest hyperventilation or approaching shock whereas a sudden increase can indicate malignant hyperthermia.

The increased adoption of capnographs in emergency medicine applications is anticipated to gain significant traction in the coming years. This has significantly supported the capnography devices market share to expand. The most prevalent reason for using capnography in the pre-hospital emergency scenario is to ensure that endotracheal tubes are accurately inserted which is critical in an out-of-hospital setting. According to one study unrecognized esophageal intubation is as high as 25%. Another study found that 3% of cardiac arrest patients and 17% of trauma patients sent to a Level 1 trauma hospital had unrecognized endotracheal tube misplacement.

COVID-19 Impact on Capnography Devices Market Value

Capnography monitoring is an integral part of COVID-19 patient care. Capnography is often used to monitor EMS patients who are receiving pain medication sedation or even oxygen and American Heart Association (AHA) guidelines recommend it whenever an artificial airway is used. Capnography can be used in acute care to assess breathing and detect changes in metabolism and perfusion. Clinicians have turned to remote monitoring platforms to monitor patients with respiratory difficulties in order to decrease their exposure to coronavirus infection. Medtronic for example created Microstream capnography and Nellcor pulse oximetry to notify patients and healthcare providers of changes in a patient's respiratory condition. In addition to help decrease COVID-19 patient exposure clinicians can view patients' status remotely from a wireless device or a central station using Medtronic's Vital Sync remote monitoring system.

Capnography Devices Market Dynamics

One of the trends in the capnography devices industry is the increasing development of portable capnographs. The growing preference for capnometers over oximetry is driving capnography market expansion. Additionally an increase in the number of minimally and non-invasive procedures is boosting market demand. However the expensive cost of these devices would limit the scale of the upcoming market. Besides that stringent regulatory approval processes for these devices are slowing industry growth. Furthermore rising widespread investment and robust growth potential from emerging economies are two key aspects that will open up considerable growth opportunities for the market in the years ahead from 2022 to 2030.

Rapidly Growing Respiratory Disease Cases All Over the World Supports the Capnography Equipment Market Revenue

The Global Burden of Diseases Injuries and Risk Factors Study (GBD) 2017 estimate the prevalence and health burden of chronic respiratory diseases. They discovered that about 545 million persons worldwide have chronic respiratory disease in 2017 a 39.8% increase since 1990. Chronic respiratory disorders (CRDs) weaken the lungs' airways and other structures. Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) occupational lung disorders pulmonary hypertension and asthma are among the most frequent. Asthma affects 262 million people worldwide according to the World Health Organization. One of the most prevalent patient concerns is respiratory discomfort. Waveform capnography is an extremely useful technique for determining the origin and degree of respiratory distress guiding therapy decisions and monitoring the patient's reaction to treatment. Capnography gives objective data to physical exam findings allowing the level of respiratory distress to be determined. A decrease in respiratory rate anxiety level and effort can indicate both improved and worsened respiratory failure. Waveform capnography aids in making a definitive determination that will guide future treatment. All of these advantages of capnographs benefit patients with respiratory problems resulting in a large demand for capnography devices.

BRK-B,Berkshire Hathaway,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZvb2wuY29tL2ludmVzdGluZy8yMDIyLzA4LzI4LzQtd2FycmVuLWJ1ZmZldHQtc3RvY2tzLXR1cm4tMzAwMDAwLWludG8tMS1taWxsaW9uL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,4 Warren Buffett Stocks That Can Turn $300000 Into $1 Million by 2030,"Riding the Oracle of Omaha's coattails can be your golden ticket to becoming a millionaire.

When it comes to investing greats Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.A 1.00%) (BRK.B 0.79%) CEO Warren Buffett deserves to be in a class of his own. Since becoming CEO in 1965 he's overseen the creation of nearly $650 billion in value for his shareholders (himself included) and delivered a better than 3600000% total return on his company's Class A shares (BRK.A).

Although no investor is infallible Warren Buffett's incredible track record speaks for itself. It's why everyone from Wall Street professionals to everyday investors waits on the edge of their seats to find out what the Oracle of Omaha has been buying selling and holding.

While Buffett utilizes a number of strategies to make his shareholders richer including a love of cyclical businesses and dividend stocks it's his use of time as an ally that's arguably been his biggest key to success -- and it can be your golden ticket too.

What follows are four Warren Buffett stocks that have the brand power and innovative capacity to turn an initial investment of $300000 into $1 million by 2030.

Amazon

The first Buffett stock with the ability to generate a 233% return for patient shareholders over the coming eight years is FAANG stock Amazon (AMZN -1.07%). Even though Amazon sports one of the largest market caps on Wall Street a $4.5 trillion valuation by the end of the decade is perfectly reasonable given the company's expected growth in operating cash flow.

When virtually anyone hears the Amazon name they instantly think of its industry-leading online marketplace. According to estimates from eMarketer Amazon is on track to bring in about $0.40 of every $1 in online retail spending in the U.S. this year.

However this primary revenue driver for Amazon isn't what'll send its operating cash flow ascending to the heavens throughout the 2020s. Rather it's the company's considerably higher-margin sales channels such as subscriptions advertising and cloud infrastructure services which could more than triple its operating cash flow by mid-decade.

For instance the popularity of Amazon's online marketplace has helped the company sign up more than 200 million people worldwide to Prime. In exchange for giving Prime members cheaper and faster shipping options and access to proprietary streaming content Amazon nets at minimum $28 billion in high-margin added revenue each year. Not only are Prime members more likely to remain within the Amazon ecosystem of products and services when making purchases but this tens of billions in added cash flow allows Amazon to reinvest in innovative projects.

Speaking of high-growth innovation Amazon Web Services (AWS) is the global leader in cloud-service market share. During the first quarter AWS accounted for an estimated 33% of worldwide cloud-service revenue according to a report from Canalys. Cloud growth is still in the early innings and more importantly it generates substantially juicier margins than online retail sales. As AWS grows into a larger percentage of Amazon's net sales it'll have a disproportionately larger positive impact on the company's operating cash flow.

After consistently being valued at a median of 30 times year-end cash flow throughout the 2010s a share of Amazon can now be scooped up for less than 10 times Wall Street's estimated cash flow for 2025.

General Motors

The second Warren Buffett stock with the brand power and innovation to turn a $300000 investment into a cool $1 million by the turn of the decade is Detroit-based automaker General Motors (GM -0.33%).

Auto stocks are facing a veritable mountain of headwinds at the moment. They're contending with general parts and semiconductor chip-supply shortages which have caused certain production lines to be pared back or shut down for short periods. Additionally historically high inflation is causing companies to choose between eating higher expenses or increasing new vehicle prices which could sap demand. The cherry on top is that rapidly rising interest rates may also price prospective buyers who finance their purchases out of the market.

Yet in spite of these short-term challenges General Motors is in great shape to sustainably grow its top and bottom line throughout much of the decade. That's because the long-awaited growth catalyst for legacy automakers has arrived: the electrification of vehicles.

Through the end of 2025 GM plans to allocate $35 billion for electric vehicles (EVs) autonomous vehicles and batteries. The stated goal by the end of 2025 per CEO Mary Barra is to release 30 new EVs globally have more than 1 million EVs being produced annually in North America and have two fully dedicated battery plants online by the end of 2023.

The company's initial focus will be on trucks (e.g. Chevy Silverado EV) and SUVs. Larger vehicles are typically less fuel-efficient than smaller vehicles which makes them a logical target with fuel prices recently hitting all-time highs. It also doesn't hurt that larger vehicle produce higher margins than sedans.

Investors should be aware that General Motors has a sizable presence in China the world's largest auto market. After selling 2.9 million vehicles (mostly internal combustion engine) in China in 2020 and 2021 it's clear GM has an established brand and the tools necessary to become a global force in the rapidly growing EV industry.

Visa and Mastercard

The third and fourth Warren Buffett stocks that can turn respective $300000 initial investments into $1 million by 2030 are payment processors Visa (V 0.79%) and Mastercard (MA 0.33%). If you've wondering why I'm discussing both companies together it's because their operating models and catalysts throughout the decade are virtually identical.

On a year-to-date basis both Visa and Mastercard have been given the cold-shoulder treatment by Wall Street. That's because financial stocks are cyclical and therefore prone to weakness when the U.S. and/or global economy shrinks. U.S. gross domestic product has shrunk in each of the first two quarters of 2022 which signals the potential for consumers and businesses to pare back their spending... at least in the short run.

However there are two sides to being a cyclical company. Although recessions are an inevitable part of the economic cycle they typically don't last very long. On the other hand periods of expansion are almost always measured in years. The takeaway is that Visa and Mastercard benefit from expansions lasting significantly longer than contractions or recessions. Investors simply have to be patient to take advantage of these long-winded periods of expansion.

Visa and Mastercard are also the respective No.'s 1 and 2 in market share in the U.S. based on credit card network purchase volume. The U.S. is the largest market for consumption in the world and according to 2020 filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission Visa and Mastercard controlled 54% and 23% of respective credit card network purchase volume.

What's more neither Visa nor Mastercard are lenders. By strictly sticking to the payment processing side of the equation both companies excuse themselves from the potential to be hurt by rising loan delinquencies and/or charge-offs when recessions strike. Not having to set aside capital to cover potential loan losses is a big reason why both companies bounce back from recessions faster than other financial stocks.

Lastly the expansion runway for both companies is still enormous. With most global transactions being conducted with cash there's plenty of opportunity for organic or acquisitive expansion into underbanked regions of the world.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiqwFodHRwczovL3d3dy5maW5hbmNpYWxleHByZXNzLmNvbS9idXNpbmVzcy9pbnZlc3RpbmctYWJyb2FkLXdhcnJlbi1idWZmZXR0cy1iZXJrc2hpcmUtaGF0aGF3YXktc2hhcmUtcHJpY2UtaXMtcnMtMy00OC1jcm9yZS1vd24tYS1wb3J0aW9uLXdpdGgtYXMtbGl0dGxlLWFzLXJzLTUwMDAtMjY0NjAwMS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway share price is Rs 3.48 crore! Own a portion with as little as Rs 5000,"Warren Buffett CEO of Berkshire Hathaway remains one of the top-notch investors of all time. One share of Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.A) trades for around $4350000 and is the most expensive stock listed on the US stock exchange. In Indian Rupees buying 1 stock of Berkshire Hathaway will cost almost Rs 3.48 crore!

But wait if you still want to own a slice of Warren Buffett’s highly prized stock there’s a way out. The international brokerages can help you buy a fraction of the stock listed on US stock exchanges. “Fractional investing refers to owning less than one full share of stock. So even if a stock’s price let’s say $5000 one could potentially purchase 0.1 shares for just $500. Currently some major brokerage firms in the US offer this feature. There are some platforms in India that have tied up with US brokerage firms that offer fractional shares. So one does not need to buy a whole share and hence can invest even a small amount in relatively high-value shares” says Atanuu Agarrwal Co-founder Upside AI.

Fractional stocks are pieces of one full stock of a company and Fractional Investing is allowed in the US stock market. Similar to a systematic investment plan (SIP) in mutual funds in India the Fractional Ownership of stocks provides the benefit of dollar-based investing in US stocks. One can start accumulating US shares with an amount as low as Rs 5000. No matter at what price the stock is trading you can buy a portion of the stock with a fixed amount. This is the most unique part of investing in US stocks – you can buy the highly prized US stocks denominated in dollars even in Fractions in Indian Rupees.

Fractional Ownership of stocks makes owning th US stocks more affordable. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission allows sub-divisions of securities however in India no such practice is allowed currently.

The conglomerate of Berkshire Hathaway and its subsidiaries are engaged in a diverse set of business activities including insurance and reinsurance utilities and energy freight rail transportation manufacturing retailing and services. The common stock of Berkshire Hathaway is listed on the New York Stock Exchange trading symbols BRK.A and BRK.B.

An alternative to holding Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway stock is to buy class B shares of the company. As against the sky-high price of class A shares the class B shares of Berkshire Hathaway are available at a price of around $289. “Berkshire Hathaway has class A and class B shares. Class B shares currently trade at a much more affordable level. There are minor differences with respect to rights but in terms of pro rata economic value they are more or less equivalent” informs Agarrwal.

“Countries should be increasing nuclear power generation” he said in the tweet. “It is insane from a national security standpoint and bad for the environment to shut them down.”

Countries should be increasing nuclear power generation! It is insane from a national security standpoint & bad for the environment to shut them down. — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) August 26 2022

When a user remarked that environmentalists “aren’t pro-clean energy they are anti-human” Musk replied “Some are indeed sadly anti-human.”

In a March interview with Business Insider Musk said it was “crazy to shut down nuclear power plants now especially if you are in a place where there are no natural disasters.” He called for shuttered nuclear power plants to re-open and said that since Germany does not have a “massive” natural disaster risk “there is really no danger with nuclear power plants.”

Global interest in nuclear power dropped after the 2011 Fukushima disaster. But Russia’s assault on Ukraine has revived interest in the power source given subsequent gas and oil shortages.

The interest comes even as concern mounts over the possibility of a Chernobyl-type disaster at the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant in Ukraine currently occupied by Russian troops. Ukrainian workers reportedly continue to run the plant under the barrel of Russian guns.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiSmh0dHBzOi8vZmluYW5jZS55YWhvby5jb20vbmV3cy9hdmFsYW5jZS1ueXNzYS1hbC1naHVsLXRydWNlLTIzNDA1ODk0My5odG1s0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,An #Avalance/Nyssa al Ghul Truce? Watch Katrina Law Crash Legends Stars' ClexaCon Panel Riding a Unicorn,"Arrow alum Katrina Law did say she always thought that Nyssa al Ghul should have crashed the wedding of Legends of Tomorrow‘s Sara (aka My Beloved) and Ava.

So she did the next best thing.

More from TVLine

Today at ClexaCon (the first and largest multi-fandom event for LGBTQ+ women trans and non-binary fans and creators held this year at the Anaheim Marriott) Legends‘ Caity Lotz and Jes Macallan were holding court at their uber-popular “Avalance” panel when who rides in — draped in a rainbow and riding a (fake) unicorn — but Law.

Waiving a white “truce” flag Nyssa’s portrayer dismounted her steed and joined Lotz and Macallan on stage to deliver a gift for the Avalance baby we may never see get born (due to Legends‘ abrupt cancellation). She then playfully wedged herself between Lotz and her Legends leading lady.

In the infamous TVLine video above Law this spring shared her knee-jerk reaction to the Avalance pregnancy news (tl;dr part-alien Sara was able to get “knocked up” by her lady love) before reminding us that she always felt Arrow‘s Nyssa should have crashed the Avalance wedding.

Short of that Law was hoping that Nyssa could show up at the inevitable Avalance baby shower with some sort of appropriate-from-an-assassin gift in hand. “It would be funny to see what sort of baby shower gift Nyssa would give” she smiled.

But what did Law herself present Lotz and Macallan with at ClexaCon? An “Auntie Nyssa” onesie for the hypothetical baby-to-be. Awww.

Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.B) has an equity investment portfolio worth more than $360 billion as of the end of the first quarter of 2022 making it one of the largest investors in the world.

Berkshire Hathaway’s portfolio is filled with high-quality stocks and generally ones that have stable earnings profiles and pay dividends. However in recent years Buffett has proven willing to go outside the typical list of companies for Berkshire to buy. Indeed the company now owns some high-growth names including tech stocks which Buffett famously eschewed for decades.

You can learn from Warren Buffett’s stock picks to find ones for your own personal portfolio. That’s because Buffett (and other institutional investors) are required to periodically show their holdings in a 13F Filing.

As of March 31st 2022 Berkshire owned over six million shares of Snowflake (SNOW) for a market value approaching a billion dollars. That makes Berkshire a ~2% owner of Snowflake although the position is just 0.3% of the company’s total equity investment portfolio.

In this article we’ll examine the business of Snowflake as well as its future growth prospects and expected total returns in what is a very unusual stock pick for Buffett.

Business Overview

Snowflake is a cloud-based data platform that is based in the US but has a list of international customers. The company’s platform allows customers to consolidate data into a single source that has several benefits. First it takes various data sources and combines them into one place that is much easier for customers to navigate. Second it allows customers to then use the data to drive insights build data-driven applications and share data across teams and businesses in ways they could not without the consolidated source of data.

As we can see in this illustration the idea of the platform is to take disparate data sources and applications and combine them into a single source making insights predictions and monetization far easier. Snowflake aims to solve the age-old enterprise problem of teams and applications being housed in silos in the organization and seeks to combine them for greater data efficiency.

Snowflake was founded in 2012 should generate about $2 billion in revenue this year and trades with a market cap of $51 billion.

The company’s most recent earnings report was released on May 25th 2022 for fiscal Q1 results. Results were mixed as revenue beat estimates by $9 million soaring 84% year-over-year to $422 million. However the company posted a bigger than expected loss at 53 cents per share.

Snowflake isn’t profitable yet so investors tend to focus on customer and revenue growth metrics instead. We can see the first quarter saw revenue nearly double year-over-year as total customers were up 40%. In addition Snowflake doubled the number of $1+ million annual revenue customers from the prior year period. Finally Snowflake’s net revenue retention rate is critical given it is building its business out and at 174% it means that not only is Snowflake retaining all prior period revenue but is growing per-customer revenue by leaps and bounds.

The company guided for second quarter product revenue to be in the range of $435 million to $440 million which would represent ~72% year-over-year growth while operating margin is expected to be -2% of revenue. For the year Snowflake guided for revenue of ~$1.9 billion which would be up ~66% with product gross margin of 74.5% operating margin of 1% and adjusted free cash flow margin of 16%.

Those growth values spooked investors and analysts however despite the eye-popping year-over-year gains expected and shares fell following the report.

Let’s now turn our attention to the company’s growth prospects which are robust to say the least.

Growth Prospects

Snowflake’s growth in the past few years has been otherworldly. Since fiscal 2019 its average revenue growth rate has been 113%. In other words Snowflake has more than doubled revenue on average for each of the past four years. The company has been scaling product revenue extremely quickly through both new customers and higher per-customer revenue. We expect those factors to continue to contribute to revenue growth going forward but the ever-higher revenue base will become more difficult to grow from.

Still analysts currently expect Snowflake’s medium-term average revenue growth to be in the neighborhood of 50% annually.

The company’s long-term forecast shows fiscal 2029 target revenue of $10 billion which is ~5X what it should be this year. In addition the company believes it will still be growing revenue at ~30% annually by then but with operating income of ~20% of revenue. These are lofty targets but given the company’s growth trajectory they look feasible.

The two main catalysts are the company’s ability to add new customers which it is doing at a very fast rate as well as its net revenue retention rate. Combined we think Snowflake can hit ~50% revenue growth annually for the foreseeable future and that would actually mark a sizable slowdown in revenue growth from historical levels.

Competitive Advantages & Recession Performance

Snowflake’s competitive advantage is in its first-mover position in using a cloud platform to consolidate disparate data sources into one. The mega-trend of using data in the cloud for a variety of applications from merchandising to cybersecurity to operational metrics is only beginning to gain steam and Snowflake is primed to take full advantage in the years to come.

Snowflake didn’t exist the last time the US had a meaningful recession but we have to assume its business would suffer. Snowflake’s customers are enterprises of all shapes and sizes so while its customers are sticky given the immense switching cost some would inevitably be unable to continue to pay Snowflake during a harsh slowdown. Snowflake does not pay a dividend and likely won’t for a very long time to come.

Valuation & Expected Returns

Given Snowflake doesn’t have any earnings and earnings won’t be meaningful for some time to come we’ll use the price-to-sales ratio to assess value. Shares of Snowflake have been very expensive since the initial public offering and they remain highly-valued today. Shares go for ~25X estimated fiscal 2023 sales which is tremendously high by any measure. However Snowflake’s average price-to-sales ratio in its history as a publicly-traded company is 60. We don’t see that value as sustainable however and instead assess fair value at 8 times sales as a long-term multiple.

We expect 50% revenue growth for the foreseeable future but the valuation could cause a ~20% headwind to total returns over time as it shrinks. Those offsetting factors would still mean we expect ~19% total annual returns in the years to come. The company does not pay a dividend so that does not factor into total returns.

Final Thoughts

Snowflake is a highly unusual stock pick for Warren Buffett in that it does not pay a dividend is not profitable and is a hyper-growth tech stock. However the company is a first mover in a mega-trend that is likely to persist for decades and we see immense growth potential for Snowflake. The valuation is extremely high however and will likely offset some of the forecasted revenue growth. Still with ~19% total expected annual returns Snowflake is rated a highly speculative and volatile buy.

amien Harmon didn't always know how to think outside the box.

As Best Buy's executive vice president of omnichannel Harmon helped the retailer reimagine its stores and interactions with customers during the pandemic. He said it wasn't always easy for him to break away from conventional thinking and allow himself to be innovative.

""I was being drilled that this is the way to think about business or this is the way to think about operations or this is the way to think about retail"" said Harmon talking about the start of his career. ""But you actually have to break outside that drill and think outside of the box.""

Harmon grew up in Gary Ind. His mom taught him the importance of dreaming big. She owned several businesses including a local day care where Harmon would often play with his friends.

Harmon joined Best Buy in 2005 as a sales manager before working his way up in the company and eventually traveling overseas to help open stores in China and Turkey experiences that profoundly changed the way he looked at business and challenged himself as a leader. There had been earlier times when Harmon ""played small in a room"" or didn't speak up he said.

""I think over time going overseas taught me to play big taught me to think outside of the box taught me to be innovative and think about the customer in different ways"" Harmon said.

Thinking creatively isn't just needed in business Harmon said. He also encourages young people at Best Buy Teen Tech Centers to think outside the box as well.

Harmon now 44 is married and has six kids. One of his daughters is studying international business and another daughter is attending college in Shanghai.

In spring 2020 when its stores were closed to foot traffic Richfield-based Best Buy was able to launch curbside pickup within a couple of days thanks in part to the quick thinking of Harmon's team.

The retail chain has expanded its fulfillment space in stores across the country including several in the Twin Cities metro. It has created more experiential stores for customers to test products.

Best Buy also launched outlet stores that sell discounted items as well as a ""virtual store"" out of a distribution center so customers can ask questions of experts online. Best Buy recently opened a small-format store where people use their phones to check out.

""Every single week we are talking about ways to solve customer problems that we see exist across our stores"" Harmon said. ""If you can solve customer problems even before you know that they have a problem that's even better.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lndhc2hpbmd0b25wb3N0LmNvbS9idXNpbmVzcy8yMDIyLzA4LzI4L2N1cmJzaWRlLXBpY2t1cC1zaG9wcGluZy_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Curbside pickup is here to stay and retailers are going all-in,"Curbside pickup is here to stay and retailers are going all-in

Just a year ago gamers who wanted to switch from an older graphics card to a newer-generation board containing GPUs like Nvidia's GeForce RTX 3080 or AMD's Radeon RX 6800 XT simply couldn't find them without paying a huge Ebay markup or getting lucky when a trickle of supply turned up at retailers like Best Buy or Newegg.

The tide has turned. As anticipation builds for the next generation of graphics cards and board makers try to clear inventory and as demand from cryptocurrency miners has softened supply and prices have stabilized. In fact retailers and manufacturers that sell direct such as EVGA and MSI are offering discounts on many graphics cards something we haven't seen in a while.

There will be many like those who need the latest iPhone when it's released who will opt to wait for the latest and greatest premium-priced cards. But for casual gamers this may be the perfect time to buy while there's still inventory and prices are back to normal or even lower.

Why Have Prices Dropped?

Back in April Jon Peddie a veteran researcher who closely follows the graphics industry predicted that a massive price drop could come soon with board scalpers left holding the bag on excess inventory.

That seems largely to have played out. But Peddie says that what's happening is that the supply and demand cycles of the graphics industry players—Nvidia AMD and now Intel (which is getting into gaming-focused GPUs)—are returning to predictable normalcy.

What got us to the point of graphics cards disappearing from retail channels and getting sold at huge markups on secondary markets Peddie says was a combination of factors including “mining and recessions and stock market crashes and wars and pandemics and everything you could think of to just screw up that nice predictable curve that we forecasters used to make our models” he says.

Surprisingly Peddie says it wasn't supply-chain issues or Covid itself that caused the shortage it was scalpers and crypto farms. Covid factory shutdowns he says “lasted maybe a week or two at most” and the graphics industry works on three- to five-year cycles so even big disruptions don't take long-term planning and orders too far off course.

But on the demand side we saw the rise of crypto-mining farms using powerful graphics cards to speed up their activity and more demand for cards as old and new gamers tried to upgrade their systems during 2020's pandemic lockdown to play newer games.

Now though there's much more inventory in retail channels and a refresh cycle of new products is overdue he says. “It's price elasticity all over the place” Peddie says. “If you need a graphics board it's an excellent time. You couldn't do better.”

What Should You Buy?

What type of graphics card you should upgrade to depends on the type of games you want to play. If you're still enjoying the games you played three years ago (say Overwatch Control and Apex Legends like me) you might only need a budget or mid-range card such as something based on Nvidia's 3060 GPU or something with AMD's Radeon RX 570 in the $200-$350 price range.

If you want to tackle more demanding new releases or monsters such as Cyberpunk 2077 or Hitman 3 with all the eye-candy turned up to the highest settings you might want an Nvidia 3080 or Radeon 6700 XT. Ideally you want something powerful but a top-of-the-line card may be overkill. The next step down in the $500-$700 range is more than sufficient for most games and you get a steep discount. Not everybody wants to pay $1000 or more for a graphics board even if it's future-proofed for the next three to five years.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNvbnN1bWVycmVwb3J0cy5vcmcvYXBwbGlhbmNlcy9haXItZnJ5ZXJzL3F1aWV0ZXN0LWFpci1mcnllcnMtYTI0NzQ4NzQ2NzYv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Quietest Air Fryers,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.consumerreports.org/appliances/air-fryers/quietest-air-fryers-a2474874676/ on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNvbnN1bWVycmVwb3J0cy5vcmcvYXBwbGlhbmNlcy9haXItZnJ5ZXJzL3F1aWV0ZXN0LWFpci1mcnllcnMtYTI0NzQ4NzQ2NzYv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen

Tens of thousands of people head to Nevada’s Black Rock Desert each summer in search of inspiring art communal living hedonism and more.

The event is an annual bacchanal – although Burning Man in its official form went on hiatus in 2020 and 2021 amid the COVID-19 pandemic.

In spite of Burning Man’s popularity and global name recognition many people still aren’t aware of its origins and what the event is all about. Here is a primer on Burning Man:

What is Burning Man?

Don’t call it a “festival.” Burning Man resembles a festival but the event can better be described as a countercultural arts event spanning about nine days. Burning Man is a surreal dusty and quirky party in the desert of northwestern Nevada. The event is known for its eccentric displays of art and expression including fantastical arty vehicles; towering metallic sculptures; and whatever else its devotees can dream up. Burning Man is also well-known for its more hedonistic aspects including sex nudity and drug use.

SEE ALSO:Burning Man is whatever you want it to be

Why is it called Burning Man?

Burning Man takes its name from a giant humanesque sculpture that is the centerpiece of the annual event – and changes in appearance year to year. Called The Man the sculpture is ignited and burned to cap off the event.

What are the origins of Burning Man?

What is now known as “Burning Man” began in 1986 in Baker Beach in San Francisco. Founders Larry Harvey and Jerry James created an event centered on the burning of a human-shaped sculpture. During the 1990s Burning Man exploded in popularity and was moved to the Black Rock Desert in Nevada where it remains. Briefly the name was changed to the Black Rock Arts Festival before settling back to “Burning Man.”

What is the purpose of Burning Man?

Burning Man is all about self-expression and the rejection of corporatism and capitalism. The experience of creating and viewing art and living in the moment is Burning Man’s purpose. Attendees famously create a fleeting self-sustaining community that (theoretically) leaves no trace or trash upon its completion. A key theme of the Burning Man experience is the use of borrowing bartering and trade in lieu of money exchange.

What happens at Burning Man?

About 80000 people known as “Burners” make the annual trek to a harsh stretch of northwestern Nevada and set up a massive-yet-makeshift encampment dubbed Black Rock City. They build elaborate villages a medical center an airport and performance stages. From there it gets weird but that is the point. Over the course of about nine days attendees test the limits of self-expression through art costume and design while building community and what they tout as a kind of utopia. However the encampment is not without its problems including drug use arrests and sexual assaults. Law enforcement officers patroling the area include local deputies and federal agents as well as Burning Man’s volunteer Black Rock Rangers.

What are the 10 principles of Burning Man?

Burning Man co-founder Larry Harvey laid out these 10 principles of Burning Man in 2004:

Radical Inclusion: Anyone may be a part of Burning Man. We welcome and respect the stranger. No prerequisites exist for participation in our community. Gifting: Burning Man is devoted to acts of gift giving. The value of a gift is unconditional. Gifting does not contemplate a return or an exchange for something of equal value. Decommodification: In order to preserve the spirit of gifting our community seeks to create social environments that are unmediated by commercial sponsorships transactions or advertising. We stand ready to protect our culture from such exploitation. We resist the substitution of consumption for participatory experience. Radical Self-reliance: Burning Man encourages the individual to discover exercise and rely on their inner resources. Radical Self-expression: Radical self-expression arises from the unique gifts of the individual. No one other than the individual or a collaborating group can determine its content. It is offered as a gift to others. In this spirit the giver should respect the rights and liberties of the recipient. Communal Effort: Our community values creative cooperation and collaboration. We strive to produce promote and protect social networks public spaces works of art and methods of communication that support such interaction. Civic Responsibility: We value civil society. Community members who organize events should assume responsibility for public welfare and endeavor to communicate civic responsibilities to participants. They must also assume responsibility for conducting events in accordance with local state and federal laws. Leaving No Trace: Our community respects the environment. We are committed to leaving no physical trace of our activities wherever we gather. We clean up after ourselves and endeavor whenever possible to leave such places in a better state than when we found them. Participation: Our community is committed to a radically participatory ethic. We believe that transformative change whether in the individual or in society can occur only through the medium of deeply personal participation. We achieve being through doing. Everyone is invited to work. Everyone is invited to play. We make the world real through actions that open the heart. Immediacy: Immediate experience is in many ways the most important touchstone of value in our culture. We seek to overcome barriers that stand between us and a recognition of our inner selves the reality of those around us participation in society and contact with a natural world exceeding human powers. No idea can substitute for this experience.

John suffered a stroke the morning of January 10 2022 while in Nayarit Mexico. Understandably the details are fuzzy to him but his partner Erica Bartel explains that he spent three weeks in a Mexican hospital and was then moved to San Francisco California. There he spent a month in acute rehab before being released March 4.

Though in a wheelchair John began his rewiring project by coming to the Burning Man Golden Spike ceremony on August 3 2022. He made a couple of other pre-event visits before he and Erica anchored their silver Airstream—its playa name is Curley Town—in Media Mecca camp a week ago.

The fancy term for body rewiring is “neural plasticity.” John explains the concept: “If you place yourself in the middle of familiar things your brain can find new routes around destroyed pathways lost due to a stroke.” Burning Man is full of familiar things.

John’s first Burn was back in 2008. He came to document the building of the Center Camp Café and Andie Grace asked if he would like to write a blog. “This was before everyone had a phone and a camera in their pocket” he recalls. A guy with a camera was not always appreciated. It took years to build a rapport with all the departments that put Burning Man together on the playa.

“There is a poignancy to being back in a place where I can’t do the things I used to do” John says while seated in a wheelchair. “I miss not being able to walk up to people and draw them out of themselves. Sometimes it was the Temple build crew or people living in the Department of Public Works (DPW) ‘ghetto.’ I was able to separate a few of the sheep from the herd and bring their stories forward.”

“When I was living in New York reading John’s stories was always part of my preparation for the playa over the first few years I came to Black Rock City” Dominique Debucquoy-Dodley recalls. “His posts helped me connect with Burning Man even though I was living thousands of miles away.” Now the Associate Director of Communications for Burning Man Project Dom finally met John in person for the first time in 2017.

“This year” John says—somewhat in jest “First I want to get out of here alive. Beyond that I hope I can gain a few more steps on my own and a heightened sense of balance. I look at this year as a form of therapy to reclaim some of my neural pathways.”

If you search John Curley’s name on the Journal you’ll find a large flock of interesting sheep he has brought forward in photos and words over the years. In real life he can be found in “Curleytown” at Media Mecca.

COLUMBUS Ohio — During his visit to Ohio last week Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis praised Republican U.S. Senate nominee J.D. Vance’s forceful opposition of the “Chinese communist party.” He said Vance would be “tough” on them in the Senate.

DeSantis described how in Florida he’s signed legislation banning Confucius Institutes — programs funded by the Chinese government to promote the country’s language and culture abroad. But a different bit of resistance elicited applause.

“We’re very mindful of them trying to infiltrate our economy” DeSantis said. “We’re going to be doing legislation to block them for purchasing land in our state and we need other states to follow that as well.”

Concerns about national security and the country’s food system drive fears of foreign entities purchasing U.S. land. Not surprisingly when it comes to farmland the issue tends to animate rural traditionally conservative voters. But lawmakers on both sides of the aisle have raised concerns about the practice.

What we know — and don’t

The USDA maintains data about foreign land ownership under The Agricultural Foreign Investment Disclosure Act of 1978. The picture those data paint seems to undermine fears about some kind of covert incursion.

In all foreign owners control less than 3% of the country’s farmland. Canadians represent the biggest share controlling a bit less than a third of the total. Owners from the Netherlands Italy Germany and the United Kingdom hold another third. Chinese owners meanwhile hold just 0.5% of privately held U.S. farmland. Even expanding the scope to include non-agricultural land Chinese owners still represent less than 1% of foreign held acres.

But Caitlin Welsh cautions the information is far from complete. Welsh serves as director of the Global Food Security Program at the Center for Strategic & International Studies.

“We don’t know the scale of foreign land ownership in the U.S.” she said. “We rely on data that’s voluntarily provided by states to USDA.”

“There’s in theory some sanctions for not reporting that data in a timely manner” she continued “but those sanctions are rarely applied.”

And Welsh added that even if the percentages are small they’re not insignificant. The foreign-held land we know about would still cover the state of Iowa.

The view from Ohio

In terms of acreage held by foreign entities Ohio ranks near the middle both in raw numbers and percentage. German investors hold roughly 77000 acres — the largest share of the half million acres of foreign owned land in the state.

“China’s really not even on the radar” Ty Higgins of the Ohio Farm Bureau explained.

Despite the small footprint Higgins said the issue is getting attention because of where investors are buying.

“With this conversation about China buying up farmland near military bases it’s really bubbling this topic back up to the surface for our members and I think for everybody in rural parts of America as well.”

Most notably the Chinese food company Fufeng Group recently purchased land in North Dakota not far from an Air Force base. A similar story is playing out in Texas where a Chinese billionaire named Sun Guangxin bought land with plans to build a windfarm not far from a different Air Force base. Higgins didn’t know of any similar examples in Ohio.

Foreign ownership on the campaign trail

While the issue fired up rally attendees foreign land ownership has played little if any role in Ohio’s U.S. Senate race.

In January at a Delaware County shooting range Vance voiced skepticism about foreign actors’ influence but his focus was on the price of single-family homes. He described hearing from a friend in real estate about first time homebuyers struggling to compete.

“Some out of state investor often taking Chinese money — Blackrock takes a lot of Chinese money Blackstone takes a lot of Chinese money — comes in and outbids that family by 20-30% and that’s the end of the homeownership dream for that young family” Vance said.

“We’ve got to make a decision” he continued. “Do we care more about Chinese money or do we care more about the future for our own people?”

More recently he voiced the same skepticism and referenced farmland directly in an interview with WLWT in Cincinnati.

“Why are we letting China go up and buy American farmland and American single-family homes right? Voters care about that stuff because they care about the future of their country” Vance said.

In a statement his campaign said he would support action to prohibit “domestic asset purchases by the Chinese Communist Party” including real estate farmland or components of the country’s infrastructure.

Democratic nominee Tim Ryan has made confronting China economically a central part of his pitch to voters as well. But foreign land purchases really haven’t come up at campaign events. In a rare point of agreement though Ryan shares the same suspicions as Vance. In an emailed statement he said “America’s farmland belongs in the hands of America’s farmers.”

“The Chinese Communist Party’s malicious practice of buying up our land poses a serious threat to our national security and our ability to feed our own people” Ryan continued. “We must do everything in our power to block China’s efforts to control our food production and ensure we keep our agricultural supply chains at home.”

And the Democratic congressman pointed to his record. He’s voted in favor of successive agriculture spending bills that direct officials to “take such actions as may be necessary” to block land purchases by companies tied to the Chinese Russian North Korean or Iranian governments.

Low hanging fruit

For two candidates who have underlined their antipathy toward the Chinese government Ryan and Vance’s convergence on the issue isn’t exactly a shocker.

But Welsh the researcher from CSIS lands on a more nuanced view. In terms of immediate steps she argued officials need to ensure data sent to USDA is complete and accurate. “To me that’s low hanging fruit” she said arguing both sides of the aisle should welcome a clearer picture. When it comes to concerns about China’s domestic influence though emphasizing agriculture might be misplaced.

“If you’re worried about the influence of China in the United States there are a lot of other sectors to be looking at in addition to agriculture” she argued.

“And if you’re worried about quote-unquote foreign control of U.S. agricultural land” she added “Number one there are countries that own a lot more than China does and then number two you can look at U.S. based companies in other states that are purchasing access or purchasing rights to agricultural land in other states.”

She pointed to Arizona where overseas and out-of-state firms have bought up land to take advantage of loose water regulations. That influx regardless of where it comes from puts added stress on the area’s agricultural system."

Big landlords who scooped up thousands of single-family homes during the COVID-19 pandemic are pumping the brakes as they wait for the housing market to cool.

The latest example: Home Partners of America a subsidiary of Blackstone Inc. said it will pause home purchases in 38 of the more than 80 markets it operates in.

Home Partners which as of last year owned more than 17000 rental homes across the US told customers that it will be halting purchases in 28 markets as of September 1 including Boise Idaho; Louisville Kentucky; and Detroit Michigan according to an announcement on its website. On October 1 the company will stop buying homes in another 10 markets including Albuquerque New Mexico; Charleston South Carolina; and Tucson Arizona.

Blackstone to raise $500 million through REIT IPO of Nexus Malls

Nexus Malls operates 17 shopping centers across 13 Indian cities and has about 10 million square feet of retail space its website shows.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiP2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZ0LmNvbS9jb250ZW50L2I3MDEyMTViLTljMDUtNDc1YS05MjFjLTdkNWZjNWEwYzBjZNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Will the cloud kill the data centre? Jim Chanos thinks so,"Print this page

Veteran short seller Jim Chanos has a new target in his sight: the humble data centre.

In June Chanos — who won big bets on the downfall of US energy group Enron and the German payments company Wirecard — announced that his eponymous investment firm is raising several hundred million dollars for a fund that will take short positions in US-listed data centre groups.

He argues that the move towards the cloud predominantly driven by Big Tech groups such as Microsoft Amazon and Google is the “enemy” of bricks-and-mortar real estate investment trusts such as Equinix and Digital Realty.

These players buy large swaths of land build vast complexes source major energy contracts and allow companies to lease space in their centres to process their data.

The Big Tech groups by contrast utilise their own equipment and process clients’ data for them in the “public cloud”. Dubbed “hyperscalers” they either store their hardware and server equipment in real estate investment trusts such as Equinix — or increasingly build their own supersized centres to meet ballooning demand for their services. One Microsoft data centre in Chicago spans 700000 sq ft the size of 52 Olympic swimming pools.

Chanos who has also been hurt by a longstanding bet against Tesla believes the tech behemoths which he says account for around two-thirds of data centre demand will increasingly move towards building and running their own real estate. He argues they will do this because the technology used by legacy groups is becoming old and redundant and because cash-rich Big Tech groups can build more cheaply. This will render the independent real estate investment trusts redundant.

But other investors argue the data centre and specialist operators have life in them yet. Nathan Luckey senior managing director of digital infrastructure at Macquarie Asset Management who has spearheaded several recent investments in data centre assets said the best companies are those sitting on prime real estate in strategic locations.

“Hyperscalers are looking for trusted partners where they can house more and more compute power” he argued. “If there is someone who already has land and a property in a market they want to expand into that’s a very relevant factor.”

Billions of dollars in private equity capital have poured into the industry with bulls arguing that traditional data centre groups will remain indispensable given their strong position in top locations and expertise in procuring resources such as power land and labour. They also cite their privileged position as so-called “carrier hotels” an industry term meaning they connect lots of different businesses.

These groups and their PE cheerleaders are wagering that data demand will continue to grow and a wide range of customers — from cloud service providers to banks and government departments — will continue to store at least some of their workloads in traditional data centres.

Last year the world’s biggest private equity firm Blackstone acquired Kansas-headquartered QTS Realty Trust for $10bn while KKR and GI Partners purchased Texas-based CyrusOne for $15bn. Earlier this month Macquarie bought a significant minority stake in British data centre provider Virtus for an undisclosed sum betting that Big Tech groups will be forced to lease as they expand into Europe.

Chanos derided these transactions as “rash” with valuations that were “stretched by any measure” and predicted a “post-takeover hangover” in a presentation.

Cloud business has been the engine of growth for groups such as Amazon Microsoft and Google over the past year. In the first quarter of 2022 Amazon Web Services’ revenue was up 37 per cent year on year to $18.4bn while revenue at Microsoft’s Azure platform increased by 40 per cent.

“The compute workloads for Google and Meta are just unimaginable” said Martijn Blanken chief executive of EXA Infrastructure which supplies networking infrastructure for the hyperscalers. “It’s a scale game and there’s no enterprise that can compete with them.”

By contrast listed US data centre groups have posted healthy — but less impressive — growth. Yet those in the data centre industry argue Chanos’s thesis is dated given that the same arguments have emerged several times over the past 15 years including a highly publicised short position taken against Digital Realty by Highfields Capital Management in 2013. Highfields made money but Digital Realty is still in business.

“There’s a fallacy in the argument that we’re not growing as fast as the cloud providers which means we are threatened by them” said Andy Power president and chief financial officer at Digital Realty. He added that “co-location” groups such as Digital Realty — where one party provides the real estate and customers provide the tech — “enable” the transition to the cloud and have seen an increase in leasing from many hyperscalers in recent years rather than a dip.

Tech groups have made a noticeable shift towards greater leasing over the past six months driven by a handful of key companies including Meta Microsoft ByteDance and Twitter. This uptick has reversed a previous trend towards greater in-house construction.

“I don’t think [hyperscalers] can keep up with the pace of their business on their own” said Charles Meyers chief executive officer of Equinix.

Power added: “These cloud service providers are blessed with lots of capital yes but they have better uses for it honestly.”

Brendan Lynch an analyst at Barclays pointed out that in many metropolitan areas of the US Equinix is the first- or second-largest data centre provider giving the company a higher degree of pricing power. “That’s why we still like Equinix even though we realise there are some risks to our thesis” he said.

One key risk is that should the land labour and energy supply crunches ease Big Tech groups may shift to constructing more of their own data centres.

For independent operators to maintain their appeal differentiation is key argue analysts. Most big businesses use a suite of different services from Gmail to Workday all hosted on different clouds. For all of these software applications to run smoothly together there need to be physical locations where data can pass quickly and seamlessly from one to the other.

Equinix’s “secret sauce” is this networking capability according to Meyers given it is nearly impossible for hyperscalers to replicate.

“Cloud service providers have spent billions building their own data centres” said Nick Del Deo an analyst at MoffettNathanson. “They have not spent a single dollar trying to replicate what Equinix has built.”

So-called “interconnection” constitutes around 35 per cent of Equinix’s earnings as compared to 14 per cent of Digital Realty’s according to MoffettNathanson calculations — though the latter has sought to expand in this market.

By contrast Digital Realty along with private groups CyrusOne and CloudHQ have focused heavily on the bricks-and-mortar business. This segment is more vulnerable to increased competition from the big cloud service providers as well as smaller data centre groups that are being pumped with billions of capital from private equity firms and infrastructure investment funds.

“I do think there may be a glut at some point because everyone and their uncle is building data centres at the moment” said David Friend chief executive of Wasabi a cloud storage company that leases from several data centre groups. “Right now there is an undersupply but it’s going to be like oil prices: everyone is going to drill drill drill — and then it will force prices down until there’s greater consolidation in the market.”

ST. LOUIS — Boeing announced Friday it will be partnering with the St. Louis Regional Advanced Manufacturing Innovation Center to open a brand new manufacturing facility in north St. Louis City.

Boeing gave $5 million to the project.

The new manufacturing facility in north St. Louis will serve different industries including aerospace agriculture and construction.

“This new facility will have workstreams across workforce development developing the talent and future the most advanced R&D that you can imagine in manufacturing and production and prototyping capability for industry” AMICSTL Board of Directors Chair Dennis Muilenberg said.

Boeing officials said there’s really no limit on what this new manufacturing facility can do.

“We do some commercial operations here in the St. Louis site but we do a lot of defense as well. But there are opportunities to impact both of those worlds with this one place so it's exciting” Chris Bray with Boeing said.

St. Louis Mayor Tishaura Jones said it was very important to focus on bringing more jobs to north St. Louis.

“It's this kind of investment these kinds of opportunities that make our neighborhoods safer and stronger in the long run. This facility's location in the North Central Corridor is a great choice given the existing talent and potential surrounding neighborhoods while enhancing workforce development opportunities” Jones said.

St. Louis Economic Development Partnership CEO Rodeny Crim said this manufacturing facility will also be connected to schools in the region and in St. Louis to give students a solid career after school.

“But we felt that this was the best place to locate the Advanced Manufacturing Innovation Center again being the hub between NGA Cortex Rankin and providing quality jobs and opportunities in North St. Louis City” Crim said.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiamh0dHBzOi8vc2ltcGxlZmx5aW5nLmNvbS9jaGluYS1haXJsaW5lcy1mbGlnaHQtMTIwLXRoZS1haXJjcmFmdC1maXJlLWNhdXNlZC1ieS1hLXNpbmdsZS1taXNzaW5nLWNvbXBvbmVudC_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,China Airlines Flight 120: The Aircraft Fire Caused By A Single Missing Component,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with ('Connection aborted.', RemoteDisconnected('Remote end closed connection without response')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiamh0dHBzOi8vc2ltcGxlZmx5aW5nLmNvbS9jaGluYS1haXJsaW5lcy1mbGlnaHQtMTIwLXRoZS1haXJjcmFmdC1maXJlLWNhdXNlZC1ieS1hLXNpbmdsZS1taXNzaW5nLWNvbXBvbmVudC_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMijQFodHRwczovL2Vjb25vbXljbGFzc2FuZGJleW9uZC5ib2FyZGluZ2FyZWEuY29tLzIwMjIvMDgvMjgvYWlycGxhbmUtYXJ0LWx1ZnRoYW5zYS1ib2VpbmctNzQ3LThpLXRheGluZy1hdC1jaGljYWdvLW9oYXJlLWludGVybmF0aW9uYWwtYWlycG9ydC_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Airplane Art - Lufthansa Boeing 747-8i taxing at Chicago O'Hare International Airport - Economy Class & Beyond,"It’s Sunday again so it must be time for some more Airplane Art.

This week we have a Lufthansa Boeing 747-8i taxing at Chicago O’Hare International Airport in classic Blue Yellow and White after it completed the transatlantic journey from Frankfurt Airport.

Lufthansa operates a fleet of 19 Boeing 747-8i in its long-haul operation. The airline also operates the Airbus A330-200 Airbus A330-300 Airbus A340-300 Airbus A340-600 Airbus A350-900 and Boeing 747-400.

The airline will receive the Boeing 787-9 in its fleet shortly with the Boeing 777X to follow. In addition the airline will bring back the Airbus A380 for its Summer 2023 season

This aircraft – D-ABYG – joined the Lufthansa fleet in March 2013. It has remained in the Lufthansa fleet since then. It has recently been operating out of its Frankfurt base to Miami Washington Dulles and San Francisco.

Boeing's Starliner mission suffers another delay; launch in February 2023

By Athik Saleh 07:45 pm Aug 27 202207:45 pm

What's the story Boeing's hopes of sending astronauts to the International Space Station have suffered another setback. The Starliner spacecraft with NASA astronauts aboard is now set for a February 2023 takeoff said an official announcement. The mission which would've been Starliner's first crewed mission was expected to be launched by the end of 2022. Meanwhile Starliner's competitor SpaceX is gearing up for its sixth crewed flight.

Context

Why does this story matter?

Boeing's failure to ready Starliner in time has been a surprise to many. A long-time partner of NASA everybody expected Boeing to kickstart the space agency's ""hired shuttle"" program. What's even more surprising is that a fairly new SpaceX managed to beat Boeing to the task. If everything goes well however this could be the end of troubled waters for Boeing.

Setback

The spacecraft's thrusters had issues during its May test run

Starliner has been plagued with issues since the beginning. Its most recent test run to the ISS in May was successful but officials had identified issues with the spacecraft's thrusters that did not fire as intended. There were also some software-related problems. None of these issues affected its ISS trip but they have been deemed serious enough to require fixes before its crewed journey.

Spacecrafts

Starliner will join SpaceX's Crew Dragon when certified by NASA

Boeing has a $4.5 billion contract with NASA for the development of Starliner and six routine missions. Once certified by the space agency it will join SpaceX's Crew Dragon which has been ferrying astronauts to and from the ISS since 2020. NASA's space shuttle program retired in 2011. Therefore it wants at least two spacecraft to carry astronauts to the space station and back.

Previous issues

Boeing has spent around $700 million on Starliner since 2019

Starliner is no stranger to problems. Its first orbital test run in 2019 was cut short due to software issues. It took nearly two years for the spacecraft to return to the launchpad. Another sticky valve issue further delayed its return to flight. Since its failed 2019 test Boeing has spent $688 million on Starliner. Its March test mission itself cost $93 million.

Mission

Barry Wilmore Sunita Williams will be first astronauts on Starliner

Once Starliner is deemed ready for its crewed mission the capsule is expected to be integrated with its Atlas 5 rocket in November. The Atlas 5 launch vehicle was built by Boeing and Lockheed Martin. NASA astronauts Barry ""Butch"" Wilmore and Sunita Williams will be the first to board the spacecraft on its initial trip to the space station."

Local real estate industry groups are fighting Wu’s proposal to ban fossil fuels at new private developments in Boston a policy that will require approval by Beacon Hill legislators. But the administration already has free rein to set aggressive green building standards at 320 parcels that it controls within the city from such landmarks as Faneuil Hall Marketplace to sought-after development parcels in South Boston’s Raymond L. Flynn Marine Park.

“We’ve been incorporating language into requests for development proposals with stricter standards” said Dennis Davis the Boston Planning & Development Agency’s deputy director of commercial leasing. “[7 Channel St.] is certainly where we’ll see the most short-term impacts.”

Three Boston-based developers – Lincoln Property Co. Marcus Partners and a partnership of Beacon Capital Partners and developer Richard Taylor’s Boston Real Estate Inclusion Fund (BREIF) – responded this month to a request for proposals for 7 Channel St.

Known as parcel U the 1-acre property includes a vacant 27049-square-foot industrial building most recently occupied by Stavis Seafoods. It’s been eyed by the BPDA as a potential mixed-use redevelopment including the possible location of the Seaport District’s first fire station. The BPDA sought proposals including office life science manufacturing marine industrial cold storage and R&D uses while ruling out a hotel or housing.

At the same time it asked developers to use passive building strategies to cut carbon emissions 40 to 50 percent below the current Massachusetts Stretch Code.

Another upcoming project on EDIC land that’s expected to incorporate aggressive carbon-cutting standards is 22 Drydock Ave. A partnership of Related Beal and BREIF is scheduled to submit plans shortly for a 337516-square-foot life science complex. The BPDA selected the team this year to redevelop the 1.8-acre parcel which currently contains a small office building.

Reducing the carbon footprint of buildings – estimated to generate 70 percent of Boston’s greenhouse gas emissions – is the goal of the draft decarbonization policy for the city-owned parcels which is scheduled to kick into gear next year. The BPDA is in the process of hiring a decarbonization specialist who will oversee the details of the implementation.

The new policy also will remove fossil-fuel-based building systems through retrofits at publicly-owned buildings many located in the Charlestown Navy Yard and Flynn Marine Park which are ground-leased to private developers. The properties include 13 million square feet of buildings that generate approximately 31000 metric tons of carbon dioxide each year according to the city’s estimates.

Boston Seeks to Join Gas Ban

New developments over 20000 square feet on BPDA parcels – ranging from large commercial developments in the marine park to smaller surplus property dispositions in outlying neighborhoods – will be required to design for carbon-neutral building systems according to the draft strategy.

The BPDA also is studying potential locations for additional solar energy installations on its properties. One project is scheduled to be installed next year atop its Marine Park garage at 12 Drydock Ave.

But the administration is simultaneously seeking to apply stricter standards to private developments.

Gov. Charlie Baker signed legislation this month that gives 10 Greater Boston communities the power to ban new natural gas hookups for new projects and major renovations as a way to test out fossil fuel-free building designs. The city of Boston promptly submitted a home rule petition asking to be added to the pilot program potentially putting it ahead of suburban communities that face hurdles complying with the program’s affordable housing requirements.

The Greater Boston Real Estate Board commercial developers’ group NAIOP Massachusetts and labor unions successfully fended off efforts to include lab and medical projects in the pilot earlier this year saying it would have chilling effect upon the region’s life science development boom given the high energy usage requirements of lab buildings. However they have raised concerns about the final program’s impact on developers’ ability to build multifamily housing in the towns that do join.

Some BPDA Tenants Will Share Costs

Eversource is conducting energy audits of all BPDA- and EDIC-owned properties to guide the future schedule of retrofits. Two buildings that are operated by the BPDA – the China Trade Building in Chinatown and 12 Channel St. in South Boston – will be among the first to be upgraded.

The China Trade Center’s tenants which include nonprofits such as the Chinatown Main Streets Program have leases that incorporate building improvements so tenants won’t have to pay higher rents to offset the green initiatives the BPDA’s Davis said.

At 12 Channel St. the BPDA has already started renegotiating and extending leases with several of the existing commercial and industrial tenants. The cost-sharing formula is yet to be determined.

“We know that we won’t be able to capture all of the costs and it will be a negotiation based upon our beneficial interests” he said.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMieWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJvc3Rvbmdsb2JlLmNvbS8yMDIyLzA4LzI4L2J1c2luZXNzL3BvcnQtZGVzaWduYXRpb24tcG9zZXMtYmlnLWh1cmRsZS1yZWRldmVsb3BtZW50LXBvd2VyLXBsYW50LWxhbmQtZXZlcmV0dC_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Port designation poses big hurdle for redevelopment of power plant land in Everett,"Not even a marina can be built in a DPA let alone luxury hotels or housing — or a sports facility for that matter.

But there’s a catch that goes unmentioned. And it’s a big one. The land that’s up for sale on the Mystic River in Everett sits in a designated port area limiting what could go there to water-dependent industrial operations. Translation: None of the advertised uses are allowed there today.

The Mystic Station marketing brochure describes the 45-acre power plant property as a “transformational development opportunity” on Boston’s doorstep — with room for labs offices multifamily housing stores and maybe even a hotel or two.

With a possible New England Revolution soccer stadium in mind House leaders last month adopted language in their economic development bill to exempt the Mystic site from DPA restrictions. The Kraft Group has long sought a standalone home for the Revs in Greater Boston separate from Gillette Stadium in Foxborough and the Mystic site has been a rumored contender for several years.

The Conservation Law Foundation went to war after the “soccer stadium amendment” came to light lobbying against what the group called a last-minute backroom deal that could undermine the local maritime economy; CLF also blasted language that would exempt the property from construction limits under the state’s Chapter 91 law governing tidelands. Time ran out on formal sessions before the House and Senate could reach an agreement on the broader economic development bill.

The fate of that bill — a $4 billion-plus potpourri of tax cuts and economic-related program funds — remains up in the air. As a result so is this key piece of Everett’s riverfront renaissance. And the entire debate underscores pressing questions about our old industrial waterfronts and how they should evolve.

At Mystic a viable mixed-use project might be possible under Chapter 91 tidelands rules. But the DPA issue could be a deal breaker potentially preventing anything from getting built.

That wouldn’t sit well with Everett Mayor Carlo DeMaria. Along with Wynn Resorts executives DeMaria wants the site to become an entertainment and hospitality destination to complement the $2.6 billion casino that Wynn opened across the street in 2019 and the related development the company is pursuing along Broadway. A Revs stadium would fit perfectly with that vision. City officials last year gave themselves the authority to take this site from plant owner Exelon — now Constellation an Exelon spinoff — by eminent domain if necessary.

The eminent-domain threat forced Constellation’s hand prompting it to hire brokerage CBRE to market the 45 acres. It no longer uses its shuttered turbines there though Eversource has an easement to operate a switchyard; another section is essentially water undevelopable. Not included are two natural-gas fired units next door. Constellation gets special payments to keep those two going because of their importance to New England’s grid until the spring of 2024. Then what remains of this decades-old power plant closes for good.

All a Constellation spokesman would say is that the company hopes to conclude the sale by year’s end with Everett’s redevelopment plan in mind.

It’s in this context that the House leaders tucked the Everett language into the back of their economic development bill. Down-to-the-wire negotiations with the Senate got sidetracked by an unexpected revelation that the state may need to budget for nearly $3 billion in income tax credits. But the bill is not dead by any means.

Legislative leaders are waiting for clarity on the exact cost of those credits. They could choose to pass much of the bill in an informal session when roll calls can’t be taken. Controversial items like this Everett language are generally avoided in informal sessions because a single lawmaker can block a bill.

With CLF watching closely it’s unlikely the Everett language could survive in an informal session. From CLF’s perspective maintaining the state’s port infrastructure is crucial. Once an industrial port makes way for high-end development CLF’s Deanna Moran argues it’s gone for good. CLF doesn’t want oil tanks and dirty power plants either. But Moran said these properties could be ideal for “blue-tech” and clean-energy uses like the wind-farm work planned for Salem’s waterfront.

Legislators are only expected to meet in informal sessions until January but it’s possible they could be called back for a rare special formal session to wrap up the tax cuts bonding proposals and other goodies in the bill. In a formal session the Everett measure might very well make it through.

While there is precedent for removing properties from DPAs through legislation Mystic Station’s road to redevelopment becomes considerably longer without State House help. The next option: ask the state’s Coastal Zone Management office for a formal DPA boundary review. The agency is currently reviewing such requests for two different areas in East Boston. One is led by warehouse developer Jacob Citrin who wants to remove several industrial parcels on Route 1A from a port area. The second is being pursued by the Boston Planning & Development Agency and involves properties in and around Central Square.

This route can be lengthy — no less than six months and often much longer. Citrin said he applied more than two years ago and expects the final decision next month; BPDA initiated its request in early 2020. But in the case of the Mystic parcel land-use experts say DPA regulations probably wouldn’t offer enough leeway to remove it from its respective port area anyway.

Another possible path is even more circuitous but could prove beneficial in the long run: rewriting the DPA rules. The system established in the 1970s is seen by many as anachronistic. State environmental regulators would include many waterfront stakeholders in that process — environmental groups property owners municipal officials. Julie Wormser of the Mystic River Watershed Association sees this as the best possible outcome: a robust regional conversation about updating the DPAs instead of dealing with them on a piecemeal basis.

The fight for the future of this power-plant land might end up not only being about bringing relief to Revs fans who have long hoped for a soccer stadium to call their own. It could end up being about the kind of future we want for the industrial waterfronts in and around Boston and what it will take to get there.

The design and results of the DAPA-HF (clinicaltrials.gov identifier NCT03036124) and DELIVER (clinicaltrials.gov identifier NCT03619213) trials have been published1267. Each enrolled patient had a diagnosis of HF functional limitation and elevated natriuretic peptides. The principal difference between the two trials was that patients with an ejection fraction ≤40% were randomized in DAPA-HF and those with an ejection fraction >40% in DELIVER. In both trials patients were randomized to dapagliflozin at a dose of 10 mg once daily or a matching placebo in addition to standard care. The ethics committees of the participating institutions approved the protocols and all patients gave written informed consent.

Trial patients

Patients in NYHA functional classes II–IV with an LVEF ≤ 40% and an elevated NT-proBNP level were eligible for DAPA-HF. Participants were also required to receive guideline-recommended treatments for HF with reduced ejection fraction. The main exclusions to enrollment were a history of type 1 diabetes mellitus hypotension causing symptoms or a systolic blood pressure <95 mmHg and an eGFR <30 ml per min per 1.73 m2.

Patients in NYHA functional classes II–IV with an LVEF > 40% and an elevated NT-proBNP level were eligible for DELIVER. Participants were also required to have evidence of structural heart disease (defined as either left atrial enlargement or left ventricular hypertrophy). All patients in DELIVER had to be receiving at least intermittent diuretic therapy but no specific background therapy was mandated during the trial. The key exclusion criteria were similar to those in DAPA-HF although the eGFR threshold was lower in DELIVER (25 ml per min per 1.73 m2).

In both trials patients with and without type 2 diabetes were randomized and randomization in both trials was stratified by type 2 diabetes status.

Outcomes

Both trials were event driven and had the same primary endpoint which was a composite of the time to the first occurrence of worsening HF or death from a CV cause. Worsening HF was defined as unplanned hospital admission for HF or an urgent visit for worsening HF resulting in the administration of an intravenous diuretic.

In the original ‘regulatory’ statistical analysis plan for the meta-analysis (dated 2 August 2019) a pre-specified hierarchy of endpoints was provided with control of alpha (see Statistical analysis below). The endpoints were: death from CV causes; death from any cause; total (that is first and repeat) hospital admissions for HF (with an additional supportive analysis of time to the first occurrence of hospital admissions for HF outside alpha control); and the composite of death from CV causes MI or stroke (MACEs). As a result of the possible attenuation of the benefit of SGLT2 inhibition at higher ejection fractions reported in the EMPEROR trials12 (as described in the introduction) we also examined the composite outcome used in the EMPEROR trials that is time to the first occurrence of hospital admission for worsening HF or death from CV causes in our analyses.

The original statistical analysis plan stated that the consistency of the effect of dapagliflozin on CV death would be examined in a limited number of subgroups defined by age (≤65 >65 years) sex (male female) race (white black or African Asian other) NYHA class at enrollment (II III/IV) LVEF at enrollment (≤40 >40%) diagnosis of type 2 diabetes mellitus at baseline (yes no) and eGFR at baseline (<60 or ≥60 ml per min per 1.73 m2). As described below additional ejection fraction subgroups were included in an updated statistical analysis plan.

In DAPA-HF the definition of a CV death included any death not judged to have a non-CV cause that is deaths where the cause could not be determined. By contrast in DELIVER deaths in which the cause could not be determined were excluded from the definition of death from CV causes. In the pre-specified statistical analysis plan the definition of death from CV causes included deaths of undetermined causes. However we also conducted a sensitivity analysis using the definitions originally employed in the individual trials.

MI and stroke were adjudicated in DAPA-HF but not in DELIVER where serious adverse event reports were used to ascertain these outcomes.

The ‘academic’ statistical analysis plan dated 30 March 2022 stated that additional LVEF subgroups in addition to those described in the DELIVER statistical analysis plan (that is ≤ 49% 50–59% ≥60%) would be considered to limit digit preference and the effects of treatment would be examined using LVEF as a continuous measure.

Statistical analysis

Before pooling DELIVER and DAPA-HF between-trial heterogeneity was tested as pre-specified using Q and I2 statistics. There was little evidence of heterogeneity for the effect of treatment on the primary outcome that is death from CV causes (Q = 0.47 P = 0.50 and I2 = 0%).

The estimand was formulated as treatment with dapagliflozin would reduce the risk of: death from CV causes; death from any cause; total (that is first and repeat) hospital admissions for HF; and the composite of death from CV causes MI or stroke (MACEs) in adults with HF irrespective of exposure treatment discontinuation or concomitant treatment. To control the family-wise error rate at the 5% alpha level a fixed sequence procedure was used with the testing procedure continued down the hierarchy if the preceding endpoint was rejected at the 5% alpha level.

Baseline characteristics were summarized as means (s.d.) median (IQRs) or percentages and described across groups according to ejection fraction. Ejection fraction was normally distributed but demonstrated digit preference and to account for this sextiles were used to describe the distribution of baseline characteristics. Cochrane Armitage and Cuzick’s tests were used to examine trends across ejection fraction quantiles. Rates were calculated using the total number of events divided by the person-years of follow-up and expressed as a rate per 100 person-years. Cox’s models included randomized therapy and were stratified by diabetes status at enrollment and trial (DAPA-HF or DELIVER). To account for the clustering within trials a variable denoting the trial was used as a stratification variable in the model to indicate that different trial populations are exposed to different baseline risks19. The effect of therapy according to ejection fraction was tested in Cox’s models by entering an interaction term between randomized therapy and ejection fraction as a continuous variable modeled as a restricted cubic spline. Three knots were chosen (ejection fraction of 6% 45% and 84%) after examining the Akaike information criterion (AIC) for different numbers of knots and the spline with the lowest AIC was chosen. All models used the full range of ejection fraction values. The interaction was represented graphically showing the HR for the effect of dapagliflozin against placebo across the range of ejection fraction. Total HF hospitalizations were analyzed by a joint frailty model with CV death treated as a competing risk20. The model included the treatment term and adjustment for previous hospital admission for HF diabetes status at enrollment and trial (DAPA-HF or DELIVER). The nonparametric estimates of the marginal mean of the cumulative number of total hospital admissions for HF over time were calculated allowing for death as a terminal event and the estimates were plotted according to the approach of Ghosh and Lin21. To examine the interaction between the effect of dapagliflozin on each CV death and total hospital admissions for HF a spline term for ejection fraction as outlined above was entered into an extension of the proportional hazards model for recurrent events as described by the Lin–Wei–Yang–Ying (LWYY) model which is a semiparametric proportional rates model22. The continuous RR interaction term was then plotted.

All analyses were conducted using Stata v.17.0 and SAS v.9.4. There were no missing data for the variables used in the models and missing follow-up data were handled by censoring at the time of the assessment for potential endpoints. Few patients in either trial had an incomplete follow-up. A P < 0.05 was considered statistically significant.

In the study published by researchers at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles and collaborators elsewhere patients with coronary artery disease but without severely impaired heart function received the highest polygenic risk score indicating a 77% increased risk for sudden cardiac death.

The investigators produced the polygenic-risk score using genome-wide genotyping in 4698 participants of European ancestry who had coronary artery disease and a left ventricular ejection fraction of greater than 30% to 35%.

Patients in the top polygenic score decile or group had a 77% increased risk for sudden or arrhythmic death after accounting for left ventricular function clinical factors and electrocardiogram parameters. However there was no association between the top group and non-sudden or arrhythmic death even when limited to cardiac causes suggesting that the score specifically predicts sudden cardiac death and not other forms of cardiac mortality in patients with coronary artery disease the researchers wrote.

Sudden cardiac death is a major international public health issue responsible for 15% to 20% of all deaths. Coronary artery disease with or without myocardial infarction represents the most prevalent cause of sudden cardiac death. In addition a family history of sudden cardiac death itself is a strong predictor of sudden cardiac death the researchers wrote.

The scientists explained that coronary artery disease and sudden or arrhythmic cardiac death may share a common genetic basis because coronary artery disease forms the foundation for most sudden cardiac death episodes. To classify risk for sudden cardiac death genetic markers must identify populations at clinically actionable levels of absolute sudden death risk in whom sudden death accounts for a substantial proportion of total mortality.

""We found incorporating information from this genetic risk score improved our ability to predict sudden death beyond the contributions of other known risk markers"" Dr. Roopinder Sandhu a study author and researcher at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center said in a statement. ""The genetics were able to identify patients where sudden death was more likely to limit their life expectancy.""

The top polygenic score group identified patients with clinically meaningful absolute risk with a sudden or arrhythmic death event rate of 8% over the study period and a group where the proportion of deaths caused by sudden cardiac death was greater at 29% compared with the remainder of the cohort at 16%.

The scientists described several novel findings. They said their study demonstrated a strong association between the top polygenic score group and sudden cardiac death in the presence of established coronary artery disease but independent of a parental history of sudden cardiac death and other clinical risk markers.

In addition they focused on an intermediate-risk population where sudden cardiac death rates are about tenfold greater than in the general population. Thus the relative risk elevations observed in the top group translated into clinically actionable absolute sudden death rates.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxlZ2FjeS5jb20vdXMvb2JpdHVhcmllcy9uYW1lL2Jvbm5pZS1qb2huc29uLW9iaXR1YXJ5P2lkPTM2MzUyMDg20gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Bonnie Johnson Obituary (2022) - Terre Haute IN - Samaritan Affordable Funeral and Cremation Services - Terre Haute,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.legacy.com/us/obituaries/name/bonnie-johnson-obituary?id=36352086 on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxlZ2FjeS5jb20vdXMvb2JpdHVhcmllcy9uYW1lL2Jvbm5pZS1qb2huc29uLW9iaXR1YXJ5P2lkPTM2MzUyMDg20gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,,,,,,

The design and results of the DAPA-HF (clinicaltrials.gov identifier NCT03036124) and DELIVER (clinicaltrials.gov identifier NCT03619213) trials have been published1267. Each enrolled patient had a diagnosis of HF functional limitation and elevated natriuretic peptides. The principal difference between the two trials was that patients with an ejection fraction ≤40% were randomized in DAPA-HF and those with an ejection fraction >40% in DELIVER. In both trials patients were randomized to dapagliflozin at a dose of 10 mg once daily or a matching placebo in addition to standard care. The ethics committees of the participating institutions approved the protocols and all patients gave written informed consent.

Trial patients

Patients in NYHA functional classes II–IV with an LVEF ≤ 40% and an elevated NT-proBNP level were eligible for DAPA-HF. Participants were also required to receive guideline-recommended treatments for HF with reduced ejection fraction. The main exclusions to enrollment were a history of type 1 diabetes mellitus hypotension causing symptoms or a systolic blood pressure <95 mmHg and an eGFR <30 ml per min per 1.73 m2.

Patients in NYHA functional classes II–IV with an LVEF > 40% and an elevated NT-proBNP level were eligible for DELIVER. Participants were also required to have evidence of structural heart disease (defined as either left atrial enlargement or left ventricular hypertrophy). All patients in DELIVER had to be receiving at least intermittent diuretic therapy but no specific background therapy was mandated during the trial. The key exclusion criteria were similar to those in DAPA-HF although the eGFR threshold was lower in DELIVER (25 ml per min per 1.73 m2).

In both trials patients with and without type 2 diabetes were randomized and randomization in both trials was stratified by type 2 diabetes status.

Outcomes

Both trials were event driven and had the same primary endpoint which was a composite of the time to the first occurrence of worsening HF or death from a CV cause. Worsening HF was defined as unplanned hospital admission for HF or an urgent visit for worsening HF resulting in the administration of an intravenous diuretic.

In the original ‘regulatory’ statistical analysis plan for the meta-analysis (dated 2 August 2019) a pre-specified hierarchy of endpoints was provided with control of alpha (see Statistical analysis below). The endpoints were: death from CV causes; death from any cause; total (that is first and repeat) hospital admissions for HF (with an additional supportive analysis of time to the first occurrence of hospital admissions for HF outside alpha control); and the composite of death from CV causes MI or stroke (MACEs). As a result of the possible attenuation of the benefit of SGLT2 inhibition at higher ejection fractions reported in the EMPEROR trials12 (as described in the introduction) we also examined the composite outcome used in the EMPEROR trials that is time to the first occurrence of hospital admission for worsening HF or death from CV causes in our analyses.

The original statistical analysis plan stated that the consistency of the effect of dapagliflozin on CV death would be examined in a limited number of subgroups defined by age (≤65 >65 years) sex (male female) race (white black or African Asian other) NYHA class at enrollment (II III/IV) LVEF at enrollment (≤40 >40%) diagnosis of type 2 diabetes mellitus at baseline (yes no) and eGFR at baseline (<60 or ≥60 ml per min per 1.73 m2). As described below additional ejection fraction subgroups were included in an updated statistical analysis plan.

In DAPA-HF the definition of a CV death included any death not judged to have a non-CV cause that is deaths where the cause could not be determined. By contrast in DELIVER deaths in which the cause could not be determined were excluded from the definition of death from CV causes. In the pre-specified statistical analysis plan the definition of death from CV causes included deaths of undetermined causes. However we also conducted a sensitivity analysis using the definitions originally employed in the individual trials.

MI and stroke were adjudicated in DAPA-HF but not in DELIVER where serious adverse event reports were used to ascertain these outcomes.

The ‘academic’ statistical analysis plan dated 30 March 2022 stated that additional LVEF subgroups in addition to those described in the DELIVER statistical analysis plan (that is ≤ 49% 50–59% ≥60%) would be considered to limit digit preference and the effects of treatment would be examined using LVEF as a continuous measure.

Statistical analysis

Before pooling DELIVER and DAPA-HF between-trial heterogeneity was tested as pre-specified using Q and I2 statistics. There was little evidence of heterogeneity for the effect of treatment on the primary outcome that is death from CV causes (Q = 0.47 P = 0.50 and I2 = 0%).

The estimand was formulated as treatment with dapagliflozin would reduce the risk of: death from CV causes; death from any cause; total (that is first and repeat) hospital admissions for HF; and the composite of death from CV causes MI or stroke (MACEs) in adults with HF irrespective of exposure treatment discontinuation or concomitant treatment. To control the family-wise error rate at the 5% alpha level a fixed sequence procedure was used with the testing procedure continued down the hierarchy if the preceding endpoint was rejected at the 5% alpha level.

Baseline characteristics were summarized as means (s.d.) median (IQRs) or percentages and described across groups according to ejection fraction. Ejection fraction was normally distributed but demonstrated digit preference and to account for this sextiles were used to describe the distribution of baseline characteristics. Cochrane Armitage and Cuzick’s tests were used to examine trends across ejection fraction quantiles. Rates were calculated using the total number of events divided by the person-years of follow-up and expressed as a rate per 100 person-years. Cox’s models included randomized therapy and were stratified by diabetes status at enrollment and trial (DAPA-HF or DELIVER). To account for the clustering within trials a variable denoting the trial was used as a stratification variable in the model to indicate that different trial populations are exposed to different baseline risks19. The effect of therapy according to ejection fraction was tested in Cox’s models by entering an interaction term between randomized therapy and ejection fraction as a continuous variable modeled as a restricted cubic spline. Three knots were chosen (ejection fraction of 6% 45% and 84%) after examining the Akaike information criterion (AIC) for different numbers of knots and the spline with the lowest AIC was chosen. All models used the full range of ejection fraction values. The interaction was represented graphically showing the HR for the effect of dapagliflozin against placebo across the range of ejection fraction. Total HF hospitalizations were analyzed by a joint frailty model with CV death treated as a competing risk20. The model included the treatment term and adjustment for previous hospital admission for HF diabetes status at enrollment and trial (DAPA-HF or DELIVER). The nonparametric estimates of the marginal mean of the cumulative number of total hospital admissions for HF over time were calculated allowing for death as a terminal event and the estimates were plotted according to the approach of Ghosh and Lin21. To examine the interaction between the effect of dapagliflozin on each CV death and total hospital admissions for HF a spline term for ejection fraction as outlined above was entered into an extension of the proportional hazards model for recurrent events as described by the Lin–Wei–Yang–Ying (LWYY) model which is a semiparametric proportional rates model22. The continuous RR interaction term was then plotted.

All analyses were conducted using Stata v.17.0 and SAS v.9.4. There were no missing data for the variables used in the models and missing follow-up data were handled by censoring at the time of the assessment for potential endpoints. Few patients in either trial had an incomplete follow-up. A P < 0.05 was considered statistically significant.

BARCELONA Spain—Promising results from multiple phase II studies of oral factor XIa inhibitors presented here at the European Society of Cardiology Congress 2022 warrant moving on to phase III trials to find out whether the anticoagulants can reduce cardiovascular events without increasing bleeding in the post-MI and poststroke settings experts say.

At a Hot Line session meeting attendees heard the results of three such trials: two of asundexian—one among patients who had had an acute MI (PACIFIC-AMI) and one among those who’d had a recent noncardioembolic stroke (PACIFIC-STROKE)—and another of milvexian among patients who had had an ischemic stroke or TIA (AXIOMATIC-SSP).

Carlos Aguiar MD (Hospital Santa Cruz Lisbon Portugal) who moderated a press conference at which the trials were discussed said it’s intriguing that evidence across studies more strongly supports an effect of antiplatelet therapy with or without oral anticoagulation on ischemic stroke rather than MI.

“It gives you the desire to see [factor XIa inhibitors] being used in patients with higher risk of cerebrovascular events but at the same time these are the ones that might get into trouble with anticoagulation and get bleeding in the brain” Aguiar commented to TCTMD. “Of course we need to wait for the phase III trials but it seems like there may be some hope here for a safe way to treat patients at higher risk of ischemic cerebrovascular disease.”

What was presented here at the meeting “absolutely” justifies further studies of this drug class Aguiar said. “I think there are sufficient results here to keep up the hope that there may be a safer alternative which would allow a broader application in clinical practice of an intensification of anticoagulation without incurring the risks [specifically of] intracranial bleeding.”

PACIFIC-AMI

John Alexander MD (Duke Clinical Research Institute Durham NC) presented the PACIFIC-AMI results which were published simultaneously online in Circulation with Sunil Rao MD (Duke Clinical Research Institute) as lead author.

In introducing the study he noted that patients have a residual risk of recurrent cardiovascular events after acute MI even when taking standard-of-care dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) with aspirin and a P2Y12 inhibitor. Studies have investigated the addition of oral anticoagulation which does reduce risk of recurrent events even further but at the cost of more bleeding. And that limits clinical use Alexander said.

Factor XIa inhibitors may be a safer option for anticoagulation because of their mechanism of action. In response to vascular injury a small amount of thrombin is generated for normal hemostasis. But in some cases there can be a burst of thrombin generation that ultimately leads to a vascular thrombus and factor XI is involved in this process. Thus inhibiting factor XI may allow for normal hemostasis but the prevention of pathological thrombus. In contrast the factor Xa inhibitors provide a broader blockade on thrombin generation preventing normal hemostasis and increasing bleeding.

“With a factor XI inhibitor we have the theoretical potential to uncouple hemostasis and vascular thrombosis” Alexander explained. He added that studies in animals and in people with congenital factor XI deficiency suggest that inhibiting factor XI might provide the efficacy of anticoagulation without additional bleeding.

In the phase II PACIFIC-AMI study the investigators assessed the novel factor XIa inhibitor asundexian which is being developed by Bayer and was shown previously in the phase II PACIFIC-AF trial of patients with atrial fibrillation to lessen bleeding relative to apixaban (Eliquis; Bristol Myers Squibb).

This new trial enrolled 1601 patients who were on DAPT consisting of aspirin and a P2Y12 inhibitor (about 50% ticagrelor 30% prasugrel and 20% clopidogrel) after an acute MI and randomized them to one of three doses of asundexian—10 20 or 50 mg per day—or placebo. Nearly all of the patients had undergone PCI for the index MI.

Asundexian effectively inhibited factor XIa activity by more than 70% with the 10-mg dose 80% with the 20-mg dose and 90% with the 50-mg dose.

The main safety outcome was BARC type 2 3 or 5 bleeding and an on-treatment analysis showed similar rates across the asundexian groups (7.6% to 10.5%) and the placebo group (9.0%). Pooling the asundexian groups together there was no increase in bleeding risk relative to placebo (HR 0.98; 90% CI 0.71-1.35). Two patients developed intracranial bleeding one taking asundexian 50 mg and the other taking placebo. There were no fatal bleeds.

Rates of any bleeding tended to be lower with asundexian (17.7% to 20.4%) than with placebo (21.3%).

The efficacy outcome was a composite of CV death MI stroke or stent thrombosis and there was no suggestion of a reduction with any dose of asundexian (5.5% to 6.8%) versus placebo (5.5%). Alexander stressed that as a phase II trial PACIFIC-AMI was not powered to assess efficacy.

“These results together with existing genetic and preclinical evidence support the further study of the factor XIa inhibitor asundexian in adequately sized phase III trials as a potentially safer anticoagulant for patients following an acute myocardial infarction” he concluded at the press conference.

PACIFIC-STROKE

Ashkan Shoamanesh MD (Population Health Research Institute McMaster University Hamilton Canada) presented the results of PACIFIC-STROKE the third piece in the PACIFIC program evaluating asundexian. This phase II trial included patients with noncardioembolic ischemic stroke who could be randomized within 48 hours of symptom onset and had planned antiplatelet therapy. Shoamanesh noted that this population has a high risk for recurrent stroke—more than 6% per year—despite use of guideline-recommended treatments.

The investigators randomized 1808 patients to the same three doses of asundexian that were evaluated in PACIFIC-AMI or placebo.

After 6 months of treatment asundexian did not provide a dose-dependent reduction in the primary composite endpoint of covert brain infarction in MRI or symptomatic recurrent ischemic stroke with rates of 18.9% to 22.0% in the asundexian arms and a rate of 19.1% in the placebo group.

Shoamanesh blamed the finding on the lack of effect on covert brain infarcts which were mostly related to small-vessel disease.

Post hoc analyses however provided some promising signals. Asundexian 50 mg reduced recurrent symptomatic ischemic strokes and TIAs through a median follow-up of 10.6 months (5.4% vs 8.3%; HR 0.64; 90% CI 0.41-0.98) with greater effects in patients whose cerebrovascular events were related to atherosclerosis.

There was no significant increase in ISTH major or clinically relevant nonmajor bleeding with asundexian (3.1% to 4.3% across groups) versus placebo (2.4%) and importantly Shoamanesh said no difference in hemorrhagic transformation between groups.

“The promising results from this phase II trial require validation in an adequately powered phase III randomized trial with the hope of ultimately developing a new paradigm that can help reduce the great residual risk of stroke in patients with noncardioembolic ischemic stroke” he said.

AXIOMATIC-SSP

The final study in the Hot Line session—AXIOMATIC-SSP—was presented by Mukul Sharma MD (University of Ottawa Canada). This phase II trial evaluated milvexian which is being developed by Bristol Myers Squibb and Janssen in patients with mild-or-moderate ischemic stroke or high-risk TIA and atherosclerosis in a vessel feeding the affected area of the brain. Within 48 hours of symptom onset patients were randomized to one of five doses of milvexian—25 mg once daily or 25 50 100 or 200 mg twice daily—or placebo. All patients received the same background antiplatelet therapy which included clopidogrel plus aspirin for the first 21 days followed by aspirin alone though day 90.

The trial had a primary endpoint similar to the one use in PACIFIC-STROKE—covert brain infarct on MRI or symptomatic ischemic stroke. Like the prior study this study too failed to demonstrate a dose-response effect of milvexian because of the lack of an effect on covert infarcts.

But the rate of symptomatic ischemic stroke was lower across all but the highest dose of milvexian (3.5% to 4.6%) compared with placebo (5.5%). The rate with the 200-mg dose was 7.7%.

Symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage occurred infrequently and there were no hemorrhagic strokes or fatal bleeds. Moreover there were low rates of serious bleeding. For instance BARC type 3c bleeds—intracranial hemorrhage including symptomatic hemorrhagic transformation—was seen in two placebo-treated patients three patients who received a 50-mg dose of milvexian and one who received a 200-mg dose.

“Based on [the] signal of efficacy for symptomatic ischemic stroke with a favorable bleeding profile milvexian will be studied further in phase III trials” Sharma said.

‘Intense Interest’

Serving as the discussant following Alexander’s presentation Michelle O’Donoghue MD (Brigham and Women’s Hospital Boston MA) reviewed several prior studies that evaluated the combination of antiplatelet therapy and anticoagulation generally showing efficacy in terms of reducing cardiovascular events but with greater bleeding.

The hope she said is that factor XI inhibition can uncouple the benefit from the risk allowing physiologic hemostasis but preventing pathologic thrombosis. Initial data on a number of investigational factor XIa inhibitors have been relatively reassuring she said pointing to orthopedic studies showing low rates of bleeding compared with low-molecular-weight heparin and to PACIFIC-AF.

And now in PACIFIC-AMI “although confidence intervals were wide it is reassuring that the addition of asundexian did not increase the risk of bleeding despite the background use of potent DAPT with potent P2Y12 inhibitors” O’Donoghue said adding that there were too few cardiovascular events in the trial to draw any conclusions about efficacy.

When it comes to potential phase III studies she added “there remains . . . intense interest that factor XI/XIa inhibitors may reduce MI stroke and [venous thromboembolism] without a marked increase in bleeding.”

Elaine Hylek MD (Boston University) speaking after the PACIFIC-STROKE presentation pointed to the “quite impressive” findings from the orthopedic studies of factor XI inhibition as a clear indication to pursue this line of research. She noted that there are still many patients who need it who are not receiving adequate anticoagulation because of a high risk of bleeding—those with advanced kidney disease and high-risk AF for instance.

“These results on phase II require validation in an adequately powered phase III randomized trial to hopefully demonstrate improved efficacy without an increased risk of bleeding” she said.",,,,,,

Her coworker has confessed to the killing,"Starr Brown a Black transgender woman was shot and killed in Tennessee last month and a coworker has reportedly confessed to the crime.

Police in Memphis say Brown was murdered in the early morning hours of April 19 after she finished her work shift at Checkers a drive-thru fast-food establishment according to local CBS affiliate WREG. She was seen on video driving away in her Pontiac G3 with coworker Alexander Williamson 20 just after 2:30 a.m. Brown’s body was discovered in her car several hours later in a wooded area on Rolling Woods Drive. She suffered a single gunshot wound to her left side.

On April 28 Williamson voluntarily walked into a police station and confessed to the crime local Fox affiliate WHBQ-TV reported. He reportedly gave a full confession but police provided no information about a possible motive or why he decided to confess.

Alexander Williamson Shelby County Sheriff's Office

Brown is the 11th known trans individual to die violently this year and the second known Black trans woman to be killed according to the Human Rights Campaign.

Jasmine Tasaki founder of WeCare Tennesse which supports trans women of color in the state decried violence against Black trans women and called for greater efforts on behalf of the trans community.

“It saddens me that we are living in a time where black transwomen are murdered with no outrage” Tasaki said in a statement. “Our community continues to suffer yet we find ways to go on. It is with deep hurt that I say Starr Brown’s name. She is now with the ancestors and can rest. It’s our duty to push harder for liberation for our people; we can only save ourselves.”

Brown was a victim of violence last year when shot while waiting for an Uber after work on October 18. She was accosted by two men around 3 a.m. She was able to use mace on the man with a gun but he wiped his face and shot her in the leg. She later told local ABC affiliate WATN-TV she felt lucky that the man didn’t shoot her in the back as she fled.

This is not the first time Williamson has been charged with murder. He was arrested in 2022 along with his brothers Artavious 23 and Ajaylin. 22 for the shooting death of a man who had been in an earlier dispute with Artvavious. He reportedly returned with his brothers to the man’s Memphis home where he shot and killed him after challenging him to a fist fight WHBQ-TV reported at the time. Williamson then 19 was charged with second-degree murder."

New York CNN Business —

August is about to come to a close which means that the summer is almost over in the Northern Hemisphere. (Have fun in the sun Australia!) If that’s not enough to bum you out then this might: September which begins on Thursday is historically the worst month of the year for the stock market.

The Dow and S&P 500 fell sharply in September last year and in 2020 even though the broader market rallied in both years. That doesn’t mean stocks are doomed to finish this September in the red of course. Stocks rallied in each of the three Septembers prior to the pandemic.

But here’s another potentially ominous sign: This is a midterm election year. The Dow has fallen in 11 out of the last 18 pre-midterm Septembers going back to 1950 according to data from The Stock Trader’s Almanac.

So don’t count on past performance to dictate future results. At the end of the day investors should focus on fundamentals instead of dates on the calendar. Earnings the economy and Federal Reserve interest rate policy will matter far more to stock performance than what month it is.

Still there’s reason to be nervous.

The Fed’s next meeting about rate hikes is on September 21. Several key economic reports are on tap that will give investors more clues about the health of the job market and whether inflation pressures are abating. Congress will be back in session just after Labor Day as well.

“There is no question that there are a number of geopolitical concerns and economic data that could lead to volatility. Investors should be prepared for that” said Josh Emanuel chief investment officer of Wilshire.

Traders should keep a close eye on the Fed and the economy he added and the good news is that there are signs that the job market remains healthy and that inflation is finally starting to cool.

If that trend persists Emanuel said “a soft landing could be a plausible scenario” meaning that the Fed won’t cause a recession by hiking rates too aggressively.

The stock market had a miserable first half of the year which could mean that the recent rebound (July’s sharp rally and a flat albeit choppy August) may continue.

“The historical concerns about September and October are less relevant this year. There are forces in play that are more significant” said Alex Chaloff co-head of investment strategy at Bernstein Private Wealth Management. “There are a number of potential catalysts for a fall rally.”

Chaloff said that if the slowdown in inflation continues “the market will cheer that significantly” and the Fed might be more likely to raise interest rates next month by just a half percentage point instead of three-quarters of a point. That could be “critical in establishing momentum for a rally” Chaloff added.

Chaloff also thinks that a soft landing is possible for the economy or in a worst case a “mild recession.” Investors don’t need to be too worried about a sharp economic downturn because “strength in consumer and corporate spending will be more than enough to carry us through” he said.

So as long as the economy keeps chugging along and inflation fears move further into the rear view mirror the market just might avoid a big September swoon.

Or an October crash. Don’t get us started on 1929. Or 1987. Or 2008…

All eyes on the jobs report

Worries about an imminent recession subsided after the stronger-than-expected-jobs report for July. The government reported that 528000 jobs were added far more than expected.

August jobs numbers are due out on Friday. Economists expect a slowdown in hiring but nothing that’s likely to lead to louder recession alarm bells.

Economists are forecasting an increase of 285000 jobs to August payrolls according to Reuters and that the unemployment rate will remain flat at 3.5%. If those estimates are met the Fed (and the markets!) will likely be happy.

“The July jobs report was so unabashedly strong so it’s hard to imagine the Fed will be worrying about the August numbers. The labor market speaks to the underlying strength of the economy” said Jake Remley senior portfolio manager at Income Research + Management.

Investors will also be keeping a close watch on the wage growth numbers in the jobs report. Any signs of a slowdown in wages could be viewed favorably by investors as more evidence that inflation pressures are cooling.

Economists are forecasting a slight increase from July with wages expected to rise 5.3% over the previous 12 months…up slightly from June’s 5.2% growth rate.

A small uptick in wage growth probably won’t set off alarm bells. But neither the Fed nor investors will want to see wages skyrocketing. That might be good news for consumers in the short run but it would not be welcome in the long haul.

As Fed chair Jerome Powell put it in Friday’s speech at Jackson Hole “a failure to restore price stability would mean far greater pain” for the economy.

Martha Stewart’s first restaurant has opened its doors in Las Vegas bringing her personal style and taste to the Strip.

The Bedford by Martha Stewart opened this month at Paris Las Vegas a few months later than the planned spring date but ready and able to welcome guests for dinner nightly.

The 194-seat restaurant is designed with a neutral color palette aimed to give it a homey feel.

“The architecture and decoration of the spaces cleverly exemplify the beauty and atmosphere you might find at my beautiful farm in Bedford New York” Stewart said in a release. “Dining at The Bedford will be immersive fun unexpected and utterly delectable.”

The Menu

Listed as casual American food on its website Stewart’s menu features a limited amount of choices in an elevated price range.

Menu items are created from sourcing seasonal high-quality ingredients from various local purveyors and some of Martha’s personal favorites including the Las Vegas Farmers Market.

It begins with a selection of appetizers including steak tartare a jumbo shrimp cocktail crab cakes and oysters Rockefeller. The standouts however are ricotta-stuffed zucchini blossoms and buckwheat crepes which are presented tableside.

The crepes come with creme fraiche grated hard-cooked eggs and Golden Osetra caviar and will run $100 for an ounce $150 for 2 ounces or $250 for 4 ounces.

Diners have four salads to choose from or a red and yellow gazpacho served with avocado and brioche croutons.

A handful of pastas and dumplings are available highlighted by a lemon risotto with carmelized fennel ($25.95) or a handkerchief pasta with herbed pesto and pine nuts ($29.95).

Seven entrees are on the menu from fish to steak and chicken. Two are drawing early attention.

A whole roast chicken stuffed with herbed breadcrumbs is available ($89.95) and the staff will carve it tableside.

A 32-ounce bone-in ribeye ($159.95) will also be sliced tableside.

Among the side dishes all priced at $15.95 a smashed baked potato tops the list and it will be smashed tableside.

“What you’ll eat here at the restaurant are dishes I serve at my own homes recipes we have perfected over the years” Stewart told Food & Wine at the restaurant’s unveiling earlier this month.

She is proud of the menu’s mix giving everyone access no matter taste or budget.

“You can splurge here and get very expensive dishes but you can also eat very nicely for a bit more moderately” she said.

Hotel officials are happy to have Stewart and her restaurant in the fold.

“The Bedford by Martha Stewart will be a dining experience you simply can’t get elsewhere” said Jason Gregory general manager of Paris Las Vegas.

The Super Bowl-winning Los Angeles Rams player will appear in a commercial for Little Caesars. The ad which airs Monday is set at a training camp with employees and football fans trying to secure a Little Caesars pizza.

Earlier this summer the Detroit-based pizza company the third-largest in the world announced its new partnership as the official pizza of the NFL.

In addition to the Stafford commercials Little Caesars is launching a new promotion called Pizza! Pizza! Pregame. Order food on the Little Caesars app before any NFL game this season and fans will be entered to win a variety of football- and pizza-related prizes including tickets to Super Bowl LVII.

“We are really excited to work with Matthew Stafford for our debut as the official pizza sponsor of the NFL” said Little Caesars senior VP of marketing Greg Hamilton in a media alert. “As a leader in the pizza business it made perfect sense for Little Caesars to partner with a leader on the field — the most recent Super Bowl champion quarterback. His relentless commitment to winning mirrors our relentless commitment to value convenience and quality.”

Stafford said in the press release that working with the Ilitch Holdings-owned pizza company has been “a great experience.”

“I’ve had a lot of fun getting a sneak peek at some of the amazing things they have planned as the official pizza sponsor of the NFL including this first commercial” he said. “I’m excited to continue my work with this brand and to enjoy their delicious pizza while doing so.”

This isn't Stafford's first time in a high-profile TV commercial. Earlier this year he appeared alongside actor Milana Vayntrub in an AT&T commercial where he gave a wink to his old team the Detroit Lions.

Little Caesars’ NFL partnership has a charitable angle to it via the brand’s Love Kitchen a restaurant on wheels that will visit key NFL cities throughout the year to give back to communities. The first stop is Sept. 7 in Los Angeles where 500 people will get free pizza and the grassroots community organization Think Watts Foundation will get a check for $125000.

Find out how she compares to other Vegas residencies.

When looking at iconic Las Vegas residencies it’s impossible to ignore those of Celine Dion. Dion has headlined two concerts at The Colosseum at Caesars Palace becoming the top-grossing residency artist in the history of the Strip. Here’s just how much money Celine Dion’s Las Vegas residencies brought in.

Celine Dion’s career and Las Vegas residencies

Born in Quebec Canada Dion’s big break came in 1982 when she won the Yamaha World Popular Song Festival per The List. She later won the 1988 Eurovision Song Contest where she represented Switzerland.

Thanks to her music manager-turned-husband René Angélil Dion went on to achieve international success after signing on to Epic Records in the United States. Since then the “All By Myself” singer has become one of the biggest voices in pop music.

Dion is responsible for many hits including “My Heart Will Go On” “The Power of Love” and “It’s All Coming Back To Me Now.” And with this success came a number of exciting opportunities for Dion to grow her presence as a live performer.

Like many artists before her Dion announced she would be doing a three-year Las Vegas residency at The Colosseum at Caesars Palace in early 2002. The show titled A New Day… consisted of 600 performances and premiered in March 2003 to much critical praise per USA Today. The venue was specially designed for Dion’s residency and routinely sold out until its end in late 2007.

Dion returned to Caesars Palace in 2011 for her new self-titled residency Celine. This show also generated millions in sales. But in March 2014 Dion and Caesars canceled all shows through March 2015 due to her husband’s battle with throat cancer which he sadly lost in 2016. She then picked up the show again for a final run and wrapped in June 2019.

How much the residencies earned and Celine Dion’s net worth today

According to OnTheStrip Dion’s A New Day is the highest grossing Las Vegas residency of all time. Ticket prices averaged $135.33 with the concert selling roughly 322000 tickets. While at The Colosseum at Caesars Palace between 2003 and 2007 the show earned an impressive $385 million.

Her second residency Celine also had massive financial success. The show amassed $296 million from 2011 to 2019.

Combined Celine Dion’s Las Vegas residencies made $681 million — earning her the title of “The Queen of Las Vegas” by various media outlets. Thanks to her years of sold-out shows and best-selling records Celine Dion’s net worth is estimated to be around $800 million per WealthyGorilla.

Does Celine Dion currently have a Las Vegas residency?

Dion was initially supposed to kick off a new Las Vegas residency at the Resorts World Theatre in November 2021. However she delayed the show due to medical reasons per The Hollywood Reporter. This also led her to cancel her remaining Courage World Tour dates earlier this year.

She issued a statement reading: “I was really hoping that I’d be good to go by now but I suppose I just have to be more patient and follow the regimen that my doctors are prescribing. There’s a lot of organizing and preparation that goes into our shows and so we have to make decisions today which will affect the plans two months down the road.”

While Dion is continuing to recover she did offer an optimistic update to her fans. According to the official Celine Dion website her 2022 European tour dates have been rescheduled to 2023 meaning ticket holders can hopefully expect to finally see the singer in concert next year.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiowFodHRwczovL2NoaWNhZ28uc3VudGltZXMuY29tL3Nwb3J0cy1zYXR1cmRheS8yMDIyLzgvMjcvMjMzMjQxODAvdG9kZC1mdWhybWFuLWNhZXNhcnMtZW50ZXJ0YWlubWVudC13aGVlbGluZy1oaWdoLXNjaG9vbC1ncmVlbi1tb3VudGFpbi1nbGFkZXMtZ3JvdG9uLWJyb29rcy1jaGljYWdv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Bet on it: Meet Todd Fuhrman the Vegas nights' goalie,"LAS VEGAS — Todd Fuhrman’s trek to sports-betting prominence began in the passenger seat of his dad’s blue Cadillac en route to hockey games in Northbrook Glenview and Park Ridge.

Early those fall Sundays Todd would pick an NFL team from this paper’s lines leaving Mark a commodities broker with the other side. Then Mark selected then Todd etc. Buck a game. Todd was 8.

Confidence pools via a buddy’s pop became “the real sweat” Fuhrman says.

At boarding school outside Boston he involved hockey teammates and friends in free website contests that awarded prizes to the largest fictional end-of-week bankrolls.

The school’s administration however balked at Fuhrman’s request to launch a Sports Betting Club akin to the more common chess or foreign-language groups.

In his senior yearbook his peers called him Most Likely to Become a Bookie. He adds “Most likely to win or lose a million dollars too.”

In college Fuhrman prospered betting on offshore sites. Those forays would bloom at the University of New South Wales in Australia where he studied as a senior.

He’d monitor money movements of the country’s National Rugby League matches on offshore lines then traipse a block from his Coogee Beach pad to the Coogee Bay Hotel and its TAB store Oz’s retail betting outlets to make wagers.

Nearly half of the country’s 4400 such outlets are in New South Wales and those Coogee purveyors moved like snails.

“Those guys thought I was a rugby savant” says Fuhrman 40. “I was following line moves watching steam move the significantly more reputable offshore books and was able to take advantage of some of the Aussie bookmakers.

“[They] just weren’t accustomed to moving [lines] based on what was going on in the Caribbean. It definitely paid for a few beers. And when talking about the liquor tax in Australia every extra dollar helps.”

TAKING A MILE

Even with all of that budding sports-betting interest and knowledge Fuhrman had been poised to use his economics degree from Wesleyan University in Connecticut to break into Wall Street as an investment associate.

Until Susan Fuhrman his aunt returned from an African safari where she had met a Caesars Palace executive. With maybe half a little toe in that door Todd jumped into the arena.

He submitted a résumé passed a battery of tests and two months later in March 2006 began working as a financial analyst for Caesars Entertainment.

“She played an extremely helpful role in giving me a jump-start” Fuhrman says of Aunt Susan. “Anytime a family member vouches for you and creates an introduction you never want to let them down.

“With a Type-A personality it was ‘OK I’ve been given an inch; now I have to take a mile.’ Like a seventh-round draft choice or someone who went undrafted someone’s given me a chance and I won’t let it slip through my fingers.”

Immersed in budgeting and market analyses involving the table-game side of the house he’d meander to the sportsbook and befriend Chuck Esposito a fellow Chicagoan who’d tutor Todd on risk management.

“How to book to faces a lot of what went into the daily machinations of moving numbers” Fuhrman says. “He was integral in my development.”

Fuhrman would ease into the Caesars book spending Saturday and Sunday there as a supervisor Wednesday Thursday and Friday in International Player Development.

“Eye-opening’’ Fuhrman says. ‘‘No matter what you think you know about sports betting until you think about it from the oddsmaker’s standpoint behind the counter you don’t understand exactly what goes into the process.”

Pressed to elaborate Fuhrman says sophisticated bettors know every book’s strengths and weaknesses when new staff starts whom they might be able to bully into getting larger limits and when early in the morning or late at night.

“You have to really develop a backbone’’ he says. ‘‘ ‘Hey look! Here are our limits.’ You’re not going to let someone sweet-talk you. They’ll get one by you from time to time but you learn. As long as it doesn’t keep happening.

“A trial by fire.”

ALMOST SEMI-PRO

Let’s back up though. Fuhrman didn’t just skate around pass the puck and unleash blue-line bazookas on the ice.

He was a goalie.

When reviewing what made him bolt from Wheeling High after his sophomore year for a boarding school in the Northeast Fuhrman at once thanks financial aid and mocks himself.

“There was plenty of endowment money for a kid who can read and write” he says “and was dumb enough to put his face in front of hockey pucks.”

At those youth tournaments he’d heard about the academic and athletic benefits of a boarding school. He’d leave friends parents Mark and Wendi and sister Hallie for the prestigious Groton School in Massachusetts.

“Even more jarring on some level [Groton] had relatively strong church ties’’ he says. ‘‘So being Jewish in a middle-class family from the Chicago suburbs and going to an Episcopalian boarding school was a little bit of culture shock in its own right.

“Arguably the toughest two years in my entire life. I’m the ultimate poster boy for the cliché: Whatever doesn’t kill you makes you stronger.”

Against Groton archrival Brooks as a senior Fuhrman faced nearly 60 shots but let only one by him. Groton attempted only six or seven all meek in a 1-0 defeat.

In the handshake line the Brooks coach apologized to Fuhrman. Groton didn’t win a game that season yet Fuhrman earned all-league honors and received a Division I scholarship offer.

Hoping to draw more D-I attention he played a season for the Green Mountain Glades in Burlington Vermont of the Eastern Junior Hockey League. He lived in an apartment with two Groton pals and worked as a Starbucks barista.

“We all had jobs and it kind of felt like you were a semi-pro athlete” Fuhrman says. “You had to show up for practice and team lifting sessions and you had to pay your bills. Add in two years of boarding school and I grew up quickly.”

He is grounded in pragmatics. At 5-10 140 pounds he harbored no pro-hockey ambitions. The sport was a passion and he viewed the EJHL as a test.

In the sports-betting industry he’d just as wisely learn the importance of versatility.

TRUST SOURCES

Caesars let Fuhrman fulfill sports-talk and other media requests to speak about the games spreads and line shifts. He’d dash to Barbary Coast or Bellagio to make bets. His social-media profile expanded.

He’d leave Caesars for a consultant’s post with the Don Best sports service learning from Kenny White. Video work there for foreign clients about American sports further honed his cadence delivery and timing.

In 2014 with Payne Insider Fuhrman launched the ‘‘Bet the Board’’ podcast which has 26000 Twitter followers NASCAR affiliation and regularly delivers a wealth of insights.

He wrote for Fox appeared on its ‘‘Lock It In’’ show (he and host Rachel Bonnetta won’t return for a fourth season) and has had a steady relationship with CBS platforms. Fuhrman is a regular guest as a Vegas insider on national talk shows.

As states legalize sports betting I ask him about the many loudmouth frauds who appear to be metastasizing by the week.

That he says is the proper word.

“Metastasizing — the perfect portrayal of it’’ Fuhrman says. ‘‘To a certain extent there are plenty of cancers in the space. When something proliferates there are more opportunities.

“But the brutal reality of it is there aren’t enough qualified individuals to fill a lot of the media obligations.”

There are only so many bona fide bookmakers only so many bona fide handicappers he says and people in a pinch just try to find someone they can portray as an expert.

It’s deeper for him and others who have devoted their lives to the nuances of the brutal cut-throat business. There’s frustration about the clueless unaccountable fakes whose “guidance” can be costly.

“You hope over time’’ he says ‘‘that casual fans understand whom he or she can trust for information versus other folks who just want to go out there and talk about gambling but don’t stay fully immersed in this world 24 hours a day.”

THE FORTUNATE GOALIE

Fuhrman says his last six months of sports wagering have been “extremely profitable” so all of the moving parts of his career are operating efficiently.

He doesn’t take his unique perch for granted.

“It’s all about developing those relationships and creating a symbiotic dynamic with the [books] in town’’ he says. ‘‘I don’t ever want to do anything dirty or deceitful. If I want a little bit more on an event I’m in a fortunate spot.

“I can send some of them a note Hey do you need a little bit more on ‘this’ side? Can I get a little bit more on ‘this’ future? If they work with me I’m just as willing to work with them. That allows you to be successful.”

The kid born in Park Ridge and raised in Wheeling though never cared for the Bears. He’s all about New York — the Knicks Rangers Yankees and Giants.

Early this summer he bet under 6.5 for the Bears’ season-victory total at even money. At both the Westgate SuperBook and South Point disinterest in Chicago has shaved that total from 6.5 to 6.

The Bears he says have an incomplete roster and rougher days ahead of them.

“[Fans] should just want to see modest improvement from Justin Fields’’ Fuhrman says. ‘‘More important that he doesn’t get sacked a Joe Burrow-like 50-plus times over the course of the season.”

With all that he juggles professionally Fuhrman has managed to have a personal life — he and girlfriend Nicole Russo recently became engaged. An online service matched them but they easily could’ve bumped into each other when he worked at Caesars; she worked two doors down for the World Series of Poker.

Fortune continues to favor the guy who willingly placed his mug before so many pucks.

The Baltimore Sun’s Hayes Gardner report on how $70 million may be spent on a minor league stadium in Hagerstown blew my mind (“The Maryland Stadium Authority will soon build a $70 million Hagerstown ballpark. First it must buy a car wash” Aug. 14)! A facility that will drew maybe 3000 minor league fans paying minor league admissions per game doesn’t make much sense at least to me.

Meanwhile the University of Maryland has a truly decrepit outdated embarrassment of a stadium 72-year-old Capitol One Field at Maryland Stadium that is in desperate need of replacement. The Big Ten brings a minimum of $40 million per year in television money to the University of Maryland and it is a great infusion for a true Maryland treasure. The need for an 80000-seat capacity NFL-style stadium with all of the “bells and whistles” for the University of Maryland football program would far exceed funding for a minor league ballpark with a minimum return on the investment. If it doesn’t make dollars it doesn’t make cents right?

To me this looks like another case of catering to rich special interest groups and another case of the real needs of the taxpayers being ignored by the alleged Maryland Stadium Authority. Where is the oversight?

In fact it seems they have at least as good availability as is offered to Singapore’s own members.

That’s shocking because there’s a basic rule of Singapore Airlines availability.



Singapore only lets their own members book long haul business and first class awards



There was a brief exception to this rule where partner programs had full access to Singapore Airlines premium cabin award space but it was a full decade ago.



That’s why it’s useful that Chase Amex Capital One and Citi points transfer to Singapore’s miles

Oddly despite being a member of oneworld Alaska Airlines has a partnership with Singapore Airlines which supports Singapore’s Seattle flight. This bilateral agreement works outside of the normal systems. And perhaps that’s why Alaska Airlines is showing crazy good award space on Singapore Airlines right now. For instance here is Los Angeles – Singapore next July for two passengers in business class:

Alaska Airlines charges 100000 miles each way for Singapore Airlines business class between the U.S. and Singapore. This isn’t a cheap award. But it’s fascinating to see availability through an airline’s program besides Singapore’s own. I haven’t tried ticketing this year but it does appear to be bookable at this time.

Unfortunately Alaska doesn’t offer Singapore redemptions between the U.S. and Europe (Houston – Manchester New York JFK – Frankfurt) and doesn’t offer premium redemptions at a low price. But there are no fuel surcharges and this was new to me.

Whether you choose Maui Kauai or Waikiki the beaches and mountains that await have the ability to take your breath away.

The remote location of Hawaii means you'll have a long flight to get to paradise regardless of where you start your journey. Hawaiian Airlines has been flying from Hawaii to destinations worldwide for over 80 years and offers a variety of ways to get to Hawaii with a bit more comfort.

Hawaiian Airlines has true lie-flat seats on some routes and offers seats with extra legroom in its economy class cabin. Hawaiian also offers a product similar to domestic U.S. first class on some intra-Hawaii flights.

As you can see there are many upgraded seating options on Hawaiian Airlines flights. Here's what you need to know about getting an upgrade when flying Hawaiian Airlines.

Snag a free Hawaiian upgrade with elite status

If you hold elite status in the HawaiianMiles program you may find yourself on the Hawaiian upgrade list. Pualani Gold and Platinum members have limited access to free upgrades to extra comfort business-class and first-class seats.

For ""neighbor island"" flights or intra-island Hawaii flights Pualani Gold and Platinum members get free upgrades to extra comfort seats (Hawaiian's premium economy product on its Airbus A330 A321neo and Boeing 717 aircraft) 24 hours before departure.

Pualani Platinum members also get free upgrades to first-class seats 24 hours before check in while Pualani Gold members can purchase an upgrade for a 50% discount if available 24 hours before departure.

Hawaiian treats flights to the rest of North America and other international destinations differently. Pualani Gold and Platinum members get access to extra comfort seating at boarding. Pualani Platinum members earn certificates redeemable for upgrades to first and business class.

Each certificate is valid for an upgrade to first or business class on Hawaiian-operated flights of 3500 miles or less. Still members can redeem multiple certificates for flights longer than 3500 miles.

Pualani Platinum members earn two certificates when they qualify for Platinum status each year six additional certificates if they fly 75000 miles in a calendar year and an additional certificate for every 10000 miles flown beyond 75000 in a year.

Pay for a Hawaiian upgrade

WALLACE COTTON/THE POINTS GUY

Hawaiian Airlines employs a ""Bid Up"" system where eligible travelers can bid to upgrade to first or business class on a Hawaiian Airlines flight. Passengers traveling in main cabin basic — Hawaiian's version of basic economy — are ineligible for the Bid Up system.

Eligible passengers can enter their confirmation number into the Bid Up page on Hawaiian's website to make a bid. You can enter a different bid for each segment but you'll need to bid for all passengers on your itinerary. If you're comfortable splitting up your party and only upgrading some travelers on your itinerary you'll need separate reservations. Hawaiian Airlines will notify you between 48 and 24 hours before departure if you've been cleared off the Hawaiian upgrade list to a first or business class seat.

Meanwhile if you want to secure an upgrade to extra comfort or preferred seats you can pay to reserve these seats. The cost will be between $5 and $49 for ""neighbor island"" flights and between $9 and $399 for other flights.

The Hawaiian Airlines® World Elite Mastercard® doesn't offer any discounts or benefits related to Hawaiian upgrades. But you can still utilize many other credit card travel credits to cover upgrade fees.

For example the Chase Sapphire Reserve offers a $300 annual travel credit and The Platinum Card® from American Express offers an airline fee credit up to $200 per calendar year in statement credits (although you'd need to enroll and select Hawaiian Airlines as your airline of choice before making your purchase).

Redeem miles for a Hawaiian upgrade

ZACH GRIFF/THE POINTS GUY

HawaiianMiles members can also redeem miles for first or business class upgrades based on availability.

For ""neighbor island"" Hawaiian flights the range of miles required to upgrade to first class is between 7500 and 15000. Meanwhile the cost to upgrade Hawaiian flights to North America or other international destinations will range between 25000 and 90000 miles depending on the destination.

Pualani Platinum and Gold members as well as HawaiianMiles credit card holders may see discounted upgrade offers for certain flights in their accounts. Unfortunately you can't redeem miles to upgrade to Hawaiian's preferred or extra comfort seats.

Bottom line

There are several ways to score an upgrade to Hawaiian first class. Intra-island flights are shorter so upgrading may not be worth the price (in cash or miles). However upgrading on longer flights may provide excellent value.

If you're a Hawaii resident or travel there frequently elite status in the HawaiianMiles program may score you some free upgrades to Hawaiian first class or business class. And Hawaiian is one of the few airlines flying to and from the mainland U.S. that employs a bidding system for upgrades.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiRGh0dHBzOi8vdGhlcG9pbnRzZ3V5LmNvbS9jcmVkaXQtY2FyZHMvcHJldHRpZXN0LWNyZWRpdC1jYXJkcy1yYW5rZWQv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,The 6 prettiest credit cards you can add to your wallet,"Update: Some offers mentioned below are no longer available.

There's no question that credit card rewards are constantly evolving and becoming more valuable than ever before. However it's not just unique perks such as dining credits Uber credits and automatic elite status that set cards apart — it's also how they physically look.

Following Chase's highly successful launch of the Chase Sapphire Reserve in 2016 there's been a rapid rise in metal cards on the market as issuers compete to offer the most eye-popping designs. And it isn't just premium credit cards with these sleek new looks — even some low- and no-annual-fee credit cards have been getting spiffy makeovers.

Cool-looking cards make for a great conversation starter. Although this factor shouldn't be reason enough to apply for a credit card (head to our best travel credit cards guide if you need help with that) today we're going to take a look at the prettiest cards currently available.

Bottom line

Issuers want you to feel proud when handing over your credit card to merchants. Despite most cards on this list being made of higher-end materials than plastic I believe that the most important trait of a good-looking card is if it shuns the standard design of the name and account number on the front rather than what it's made out of. After all wallets with too many metal cards become heavy and difficult to open and close — first-world problems I know.

As a reminder although the prettiest cards are often also the most rewarding looks shouldn't be a determining factor when applying for new cards. We have plenty of resources here at The Points Guy such as our best travel credit cards guide and monthly roundup of limited-time and new welcome offers which you can refer to if you need help deciding which credit card to apply for next.

But I keep coming back to the budget-friendly Carnival Panorama for its cruise along the Mexican Riviera.

The author enjoying a sunny day onboard Carnival Panorama. Lori A. May

I love to cruise especially from my home base on the west coast to Mexico. I've boarded Norwegian Princess and Holland America ships but my favorite vessel remains the Carnival Panorama.

The Carnival Panorama sails the same itinerary year-round from the port of Long Beach in California to Mexico including stops in Puerto Vallarta Cabo San Lucas and Mazatlán.

And while I've sailed a similar itinerary on Holland and Princess I find that the Carnival Panorama offers a similar experience for far cheaper and doesn't skimp on activities dining and exciting places to visit.

In particular one cruise from New York City where the authorities were called in to take certain people off the vessel after a late-night altercation in a nightclub onboard Carnival Magic.

In light of this Carnival Cruise Line is now including documentation in the Know Before You Go emails where it asks guests to behave and demonstrate care and respect towards others while onboard.

Carnival Asks Guests to Respect Others

While for the vast majority of people a cruise is a fun vacation away from the stress of daily life some are not able to leave their issues ashore. In recent weeks several media reported incidents where altercations had broken out between guests onboard the Carnival Cruise ships.

Unsurprisingly Carnival has now reacted by adding a new reminder to the “Know Before You Go” documentation asking guests to be respectful to others while onboard letting children enjoy the cruise while being mindful of others and respecting fundamental decencies such as waiting in line for their turn.

The new letter states: “We want you to have a memorable vacation but please remember a cruise ship is a shared space. Our Carnival Values underscore that everyone should feel welcome and included and that everyone on board demonstrate care and respect towards others.”

“No one will ever confuse a Carnival Cruise Line ship with a school library but our experience has taught us that everyone has a better time when children are supervised noise in the hallways is kept to a minimum guests follow queues and that a spirit of community and neighborliness is shown by all.”

Carnival Cruise Line also has a message for guests who do not respect the safety of all onboard or who display disruptive behavior which affects other guests or the crew members onboard:

“Consistent with our commitment to safety disruptive behavior is not tolerated and any guest whose conduct affects the comfort enjoyment safety or well-being of other guests or crew will be disembarked at their own expense and banned from sailing on Carnival in the future.”

Cruise Lines Take No-Nonsense Approach

Although incidents can always happen onboard cruise ships especially as thousands of different people from different cultures come together the recent increase in incidents onboard is worrisome for Carnival Cruise Line.

Keeping in mind that Carnival and all other cruise companies have always been no-nonsense when dealing with people that cause disturbance onboard by quickly banning them from sailing.

In June and July of this year two separate incidents happened onboard Carnival Cruise ships. In June passengers on a Carnival cruise onboard Carnival Magic sailing back home to New York City got into trouble in the nightclub on the final evening of the cruise. The NYPD met them on arrival and the group was banned from ever again sailing with Carnival Cruise Line again.

In July a group of passengers onboard Carnival Elation sailing from Jacksonville Florida were involved in a disturbance. The security team quickly intervened and the group was reported to law enforcement. Those who instigated the altercation will no longer be able to sail on the Carnival ships.

Another incident was reported aboard Royal Caribbean International’s Voyager-class Navigator of the Seas in early July. Around twelve passengers were involved in an altercation on deck 5 of the vessel near the Cafe Promenade. That incident was believed to have been between family members.

But it’s not just post-pandemic where these incidents occur. Perhaps one of the most well-known is the cruise onboard Carnival Legend in Australia. There were brawls onboard involving around 30 people with clashes between two groups of cruise ship passengers who were all arrested by Australian police.

Besides being disruptive to the guests who behave while onboard this behavior is also hazardous. Not only are guests in an environment where alcohol is flowing freely but ships are also an inherently dangerous place to be something that some passengers forget.

Luckily cruise lines do take action against these people and ensure they will never sail again onboard.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMihwFodHRwczovL3d3dy50ZWxlZ3JhbS5jb20vc3RvcnkvZW50ZXJ0YWlubWVudC9ldmVudHMvMjAyMi8wOC8yOC93b3JjZXN0ZXItY2FyaWJiZWFuLWFtZXJpY2FuLWNhcm5pdmFsLW1hcmNoZXMtbXVzaWMtZm9vZC1mdW4vNzkwNjI3MTAwMS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Worcester Caribbean American Carnival marches on with music food fun,"WORCESTER — When Ashley Cruz crafted the costume she wore for Sunday's Worcester Caribbean American Carnival she made sure to include blue red and yellow feathers on her crown.

Those are the national colors of Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands which Cruz proudly represented as one of the many people who paraded from City Hall to Institute Park in an entourage drenched in Caribbean rhythms.

“Today I represent my roots” Cruz said. “It’s a day that as a Worcester resident I can be who I really am.

“I’m from Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands and I’m proud of it.”

In its eighth year the Worcester Caribbean American Carnival Association's (WCACA) annual carnival parade and festival returned to the city for the first time since 2019 after the pandemic derailed the past two events.

The carnival roared back in brilliant grandeur kicking off in front of City Hall where folks representing various Caribbean countries wore colorful clothing and elaborate costumes while dancing and marching to music from Jamaica the Dominican Republic and Guyana among others.

The carnival paraded down Main Chandler and Highland streets before finally stopping at Salisbury Street where the smell of cooking food wafted over festivalgoers gathered at Institute Park.

'Engaged in the community'

Katherine Lazo a Dominican mother of three said the carnival was a day of cultural celebration which she saw as important for her children to learn about and experience.

“With what the different cultures are bringing to this event we’re looking forward to exploring all of it” Lazo said. “It's really important to get the kids back and engaged into the community because now that we're coming out of the pandemic a lot of them are not even used to hanging out with each other.""

According to the WCACA the event's mission is to “promote a broader understanding and deeper appreciation of the Caribbean and Black American experience.”

Covered in blues reds and whites Juan Bodre said that his costume as “El Diablo Cojuelo” or “The Naughty Devil.”

Bodre said he enjoyed bringing to Worcester something typically seen — and heard — in the Dominican Republic capital of Santo Domingo.

Indeed the jingling of the hundreds of bells that hung from his costume were hard to miss during the festivities.

“When you have something like this event it brings everybody together” said Bodre who lives in Worcester. “Through this we can celebrate our Caribbean core heritage for one day.”

Food and more food

At Institute Park ethnic food choices included savory specialties such as Jamaican escovitch fish and curried crab or goat.

Festivalgoers also licked their spoons covered in sweetened ice with flavors of mango and cherry.

Hard to pass on were also the fresh fruit that ranged from coconut that was cut live with a manchette to the ginip — a fruit similar to guava but with pulp that is sweet like candy.

Andrew Hart who's Jamaican and the owner of fruit store 4U Bridal cut fresh coconuts.

“The food brings island vibes” Hart said. “My stand here brings a flavor of Jamaica.”

Bruno Schaidong a WPI student heard the music from his dorm and headed to the event to listen to the music and try the cherry ice gelato.

“Not everyone's from the exact same place and it's good to embrace that in events like this” Schaidong said. “This is a way for people to share where they come from and what they bring which is a great way to inform others to embrace differences rather than not."""
CARR,Carrier Global,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMie2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZXZlcmdlLmNvbS8yMDIyLzgvMjcvMjMzMjQxMjgvdC1tb2JpbGUtc3BhY2V4LXNhdGVsbGl0ZS10by1waG9uZS10ZWNobm9sb2d5LWFzdC1seW5rLWluZHVzdHJ5LXJlYWN0aW9ucy1hcHBsZdIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,How Elon Musk SpaceX and T-Mobile are helping the satellite-to-cellular business,"On Thursday Elon Musk got on stage with T-Mobile CEO Mike Sievert to announce that SpaceX is working with the carrier to completely eliminate cellular dead zones. The companies claim that next-generation Starlink satellites set to launch next year will be able to communicate directly with phones letting you text make calls and potentially stream video even when there are no cell towers nearby. What’s more Musk promised all this is possible with phones that people are using today without consumers having to buy any extra equipment.

It’s a bold proclamation from the carrier — Verizon and AT&T don’t offer anything like it. However SpaceX and T-Mobile aren’t the only companies looking to use satellites to directly communicate with cell phones using existing cell spectrum. For years a company called AST SpaceMobile has promised that it will beam broadband to phones from space and a company called Lynk Global has already demonstrated that its satellite “cell towers” can be used to send text messages from regular phones. It’s easy to imagine that these companies would be afraid that two giants were suddenly looking to get in on a similar game — but it turns out that’s not the case at all. They actually seem delighted.

Who’s competing with SpaceX and T-Mobile in satellite-to-phone tech?

“We love the validation and the attention that this is bringing to this technology” said Lynk’s CEO Charles Miller in an interview with The Verge. “We’ve been getting all kinds of calls of carriers today who are like ‘help us!’”

Earlier this year Lynk deployed its first commercial satellite which was ferried into orbit by a SpaceX Falcon 9. Image: Lynk

Lynk’s initial goal is similar to SpaceX’s — it’s partnering with a number of carriers around the world to let their customers send texts using a satellite network it’s currently in the process of building. Like T-Mobile’s presentation Miller especially stressed the tech’s importance during emergencies and natural disasters where things like hurricanes wildfires flooding or earthquakes can take down traditional cell networks. “It’s resilience. It’s instant backup working for everybody on Earth. Your phones even though the towers are down can communicate” he said. “This will save lives.”

Miller’s pitch is very similar to Sievert’s and Musk’s but he doesn’t seem particularly worried about competing in the same space (pun intended) as them. Part of his confidence comes from Lynk being an early leader in the market — it claims that in early 2020 it became the first to send a text message to an unmodified cell phone from space. “We think there’s going to be more big companies jump in. They have years and years to go. They’re years behind us” he said. “We’re going to be like ‘wonderful! Educate the world that this technology is done.’ And when we start rolling it out at the end of this year people are going to go ‘I want it.’ They’re not going to want to wait years for it.”

Lynk SpaceX and AST all promise varying levels of connectivity

Scott Wisniewski the executive vice president and chief strategy officer at AST echoed a similar sentiment. “Our CEO actually tweeted and he said we’re happy that they’re focusing on this real big market and this real big need. And it was comforting to hear folks say things like the technology works for them” he said. He also predicted that the market for satellite-to-phone communication likely wouldn’t be winner-take-all. “In terms of the overall market it will be multiple winners in our view.”

AST’s service is perhaps more ambitious than what T-Mobile announced. Sievert said that he hopes T-Mobile will someday be able to deliver data via SpaceX’s satellites where AST’s express goal is to operate 4G and 5G networks. It’s betting that the idea of broadband will be more appealing than just being able to text and make calls from remote locations. “We all really understand that phones can go out of service quite frequently or coverage can be poor. And that was a point that was highlighted by T-Mobile. So our solution is really attractive in that regard” Wisniewski said.

Where SpaceX and T-Mobile’s plan is largely limited to the US and its territories — the wireless spectrum SpaceX is using for its service is owned and operated by other carriers and agencies internationally so additional deals are necessary for it to work anywhere outside the US — AST and Lynk have global aspirations. AST has gotten investment and a five-year exclusivity deal with Vodafone one of the world’s largest cell providers and has also received investment from Rakuten a mobile carrier in Japan. Miller says that Lynk’s testing its service in 10 countries “as we speak” and is capable of providing it in dozens more.

Even the timing of T-Mobile and SpaceX’s announcement is perfect for AST and Lynk as they tell it. The former is getting ready to launch a test satellite in just a few weeks (with five more slated for 2023) and the latter is planning on launching its commercial service with 14 network operators by the end of the year. If there was ever an ideal time for consumers to become very interested in exactly the thing you’re working on right as you're about to take a big first step might be it.

How Apple and iPhone 14 rumors fit into this puzzle

Tim Farrar an analyst at satellite and telecom-focused consulting and research firm Telecom Media and Finance Associates however thinks T-Mobile’s timing could be because another huge competitor is about to enter the market — one that could have advantages that AST SpaceX and Lynk don’t. “The issue is going to be what happens with Apple next week” he said referring to rumors that the next iPhone may be able to communicate with the Globalstar satellite network for emergency purposes.

If that happens he says iPhone users might get this feature very soon and in a version that includes international support from the start. “I think what’s likely is if Apple does announce something next week it will be something that’s ready to go as soon as the phone’s available. Because if they’re partnered with Globalstar Globalstar already has 24 satellites operating in space that you can communicate with and they have the licenses with the FCC and many other international jurisdictions.”

That last part is particularly important. All Apple has to do according to Farrar is get equipment authorization from the FCC through a “simple and well-defined” process and it’s off to the races. For the other companies — including SpaceX — who want to transmit from space using spectrum that’s licensed by cell carriers it’s not so easy. Historically satellites used satellite spectrum and cell towers used terrestrial spectrum. But Farrar says that satellite-to-cell tech mixes the two in a way that the rules currently don’t really allow for. “It’s a big regulation change for the FCC to make. And it’s something they’ve been considering for two years and not really reached a resolution.”

T-Mobile’s carrier competitors may even try to look for a way to prevent SpaceX from using the carrier’s spectrum which could complicate things further. “There’s going to be a lot of fighting over use of terrestrial spectrum on satellite” Farrar said. “There have already been interference concerns expressed when AST was looking to partner with AT&T to trial their system. None of the major wireless carriers want their rivals to gain the advantage. So clearly people will protest any application for use of T-Mobile spectrum on satellites. And the FCC will have to make a decision that which may not be reached very quickly.”

“Regulatory’s a process all of telecom is regulated.” - Scott Wisniewski

Indeed Miller wouldn’t really talk about spectrum saying that Lynk has “an open issue” with it. Wisniewski said that one of AST’s plans for dealing with spectrum issues is to work with carriers to get approval from regulators. He also said that the nature of providing service where there currently isn’t any could make things a bit easier. “We share the spectrum with mobile network operators on a noninterference basis in places where they don’t have towers.”

While AST has regulatory approval for commercial operation in seven countries according to Wisniewski the FCC has only authorized it to test its satellite to provide service to the US on an experimental basis.

As for SpaceX and T-Mobile their plans are quite a ways out giving the companies time to try and work things out with regulators — they don’t expect to even start testing their service until the end of next year.

If one company can break through with a phone that connects to satellite networks though it could potentially help all the other companies out. For example if Tim Cook gets on stage on September 7th and announces that you can send emergency satellite messages from the iPhone 14 a lot of people who don’t use iPhones are going to get real jealous real fast. That could add to pressure on the FCC to authorize the satellite-to-phone tech for carriers and their satellite communications partners. And if T-Mobile has it you know AT&T and Verizon will be making some calls. (Farrar thinks that other handset makers that don’t have as much clout as an Apple or a Samsung would have a difficult time introducing a similar feature — carriers could fight them arguing that their phones should just use the carrier’s satellite capabilities instead.)

Verizon specifically does actually already have an agreement for satellite connectivity though in a different form. It’s partnered with Amazon’s Kuiper project which aims to create a satellite constellation similar to SpaceX’s. Instead of doing direct satellite-to-phone communication though Verizon’s plan is to feed remote cell towers with satellite service instead of having to run fiber or cable to them. During the event on Thursday Sievert did say that T-Mobile was open to the possibility of doing something similar with SpaceX.

Neither Verizon nor Amazon responded to The Verge’s request for comment on whether they’d be modifying their plans based on T-Mobile and SpaceX’s announcement.

As for AST and Lynk neither company is particularly interested in competing on that front. “You don’t need to build these remote cell towers if your phone’s already connected by the satellite” said Miller.

Elon Musk let the satellite-to-phone cat out of the bag

At this point there’s really only one thing that seems totally clear: T-Mobile and SpaceX have let a genie out of the bottle. They announced loudly that soon your phone will be able to connect to satellites letting you have at least some level of communication even when you’re in areas that have traditionally been completely isolated.

There are a lot of ways things could play out from here — AST’s tests could show that yes you really can beam relatively fast internet to phones from space and raise the bar for what consumers want higher than where T-Mobile and SpaceX have set it. Or maybe regulators could suddenly figure things out letting Lynk swoop in before T-Mobile gets out of beta. And of course there’s always the possibility that everyone gets caught in a huge regulatory mess letting Apple come in and do its own thing with a completely different kind of technology.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXmh0dHBzOi8vdmVyb25ld3MuY29tLzIwMjIvMDgvMjgvc2t5Ym9ybmUtYWNhZGVteS1hZGRzLWRlbHRhLXRvLWxpc3Qtb2YtbWFqb3ItYWlybGluZS1wYXJ0bmVycy_SAV5odHRwczovL3Zlcm9uZXdzLmNvbS8yMDIyLzA4LzI4L3NreWJvcm5lLWFjYWRlbXktYWRkcy1kZWx0YS10by1saXN0LW9mLW1ham9yLWFpcmxpbmUtcGFydG5lcnMv?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Skyborne Academy adds Delta to list of major airline partners,"Skyborne Airline Academy Vero Beach has added Delta Airlines to its growing list of flight-training partnerships with major and regional carriers.

The agreement with Delta’s Propel program the airline’s pilot-career pathway was finalized earlier this month and comes seven months after Skyborne announced a new partnership with United Airlines’ Aviate program.

Skyborne also has established partnerships with: SkyWest Airlines the nation’s largest regional carrier; Endeavor Air which operates as a Delta Connection; and Envoy Air a wholly owned subsidiary of American Airlines and formerly known as American Eagle Airlines.

In addition the academy has agreements to train pilots for two charter airlines.

“It’s certainly good for business” Ed Davidson managing director of Skyborne’s Vero Beach flight school said of the partnerships. “It increases our top-line revenues and it’s always nice to have those relationships especially at a time when airlines need more pilots.

“Delta is a great addition to our stable” he said.

Delta’s Propel program launched in 2018 to identify select and develop the next generation of pilots is designed to take candidates through to their commercial and certified flight instructor ratings on their path to becoming a first officer.

According to a statement from Delta Propel is a highly selective program that provides current Delta employees who have worked for the company for at least three years with a transition opportunity and the support to pursue a career as a commercial airline pilot.

To qualify candidates must have a private pilot’s license and at least 100 hours of flight time.

Only a select few are chosen each year. They are then given a defined path timeline to become a Delta pilot and five-year leave of absence to complete their training.

After being trained by Skyborne and working no more than 42 months at a Delta Connection carrier Propel participants may transition to a pilot position at Delta Airlines.

“This program will allow Delta to continue to invest in its people tapping into their passion for aviation and the strength of the Delta culture” the company’s statement reads.

Davidson said Propel candidates can expect to spend 30 to 40 weeks at the academy where they’ll train in single-engine Piper Warrior aircraft.

“Every aspect of our training is designed to prepare cadets for airline operations in terms of core knowledge and decision making flight deck procedures and professionalism” Davidson said.

Apparently Skyborne’s global reach and commitment to filling the cockpits of major commercial carriers has drawn the attention of industry leaders.

“Skyborne has the level of professionalism and training rigor we look for in our flight school partners” Delta Propel program manager Kelvin Mason said.

While the Skyborne flight training remains the same the programs offered by each airline is different Davidson said adding that some carriers pay for cadet training and others make conditional job offers.

He said he expects the academy to have as many as 200 candidates on campus by the middle of next year and 300 by the end of 2023.

“We’ve been progressing at a pretty good rate” Davidson said.

Earlier this year after the academy’s agreement with United was announced Skyborne Chief Executive Officer Lee Woodward said the partnerships with major carriers produced a “significant rise in applications.”

Skyborne which was founded at the Gloucestershire Airport in the United Kingdom in 2018 has quickly earned an international reputation as one of the most respected commercial-pilot training schools in the industry.

The IFC solution will enter commercial service from early 2023 with Inmarsat serving as the aero ISP.

The national carrier of Saudi Arabia is a long-time customer of SITA’s L-band satellite-based Internet service. In partnership with SITA it later opted for the Taqnia Space Ka/Ku broadband hybrid terminal for in-operation A320s and began doing the same for its Boeing 777s before the COVID-19 pandemic. But in November 2021 SAUDIA became the first airline in the world to select a next generation GX terminal called Falcon 300 from Stellar Blu (formerly GDC Technics).

The Falcon 300 terminal which will transmit data over GX features Stellar Blu’s unique modem manager with exclusive components by Kontron and next-generation modem by iDirect together with a Ka-band flat panel VICTS antenna from ThinKom Solutions. It will be retrofitted to 20 Airbus A321neos as well as 15 of the A321XLR variant after they are delivered to SAUDIA.

While Inmarsat boasts a robust roster of value added reseller (VAR) partners for GX it has also taken a more direct approach with certain airline customers serving as the Internet service provider. And indeed for the SAUDIA program the aero ISP will be Inmarsat confirms Inmarsat SVP inflight connectivity William Huot-Marchand to Runway Girl Network.

“We see this as the start of an exciting relationship with SAUDIA and a great opportunity to extend coverage and availability of GX within the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia” he says.

Asked by RGN how the PaxEx (passenger experience) available on Stellar Blu/GX-fitted SAUDIA aircraft will compare to aircraft equipped with the hybrid UON solution offered by Taqnia Space and SITA Huot-Marchand says: “Inmarsat and Stellar Blu will provide SAUDIA with higher speeds better consistency of service and our advanced new OneFi passenger experience platform allowing the national carrier’s passengers to experience an inflight service that far exceeds what has been available until now.”

Revealed last year OneFi brings a host of onboard services together within a single portal interface which passengers can access using their own personal devices.

Though the timeline for launching the new nextgen GX solution has moved slightly to the right — it is now scheduled for early 2023 versus late 2022 — Inmarsat says the new Stellar Blu terminal is in fact ready for deployment following the successful conclusion of a flight trial campaign “where its performance was tested across more than 320 simultaneous online user sessions and sustained throughput of over 200 Mbps.”

The Falcon 300 terminal “has received full type approval for use over Inmarsat’s Global Xpress (GX) satellite network” notes the satellite operator and aero ISP and has been designed to enable passengers to stream high-definition videos download documents browse the Internet shop online and enjoy social media from the comfort of their seat.

Because the product is not linefit offerable at Airbus Stellar Blu will be installing the Falcon 300 terminal on SAUDIA’s new Airbus narrowbodies post-delivery.

The lightweight terminal is compatible with all existing and upcoming satellites from Inmarsat’s GX network according to Inmarsat. Asked if this statement contemplates future Viasat satellites once the Calsbad California-based satellite operator’s acquisition of Inmarsat is complete Huot-Marchand says: “The terminal is fully compatible with all existing and upcoming GX satellites including 7 8 9 and 10a/10b.” (A vertically integrated provider of IFC Viasat previously indicated it is looking to meld the direct aero model with Inmarsat’s VAR ecosystem.)

Tracy Trent who serves as president of Stellar Blu said the firm looks forward to seeing its Falcon 300 terminal onboard SAUDIA’s Airbus A321neo and Airbus A321XLR aircraft “followed by many more airline fleets in the years to come.”

How to Check if an iPhone Is Unlocked in the Settings Menu

The easiest way to see if your iPhone is unlocked is to check your Settings menu. This method isn't always accurate but it's a good place to start.

Open the Settings app on your iPhone. Tap Cellular > Cellular Data Options. Look for an option called ""Cellular Data Network"" or ""Mobile Data Network."" If you see either one of these options your phone is most likely unlocked. If you don't see these options your phone is most likely locked.

If you travel overseas your phone isn't going to work unless you have a truly excellent service plan. The easier and more affordable option is to swap your existing SIM card for a local SIM. This will give you a new phone number to use in that country but will grant you the ability to use your phone and data on the road.

The first step is to power off your iPhone. Removing a SIM card while the device is powered on can damage the phone and the SIM. Locate the SIM card on your iPhone. Look for a small circular opening about the size of a pinhole. Use a SIM card ejector tool to remove the iPhone's SIM card. These tools simplify the process of removing a SIM card but you can also use a safety pin or a paperclip. Look at how your existing SIM card fits into the tray. Set it to the side in a safe location and place the new SIM card into the tray in the same fashion. Re-insert the tray into the iPhone. Press until you hear a soft click. nerosu / Getty Images Power the iPhone back on. Try to make a call. If your iPhone is able to connect to the network with a new SIM then it's unlocked. If your phone is unable to connect to the network then your device is locked. There are several ways to get around this such as contacting your carrier and asking them to unlock the device or using a third-party service. Some carriers may charge to unlock a device. However certain areas have legislation requiring companies to unlock mobile devices free of charge. You're done!

How to Check if an iPhone Is Unlocked Using an IMEI Service

Your phone has an IMEI (international mobile equipment identifier) number that is a tell-all for any information relating to the device.

There are multiple online services that will scan databases of IMEI numbers and tell you whether your iPhone is unlocked or not. However most are paid services the free services aren't always reliable and both are sometimes inaccurate.

Find the service you want to use. One of the most reliable services is IMEI Info which does a basic check for free with paid options for more information. Another free option is IMEI24 but your results may vary; the service might even time out before it can return results. On your iPhone and tap Settings > General. Tap About and scroll down to the IMEI number. This appears just below the serial number Wi-Fi address and Bluetooth information. Enter your IMEI number into the search bar of the IMEI service you chose. Select Check and fill out any verification information the website requires. It will then attempt to match your IMEI number again those stored in the databases. If you entered your number correctly you'll be able to see a lot of information about your phone including the production date the carrier it's attached to whether it's locked or not and more. The IMEI number will also reveal whether or not a device is stolen.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMifmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmluZGlhdG9kYXkuaW4vd29ybGQvc3RvcnkvY2hpbmVzZS1haXJjcmFmdC1jYXJyaWVyLWNvbWJhdC1kcmlsbC1zb3V0aC1jaGluYS1zZWEtdGFpd2FuLXRlbnNpb25zLTE5OTMxNDYtMjAyMi0wOC0yNtIBggFodHRwczovL3d3dy5pbmRpYXRvZGF5LmluL2FtcC93b3JsZC9zdG9yeS9jaGluZXNlLWFpcmNyYWZ0LWNhcnJpZXItY29tYmF0LWRyaWxsLXNvdXRoLWNoaW5hLXNlYS10YWl3YW4tdGVuc2lvbnMtMTk5MzE0Ni0yMDIyLTA4LTI2?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,China's aircraft carrier conducts combat drills in South China Sea amid Taiwan tensions,"A Chinese aircraft carrier which raised eyebrows by undergoing overhaul and upgrades just over two years after its launch held combat drills in the South China Sea with its full battle group consisting of a flotilla of naval ships including a nuclear submarine as Beijing ratcheted tensions over Taiwan.

The Shandong -- the People's Liberation Army (PLA) Navy's second aircraft carrier and the first domestically built -- recently held comprehensive drills in the South China Sea in a group consisting of full combat elements which analysts said showed that the carrier is becoming ready for far sea operations state-run Global Times reported on Friday.

Shandong conducted realistic combat-oriented exercises in an undisclosed area in the South China Sea in early autumn to comprehensively test the force's combat capabilities the report said quoting a PLA South Sea Fleet press note released on Wednesday.

During the drills the Shandong hosted take-off and landing operations of J-15 carrier-based fighter jets and practised replenishment-at-sea operations the press note said.

A video attached to the press note showed that the aircraft carrier manoeuvred in a combat group featuring a Type 055 large destroyer a Type 052D destroyer a Type 054A frigate and a Type 901 comprehensive supply ship.

Generally speaking a nuclear-powered attack submarine would also be part of an aircraft carrier group the report quoted a defence expert as saying.

Shandong’s drills in the South China Sea with full complement of its combat group comes at a time when China has ratcheted its military drills near Taiwan after the recent visit of US House Speaker Nancy Pelosi the highest-level visit by a US official in 25 years sparking off tensions in the region.

The report on the aircraft carrier conducting combat drills came as a number of US lawmakers have started visiting Taiwan after the high-stakes trip by Pelosi.

On Friday US Senator Marsha Blackburn visited Taipei and called on Taiwan President Tsai Ing-wen.

Pelosi's visit prompted China to launch the exercises that saw it fire missiles and send dozens of warplanes and ships over and around the self-ruled island which Beijing says will be reunified with the mainland even by force.

Beijing claims Taiwan a part of it under the 'One China' policy and takes umbrage against any official and diplomatic contacts by other countries with Taipei.

China also faced periodic forays by US naval ships including aircraft carriers and planes challenging Beijing’s claims over the South China Sea and to assert freedom of navigation.

China claims most of the South China Sea. Vietnam Malaysia Philippines Brunei and Taiwan have counterclaims over the area.

The Shandong entered service with the PLA Navy in December 2019 in Sanya South China's Hainan Province.

In April it had to undergo its first maintenance and comprehensive examination upgrades and overhaul according to official media reports raising questions over its operational readiness.

Defence experts say that while China is producing aircraft carriers at a faster pace it is still a work in progress for the J-15 carrier-based fighter jets which were stated to be too heavy for deployment on aircraft carriers.

China is rapidly modernising its navy almost launching a battleship every month or two.

In June China launched its third aircraft carrier Fujian which was stated to be the most advanced as it has a catapult system called the electromagnetic aircraft launch system (EMALS) for the aircraft to take off and land.

The system is used also on the US Navy’s Gerald R Ford-class carriers according to the media reports.

Both Liaoning and Shandong are equipped with ski-jump take-off ramps while the Fujian features a flat top flight deck.

Caterpillar migration swarms Phoenix-area neighborhoods,"Thousands of fuzzy yellow caterpillars are creeping across the Phoenix metropolitan area crossing roads falling into pools and getting into homes.

Some may think they're cute or creepy but they aren't dangerous and they don't stick around for long. They make their way off the mountains like South Mountain and into the valleys.

""The whole mountain looks like it’s undulated with yellow as they’re coming down and coming really fast"" said Ahwatukee resident Kelly Athena.

Athena has been studying these caterpillars in her Ahwatukee neighborhood for years. Not only observing them but rescuing them from harm's way too.

""So they usually come in Ahwatukee across Chandler Boulevard"" Athena said. ""I went over to 17th Ave where they usually are and there were hundreds of them coming from the north and they’re heading towards the south.

""They’re heading for softer soil where they can dig their burrow and become a moth so I took a bucket and filled it with about a hundred of them and then I got across the road and let them go in some of the spiderling and other bushes they like"" she continued.

These furry yellow caterpillars will eventually turn into the white-lined sphinx moth.

Experts with Butterfly Wonderland say that they come off the mountains every August and hibernate before the monsoon season ends.

But unlike butterflies that create a cocoon they bury themselves into the ground turning into a pupa before transforming.

""Give a little bit of patience and kindness for these caterpillars they’re not looking to hang around for long"" said Derek Kellogg with Butterfly Wonderland. ""They’re really looking to move right through our areas and get on to their next stage in life.""

Kelly Athena says these caterpillars are relatively harmless. They won't chew through clothes or food but love Arizona's natural desert vegetation. But back in the day they were an edible delicacy.

""Thomas Hunter who was the first man to bring cattle to Arizona in 1868 he came over the ridge and he looked down and he saw about 250 Pima women in a line"" Athena said. ""They were out gathering mesquite beans and putting them in their baskets and around their necks they had beautiful necklaces.

""As he got closer he saw that they were wriggling caterpillars and they’d eat some raw and they were taking some back to be roasted"" Athena continued.

For residents seeing an influx of the critters it's not necessary to call an exterminator. They will be gone in a few days so just be patient.

If you find them in a pool use a little net and scoop them out or use latex gloves to move them along so that they don't leave a yellow mark behind on you.

Sara Dousharm environmental educator and Butterfly House Curator at Airlie Gardens is set to give a lecture on butterflies at Ocean Isle Beach at the Museum of Coastal Carolina on Aug. 30.

In advance of the seminar Dousharm shares six facts about how to have a beautiful backyard that butterflies would love to visit.

What are the different varieties of butterflies in North Carolina?

North Carolina is home to more than 175 species of butterflies. Some of them are very easily recognizable and well-known such as the monarch or eastern tiger swallowtail butterfly.

More:After 50 years the Wilmington club for 'plantaholics' continues to grow

Others such as the least skipper or pearl crescent are much smaller and tend to blend into their surroundings so while they are common they may not catch our eye as often.

What is the life span of butterflies?

This can vary from species to species but most butterflies live an average of about two months. They have a unique life cycle called metamorphosis; the four stages are egg caterpillar chrysalis adult.

Each stage will last approximately two weeks for a total of about two months.

This means that butterflies can pass through a few generations every year. There are some outliers to this for example butterflies who migrate south for winter will have an adult phase of several months.

When are butterflies most active?

Adult butterflies are most active in our area from late spring through summer into early fall. Not only are temperatures most comfortable for the butterflies this time of year but this is also when flower nectar is most available. As temperatures start to drop some species of butterfly migrate south for winter. Examples of migratory butterflies that we see in our area include monarchs gulf fritillaries and cloudless sulfurs. Other species of butterflies will stay for winter but will spend winter in a different phase of their life cycle. The last black swallowtail caterpillars of the summer will become a chrysalis and then remain a chrysalis all winter until emerging in the spring. The chrysalis has its own form of antifreeze inside to help protect it from colder weather.

What are the adaptations and notable features of butterflies?

Butterflies and moths are in the order Lepidoptera which means “scale-wing.” The colors you see on butterfly wings come from microscopic scales and the reason you are not supposed to touch butterfly wings is because the sweat and oils on our skin can easily rub these scales off.

The straw-like tongue that a butterfly uses to drink nectar from flowers is called a proboscis.

Butterflies have more photoreceptors in their eyes than we do which means they can see a wider range of colors including in ultraviolet. This helps them to find food or to find a mate.

Why are butterflies important?

Butterflies are significant pollinators and their role allows flowering plants to produce seeds which will grow more plants. This is a crucial ecosystem service! Plants provide many other creatures with oxygen shelter and food.

Approximately 1/3 of our food crops must be pollinated by insects such as butterflies. This is important to our health and to our economy.

All phases of the butterfly life cycle are an important part of local food chains. Many songbirds will select caterpillars to feed to their hatchlings because caterpillars are softer than other insects such as crickets or beetles. One nest of baby birds may require thousands of caterpillars before they fledge!

How can we support butterflies in our own yards?

The best thing you can do to support butterflies in your own yard is to plant native. Plants that naturally occur in our area will do the best job of supporting butterflies that naturally occur in our area. Over 85% of land in North Carolina is privately owned so creating habitat for butterflies in our yards can make a big difference.

Adult butterflies need “nectar plants” which are plants that produce flowers that they can drink nectar from. Planting nectar plants that bloom at different times will help support butterflies all throughout their active season. Some nectar plants to consider for a garden in Southeastern North Carolina are wild bergamot purple mistflower coreopsis black-eyed Susan and calico aster.

Caterpillars depend on “host plants” for food. Different species of butterflies have different species of host plants. The adult butterfly will lay their eggs on the host plant so that the caterpillars have easy access to the food they can eat. One of the most well-known host plants is milkweed which is eaten by monarch caterpillars. Without milkweed we would have no monarchs! Other examples of host plants that will support caterpillars in Southeastern North Carolina are purple passionflower for gulf fritillaries and paw paw trees for zebra swallowtails.

When you create butterfly habitat in your yard you are also supporting other pollinators such as moths hummingbirds and bees. This contributes to the overall health of our ecosystem.

Editor

Agriculture can come to life in classrooms across the state thanks to Texas Farm Bureau’s (TFB) interactive lesson plans.

“The lesson plans are like a roadmap of Texas agriculture. They detail crops livestock and the people who grow them” Whit Weems TFB director of Organization said.

There are 10 lessons which are aligned with Texas teaching standards.

The Very Hungry Texas Caterpillar lesson plan is a Texas twist on Eric Carle’s The Very Hungry Caterpillar. It takes students on a journey of crops grown in Texas and students create their own book.

In the Oh Say Can You Seed unit students learn how all plants start as a seed and the process of growing healthy plants. Through the lesson students learn about seed parts germination plant and flower parts pollination and seed dispersal for regrowth.

A Nutrition unit explores two avenues of healthy eating. The activities dive into food groups and take students on an adventure to meet farmers who grow vegetables for soup.

The Farmland unit is based on an award-winning documentary that takes viewers into six young farmers’ and ranchers’ lives including one who lives in Texas. The innovative multi-modal unit brings to life critical issues impacting agriculture.

Farmers value soil and water working to conserve the natural resources. Through a Water and Soil unit students will understand the importance of water to agriculture the water cycle the amount of available water on Earth conservation the movement of water through the soil and the impact of floods and droughts among other topics.

Through the Texas Top Ten lesson plan students will rank the top 10 agricultural commodities—both crops and livestock—by cash receipts. They’ll learn about the diversity of Texas agriculture through the activity.

One in seven jobs in Texas is related to agriculture. In the Careers lesson students can explore the Agriculture Food and Natural Resources career field and dive deeper into specific clusters.

A Look at Texas Agriculture details the state symbols climate soil crops animals and general agricultural facts to connect students with agriculture right here in the Lone Star State.

A packet of fun interactive small activities are available to bring agriculture and science to life in the Exploring Agriculture Through Science lesson plan.

“The lessons plans explore concepts like sustainability technology and science. They also aim to stimulate thoughtful conversation about innovation on farms and ranches challenges that agriculture faces and supply and demand” Weems said. “The lessons can help teachers engage students on agricultural concepts while also meeting the state’s teaching requirements.”

More lesson plans will be uploaded throughout the year.

In addition to the lesson plans Texas teachers can apply for garden grants through TFB’s or schedule a visit through TFB’s .

Also available to teachers and schools is TFB’s . It is an educational trailer that includes agricultural videos and facts on crops and livestock grown in Texas.

Duff Goldman is known as the Ace of Cakes for very good reason and he showed off his skills proving the merits of that title once again. It's one of Goldman's more whimsical creations that defies belief considering that it's actually a pastry and fans of Pixar's animated movies will find this cake extra sweet.

Goldman became associated with the ""Ace"" title by virtue of his role in the titular Food Network series ""Ace of Cakes"" but his pastry practice goes back even further. One of the things you don't know about Goldman is that he began cooking professionally at just 14 years of age according to Food Network. Since then his career has blossomed through opening bakeries and showing off his artistic flair via custom cakes and other desserts.

One of Duff's works of art doesn't seem to be bugging anyone on Twitter. In fact his followers appear to think it's an absolute pillar of pastry perfection.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMid2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRheXRvbmRhaWx5bmV3cy5jb20vd2hhdC10by1rbm93L2dhcmRlbmluZy1mYWxsLXdlYndvcm0tbmVzdHMtYXJlLXF1aXRlLWV2aWRlbnQvTlNFU0oyTzczQkJTVlBONk1SUkxLQllKWDQv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,GARDENING: Fall webworm nests are quite evident,"Fall webworms unlike their name hatch in late spring with the first generation of caterpillars. Their feeding is hardly noticeable and they don’t construct the webs that are visible now. No one sees them unless they are specifically looking for them.

The second generation hatches and begins to construct their web-like nest. The silken strands surround the foliage at the ends of the branches which makes them visible. These nests are protective and difficult to penetrate with pesticides sprays.

They feed on the foliage of preferred plants inside of the nest continuing to envelope more leaves as needed. They are harmless and won’t kill a tree.

Since it’s so late in the summer season and the leaves will be dropping soon no need to worry. However hand-removal of the nest is possible particularly if they really bother you. The challenge with this is that they tend to be higher in the tree than you can reach!

I remember my dad taking a rag and wrapping it around a stick and burning the nests. I have heard many tell me that their parents and grandparents did this. It worked but is not a recommended practice!

You can take a rag and wrap around the stick and remove as much of the nest as possible or you can trim the end of the branch and eliminate the nest. Dropping the caterpillars in soapy water kills them.

Again they are more annoying than anything else. They won’t kill the tree!

In addition I noticed that populations this season are much lower than last year. Last summer was a banner year for them. I couldn’t find a walnut tree that didn’t have several nests.

It will be interesting to see what next year brings in terms of populations. Beneficial insects follow pest outbreaks and build in populations. Eventually the bad guys decline and the beneficial insects increase.

It’s kind of like an up and down roller coaster. The bad guys grow the good guys follow the bad guys decline the good guys follow. And so goes nature. I love it!

The point is this is an insect that really isn’t a big deal in our landscapes and can be left alone. It may look bad but it won’t hurt the tree.

If you have fall webworm nests observe the numbers this year and see what happens next year. That’s what I am doing!

The Federal Reserve's hardline stance against inflation at Friday's Jackson Hole meeting sent stocks tumbling finishing off a rally that began in mid-June. Fears around heightened uncertainty and a potential recession also solidified as the Cboe Volatility Index (VIX) a traditional measure of market volatility spiked upwards.

This story is available exclusively to Business Insider subscribers. Become an Insider and start reading now.

When realizing gains is as difficult as it is right now Morgan Stanley's Vintage Values list comes as a welcome respite. The list published annually provides a selection of the firm's top equity recommendations for a one-year buy-and-hold investment horizon.

""In compiling the list our stock-selection framework blended our analysts' fundamental views with quantitative analysis"" wrote a team of analysts led by Morgan Stanley Chief Investment Officer and Chief US Equity Strategist Mike Wilson in the report published on August 24.

Last year's Vintage Values list which covered August 2021 to August 2022 outperformed the S&P 500 index by 100 basis points. Of the 50 stocks recommended this year by Morgan Stanley's North America analysts only the top 15 were included in the list.

To narrow down the selection each of the suggested stocks were extensively assessed to screen its ""macro exposure industry positioning valuation and risk-reward profile paying particular attention to the skew of the analysts' bull- and bear-case valuation estimates"" Wilson explained.

Next the stocks were cross-checked for their quantitative quality and environmental social and governance scores. To narrow down the final 15 the list was considered against Wilson's high-level equity sector allocations so that its weightings would match his current positioning which includes an overweight position in the healthcare and real estate sectors.

Morgan Stanley's top 15 stocks to buy and hold over the next 12 months

On the topline Morgan Stanley's Vintage Values list prefers high-quality stocks. With the average stock on the list trading 11% more expensive than the market on forward price-to-earnings ratios and 17% more expensive on price-to-sales ratios it may seem that the list of stocks is trading at a premium.

But according to Wilson the list is ""materially less expensive"" than the market when accounting for key cash flow-based valuation measures like the enterprise value-to-operating cash flow and also carries a more attractive free cash flow yield of 5% versus the market's 4.7%. And with relative earnings revisions for the overall market taking a nosedive Wilson pointed out that the Vintage Values list has a ""far superior"" positive revisions profile versus the S&P 500's negative 3-month smoothed revisions.

The list is more tilted towards larger firms with 63% of its stocks classified as either large- or mega-cap said Wilson. He also pointed out that the list's average market capitalization of $211 billion is significantly above the S&P 500's average of $74 billion.

60% of the names on the list were growth stocks with 7% of firms falling into the value bucket and the remaining 33% belonging to neither investing style. This is well above the S&P 500's 39% growth stock weighting and well below its 25% value weighting Wilson noted.

Finally Wilson highlighted the fact that the Vintage Values list is marginally tilted more defensively than the overall market with 33% of its stocks classified as cyclical and 27% as defensive versus the S&P 500's respective weightings of 41% and 24%.

The updated Vintage Values list of 15 stocks for the next twelve months is below along with each firm's ticker sector market capitalization price target and respective analyst commentary.",,,,,,,,,,,,

CONVENT - It was a lonely site Saturday morning as the usually busy Sunshine Bridge sat empty. DOTD closed the bridge Saturday to repair a crack they found in a support beam.

The bridge was expected to be closed through the weekend but it was reopened around 8:30 p.m. Aug. 27.

However drivers still saw lane closures.

""Now it's open and repaired but we still have lane restrictions and permit restrictions because of the previously planned bridge inspection that was going on when they found the crack"" said Rodney Mallett spokesperson for La DOTD.

That inspection is expected to be completed sometime this week. However DOTD expects another lane closure in the future in order to paint the newly added plate on the bridge.

""We're going to have a lane closure at some point so we can paint it to keep it from rusting but we got it in place it's primed and ready to be painted but we just ran out of time Saturday and were going to do that one day this week hopefully depending on the weather"" said Mallett.

""I'm just happy that it is getting fixed"" Jaymes Leblanc a Baker resident said.

Drivers like Leblanc who use the bridge every day had to find alternate routes.

""A lot of people have to take that bridge and a lot of people don't know the way that I know"" Leblanc said.

The Baker resident says the closure adds a significant amount of time to his commute.

""I have to go an hour and a half out of the way. Take the Gramercy bridge take 3127 then go to CF Industries so it's impacting my life a whole lot"" Leblanc said.

But he says he is no stranger to the long commute. This is the third time the bridge has closed for repairs in the last four years. In 2018 drivers found alternate routes for three months after a barge crashed into the bridge.

""They give us updates on the bridge will be closed and the length of time. They usually stick to their word on when the bridge will open back up"" Leblanc said.

It's unclear if the damage had anything to do with previous issues.

The bridge was reopened with no lane closures on Aug. 31.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMingFodHRwczovL3d3dy5wb3N0Z3VhbS5jb20vdGhlX2dsb2JlL3dvcmxkL3VucmVsZW50aW5nLXByZXNzdXJlLWV1cm9wZS1mZXJ0aWxpemVyLWNyaXNpcy10aHJlYXRlbnMtZm9vZC1zdXBwbHkvYXJ0aWNsZV9lMTYxOWZlMi0yNTEyLTExZWQtODUwNS01MzIwNWE0MmJhODMuaHRtbNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,'Unrelenting pressure': Europe fertilizer crisis threatens food supply,"You have permission to edit this article.

Now after years of cleanup working closely with the Ford Motor Co. and other companies whose waste contributed to the contamination the site has been returned to a lush natural environment complete with meadows pools and wetland habitat for wildlife the National Park Service said.

What You Need To Know The Cuyahoga Valley National Park didn’t know property it bought in 1985 contained a contaminated dump



After years of site cleanup U.S. EPA awarded CVNP its National Federal Facility Excellence in Site Reuse award for outstanding effort



The Krejci Dump covered more than 40 acres between Hines Hill Road and I-271



After years of toxic material removal in 2015 native plants were well established and wetlands returning

Recognizing the Herculean effort it took to clean up the site including the park’s cooperative partnerships with federal and states agencies developers and local entities the U.S. EPA has awarded the Cuyahoga Valley National Park its National Federal Facility Excellence in Site Reuse award for outstanding remediation efforts the EPA announced in a release.

“By investing in a major environmental cleanup the National Park Service has not only honored Congress’s intent they have also restored wetlands and meadows” said EPA Region 5 Administrator Debra Shore. “Through strong federal state and local partnerships this site is now a thriving recreational space that will be enjoyed for generations to come.”

Known as the Krejci Dump the site covered more than 40 acres between Hines Hill Road and I-271. The former owners the Krejci family had run a scrap operation there from 1948 to 1980 collecting waste from municipalities and companies at a time when dump sites weren’t closely regulated.

After buying the property the CVNP realized there was a problem when visitors and rangers became ill at the site with headaches and skin rashes the park service said so it closed the area in 1986.

The park brought in the Ohio and U.S. EPAs to investigate and with thousands of barrels of leaking industrial waste the land was found to be so contaminated it qualified as a Superfund site requiring a major cleanup the park service said. The 1980 law that created Superfund made the parties responsible for cleaning up the contamination or reimbursing the government for cleanup work executed by the EPA.

Cleanup at the Krejci site began in 2000 and as part of a settlement Ford Motor Co. took the lead role with assistance from General Motors Co. Chrysler Corp. 3M Chevron and others and overseen by the EPA the park service said.

A year later the park service scored a major victory when 3M was ordered by a federal judge to repay the park service more than $20 million it had spent on the initial site investigation the park service said. The money was put into a fund that launched NPS’s own site cleanup and enforcement program.

Removing toxic soil and material at the Krejci site took years.

Veronica Dickerson Environmental Protection Specialist at CVNP served as project manager for 10 of those years ensuring the remediation was implemented as it was designed and that the project proceeded as it should she said.

That meant managing the entities responsible for the contamination and keeping the park service and EPA apprised of the progress.

“It's exhilarating” Dickerson said. “I tend to thrive on that level of chaos. You have to be able to pivot.”

During the project the depths of the contamination varied with some areas up to 25-feet deep as more and more barrels were uncovered.

“It’s where it could kind of derail your excitement but it actually intensifies it because you're still getting closer to the end goal and getting a site cleaned up and brought back to the public” she said.

By 2012 the park service reported that more than 375000 tons of contaminated material had been shipped to a licensed hazardous-material facility in Michigan.

What the contents of some of the barrels was used for was never identified Dickerson said as none of the companies involved wanted to claim them. Scientists could identify the molecular structure of the fluid but not the use.

“It would have been nice to know because some of us were curious like ‘what was that for?’” she said. “It was pretty nasty.”

Once the contamination was removed workers began stabilizing the ravines on either side of the dump area through extensive grading.

In 2013 work began to recreate the natural features of the landscape preparing nearly four acres of the area for meadows and wetlands the park service said. It was then seeded with a variety of native grasses and wildflowers.

By 2015 the plants were becoming well established and the wetlands returning the park service said.

In 2020 the park service determined the objectives of the site restoration had been achieved and a certificate of completion was issued to Ford.

In the end those deemed responsible for the contamination paid out more than $50 million for the property’s cleanup and restoration the park service said.

For now the CVNP is letting the site rest in its new state as the land slowly rejuvenates.

“In time the plants and the flora and the fauna and just kind of the circle of life if you will will start to re-add those micro and macro nutrients back into the soil” Dickerson said. “So as time goes on we'll see those get to healthier levels.”

No trails or structures are currently being planned for the site although park visitors do stop on the nearby access road to enjoy the beauty of the area often said NPS Community Engagement Supervisor Pam Barnes.

“It's lovely” she said. “It's amazing to get out of the car and just listen and contemplate what it used to be.”

The Krejci site is illustrative of the larger efforts of the national park she said.

“This park has really been striving to take the damage that man has done in the past and clean it up for the future” Barnes said. “We've done a great deal to scar this environment.”

Barnes said she is hopeful society is heading into an era underscored by land revitalization and that upcoming generations are learning important lessons.

“Not to repeat history” she said.",,,,,,,,,,,,

Workers at a Chipotle Mexican Grill in Lansing Michigan voted to unionize Thursday becoming the first of the fast-casual chain’s 3000 locations to organize.

The workers at the Lansing Chipotle voted to form a union with the International Brotherhood of Teamsters. In a release Thursday the union said that workers are organizing “to improve their work schedules increase wages and gain the respect from management that they’ve rightfully earned.”

The restaurant joins a wave of unionization efforts at workplaces across the country including other food service locations like Starbucks which has had more than 200 US locations unionize since its first victory in Buffalo New York last year.

“Chipotle pulled in revenue of $7.5 billion last year and just as we’re seeing workers of all ages and backgrounds across the country take on these corporate giants it’s so inspiring to see Chipotle workers stand up and demand more from a company that can clearly afford it” said Scott Quenneville president of Teamsters Local 243.

In a statement Chipotle said it offers its employees industry-leading benefits such as competitive wages debt-free degrees health benefits and bonuses that last year totaled $37 million for its nearly 100000 employees.

“We’re disappointed that the employees at our Lansing MI restaurant chose to have a third party speak on their behalf because we continue to believe that working directly together is best for our employees” Laurie Schalow Chipotle’s chief corporate affairs officer said in a statement.

Chipotle permanently closed a restaurant in Augusta Maine that filed to form a union in June saying it was unable to “adequately staff” that location. Union organizers claimed the chain was trying to stifle workers.

The Chipotle workers in Lansing filed for election with the National Labor Relations Board on July 5. Chipotle did not object to the filing.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMifmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNoZWF0c2hlZXQuY29tL2VudGVydGFpbm1lbnQvYm9iYnktZmxheS1kYXVnaHRlci1zb3BoaWUtZmxheS1icmVha2Zhc3QtYnVycml0by1jYWxscy11bmlxdWUtY3J1bmNoeS1hZGRpdGlvbi5odG1sL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Bobby Flay and Daughter Sophie Flay's Breakfast Burrito Calls for a Unique Crunchy Addition,"Bobby Flay and daughter Sophie Flay enjoy a good breakfast burrito. To make one like theirs you'll need a special ingredient.

Breakfast burritos are one of the easiest and most delicious breakfast foods ever invented. And to bring the dish up a notch Food Network star Bobby Flay and daughter Sophie Flay suggest adding a unique crunchy ingredient. Here’s a breakdown of the celebrity chef’s recipe.

Sophie Flay and Bobby Flay’s Breakfast Burrito recipe uses potato chips for crunch

The Flays’ Breakfast Burrito recipe — which they recently shared on Good Morning America — combines all the southern Tex-Mex flavors Bobby is known for and also incorporates the crunchy goodness of potato chips. Bobby often adds potato chips to his staple recipes. He also offers them as an option at his burger chain Bobby’s Burger Palace.

“Some of you may have added chips to your sandwiches as kids and if people ever told you that you were nuts I’m here to say that you’re not!” Bobby captioned his Food Network Crunchburger recipe. “It’s a way to get a true contrast of textures.”

The Flays’ recipe for Breakfast Burritos starts with a quick homemade salsa and sauce

The first step in making the Flays’ breakfast burrito is probably preparing a fresh tomato salsa. The recipe calls for combining three seeded and finely diced plum tomatoes half of a small onion that’s been finely diced a teaspoon of chipotle in adobo (which can be found canned in the Mexican food aisle) two tablespoons of chopped cilantro the juice of one lime a tablespoon of avocado oil and salt and pepper to taste.

While this salsa will be used in the burrito Bobby notes it’s also great for dipping chips. And for those in a rush he suggests sticking with a good quality store-bought salsa.

The next step is making Bobby’s secret sauce. It calls for chipotle peppers roasted red peppers and mayonnaise. Add all three ingredients to a blender or food processor and blend to make a smooth spreadable sauce.

Next cook the eggs

After preparing the salsa Bobby suggests heating the tortillas on a warm saute pan for five to 10 seconds on each side before placing them on a plate. He then adds a layer of the secret sauce to the tortillas and sets them aside.

Then after swirling a tablespoon of butter in the heated pan he adds two whisked eggs and swirls them around the pan on low heat.

As the eggs begin to set you add cheese to the middle. Then gently fold the eggs in on all sides into a rectangle shape flipped and then cooked for five to 10 seconds without pressing down.

How to assemble the burritos

Once the eggs are done place them in the middle of the tortilla atop the sauce. Bobby begins layering the burrito starting with two slices of cooked crispy bacon and a few thin slices of avocado.

He spoons the reserved salsa on top of the avocados. For the final layer he sprinkles on a handful (about six to eight) of crunchy potato chips. Then fold the burrito closed seam down and cut in half before serving.",,,,,,,,,

Construction is nearing completion on the St. Charbel Maronite Church in Doha Qatar with plans to open its doors to worshippers in 2025 coinciding with the Catholic Church’s Jubilee Year according to Father Charbel Mhanna from Qatar’s Maronite parish.

In an interview with ACI Mena CNA’s Arabic-language news partner Mhanna explained that with a capacity of about 3000 people St. Charbel will be the country’s largest church open to all Catholics. Once completed it will be Qatar’s second Catholic church joining the existing Church of Our Lady of the Rosary.

While precise statistics on the Christian population in Qatar are lacking Mhanna estimates there are close to 1 million Christians there of which about 70% are Catholic. Approximately 12000 belong to the Maronite rite which is in full communion with the pope.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNocmlzdGlhbml0eXRvZGF5LmNvbS9uZXdzLzIwMjQvbWF5L3NvdXRoZXJuLWJhcHRpc3QtY2h1cmNoLWRlY2xpbmUtc2JjLWFubnVhbC1jaHVyY2gtcHJvZmlsZS5odG1s0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,SBC Membership Falls to 47-Year Low But Church Involvement Is Up | News & Reporting,"Despite years of record-setting declines shrinking the Southern Baptist Convention (SBC) to its lowest membership in nearly half a century Southern Baptists have begun to see some signs of life within their 46906 churches.

Worship attendance small group attendance and baptisms were up last year in the SBC’s annual statistical report released Tuesday while membership fell below 13 million.

2023 marks 17 straight years of decline for the country’s biggest Protestant denomination. It’s down 3.3 million from its peak with the steepest drops coming during the pandemic. The SBC lost 1.3 million members between 2020 and 2022 alone.

Beyond COVID-19 disruptions Southern Baptists have recently confronted some contentious issues within their convention responding to sexual abuse and clamping down on female preachers which have led some congregations to leave the SBC (including prominent megachurch Saddleback Church).

But statistics indicate that church departures aren’t a significant driver of membership decline; the SBC was down 292 churches last year just 0.63 percent of its total.

In 2023 membership fell by 241000 its smallest decrease since 2018. Yet attendance at SBC churches increased 6.5 percent reaching above 4 million a week for the first time since the pandemic.

Attendance at small groups and Bible studies ticked up 4 percent to 2.4 million.

With fewer Americans than ever attending church and religious disaffiliation on the rise leaders see even small increases in engagement and discipleship as worth celebrating.

It’s the first time in over a decade that SBC worship attendance has grown two years in a row though it still lags behind pre-pandemic numbers. Back in 2019 SBC churches saw over 5 million show up each Sunday.

“Outreach and discipleship are difficult today. They require time and commitment when our culture offers numerous distractions and alternatives. The pandemic was discouraging as fewer people engaged in these activities” said Scott McConnell executive director of Lifeway Research which releases the annual report.

“But as people have re-engaged and new people are participating there is much to celebrate in Southern Baptist churches today while we invite more to join.”

Baptisms the key metric for Southern Baptists also grew for the second year in a row.

“God has been stirring the waters and an upswing in baptisms has solidly begun” wrote SBC president Bart Barber a pastor in Texas.

“Not only have we experienced a second year of increased baptisms but we have also witnessed a year-over-year gain—25.94 percent more baptisms than in 2022—that leaves no room for doubt about what God is doing among our churches.”

Kevin Ezell president of the North American Mission Board said the baptism trend is widespread across regions. Out of 41 state conventions 35 reported more baptisms in 2023 than 2022.

“Pastors are the difference makers here” he said in a statement. “Despite all the distractions and challenges out there they are keeping the focus on evangelism and encouraging new believers to follow up with baptism.”

The report’s release falls about a month before the SBC’s annual meeting which gathers over 10000 messengers in Indianapolis in June. They are slated to address new mechanisms for overseeing abuse reform and reporting as well as clarifications to cooperation agreements and guidance around women in ministry.

The SBC’s current membership of 12982090 is the lowest since 1976. The membership size peaked at 16.3 million in 2006.

One bright spot leaders say is the generosity of members and churches who spent nearly $800 million on missions last year up 9 percent.

“We are sharing the gospel with more people gathering for worship and Bible study in increasing numbers giving billions to support churches serving communities across our country and sending millions to support mission enterprises around the world” said Jeff Iorg the SBC Executive Committee president-elect.

“Southern Baptists are not a perfect people” he added. “But we are a movement making a positive difference in our world and our most recent statistical report underscores this reality and motivates us to press forward.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnlhaG9vLmNvbS9saWZlc3R5bGUvY2xpbnRvbi1jaHVyY2gtaG9zdC1jb21tdW5pdHktYmFieS0xODU4NTYwMTguaHRtbNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Clinton church to host community baby shower resource fair Saturday,"CLINTON Md.

Penampilanmu yang semakin menarik ketika sedang jatuh cinta ternyata juga dipengaruhi oleh turunnya tingkat stres dan bagusnya suasana hati alias mood. Melansir dari laman Healthline cinta yang langgeng secara konsisten dikaitkan dengan tingkat stres yang lebih rendah. Selain itu perasaan positif yang muncul juga berpengaruh dalam produksi hormon oksitosin dan dopamin dapat membantu meningkatkan suasana hati.

Lalu dari mana perasaan positif tersebut muncul? Perasaan positif yang memicu produksi hormon tersebut bisa muncul salah satunya ketika mendapatkan perlakuan manis dari pasangan.

Termasuk perhatian atau kontak fisik seperti pelukan dan sentuhan bisa menimbulkan euforia tersendiri. Tak heran jika kamu lebih bersemangat dan memiliki mood yang bagus ketika berinteraksi dengan pasangan.

Nah Beauties sudah paham keterkaitan antara jatuh cinta dengan penampilan diri bukan? Semoga info di atas bermanfaat ya.

CSCO,Cisco,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiKWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lmh1ZHNvbnJpdmVyYmx1ZS5jb20vdW50aXRsZWQv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Would you wear a smart scarf that tracks your biometrics?,"Would you wear a smart scarf?

Manchester City seem to think so. They recently ran a pilot program in which a handful of lifelong fans wore club scarves with “EmotiBit” sensor systems from Cisco Systems stitched into them. One sensor monitored body temperature another blood flow and accelerometer data monitored movement. Notably there was also an EDA sensor with “lie detector technology” — which sounds like it could be more useful on the field: Strap one on a world-class embellisher Luquinhas of the New Jersey Red Bulls and watch his production slow to a trickle.

Called the Connected Scarf it was created by Cisco Systems — City helped facilitate content creation through access to fans who opted into the activity. According to a statement issued by City this “innovative upgrade” to the club scarf will allow them to “measure those ups and downs and get a better understanding of the emotion at the heart of the world’s beautiful game.” The Connected Scarf measured 120 moments in a 90-minute game (presumably plus stoppage time) which means the sensors checked in every 45 seconds on average.



Is this the logical next step after smartwatches and other monitoring devices we willing use in everyday life? City love data and it was just a matter of when before the club turned their technological acumen to learn more about the habits of their supporters: Just imagine your gameday heatmap with those deep red blobs at your seat waiting in line for the bathroom waiting in line for the very decent burnt end Dirty Fries at Mighty Quinn’s.



Or is this something more dystopian the latest wall to be breached as CFG will be able to track us and collect more data in order to better monetize our feelings for the teams we support?



Soon a few NYCFC fans will face these questions themselves. According to Reuters “a select number [of scarves] will be distributed to supporters of City and also those of their sister club New York City FC in the United States.”

No timeline has been made public and the pilot program in New York City will be limited — according to the club there are no plans to sell the scarves to the public. Still it raises the question: Would you put on a smart scarf?

Many unanswered questions about the Connected Scarf remain. As the Verge put it: “Will it have to be charged? How much will it cost? (Probably and likely more than is sensible.) Can it survive the wash or will you have to deal with an incredibly stinky scarf after a few games? But also how will Manchester City protect users’ privacy considering the fact the scarves will collect biometric data? We likely won’t know those details until the scarf actually becomes available to the public — if it ever truly does.”

Just as important: How will it look? The Connected Scarf we see in the images released by City is pretty vanilla. NYCFC will have to do a better job than that if the fans here are to wear them on gameday.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZXZlcmdlLmNvbS8yMDIyLzgvMjgvMjMzMjU1NzUvZ29vZ2xlLW1lZXQtc3RlYWxpbmctem9vbS10cmljay1lYXNpbHktdW5tdXRlLXB1c2gtdG8tdGFsa9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Google Meet is stealing Zoom's trick to easily unmute,"As Google carries out the needlessly complex process of combining both the Meet and Duo apps now it’s throwing a feature copied from Zoom in the mix. In an update on the Google Workspace blog the company announced that Google Meet will soon give you the ability to unmute yourself by holding down the spacebar and to mute yourself again by releasing it.

If you frequently use Zoom this feature might sound a lot like its push-to-talk feature — and that’s because it’s essentially the same thing. Zoom obviously didn’t revolutionize this feature (we have walkie-talkies to thank for that) but it conveniently makes it available during video conferences which comes in handy whenever you want to chime in during a meeting but don’t want to stay unmuted for long. Cisco’s Webex has a similar capability while Microsoft Teams lets you unmute using a Ctrl + Spacebar shortcut.

Google says it'll start rolling out its own version of the shortcut to all Workspace users on September 9th but it could take up to 15 days for you to see it. Once it arrives it won’t be turned on by default so you’ll have to enable it from Google Meet’s settings.

Confusingly Google’s efforts to merge Duo and Meet have left us with the new Meet app (the one that combines both Duo and Meet) the old Meet (Original) app and a Duo shortcut that leads to Meet. It’s truly something only Google could think up. That said I’m pretty sure the new push-to-talk feature’s coming to the new Google Meet app but it’s still not exactly clear whether it’s coming to the Meet (Original) app as Google will eventually discontinue it.

I noticed on Sunday night that the Phillies used an all-white starting lineup versus the Mets. I don’t know if anyone tracks this but I assume that all-white starting lineups in major league baseball are fairly rare.

Also after the trade deadline in early August I had noticed that the Phillies were very white (i.e. Caucasian). They had traded for three white players (Marsh Syndergaard and Robertson) and one minority player (Sosa) and followed that up by releasing numerous minority players (Herrera Gregorius Familia and Carmago).

As a result the Phillies currently have six minority players on their active roster. That’s 23 percent. According to The Institute for Diversity and Ethics in Sport (TIDES) at the University of Central Florida 38 percent of all MLB players as of opening day were players of color. The Phillies also have just two minority coaches.

I conducted an informal poll on mlb.com of players and coaches on the other teams in the National League East and found the following:

New York Mets: 10 minority players 3 minority coaches

Atlanta Braves: 10 minority players 6 minority coaches

Miami Marlins: 11 minority players 6 minority coaches

Washington Nationals: 17 minority players and 5 minority coaches

So the Phillies have fewer minority players and fewer minority coaches than any team in their division.

I looked at the team’s 2022 Media Guide and noticed that only seven of the 38 people at the top of the Phillies front office (including the owner but not Special Advisors) are minorities. That’s 18.4% about the same percentage. Is it a surprise that the roster reflects the racial makeup of the front office?

Also over the past few years the Phillies have signed mostly white free agents and their average salary for white players is much higher than salaries for minority players.

And the team heritage regarding minority representation is not great. The Phillies were the last team in the National League to include an African American player on their roster. That was in 1957. And for the first year since 1959 the Phillies had no African American player on their opening day roster.

I’m not accusing the Phillies of being racist and I’m not proposing that the Phillies make decisions based solely on skin color but they also shouldn’t have one of the whitest rosters coaching staff and front offices in baseball.

And in a city with a majority minority population shouldn’t they make an effort for more minority representation than approximately half the league average?

As the Philadelphia 76ers star is back at his NBA home market Maxey has been keeping busy when he’s not in the gym working on his craft.

A couple of weeks ago the young star hosted his first annual 1% Better Camp in Philadelphia. The former first-round pick gathered youth basketball players to coach them up for a day to help them improve their games.

After hosting his camp Maxey participated in the Danny Rumph Classic game at LaSalle University. To no surprise Maxey was the star of the show as he logged a double-double by scoring 34 points and collecting ten rebounds.

Earlier this week Maxey made a public appearance at the Philadelphia Phillies game. Not only did he attend the matchup between the Phillies and the Cincinnati Reds but he participated in a mid-game interview discussing a wide range of tops such as teaming up with new Sixers additions and praising the Philly fan base for embracing him from the jump.

After Maxey created a ton of buzz at Citizens Bank Park earlier in the week the star guard was encouraged by Philadelphia’s MLS organization the Philadelphia Union to attend one of their games soon. Maxey was confident he would be there this weekend.

Sticking to His Word

Maxey indeed stuck to his word and attended the Union game on Saturday.

“What’s up ya’ll? It’s Tyrese Maxey. First Philadelphia Union game first soccer game ever. The atmosphere is amazing. I got the fans behind me. I can’t wait to hit the drum and see them get a dub.”

To no surprise Maxey’s recorded video involved a group of cheering fans in the background as Union fans were excited to see the 76ers star in the building donning the home team’s jersey.

When Maxey was selected 20th overall in the 2020 NBA Draft he was immediately embraced by the Philly fan base as the emotional former Kentucky guard made it clear that Philadelphia wouldn’t regret calling his name on draft night.

Just two short years later Maxey is a clear-cut fan favorite in Philadelphia as his personality and production on the court have won the City of Brotherly Love over.

Glad provides innovative trusted solutions and relentlessly pursues ways to deliver excellent odor control strength scent color and more so consumers can get on with their day. We continue to think “outside of the bag” using creative executions and cultural moments to help showcase our product innovation and performance to help make people and the planet happier.

This fall our U.S. and Canada teams are using extraordinary situations and expert credibility to demonstrate that our bags are up for a challenge and that consumers can rely on Glad for their everyday needs.

Partnership with real estate expert underscores product performance

The U.S. team tapped into the culturally relevant hot housing market and partnered with real estate agent and interior design specialist Amanza Smith from the hit TV show “Selling Sunset” to create the most recent Glad “Torture Test” installment.

While many competitor bags only mask the smell of trash Glad® ForceFlexPlus with Clorox® bags use innovative technology to help eliminate food and bacterial odors to help keep your home smelling clean and fresh.

To showcase our odor-eliminating technology of Glad with Clorox Amanza hosted an open house where unsuspecting home buyers were brought in to tour their potential dream home. What prospective buyers didn’t know is there were bags of trash hidden throughout the home. Once revealed they were surprised to find the hidden trash bags and delighted by the performance.

The campaign opened many doors for the team to connect with consumers from capturing attention in an unexpected way reaching Amanza’s loyal followers and aligning with a key cultural conversation.

‘Top Chef’ sponsorship shows at-home cooks how to compost

Knowing Canadian consumers have a love for cooking our team decided the 10th season of “Top Chef Canada” was the perfect opportunity to highlight the ease of composting aided by the new Glad drawstring compost bags.

Over 70% of Canadians have access to curbside composting programs*; however there are Canadians who have yet to make it a part of their everyday lives and we know that the thought of sorting their waste is a hurdle for many. The partnership with “Top Chef” will put the bags in a dramatic — but relatable — situation to show how easily composting with Glad bags can be adopted into cooking routines.

Going beyond product news and further demonstrating the brand’s commitment to sustainability at each chef’s cooking station Glad compost bags and recycling bags will be featured throughout the season.

To see Amanza’s video or learn more about Glad ForceFlexPlus with Clorox trash bags visit Glad.com/Amanza and follow along on Instagram for more content. “Top Chef Canada X” makes its debut Sept. 26 at 10 p.m. ET/PT on Food Network Canada.

The S&P 500 lost 3.4% its biggest drop since mid-June after Fed Chairman Jerome Powell said the U.S. central bank will likely need to keep interest rates high enough to slow the economy ""for some time"" to beat back the decades-high inflation sweeping the country.

The Dow dropped 3% and the Nasdaq composite ended 3.9% lower reflecting a broad sell-off led by technology stocks. Higher rates help corral inflation but they also hurt asset prices.

Investors initially struggled to make out the meaning of Powell's highly anticipated speech. Stocks fell at first then erased nearly all their losses and then turned decisively lower with all but five of the companies in the S&P 500 ending up in the red.

""[Powell] focused more on the Fed's goals rather than the path"" said Jeffrey Kleintop chief global investment strategist at Charles Schwab. ""That left the market with less to grab onto in terms of the future path for policy.""

Powell's speech followed up on several other Fed officials who have recently pushed back on speculation the Fed may ease up on its interest-rate increases. The increases help corral inflation but they also hurt the economy and investment prices.

Powell acknowledged the increases will hurt U.S. households and businesses in perhaps an unspoken nod to the potential for a recession. But he also said the pain would be far greater if inflation were allowed to fester and that ""we must keep at it until the job is done.""

He was speaking at an annual economic symposium near Jackson Wyo. that has been the setting for market-moving Fed speeches in the past.

""He basically said there will be pain and that they won't stop and can't stop hiking until inflation moves a lot lower"" said Brian Jacobsen senior investment strategist at Allspring Global Investments. ""It was a mercifully short speech and to the point. Powell didn't really break new ground which is good since Jackson Hole isn't a policy meeting.""

The sell-off capped a week of choppy trading that left major indexes down 4% or more for the week.

All told the S&P 500 fell 141.46 points to 4057.66. The benchmark index is now down almost 15% for the year.

The Dow lost 1008.38 points to close at 32283.40. The last time the blue-chip average had a 1000-point drop was in May.

The Nasdaq slid 497.56 points to 12141.71 its biggest drop since June.

The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies fell 64.81 points or 3.3% to finish at 1899.83.

Expectations had built through the week that Powell would try to bat down recent talk about a ""pivot"" by the Fed. Such speculation had helped stocks surge through the summer. Some investors were even saying the Fed could cut interest rates later in 2023 as pressures on the economy mount and the nation's high inflation hopefully recedes.

But Powell's speech made clear the Fed will accept weaker growth for a while for the sake of getting inflation under control analysts said.

""Powell reiterated that the Fed is worried about rising prices and getting inflation under control is emphatically job No. 1"" said Jeff Klingelhofer co-head of investments at Thornburg Investment Management.

Perhaps giving some hope to investors some analysts said Powell seemed to indicate expectations for future inflation aren't taking off. If that were to happen it could cause a self-perpetuating cycle that worsens inflation.

For now the debate on Wall Street is whether the Fed will raise short-term rates by either half a percentage point next month double the usual margin or by three-quarters of a point.

The Fed's last two increases have each been three-quarters of a point and a slight majority of bets on Wall Street are favoring a third such increase in September according to CME Group.

A report Friday morning showed that the Fed's preferred gauge of inflation decelerated last month and wasn't as bad as many economists expected. It's a potentially encouraging signal which may embolden more of Wall Street to say that the worst of inflation has already passed or will soon.

Other data showed that incomes for Americans rose less last month than expected while consumer spending growth slowed.

After the reports and Powell's comments the 2-year Treasury yield rose for much of the day but slipped by late afternoon to 3.36% from 3.37% late Thursday. It tends to track expectations for Fed action.

The 10-year Treasury yield which follows expectations for longer-term economic growth and inflation initially rose before slipping to 3.02% from 3.03% late Thursday.

The Fed has already increased its key overnight interest rate four times this year in hopes of slowing the worst inflation in decades. The increases have already hurt the housing industry where more expensive mortgage rates have slowed activity. But the job market has remained strong helping to prop up the economy.

Investors got a fresh set of warnings from companies about the persistent impact from inflation and a slowing economy. Dell Technologies Inc. slumped 13.5% after it said weaker demand will hurt revenue. Marvell Technology Inc. which produces computer chips fell 8.9% after giving investors a disappointing earnings forecast.

(AP Photo/Kin Cheung File)

More than half of all Bitcoin daily trading volumes are reportedly fake as the world's largest cryptocurrency nosedives again amid global economic turmoil.

According to a Forbes analysis of 157 crypto exchanges and trading platforms more than half (51 per cent) of all reported trading volume is likely to be fake or non-economic.

""We estimate the global daily bitcoin volume for the industry was $128 billion on June 14. That is 51 per cent less than the $262 billion one would get by taking the sum of self-reported volume from multiple sources"" the report mentioned.

Bitcoin represents 40 per cent of the $1 trillion global crypto market.

According to the report there is no genuine method of calculating bitcoin daily volume ""even among the industry's most reputable research firms"".

""For example CoinMarketCap puts the latest 24-hour trading of bitcoin at $32 billion CoinGecko at $27 billion Nomics at $57 billion and Messari at $5 billion"" the report revealed.

In terms of how much Bitcoin activity takes place 21 crypto exchanges generate $1 billion or more in daily trading activity while the next 33 exchanges had volume between $200 million and $999 million.

Binance is the leader with a 27 per cent market share followed by FTX. Chicago-based CME Group is the market leader in bitcoin futures trading.

After showing some stabilisation in the last few weeks world's largest cryptocurrency Bitcoin has plunged once again below $20000 after Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell's keynote address.

Bitcoin prices had stabilised around the $23000 to $24000 level after plunging below $20000 in June.

Sat 27 Aug 2022

In the first race of the day Mike Browne took a dramatic victory in the Dunlop Lightweight Manx Grand Prix Race on Saturday afternoon with the Laylaw Racing Yamaha claiming his win ahead of teammate Ian Lougher and Stuart Hall (Stu Hall Racing Yamaha).



Browne had been locked in battle for much of the race with James Hind (Dennis Trollope Racing Yamaha) the latter setting a new Lightweight lap record of 117.592mph on the opening lap. But just when it looked like Hind would sweep to the victory he retired on the final lap with just two miles to go.



It was Browne who led through Glen Helen on the opening lap his advantage over Hind 2.4 seconds with Dominic Herbertson (Chapman Racing Honda) a further 3.8 seconds further back. Lougher slotted into fourth ahead of Michael Dunlop (Crossan Motorcycles Honda) and Daniel Sayle (Honda) as just 10.2 seconds covered the leading six riders.



Over Ballaugh Bridge and Hind had cut the lead to two seconds with Herbertson now 9.1 seconds adrift of the race leader. Lougher was still in fourth but Sayle was now only 0.3 seconds behind the Welshman having overhauled Dunlop for fifth.



As the riders rounded Ramsey Hairpin Hind was in front having turned his deficit to Browne into an advantage of 0.7 seconds so it was still very close as they made the climb up Snaefell for the first time. Herbertson was sitting in a comfortable third with Lougher having edged away from Sayle by 1.8 seconds but Dunlop was in trouble and had slipped back to sixth.



Through the Bungalow Hind had eked out another three tenths of a second to a lead and an opening lap of 117.592mph – a new MGP lap record – gave him a lead of 1.856 seconds over Browne the Irishman also bettering the old lap record at 117.403mph.



Herbertson (115.690mph) maintained third ahead of Lougher (113.794mph) who was shaking his head as he passed his pit crew Sayle (113.787mph) and new sixth placed man Hall (112.391mph). The gap between Lougher and Sayle was just 0.069s but Dunlop toured across the line at 106.775mph and pulled into the pits to retire with his motor running too rich.



By Glen Helen on the second and final lap Browne had cut the gap to 1.113 seconds but he began to lose time on the run to Ballaugh and the gap was up to 4.256 seconds with Hind making the most of the clear road ahead of him. Sayle’s strong ride ended though with a retirement at the Black Dub.



Hind’s lead was even more comfortable as he came through Ramsey his advantage over Browne a healthy 7.3s as Herbertson and Lougher held station in third and fourth. Hall was now up to fifth with Rhys Hardisty (Willson and Wilding/Kaymac Yamaha) tenth at Glen Helen on lap one working his way up to sixth.



Browne continued to lose ground up the Mountain and Hind looked to have the race in the bag as he led by almost twenty seconds over the tram lines at the Bungalow. However as Browne completed the race there was no sign of the Lincolnshire rider and he was reported as having stopped between Brandish and Hillberry.



Herbertson was also out of luck as he retired at the 33rd Milestone and it all meant Browne took the victory by 43.8s from teammate Lougher with a jubilant Hall coming through for third nine seconds ahead of Hardisty.



Class regulars Chris Moore (Outhwaite Plant/Silverstar Yamaha) and Phil Harvey (CSC Racing Honda) took fifth and sixth respectively ahead of Michael Sweeney (Chapman Honda) – who didn’t do a lap until the morning – Richard Wilson (MC Racing KTM) Gareth Arnold (Jenarracing Yamaha) and Tom Snow (Falcon Electrical Honda) Wilson taking the award for the best placed 250cc four-stroke.",https://news.google.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?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Mukesh Ambani seen to repeat Jio feat with potential disruptive green energy announcements at Reliance AGM,"Empower Your Corporate Journey with Strategic Skill Courses Offering College Course Website University of Western Australia UWA Global MBA Visit IIM Lucknow Chief Executive Officer Programme Visit IIM Lucknow Chief Operations Officer Programme Visit

It will be an interesting Monday with the 45th annual general meeting of Reliance Industries lined up where experts believe among other major announcements chairman Mukesh Ambani will shed light on new energy . The oil-to-consumer conglomerate may offer a road map on listing or strategic sale of businesses including clean energy or even come up with some big-bang announcement on it something that may just disrupt the sector.Reliance's AGMs have been momentous in recent years be it the announcement of Reliance Jio that disrupted the telecom industry the launch of the Jio Phone with refundable deposits or last year's unveiling of the 75000 crore rupees investment plan over three years in green energy This time the chairman may share the specifics on the 75000 crore rupees investment plan.The company intends to create a complete green energy ecosystem in the country starting from solar power generation to green hydrogen production. Ambani's green energy enthusiasm was also evident through the latest annual report where he mentioned the words 'clean' and 'green' as many as 23 times in his note to shareholders in the company's annual report for FY22.Reliance's green energy business which was launched last year will outshine all its existing growth engines in just five-to-seven years Ambani said. He said over the next 12 months RIL 's investments across the green energy value chain will gradually start going live scaling up over the next couple of years.“Just as India has the world’s most affordable wireless broadband today we will have the world’s most affordable Green Energy within this decade. And these solutions will then be exported to other countries helping them contain carbon emissions” he said.In the last fiscal Reliance had entered into a series of partnerships including equity investments with local and international corporates with unique technological and execution capabilities with a strong track record of innovation and a growing number of patents and IPRs across the green energy value chain.""Reliance will also invest in creating an ecosystem of thousands of small and medium scale project consultants and installers pan-India to set up green energy generation projects in every nook and corner of the country. Similarly RIL will undertake large giga watt scale turnkey green energy projects for Power GenCos or large investors on its own.""We know that affordability is the most critical factor in the adoption of any new technology and the scale of societal benefit it can create. Reliance has embarked on this journey with a vision to repeat the feat it achieved in wireless broadband"" Ambani added.The potential announcements on green energy push by Reliance will come a month after peer Adani Group in its AGM announced investments to the tune of $70 billion in green energy transition and infrastructure projects as the company called for ""reshaping India's energy footprint in an extraordinary way"". The group is working towards making green hydrogen the ""fuel for future"" its chairman Gautam Adani said.Meanwhile the Energy Conservation (Amendment) Bill 2022 was tabled in Parliament earlier this month which proposes a mandatory threshold for consumption of green fuels such as green hydrogen green ammonia and biomass in all industries.Separately the company is also expected to revive plans of an oil-to-chemicals demerger. Foreign brokerage JPMorgan had said while Reliance may not share exact timelines on initial public offerings of its retail and telecom businesses it may offer some roadmap for the future.",https://news.google.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?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,By 2030 50% of power capacity will be from non-fossil sources India tells UN,"INDIA’S EIGHT GOALS

NEW DELHI: India has submitted its updated Nationally Determined Contribution ( NDC ) - climate action targets - to the UN climate change body promising that the country would achieve about 50% cumulative electric power installed capacity from non-fossil fuel-based energy resources by 2030. The updates are aimed at keeping India on track of its long-term goal of carbon neutrality by 2070.India’s other updated quantitative target under the new submission is to reduce emissions intensity (emission per unit of GDP) by 45% by 2030 from 2005 level.“This update to India’s existing NDC is a step forward towards our long-term goal of reaching net-zero by 2070” said environment minister Bhupender Yadav in the country’s submission note to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change ( UNFCCC ) on August 23.Yadav also flagged that the country’s NDC does not bind it to any sector-specific mitigation obligation or action saying “India’s goal is to reduce overall emission intensity and improve energy efficiency of its economy over time and at the same time protecting the vulnerable sectors of economy and segments of our society”.India has also kept the option of further updates of its NDC open. “India reserves the right to provide further updates by way of additional submissions on its NDC as and when required” said Yadav in his note. The UNFCCC made the submission public on Friday.India’s submission shows that the country’s target of achieving 50% cumulative electric power installed capacity from non-fossil fuel-based energy will be a sort of conditional as it will be contingent on international support. India underlined that the country would achieve that target “with the help of transfer of technology and low-cost international finance including from Green Climate Fund (GCF)”.The condition is a kind of reminder to the rich nations about their promises on delivering $100 billion per year by 2020 to help developing countries move towards a low carbon growth path. Rich nations have so far not contributed the promised amount to the GCF meant for supporting developing countries.The country’s submission has total eight goals which include three updates including its commitment to propagate a healthy and sustainable way of living based on ""traditions and values of conservation and moderation"" including through a mass movement for LIFE -lifestyle for Environment as a key to combating climate change.Remaining five targets which India submitted as its first NDC in 2015 remained unchanged. It includes the country’s goal to “create an additional carbon sink of 2.5 to 3 billion tonnes of CO2 equivalent through additional forest and tree cover by 2030”.Referring to updated NDC Yadav said “This update to India’s existing NDC translates the ‘ Panchamrit ’ announced at COP26 (Glasgow UK last year) into enhanced climate targets after carefully considering national circumstances and the principle of common but differentiated responsibilities and respective capabilities”.NDCs are the voluntary targets of countries under the Paris Agreement on climate change to collectively reach the goal of keeping the global average temperature rise well below 2 degree Celsius while making efforts to limit it to 1.5 degree C above pre-industrial (1850-1900) level. The Article 4 (paragraph 9) of the Agreement provides that each country will communicate/update a NDC every five years.India in its updated submission said that the country’s “NDC is ambitious and it is a significant contribution towards achieving the goals of the Paris Agreement. Environmentally sustainable low carbon initiatives are underpinning all key sectors of the Indian economy.”Reaffirming its commitment to the UNFCCC and the Paris Agreement on Climate Change India’s submission noted that it has not proposed any change in other sections or text of the document containing its first NDC (submitted on October 2 2015) at this stage.1. To put forward and further propagate a healthy and sustainable way of living based on traditions and values of conservation and moderation including through a mass movement for ‘LIFE’– ‘Lifestyle for Environment’ as a key to combating climate change.2. To adopt a climate friendly and a cleaner path than the one followed hitherto by others at corresponding level of economic development.3. To reduce Emissions Intensity of its GDP by 45 percent by 2030 from 2005 level.4. To achieve about 50 percent cumulative electric power installed capacity from non-fossil fuel-based energy resources by 2030 with the help of transfer of technology and low-cost international finance including from Green Climate Fund (GCF).5. To create an additional carbon sink of 2.5 to 3 billion tonnes of CO2 equivalent through additional forest and tree cover by 2030.6. To better adapt to climate change by enhancing investments in development programmes in sectors vulnerable to climate change particularly agriculture water resources Himalayan region coastal regions health and disaster management.7. To mobilize domestic and new & additional funds from developed countries to implement the above mitigation and adaptation actions in view of the resource required and the resource gap.8. To build capacities create domestic framework and international architecture for quick diffusion of cutting edge climate technology in India and for joint collaborative R&D for such future technologies."

This came in statements to Anadolu Agency by Imad Al-Bahi head of the Regional Union of Industry Commerce and Handicrafts in the Ben Arous Governorate.

“The sugar crisis is a national problem for the time being and the matter does not concern only the governorates of Beja and Ben Arous. We waited to cover the shortage of this material by two local deals with the sugar factory in the governorate of Bizerte but the factory did not fulfil its commitments” Al-Bahi explained.

He added: “Unfortunately the sugar factory in Bizerte is the reason for the quick exacerbation of the crisis. Many factories have been affected by this shortage including two factories of the Coca-Cola company and other factories producing biscuits and chocolate in the Ben Arous Governorate.”

Al-Bahi continued: “There are ongoing efforts to solve the crisis. We are waiting for the official authorities of the state to take action as soon as possible so that production returns to its previous levels.”

According to an official of the Beja Governorate: “The workers of the Coca-Cola factory organised a sit-in on Friday in front of the governorate headquarters to protest the decline in production and its suspension in a number of units as well as the delay in disbursing their wages due to the sugar crisis.”

IT services major Cognizant Technology Solutions aims to accelerate growth in its international business known as global growth markets which includes markets like Australia Japan Middle East and India.

“Global growth markets is about 26% of Cognizant’s revenue today. Our ambition is to grow at 20% plus in those regions. We are already growing in mid-teens and we expect to accelerate that going forward” Brian Humphries chief executive officer Cognizant said in an exclusive interview with FE.

To enable this growth Cognizant is ‘refreshing’ its leadership team in many countries by bringing in diverse talents Humphries said. Some of the leaders include Jane Livesey who is the CEO for Australia and New Zealand at Cognizant and Anne-Sofie Risasen head of Nordics at Cognizant. “We also brought in local leaders our new head of Japan who joined us about 18 months ago” he said.

Cognizant is complementing its strategy of renewed leadership with targeted mergers and acquisitions. “Over half of our M&As could go to international markets in the years to come. Now that we have senior people in those countries the success is starting to be visible. Our Australian business has grown hundreds of millions in the last two years…our Japanese business is growing 20% plus” Humphries said.

Cognizant is also strengthening its delivery capabilities internationally and expanding beyond its onshore and nearshore delivery centres.

“And India is the heart and soul of Cognizant…we will complement India with local delivery capabilities in those markets. And in the last six months I have announced expansion of delivery capabilities in Germany the UK Spain and Australia” Humphries said.

In the last few years about 4% more of Cognizant’s delivery has happened out of India versus onshore or nearshore locations. “That is fuelled by embracing India’s talent via technical universities or otherwise” Humphries said.

Cognizant aims to hire about 50000 freshers in India over the next 12 months to drive this growth. On a trailing 12-month basis the company’s voluntary annualised attrition stood at 32% the highest in the industry. However it aims to contain it in the coming months through better compensation and career paths.

“Last year we paid substantially more in compensation than any time in our history…and we overhauled our promotion process and last year we actually had a 300% increase in promotions in Cognizant which really enables us to fulfil the career path ambitions of employees” Humphries said.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiV2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnN0YWJyb2VrbmV3cy5jb20vMjAyMi8wOC8yNy9zdW5kYXkvdGhlLWxhc3Qtd29yZC9mZW1pbmlzbS1oYXMtbm8tcHJvdG90eXBlL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Feminism has no prototype,"I feel scared most times when people call me a feminist and it’s not that the movement frightens me. I’m eternally grateful for all the ways it has advanced women’s rights. I’m scared because every day I grow more and more cognizant of how I fall short of being one. Roxane Gay’s book “ Bad Feminist” which I finally had time to finish last week thanks to my mother-in-law relieving me of all my household chores so I could relax made me comfortable for the first time.

Gay’s book is vulnerable honest and a little heartbreaking. I breathed a sigh of relief to know that I can exist with all these contradictions and still have genuine interest in the movement. I think my favourite part of the book was when she interrogated Tyler Perry’s movies and got to see how casually we overlooked the many tropes and stereotypes that project the myth of the perfect and pious woman. Perry gives women roles where the take-home message is they need to be satisfied with where they are in their lives and that exploration based on personal preferences doesn’t always with end in chaos. This was evident in his movie Temptation: Confession of a Marriage Counselor.

I am now ashamed to say that years ago when I first watched Temptation I thought it to be a brilliant movie. Gay’s book encourages you to reflect to humanise your experiences and most importantly gives varying detailed analysis on how patriarchy has been interwoven in popular culture media and by extension ourselves. Thus leading us to be believe there is some fixed way to do this.

The housewife feminist

I enjoy cooking and taking care of the home. Personally I feel this is how I can best support my family unit and if I am to be honest it was what I always craved “since ah know mahself ” as Guyanese would say. However to say this out loud in certain circles somehow manages to make me feel less than. I feel the judgement. The awkward silence after I announce I’m no longer in a formal job makes me feel as if the conversing parties have little or nothing to say to someone this unambitious; a woman throwing all her opportunities to engage in “formal work” through the window in this day and age. Household labour has always been work and I’m thankful to have a husband who sees it as such. It is gruelling and draining work to cater to the needs of a family. Much more so when there are children involved.

Household chores look different for so many of us. Some have machines to help with washing and some have to fill buckets with water and fetch them for long distances (sometimes on their heads). Some women shop in the supermarket and buy their greens pre-cut and others labour in their gardens to gather the fresh produce they planted. This is labour. To vilify women based on the type of work they do and to use it as a measurement to decipher who is more worthy reinforces class stratification. All work is work and all women must be recognised for the labour they produce.

The militant feminist

A while back there was a trend on Instagram with women posting pictures of their unshaven underarms. I believe the reason was to provoke the beauty industry on the unrealistic standards they hold women to. There was this sense of rebellion that made me feel that if I wasn’t following the anti-beauty industry trends that I was somehow selling out the cause; or selling myself short. There was the feeling that to engage in things that concerned beauty was to worship at the altar of frivolity and submit myself to distractions that would pull me away from the movement. The truth is I hate body hair. I never miss a wax appointment. I love pink and anything that sparkles. I could spend days looking at Vintage Vogue magazines. I love girly movies. I spend way too much money on my skincare routine. There will always be trends some with well-intentioned messages but once we seek to subscribe to an idealistic view of what feminism should look like on the outside we run the risk of further marginalising and icing out women. This is so evident in France where the war on Muslim women and how they should dress rages.

The relationship perfectionist

Feminist women don’t always date the most perfect partner who embodies the movement themselves. Some had pretty toxic relationships and some engage in regular briefings to ensure their significant other understands and respects their views. It is a work in progress. Feminists by their very nature are flawed as are all human beings. There are people with individual life experiences that shape their choices and they are simply people who are deconstructing and learning like everyone else who probably move their bodies to the raunchy lyrics of a Vybz Kartel song.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVWh0dHBzOi8vanVzdHdvbWVuc3Nwb3J0cy5jb20vcmVhZHMvcGF1bGEtYmFkb3NhLXJldHVybnMtbmV3LXlvcmstdXMtb3Blbi10aXRsZS1ob3Blcy_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Paula Badosa returns to New York with US Open title hopes,"The US Open holds special meaning for Paula Badosa.

The New York-born Spaniard is aiming to claim her maiden major title in front of a friendly crowd. The 24-year-old’s run at Flushing Meadows will start Tuesday as she takes on Lesia Tsurenko in the tournament’s first round.

“With the energy of the tournament and the city it’s like you’re awake all day” Badosa told David Kane of the WTA during her 2019 US Open run. “New York has a special place in my heart and I told my coach that I’ll even come here for my holidays.”

If the world No. 4 advances past No. 89 Tsurenko she will find herself in the midst of heavy hitters. Her quarter of the draw includes reigning US Open champion Emma Raducanu as well as Naomi Osaka and Venus Williams.

Should she move on to the quarterfinals Badosa is projected to run up against No. 6 Aryna Sabalenka against whom she holds a 2-1 head-to-head advantage.

Deploying an aggressive style of play Badosa’s powerful baseline game has paid off on her preferred surface of clay. Now the young star will hope to translate her success on dirt to hard-court triumph.

While Badosa exited US Open warm-ups in Canada and Cincinnati early she boasts an impressive 68.3 win percentage through the 2022 hard-court season having played the fifth-most matches on the surface.

The New York Knicks reportedly engaged with the Brooklyn Nets in conversations about a potential blockbuster trade for Kevin Durant.

""The Knicks did make calls on Kevin Durant from what I'm told. But I think both sides were cognizant they didn't really have enough"" Shams Charania of Stadium and The Athletic reported Friday on the Le Batard & Friends podcast (via HoopsHype).

Brooklyn announced Tuesday an agreement was reached for KD to rescind his trade request and remain with the franchise to open the 2022-23 NBA season.

The Knicks were far from alone in being unable to meet the Nets' asking price for the 12-time All-Star.

Just days after KD's trade request the Minnesota Timberwolves gave up a king's ransom that included five players and four draft picks including four first-rounders and a possible pick swap in order to acquire defensive stalwart Rudy Gobert from the Utah Jazz.

It set the trade market for the remainder of the summer and the Nets couldn't have dealt Durant for anything less than that package especially since he's under contract through 2025-26 as part of a four-year $194.2 million contract that's just getting underway.

The other factor involved is the Knicks' hesitancy with roster-altering deals which continues to hover over the organization amid links to Jazz star Donovan Mitchell.

SNY's Ian Begley reported in July that New York's front office was concerned ""there wouldn't be enough left on the roster to field a contending team"" if they gave up all the assets required to acquire a high-profile player via trade.

So while it's hard to blame the Knicks for at least checking in to see what it would take to land Durant it's not a major surprise a deal never got close.

The four-time NBA scoring champion playing his home games at Madison Square Garden would have been quite a spectacle though.

In 2018 while playing the season before he signed with the Nets in free agency he drew attention with his comments about MSG.

""The Garden is like a playground with walls"" Durant told reporters likening it to playing at NYC's famed Rucker Park and he applauded the Knicks faithful for their support of good plays even if they're made by the opposing team: ""That's pure. I like that."""

“I can’t help but imagine actor Lara Dutta bursting out of nowhere to ask me agar mere toothpaste me namak hai (if my toothpaste has salt)” Mini who is based out of Delhi told ThePrint.

New Delhi: Even today when 21-year-old Harsha Mini scouts for toothpastes in the large shelves of supermarkets she can’t help but gravitate towards Colgate Active Salt or its many variants.

The advertisement shows Dutta playing the role of a cashier at a grocery store when suddenly a customer (played by actor Sahil Anand) feels discomfort signaling a toothache. Dutta is then shown in the role of a TV reporter delivering the iconic dialogue: “Kya aapke toothpaste me namak hai?” (Does your toothpaste have salt?) She then goes on to explain the benefits of the product.

This question went on to become one of the iconic most recalled taglines by consumers.

There was just something about Dutta going from being a check-out counter girl to a reporter in split seconds that really struck people. “She interrupted the guy and for a few seconds in the ad I was terrified but it was equally funny” Mini added.

The advertisement propelled Colgate into a cult status. The commercial was created by Red Fuse Communications an integrated global WPP team that was made for Colgate-Palmolive worldwide.

There were subsequent advertisements in the same format — celebrities playing reporters would pose the question in a dramatic fashion.

Public reception

Prior to Colgate’s commercial Indian consumers hadn’t seen a product that incorporated salt into something that was supposed to be on the sweeter side. To see a popular toothpaste brand experimenting with salt was startling.

“For a second I thought it was a joke and then when I saw it on the stands I knew I needed to try it out” Mini said.

Vishwajeet Rana an advertising professional who lives in Gurugram told ThePrint “It is a category (oral hygiene) you don’t really pay much attention to or question unless you have a problem so there is inherent trust.”

This ‘trust’ is reflected in the company’s numbers too. In 2016 55 per cent of the market share in the oral hygiene industry was held by Colgate-Palmolive. Of the 55 per cent 7 per cent share was held by the Active Salt product. Around 25 per cent of the market share held by Active Salt was from South India.

In the same year a new variant of the Colgate Active Salt was able to secure a 1 per cent market share. In March 2020 Colgate-Palmolive was still able to hold 52.7 per cent of the market share even with stiff competition from herbal giants like Patanjali and Dabur.

Among school going children these advertisements also became extremely popular memes. People also used the tagline “Kya aapke toothpaste me namak hai” to humour and take jibes.

“As a kid I remember this being a funny running joke that everyone took part in. It was one of those few jokes that I could make at home and people wouldn’t find it too offensive and often took part in them” Mini recalled.

Why it worked

The team at Red Fuse had been using what is known as the ‘interruption campaign‘ format for sometime and wanted to refresh it — allowing for the recall value of the ad to be greater.

Which is why although Colgate ads had the likes of actors like Sandhya Mridul and Koel Puri earlier it was the one featuring Dutta that really became popular. It wasn’t just the jump scare and rapid-fire nature of the interaction between Dutta and Anand that really sold the ad to consumers. It was the absurd nature of the question itself.

Rana said “When someone suddenly questions you like that you can’t help but wonder — ‘oh okay I didn’t know there was something like this in the market’. And especially when you have an established brand saying that you’re like — ‘oh there’s some truth in it’. That’s why they’ve been able to stick around for decades.”

He added “The commercial was to the point and I guess it’s abrasiveness then stood out because our media wasn’t like that.”

The question asked in the ad isn’t personal but just catches one off guard. Hearing someone ask what kind of toothpaste you use and if it contains salt was definitely bizarre to the ears.

If there were variations of this tagline it was because Colgate was promoting a new product. “You need a massive amount of guts to do something different as a marketeer and unfortunately we rarely do that in Indian advertising. We go with tried and tested methods” Rana said.

This format of advertising really worked for the brand as they went on to feature more actors in different variations of the original ad. Actors Kareena Kapoor Khan and Anushka Sharma also posed as reporters asking unsuspecting victims “Kya aapke toothpaste me namak hai?”.

Interpretations in pop culture

Delivery service Swiggy Instamart came out with its own spin to the Colgate advert in 2021. Swiggy’s advertisement was one in a series of many that were made to recreate the iconic Colgate ad.

Many other brands came up with their own renditions of Colgate’s “Kya aapke toothpaste me namak hai?” tagline as one seen in a commercial by milk brand Country Delight in 2020.

Read more

Michael Schreiber calls his start-up firm the biggest sports network that “you’ve never heard of and that’s OK.”

Almost two years ago the former Comcast Corp. executive launched the sports-ad firm Playfly Sports LLC in Chester County that now reaches 83% of U.S. sports fans pulsing 230 billion advertising impressions a year through 8500 professional and college televised games streaming platforms digital banners radio shows and newsletters.

It’s one half of a two-company mini-boom of sports-tech firms in Berwyn with connections to Comcast. Playfly’s offices are in a former roller rink on the outbound side of SEPTA’s Paoli/Thorndale line. Epoxy.ai also a start-up founded by former Comcast executives leases offices on the line’s inbound tracks within rock-throwing distance of PlayFly. Epoxy.ai personalizes sports bets through mobile phones.

Monetizing sports fan engagement is what it’s all about here: Playfly through advertising and Epoxy.ai through betting. And the former Comcast executives know all about economics of big-money sports the persistence of sports-TV ratings and squeezing value out of sports-media rights.

“It was hard to work in the programming side of Comcast without being involved in sports” said Chris Reynolds an Epoxy.ai cofounder who knew and worked with Schreiber at the Philadelphia company.

Mining advertising revenue regionally

Schreiber’s idea has been to create a sports platform for national brands such as TD Ameritrade or BMW to reach regional sports fans without those brands calling around to local sports teams. An alcoholic beverage company for instance could advertise hard-seltzer drinks in New York and low-calorie beers in Los Angeles “with one invoice” Schreiber said.

The sports advertising market is huge and diffuse. About 800 brands collectively spent $6.2 billion on advertising during NFL telecasts during the 2020-21 season according to one ad-research firm and reported by the Sports Business Journal. The NFL is just one league and most of the advertising is national. Playfly mines the sports advertising on the regional level.

Andrey Mikhailitchenko business professor at California State University in Sacramento said sports fans are five times more likely to recall brands advertised during college or professional games than they are to recall brand advertised during movies or general entertainment.

To sprint quickly out of the blocks Playfly has acquired seven companies supporting Schreiber’s vision for more than $100 million giving it access to a technology platform and advertising inventory for professional baseball basketball and hockey games that it can sell to national advertisers. The most significant of the deals were three former Fox Corp. companies: Home Team Sports Impression Sports and FOX Sports College Properties. Other acquisitions allow Playfly to sell sponsorships to colleges and sell naming rights to arenas.

Schreiber declined to provide revenue for the private company but said it was profitable. In addition to Schreiber Sinclair Broadcast Group and Baltimore investment firm Access Holdings have invested into Playfly.

The firm employs 50 staffers in Berwyn. On its website Playfly has posted job openings in Berwyn or Philadelphia. Playfly employs 350 in other parts of the country with posted openings in New York; El Segundo Calif.; Atlanta; Chicago; and Detroit. In addition Playfly hires about 300 contractors.

In July the Orlando Sentinel reported that Playfly entered a 13-year deal with the University of Central Florida agreeing to pay the institution $125 million for its media rights.

“Playfly is betting that they will make more than $125 million to pay off Central Florida” for those rights said Kirk Wakefield a professor of retail marketing and expert on sports advertising at Baylor University in Texas.

Playfly and UCF confirmed in news releases that they reached a deal. They did not disclose the financial terms.

In college sports Playfly is taking on heavyweight Learfield owned by the investment fund Atairos Group Inc. Wakefield said. Atairos also has links to Comcast — deep ones. Former Comcast chief financial officer Michael Angelakis controls Atairos based in Bryn Mawr and about nine miles from Playfly’s offices. Comcast agreed to finance Atairos with $4 billion.

Sports advertising used to be about a mass audience. But Wakefield said that brands now want to know that their advertising has “changed the minds and behaviors” of consumers he said. “The organization that can go in with that kind of data will win the day.”

For some fans sports games and arenas already feel saturated with advertising.

“Saturation can take place if you are overloading [teams] with easy money” said Mikhailitchenko the professor in Sacramento pointing to professional hockey jerseys in Europe patched over with multiple brand logos.

But he also believes that there is an “endless market” for marketing on sports because advertisers can segment the audience targeting fan groups by demographics lifestyle geography or behavior.

The close proximity of the Playfly and Epoxy.ai offices is not a coincidence. Towns in the western suburbs are Comcast bedroom communities accessed by Regional Rail which also carries reverse commuters from Philadelphia to Berwyn.

Epoxy.ai “had a great team that lived primarily in Center City and they had to be OK with a reverse commute” Reynolds said. “And there is nothing more manageable than getting off the train and walking to your office.”

Reynolds also said it was great to see spin-offs and start-ups cluster in the region similar though on a smaller scale to Silicon Valley or other innovation hubs.

Passionate fans as advertising targets

Schreiber 46 a Baltimore native who worked at NBCUniversal relocated to the Philadelphia area when Comcast bought NBCUniversal in 2011.

“The goal was to take everything on the television in your living room and make it available on digital platforms such as the iPhone” Schreiber said of his first Comcast project.

Negotiating content deals for Comcast Schreiber said he realized that big advertisers could reach a general sports audience on ESPN and other national networks. But they couldn’t easily reach local sports fans who are most passionate and prized eyeballs for advertisers.

In 2016 Schreiber left Comcast for a new post as chief content officer at Altice USA a cable TV and broadband provider in New York. He didn’t want to relocate his family in Paoli so he commuted to the Altice offices by train.

Schreiber quit Altice in June 2020 and several months later he launched Playfly and began looking for a local headquarters. “I did not want to be in a strip plaza somewhere” Schreiber said.

He was charmed by the Berywn Theatre which opened in 1913 and brought Broadway plays to the suburbs. Later uses included a roller rink and then law offices.

After $2 million in renovations Schreiber opened the Playfly offices in the building in May. An indoor basketball court was put in the excavated basement and employee desks ring the court above like a press box. Outdoor turf was laid on that main floor emulating a football field. Professional and college team banners cover walls. There are a gym and areas to hang out.

Before the interview Schreiber tossed a basketball. “Take a foul shot. You have to make one before every meeting.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMikAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5tbGl2ZS5jb20vbmV3cy9hbm4tYXJib3IvMjAyMi8wOC9taWNoaWdhbi1tYW4tc3RhcnRlZC1oaXMtb3duLWludGVybmV0LXByb3ZpZGVyLW5vdy1oZXMtZ290LTI2bS10by1icmluZy1icm9hZGJhbmQtdG8tbmVpZ2hib3JzLmh0bWzSAZ8BaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cubWxpdmUuY29tL25ld3MvYW5uLWFyYm9yLzIwMjIvMDgvbWljaGlnYW4tbWFuLXN0YXJ0ZWQtaGlzLW93bi1pbnRlcm5ldC1wcm92aWRlci1ub3ctaGVzLWdvdC0yNm0tdG8tYnJpbmctYnJvYWRiYW5kLXRvLW5laWdoYm9ycy5odG1sP291dHB1dFR5cGU9YW1w?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Michigan man started his own internet provider.

Game notes: The Tigers scored 11 runs on Saturday night in their win over the Rangers roughly 24 hours after they scored six runs in a loss to Texas. It's their first time breaking double-digit runs since July 25 snapping a streak of 29 straight with nine runs or less. It was also their fifth time hitting double figures this season and their second against the Rangers. The first came on June 18 in outfielder Riley Greene's debut at Comerica Park. The day after that 14-7 victory the Tigers scored seven runs in another win over the Rangers.

So while this offensive explosion is nice for the weekend don't expect it to last into the Tigers' next series which starts Tuesday against the Seattle Mariners back in spacious Comerica Park. The Rangers meanwhile are likely to drop even further below .500 as the AL West-leading Houston Astros come to town again; Houston is already 10-4 this season against the Texas. (Speaking of that the M's are 12-4 against the Rangers; must be nice to live in the AL West.)

First let's talk electricity.

In an unprecedented move a few days ago NOPEC the area’s largest energy aggregator (bulk buyer) for communities announced it was moving 550000 customers back to FirstEnergy utilities.

Utility help:Check out Betty Lin-Fisher's guide

NOPEC or the Northeast Ohio Public Energy Council is a consortium with nearly 1 million gas and electricity customers in 242 communities including parts of Summit Portage Medina and Stark counties.

NOPEC has some communities that are both natural gas and electric — many Portage County communities and a few in Medina and Summit — but a large majority in Summit are gas-only communities. The village of Richfield and some northern Summit communities including Twinsburg and Sagamore Hills have NOPEC electricity.

To see if you're in NOPEC the easiest thing to do is to check its community map at www.nopec.org/communities/community-map or contact your local community.

NOPEC said it notified the Public Utilities Commission of Ohio of its intention to voluntarily return 550000 of its electricity customers who are on what’s called the Standard Program Price or its default price back to their local utility. In our area that would be Ohio Edison. Customers would get the utility default price often called the “price to compare.""

The reason is that while wholesale natural gas prices have been skyrocketing since last fall electricity prices didn’t do the same until recently Dave Jankowski chief marketing and communications officer for NOPEC told me during an interview. NOPEC’s default price which customers are automatically included on unless they had chosen the variable rate or longer-term fixed rate often changed monthly or every few months he said.

Why is advice different for electric rates and gas rates?

NOPEC's and other retailers' current electric rates are higher than the utility's ""price to compare"" because the utility's rate was determined largely in auctions conducted before April when energy prices were considerably lower NOPEC said.

This is where it is confusing for us because my advice for natural gas is to stay away from the utility’s default since it is based on current wholesale rates.

The advice now for electricity is to go with the utility’s default because the electricity default price is determined through several auctions held at different times that buy ahead and lock in a price. The current default price is largely based on pricing during auctions that happened before the run-up.

NOPEC’s current Standard Program Price would have been almost double Ohio Edison’s “price to compare” which is currently at 6.7 cents per kilowatt hour.

“As a consumer-focused non-profit NOPEC is always operating and advocating for what’s best for our communities and customers” Chuck Keiper NOPEC’s executive director said in a press release. “When we looked at the price forecasts it became increasingly apparent that the Price to Compare rate would be a better place for our customers to be through Winter 2023 to save significant money during these economically challenging times.”

Customers could make their own choice to come off the NOPEC rate but Keiper said the organization decided “it was in all our consumers’ best interest” to make the wholesale change and temporarily switch its customers.

Current NOPEC customers on the Standard Program Price do not need to do anything and will automatically be returned to their utility within one to two billing cycles depending on the billing date. There is no fee to leave the aggregation early.

NOPEC customers who are on the variable price which is 6% off the “price to compare” and customers who were on one of NOPEC’s 12- or 24-month contracts will remain though they can also choose to leave at no charge said Jankowski. Contract rates vary depending on when a customer locked in.

NOPEC is expecting electricity prices to stabilize by next spring and that its prices will be in line with the utility’s default pricing so the aggregation will send new opt-out enrollments at that time. That means customers in those communities will automatically be enrolled in the electric plan unless they opt out.

If you have questions NOPEC’s number is 855-667-3201.

What if I'm not in a NOPEC community?

If you're not in a NOPEC community you should still do a checkup to see if you're getting the best price possible for electricity. You can check your bill to see who your current supplier is or contact your local community to see if you are in an aggregation. Many communities in our area are on aggregation deals with Energy Harbor the former FirstEnergy Solutions. Those contract rates used to be a certain percentage off the utility’s “price to compare” but they are now all on fixed rates. If your community was locked in before this spring/summer run-up it’s possible you are on a better rate than the “price to compare” so you should stick with it or see if you can get into it.

Here are a few of the area Energy Harbor contracts: Akron and Barberton both are on a fixed rate of 4.97 cents/kWh through May 2025; Green is 4.91 cents/kWh through May 2024; and Tallmadge is 4.96 cents/kWh through May 2024. Summit County townships (with the exception of Sagamore Hills which is in the NOPEC aggregation) are in an Energy Harbor contract for 4.67 cents/kWh through May 2024.

You can call Energy Harbor to find out more: 888-254-6359. If your community is not with Energy Harbor call your local community or search online.

The bottom line is that if your community aggregation rate is below the current “price to compare” of 6.7 cents/kWh stick with your current contract. Similarly if you locked in to a fixed-rate contract on your own that beats the price to compare stay where you are.

I looked at the PUCO’s Apples to Apples chart www.energychoice.ohio.gov for electricity prices and there is one that is close to the utility “price to compare” but it is laced with monthly fees and hefty cancellation fees. Other rates are 8 cents/kWh and above so I would not lock in to a public fixed rate and I would go back to Ohio Edison as the default which just means you cancel your current contract if you have another provider listed on your bill.

OK so what about gas?

Natural gas prices have been all over the place since last summer. The prices have mostly been way up as the energy markets have reacted to typical gas and storage issues but had the added nervousness from world events.

Last fall I suggested readers find a low fixed rate — either on their own or through their community aggregation or bulk-buying group — and get off the Dominion Standard Choice Offer or SCO. The SCO is the monthly rate based on wholesale rates plus a state-approved formula. For years we enjoyed great prices on the SCO when prices were close to wholesale rates.

The SCO has been all over the map since last fall as low as $4.17 in January and $9.08 in June. It is $8.87/mcf as of Aug. 11 bills.

There isn’t a one-size-fits-all answer but my advice remains the same to try to find the best rate.

If you locked in to a good fixed rate in fall 2021 before the run-up in prices and you're still on that rate for a while you are in good shape. I was able to get an excellent $2.49/mcf rate with Ohio Electric & Gas for 11 months in October 2021 with a $50 cancellation fee. My rate is ending next month and my community aggregation rate is not one I want to join so a few days ago I locked in to the cheapest fixed rate with no cancellation fee on the PUCO's Apples to Apples chart or at www.energychoice.ohio.gov. That was Direct Energy with a $6.29/mcf rate with no cancellation fee for 32 months. You can call 877-698-7551 or go to www.directenergy.com for that rate. Rates can change quickly so if that’s not available find a decent rate with no cancellation fee. I probably won’t stay on that for 32 months but it’s a decent rate for now.

If you live or have a small business in the city of Akron the aggregation with Constellation Energy moved to its $4.06 fixed rate in May and that lasts through November 2024. That is a very good price given where we are now. Last fall I was not in favor of the Akron rate since it was going to mirror the higher SCO rates through the winter months when people use the most gas though I said the fixed rate was decent. Akron residents and small-business owners are allowed to opt in. Call Constellation at 833-500-2738. It will take one to two billing cycles to switch over.

If you are still on the SCO or a price that is based on the SCO see if your community has an aggregation rate that's better and see if you can get in. There are some communities that locked in prices that were only OK a few years ago but they locked in for several years and that price looks good now. (Stow's rate is $2.84/mcf fixed through 2024.) See if they will let you in; each has different rules. I would not be on the SCO now.

If you live in a NOPEC gas community which is a large portion of the Akron region NOPEC's default is called its program rate. That is currently at $7.80/mcf. Its variable is 3 cents below the SCO (too high) and its fixed rates are $8.65 for 12 months and $7.75 for 24 months. None of those prices are great so I would probably lock in to the $6.29/mcf Direct Energy rate and watch to see if NOPEC rates come down. There is no fee to leave NOPEC. Also NOPEC gas customers are not being returned to the utility; only the default electricity customers are.

But there’s a catch that goes unmentioned. And it’s a big one. The land that’s up for sale on the Mystic River in Everett sits in a designated port area limiting what could go there to water-dependent industrial operations. Translation: None of the advertised uses are allowed there today.

The Mystic Station marketing brochure describes the 45-acre power plant property as a “transformational development opportunity” on Boston’s doorstep — with room for labs offices multifamily housing stores and maybe even a hotel or two.

With a possible New England Revolution soccer stadium in mind House leaders last month adopted language in their economic development bill to exempt the Mystic site from DPA restrictions. The Kraft Group has long sought a standalone home for the Revs in Greater Boston separate from Gillette Stadium in Foxborough and the Mystic site has been a rumored contender for several years.

The Conservation Law Foundation went to war after the “soccer stadium amendment” came to light lobbying against what the group called a last-minute backroom deal that could undermine the local maritime economy; CLF also blasted language that would exempt the property from construction limits under the state’s Chapter 91 law governing tidelands. Time ran out on formal sessions before the House and Senate could reach an agreement on the broader economic development bill.

The fate of that bill — a $4 billion-plus potpourri of tax cuts and economic-related program funds — remains up in the air. As a result so is this key piece of Everett’s riverfront renaissance. And the entire debate underscores pressing questions about our old industrial waterfronts and how they should evolve.

At Mystic a viable mixed-use project might be possible under Chapter 91 tidelands rules. But the DPA issue could be a deal breaker potentially preventing anything from getting built.

That wouldn’t sit well with Everett Mayor Carlo DeMaria. Along with Wynn Resorts executives DeMaria wants the site to become an entertainment and hospitality destination to complement the $2.6 billion casino that Wynn opened across the street in 2019 and the related development the company is pursuing along Broadway. A Revs stadium would fit perfectly with that vision. City officials last year gave themselves the authority to take this site from plant owner Exelon — now Constellation an Exelon spinoff — by eminent domain if necessary.

The eminent-domain threat forced Constellation’s hand prompting it to hire brokerage CBRE to market the 45 acres. It no longer uses its shuttered turbines there though Eversource has an easement to operate a switchyard; another section is essentially water undevelopable. Not included are two natural-gas fired units next door. Constellation gets special payments to keep those two going because of their importance to New England’s grid until the spring of 2024. Then what remains of this decades-old power plant closes for good.

All a Constellation spokesman would say is that the company hopes to conclude the sale by year’s end with Everett’s redevelopment plan in mind.

It’s in this context that the House leaders tucked the Everett language into the back of their economic development bill. Down-to-the-wire negotiations with the Senate got sidetracked by an unexpected revelation that the state may need to budget for nearly $3 billion in income tax credits. But the bill is not dead by any means.

Legislative leaders are waiting for clarity on the exact cost of those credits. They could choose to pass much of the bill in an informal session when roll calls can’t be taken. Controversial items like this Everett language are generally avoided in informal sessions because a single lawmaker can block a bill.

With CLF watching closely it’s unlikely the Everett language could survive in an informal session. From CLF’s perspective maintaining the state’s port infrastructure is crucial. Once an industrial port makes way for high-end development CLF’s Deanna Moran argues it’s gone for good. CLF doesn’t want oil tanks and dirty power plants either. But Moran said these properties could be ideal for “blue-tech” and clean-energy uses like the wind-farm work planned for Salem’s waterfront.

Legislators are only expected to meet in informal sessions until January but it’s possible they could be called back for a rare special formal session to wrap up the tax cuts bonding proposals and other goodies in the bill. In a formal session the Everett measure might very well make it through.

While there is precedent for removing properties from DPAs through legislation Mystic Station’s road to redevelopment becomes considerably longer without State House help. The next option: ask the state’s Coastal Zone Management office for a formal DPA boundary review. The agency is currently reviewing such requests for two different areas in East Boston. One is led by warehouse developer Jacob Citrin who wants to remove several industrial parcels on Route 1A from a port area. The second is being pursued by the Boston Planning & Development Agency and involves properties in and around Central Square.

Advertisement

This route can be lengthy — no less than six months and often much longer. Citrin said he applied more than two years ago and expects the final decision next month; BPDA initiated its request in early 2020. But in the case of the Mystic parcel land-use experts say DPA regulations probably wouldn’t offer enough leeway to remove it from its respective port area anyway.

Another possible path is even more circuitous but could prove beneficial in the long run: rewriting the DPA rules. The system established in the 1970s is seen by many as anachronistic. State environmental regulators would include many waterfront stakeholders in that process — environmental groups property owners municipal officials. Julie Wormser of the Mystic River Watershed Association sees this as the best possible outcome: a robust regional conversation about updating the DPAs instead of dealing with them on a piecemeal basis.

The fight for the future of this power-plant land might end up not only being about bringing relief to Revs fans who have long hoped for a soccer stadium to call their own. It could end up being about the kind of future we want for the industrial waterfronts in and around Boston and what it will take to get there.

The top admiral of the US Navy Michael Gilday stated that directed energy systems are being developed as a potential countermeasure against hypersonic missiles calling the advancements made by Russia and China in hypersonic weapon technology “a significant concern.”

The development of devices that would use high-energy lasers or high-power microwaves to remove a threat is a major priority for the Navy according to Adm. Michael Gilday Chief of Naval Operations who is also the Chief of US Missile Defense Agency.

The statement comes a few days after the US Navy secured the delivery of a high-energy laser weapon called ‘HELIOS’ from defense giant Lockheed Martin. The acquisition made way for installation on warships marking a significant step forward beyond isolated testing and toward real combat.

It is widely known that hypersonic missiles are very difficult to intercept due to their incredible speed unpredictable trajectory and their ability to enter space and then re-enter the atmosphere using Hypersonic Glide Vehicle (HGV).

While the US is working towards layered anti-hypersonic missile defense it is still years away.

The US Navy currently uses the Aegis Ballistic Missile Defense System deployed on Arleigh Burke-class destroyers and Ticonderoga-class cruisers designed to intercept ballistic missiles in the post-boost phase and before re-entry. However it cannot intercept highly maneuverable Chinese and Russian hypersonic missiles.

While Russia fired a hypersonic cruise missile Kinzhal against Ukraine in March China conducted a historic hypersonic test last summer. “They’re a significant concern” Gilday said. “Russia and China are both developing those capabilities and will be fielding those capabilities shortly.”

To combat the threat posed by these hypersonic missiles in the backdrop of tensions with its adversaries the US has been exploring the possibility of using DEWs as a defense against these formidable and super-fast missiles.

The American Emphasis On DEWs

A possible method of thwarting hypersonic weapons is to deploy directed energy systems which employ lasers or microwave transmitters to damage a system or interfere with its electronics according to the US official.

In essence DEWs are weapons that destroy damage or incapacitate targets with highly focused energy including lasers microwaves or particle beams. They employ a beam of concentrated electromagnetic energy for their functioning.

They can be operated at high speeds to allow them to cause disruptive effects to facilities vehicles personnel and equipment in an efficient manner.

The fiscal 2022 National Defense Authorization Act that was passed in December 2021 granted the Missile Defense Agency the power to study and develop laser technologies for use in ballistic and hypersonic missile defense applications.

The Defense Department considers directed energy systems to be a technology area of utmost importance according to Heidi Shyu the Under Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering.

Earlier this year Shyu said that DEWs which use lasers or microwave emitters to destroy targets have finally reached the point of technological maturity where the military can field them.

In June 2022 the House Armed Service Committee panel asked the Department of Defense to submit a strategy for defeating hypersonic missile threats using asymmetric capabilities including directed energy and microwave systems among other things. Several US Defense contractors are already invested in developing DEWs.

Directed Energy Weapons Vs Hypersonic Missiles

The discourse about using DEWs to destroy hypersonic missiles has been around for a while. US Defense Contractor Northop Grumman stated that it was partnering with the US Department of Defense to explore high-wave microwave systems as a part of a layered approach to air defense.

At the time the defense contractor said “High-power microwaves have an important edge over hypersonic weapons – they’re much faster. While hypersonic weapons travel more than five times the speed of sound high-power microwaves travel at the speed of light – 300 million meters per second.”

According to Aerospace and Defense Analyst Girish Linganna “Directed energy systems use lasers or microwave emitters to eliminate a system or disrupt its electronics. They transmit a lethal force at the speed of light i.e. around 300000 kilometers per second.

Secondly the atmospheric drag and the constraining effects of gravity do not affect the beams of these weapons. Third these weapons are extremely precise. Fourth varying the intensity and type of energy delivered against targets can change the effects of DEWs.

We know that hypersonic missiles travel with a speed of Mach 5 i.e. 5 times the speed of sound. Any particle emitted by lasers or DEWs(Directed Energy Weapons) travels at the speed of light. So it is very highly possible that lasers can disable the onboard systems or outright destroy it.”

The US is in the process of developing anti-hypersonic defense systems many of which are in various phases of development. For instance the US Missile Defense Agency (MDA) is working on a Glide Phase Interceptor (GPI) to intercept the hypersonic missile and shoot it down in the middle of the flight’s most vulnerable phase.

Further the US Space Development Agency has announced two new contracts for a constellation of missile surveillance satellites. Chinese and Russian hypersonic missiles will be tracked and observed by these satellites. On July 18 L3Harris and Northrop Grumman received the contracts which have a combined value of $1.3 billion.

At the time the director of the Space Development Agency Derek Tournear had explained that there would be two layers – a Transport Layer and a Tracking Layer of satellites that send data to ground troops ready to kill the missile.

While Gilday did not give details about how the DEWs would hit the hypersonic missile the surveillance satellites would probably take on the task.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiW2h0dHBzOi8vZ2FtZXJhbnguY29tL2ZlYXR1cmVzL2lkLzM1MDcxNC9hcnRpY2xlL2dlbnNoaW4taW1wYWN0LXpob25nbGktY29uc3RlbGxhdGlvbi1ndWlkZS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Genshin Impact: Zhongli Constellation Guide,"With Zhongli back for his third Genshin Impact rerun it's time to decide whether to power up Zhongli or roll for Tighnari.

With Genshin Impact rolling out Sumeru the new character banners are Tighnari – the first Sumeru character banner – and Zhongli. If you want to return to Liyue want Zhongli or want to make Zhongli even better it’s time to roll.

Genshin Impact Dottore’s History and Release Date | New Character Candace Revealed for Genshin Impact | Should You Pull For Tighnari in Genshin Impact

Overall Zhongli’s best Constellation is C1. Though Zhongli is already fantastic the extra Stone Stele is the most useful effect out of the six. But if you’re a really big Zhongli fan or you’re that one person who uses him as Main DPS going up to C4 or C5 provides both attack and shield benefits.

C1 – Rock the Backbone of Earth

You know what’s better than one pillar? TWO pillars! This Constellation allows two Stone Steles to exist simultaneously. Two pillars means double the Geo damage and shield generation from any Elements within Stone Stele’s AoE. But more importantly you can take even more funny pictures involving the Steles.

C2 – Stone the Cradle of Jade

Planet Befall grants nearby characters on the field a Jade Shield when it descends. This Constellation is very useful if you do a lot of Co-Op since nearby teammates will get a shield. If you have C2 Zhongli this is the point where you should build him as a Support since both his Elemental Skill and Elemental Burst will generate a Jade Shield.

C3 – Jade Shimmering through Darkness

Upon activation this Constellation increases Dominus Lapidis by three levels. Dominus Lapidis will have a max Talent Level of 15.

C4 – Topaz Unbreakable and Fearless

This Constellation affects Planet Befall increasing its AoE by 20% and increasing its petrification effect by two seconds. Planet Befall will potentially affect more enemies and said enemies will be frozen for slightly longer. Ruin Guard Island just became a lot more feasible. Coupled with C2’s Jade Shield Zhongli may never take damage. So if you hate damage go for C4!

C5 – Lazuli Herald of the Order

Upon activation this Constellation increases Planet Befall by three levels. Planet Befall will have a max Talent Level of 15.

C6 – Chrysos Bounty of Dominator

This Constellation specifically affects the Jade Shield. Due to the previous Constellations Zhongli’s Elemental Skill and Elemental Burst will generate a Jade Shield. When the Jade Shield takes DMG 40% of that DMG converts to HP for the current character. This is capped at 8% of that character’s Max HP.

So not only will the shield protect you but it’ll heal you! This is great for the weekly bosses and any area of Teyvat giving you trouble (like the Masanori fight). Just remember the healing cap.",,,

It’s seen far better days but it comes with just 2738 miles on the clock and the dubious distinction of having been brought into this state by American businessman Paul Pelosi who is also the husband of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi.The 82-year-old businessman was arrested in late May 2022 on suspicion of driving under the influence after he was involved in a two-vehicle crash in Napa California. He was initially charged with Driving Under the Influence of Alcohol Causing Injury and Driving with .08% Blood Alcohol Level or Higher Causing Injury and he initially entered a not guilty plea on both.Specifics of the crash were never made public except for the mention that a Jeep smashed into the Porsche and that Pelosi was under the influence. Earlier this month Pelosi pleaded guilty to DUI and was sentenced to five days in jail (four of which he’d served and one was replaced with an 8-hour court-ordered work program) and 3 years of probation.The Porsche is now on a lot in Martinez California. It’s been listed on Copart and will sell at auction with an upcoming lot with celebrity publication TMZ noting that the date is yet to be established. The same media outlet confirms that this Porsche is Pelosi’s. Damage from the crash is visible on the driver side both in the front and the rear but the interior is as-new. The driver airbag deployed in the crash and is shown in the photos. The unit sells with a salvage California title but there’s no estimate on how much it could fetch; for comparison an un-crashed 2021 Porsche 911 Carrera S starts at well over $100000.,,,,,,,,,,,,

With a rocky start to his weekend on Friday night after GMoney (Mike Miller Bucking Bulls) launched him to the ground after just 3.48 seconds Wimer knew he had to give Saturday his all. Beginning the night aboard Another Player (Johnson Bucking Bulls) Wimer set the tone early on recording an 84.5-point score.

Laser-focused on the back of the chutes as the championship round began the 23-year-old rider prepared for his matchup with Crazed Addiction (Cornwell Bucking Bulls).

In a uniquely formatted weekend that featured nightly regular rounds and nightly championship rounds it was ultimately Wimer’s 86-point score in Saturday’s final round that clinched his victory.

The young gun leaves Iowa with 42.5 Challenger Series points and a check for $10124.69.

After finishing Friday night atop the leaderboard Ariat Texas Rattlers rider Brady Fielder (Clermont Queensland Australia) finished the weekend in second place.

In Saturday’s opening round the young Australian was matched with Dirty Lyle (L4 Livestock) for a resounding 81 points.

With the exception of Wimer Fielder and the other riders putting it all on the line in Saturday’s championship round were no match for the extreme athleticism of the PBR bulls.

Courtesy of his first-night lead and Saturday night regular-round score Fielder leaves Sioux City with 27 Challenger Series points.

2004 PBR World Champion Mike Lee (Decatur Texas) sported a fifth-place finish as the Sioux City Classic began on Friday night and kicked off Saturday night as the first rider out of the chutes.

Paired with Twisted Thoughts (Triplett/Sterk) Lee’s 84-point ride score earned him third place on the weekend and 13 Challenger Series points.

After a three-way tie for second place on Friday night Travis Wimberley (Las Lunas New Mexico) Matt Allgood (Saline Michigan) and Dustin Herman (Great Falls North Carolina) finished out the weekend again in a three-way tie for a fourth-place finish overall.

The first in the trio to record a score on Saturday night Allgood launched from the chutes clinging to Kodach Rome (L4 Livestock) for a less-than-ideal 78.5-point score.

Shortly after Herman attempted Pneu-Dart’s Coal Miner (Mike Miller Bucking Bulls) to no avail. The powerful animal athlete dispatched the North Carolina cowboy in just under five seconds.

The last in the trio to climb aboard on Saturday night was Wimberley paired with Pneu-Dart’s Southern Twist (Mike Miller Bucking Bulls). Slammed to the ground without making the 8 the young gun 18-year-old from New Mexico was in visible pain as the sports medicine team helped him out of the arena.

Despite the falters as the weekend closed out all three cowboys collected 5.66 Challenger points.

The top bull riders of the PBR Challenger Series will next travel to the Stark County Fairgrounds in Dickinson North Dakota for the Dakota Community Bank & Trust 4th Annual Dickinson PBR Sept. 2-3.

Jane was the fifth of eight children born to Fordy and Ruth Perry of Corning NY. She is survived by her loving husband John two daughters Niki Loiko (Rick) and Dana DeMay (Kris) two step sisters Stephanie Romeo (John) and Julie Slechta one step brother Matthew Slechta grand daughter Gabrielle Romeo plus seven siblings and their spouses: Rochelle Joynt (James) Michael Perry Preston Perry Gordon Perry (Diane) Robert Perry (Debra) Laurel Antonio (Gregory) and Patricia Staheli.......plus countless nieces nephews and other extended family members. Jane grew up in the Northside of Corning in a loving environment surrounded by her wonderful parents and siblings. Their house was a frequent gathering place where the local children were always welcome. Many of the friends she made in that nurturing neighborhood and elsewhere in Corning remained close to her to the very end. Most notable of these dear friends were her three ""adopted sisters"": Jane (""Jane #1"") Kaszczynec Debbie Rockwell and Dorothy ""Dottie"" Williams. Over the years Jane held many jobs in and around Corning where she made countless life-long friends. It was almost impossible to go anywhere (including China!) with Jane and have her not bump into a friend or acquaintance! For the last 14 years before retirement Jane worked in the front office of the Pollio Dairy in Campbell. In the first year that she was eligible she was unanimously honored with the Employee of the Year Award. Jane knew the names and ""life stories"" of every single one of Pollio's several hundred employees and was loved and respected by them all. Jane had many passions but she was best known for her ability as an accomplished cook. Her cheesecakes and brownies are legendary among her friends and relatives. Husband John has been heard to say ""Eating dinners cooked by Jane is like eating in a different restaurant every night"". Jane loved nature and especially watching the many birds that came to her feeders......not to mention the occasional squirrel chipmunk bear possum and raccoon. She (and her siblings) especially enjoyed watching cardinals as did their parents before them. Jane had an uncanny ability to spot hawks (and count them!) from the car during road trips and she always looked forward to the annual winter trip to the Catskills to spot bald eagles. She and John enjoyed their yearly ""deer census"" every spring on Harris Hill. Other interests included playing cards reading listening to 50's and 60's rock crocheting driving around our beautiful hills and byways and of course spending time with her daughters and her huge and loving family. She loved to travel and by the time she retired she'd visited almost all of the 50 states. In the 15 years since retirement Jane and John ""kicked it up a notch"" and visited over 40 countries. Friends Sam and Jane Kaszczynec joined them on many of these adventures. Final arrangements have been entrusted to Phillips Funeral Home 17 W. Pulteney Street Corning. A viewing will be held on Tuesday August 30 2022 from 12-2 PM immediately to be followed by a funeral service and interment at the Coopers Plains Cemetery. A reception for relatives and friends will follow at the Horseheads Elks Club. In lieu of flowers the family would appreciate a memorial donation to the American Cancer Society.

Looking back at a long reign

(SitNews) Ketchikan Alaska - In the world of municipal management former longtime Ketchikan city manager Karl Amylon was a unicorn.

The International City/County Management Association estimates that the average city manager stays in one job for between three to five years. In more than 40 years as a municipal manager Amylon basically only had two jobs.

Amylon was fresh out of Bucknell University in 1978. when he was hired to be confidential assistant to the city manager of Watertown New York By 1982 he was the acting city manager and then became assistant city manager in January 1983. Eleven months later he was appointed full time Watertown city manager. Watertown is about 160 miles north of Corning New York where Amylon grew up.

At the time Amylon 28 was one of the youngest municipal managers in the country. He would hold that job for the next 11 years before resigning in 1994. In 1995 he would be named city manager in Ketchikan a job he would hold for 26 years before resigning at the end August of 2021 just about a year ago.

Amylon then died of cancer in September of 2021.

When Amylon passed away in 2021 the current Watertown city manager Kenneth Mix spoke about him in an article in the Watertown Daily Times.

""Karl was a very intelligent person"" who knew how to get things done Mix told the Daily Times noting that he had worked with Amylon back in the 1990s. He said among Amylon's major accomplishments in Watertown was negotiating a power purchase agreement between the city and Niagara Mohawk that decades later still provides the city with millions of dollars of revenue each year.

But Mix also noted that Amylon was forced to leave Watertown because of a pair of controversies involving the Watertown police department. First in 1986 he was criticized for naming Michael Hennegan of the Niagara Falls police department to head the Watertown department in 1986. Several years later a lieutenant with the police department was accused of a serious crime and according to the Daily Times Amylon publicly said the officer would be found guilty. When that didn't happen the city council forced Amylon's resignation.

""We lost him and he went to Alaska but I think he found a good place he was in Alaska for 26 years"" Mix told the Watertown newspaper.

Amylon was born in Corning New York in 1956. After growing up in Corning he attended Bucknell University graduating with a degree in political science. He later received a master's degree in public administration from Syracuse University.

When he arrived in Ketchikan it was not without some controversy. He took over for a long-time assistant city manager who was one of the candidates for the full-time position and the city council received more than a little grief for not ""hiring local.""

Also in 1999 the city council decided to add the management of Ketchikan Public Utilities to the city manager's portfolio after having separate utility and city government managers for many years. The idea was to limit what had become numerous skirmishes between the city and utility managers in recent years.

There were many major projects during Amylon's two decades at the head of Ketchikan city government.

On the city side there was the $50 million renovation of the medical center the construction of the new downtown fire station and the new city library in Bear Valley. The centennial building and the Tongass Historical Museum were remodeled. There were also several city hall remodeling projects and upgrades to Bayview Cemetery and the city landfill.

Roads were a major issue and Amylon oversaw the reconstruction of Water Street Trestle and the work on numerous other city roads as well as a few state ones in the city.

There were also public-private projects and Amylon promoted the city interests in the private company building of Berth 4 and the expansion of the Ketchikan Shipyard.

Perhaps the biggest change to the city was creation of the port facility downtown with nearly $100 million going into the establishment and improvements of Berth's One Two and Three and the Waterfront Promenade as well as upland developments to handle a cruise industry that went from 200000 visitors in Amylon's first year to more than 1.3 million by 2019.

There were also major changes at KPU when Amylon was in charge.

The water disinfection facility was built the Whitman Lake Hydro Dam was built. A $15 million subsea fiber optic cable was built to Prince Rupert. The Bethe Electrical Substation was built and the city negotiated the transfer of responsibility for operating the Swan Lake hydro operation from the city to the SEAPA.

All told Amylon helped lead the city through more than $300 million in new construction projects in his two decades besides implementing combined city and KPU budgets of more than $100 million yearly.

Another area where Amylon was involved was in the transfer of the city's responsibility for operating Gateway Center for Human Services to the State of Alaska.

Politically the city responded to the potential loss of sales tax dollars by annexing the Shoreline Service Area where Walmart would be located.

After retiring Amylon received several posthumous awards.

The Alaska Municipal League gave him the Vic Fischer Local Government Award in 2021. Southeast Conference named him the 2021 Southeast Alaska Person of the Year and the Ketchikan Chamber of Commerce gave him the 2021 Lifetime Achievement Award.

And the Ketchikan City Council renamed city hall the Karl R. Amylon City Hall.

When Amylon was first hired several letters to the editor of the Daily News predicted he wouldn't last very long in the community.

He proved them wrong.

At £479.99 for the 8/128 GB trim and £529.99 for the 8/256 GB model Honor is having big goals for its new workhorse but does it have what it takes to be your next phone?

The Android midrange segment is arguably the busiest area in the smartphone market with plenty of great options from a variety of makers. The big names like Samsung Xiaomi and the BBK group routinely offer great devices that come with their own set of highs and lows when it comes to chipset cameras and build.

Honor aims to bring you a flagship experience on a budget and design is a big focus. Honor 70 features a dual-glass design and a curved OLED display. The panel measures at 6.67-inches and refreshes at 120Hz while the resolution is 1080 x 2400 pixels. The back also features a neat design with Crystal Silver option getting a diamond pattern while the other options stick to a frosted finish.

The cameras on the back are pretty capable too – you get a 54MP main camera that relies on Sony’s IMX 800 sensor. This is a new 1/1.49” sensor with 1.0µm pixels and all pixel autofocus and it’s the same sensor used in the flagship Honor 70 Pro and Honor 70 Pro+ models that are still exclusive to China. There’s an additional 50MP ultrawide module that doubles as a macro cam as well as a 2MP depth helper.

And now we get to the chipset – Honor went with the Snapdragon 778G+ which is also used in a variety of well-received midrangers like the Galaxy A52s 5G Xiaomi 12 Lite and the more recent Galaxy A73 5G and Nothing Phone (1). While the 778G is a well-rounded SoC there are more capable chipsets among other midrangers with the likes of the Snapdragon 870 SD 7 Gen 1 or some of the newer Dimensity chips from MediaTek.

Honor 70 gets a decently sized 4800 mAh battery and charging should be plenty fast – Honor is bundling a 66W adaptor in the box which should get you a 0-60% charge in 20 minutes. The software side is covered by Magic UI 6.1 over Android 12 with full GMS support.



Honor 70 color options

There’s no water resistance rating headphone jack or a microSD card slot on the Honor 70 which can turn off some potential buyers. Audio is handled by a single bottom-firing speaker which also does not help its case. Honor has one advantage for early bird buyers though – a free pair of Earbuds 3 Pro which we found to be a great sounding pair of buds in our review.

With the case for the Honor 70 out the way let’s take a look at the competition.

Samsung’s Galaxy A52s 5G comes to mind – it’s also powered by the Snapdragon 778G chipset and offers a large 6.5-inch AMOLED that refreshes at 120Hz. The main cam is a 64MP shooter with OIS while the auxiliary modules are less impressive with a 12MP ultrawide and two 5MP modules for macro shots and depth data. The Galaxy has a smaller 4500 mAh battery and it charges far slower at 25W.

Software support is a key advantage for the Samsung phone as it’s guaranteed three Android releases and four years of security packages. The phone also gets IP67 water and dust resistance while also boasting a microSD card slot and stereo speakers making it a much more capable multimedia device. You can get a 6/256GB A52s 5G for just £300 which is far less than the Honor 70.



Samsung Galaxy A52s 5G

Another phone from Samsung’s camp is the Galaxy S21 FE which is offering a 6.4-inch AMOLED screen and 120Hz refresh rate. You get a superior Snapdragon 888 chipset here and the same great software support with three Android version updates and four years of security updates.

The main (12MP) and ultrawide (12MP) cameras are less impressive on paper though you do get an 8MP telephoto lens to make up. You also get IP68 water and dust resistance Corning Gorilla Glass protection on the screen and stereo speakers. Pricing is pretty competitive here as well the 6/128G Galaxy S21FE is currently going for £456.

You could also look at the Poco F4 GT – one of the most popular midranges out there. It boats the flagship Snapdragon 8 Gen 1 chipset magnetic pop-up buttons for gaming and a 4700 mAh battery with blazing fast 120W wired charging. The camera setup is less impressive – a 64MP main cam and an 8MP ultrawide module as well as a 2MP macro shooter. It’s a compelling all-around package and the baseline 8/128GB model currently retails for £584.



Poco F4 GT

Realme GT Neo 3 brings the capable MediaTek Dimensity 8100 chipset class-leading 150W charging and a large 6.7-inch AMOLED with a 120Hz refresh rate. Battery endurance in our tests was stellar – clocking in over 102 hours. When you do need to recharge a full charge from 0 to 100% takes only 16 minutes. The 50MP main cam takes good enough photos in the daylight. Realme GT Neo 3 150W is currently going for £599.

Depending on where you live there are quite a few other alternatives. With all that in mind can you see yourself purchasing the Honor 70 or would you pick another phone?

COST,Costco,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZvb2wuY29tL3RoZS1hc2NlbnQvcGVyc29uYWwtZmluYW5jZS9hcnRpY2xlcy81LXJlYXNvbnMtaXZlLXRyYWRlZC1zYW1zLWNsdWItZm9yLWNvc3Rjby_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,5 Reasons I've Traded Sam's Club for Costco,"After some back and forth I've decided Costco is the right warehouse store for me.

Honestly Sam's Club and Costco have always struck me as interchangeable. Historically I would join whichever happened to be closer to my house. And while convenience is important I recently decided to drive a bit farther down the road to get to Costco. I allowed my Sam's Club membership to expire and became a Costco member. Here's why.

1. Less time spent mulling around

I do not enjoy SIRL (shopping in real life). For me a trip to a store means ""get in get out and get home to put things away."" From my experience Costco shopping takes less time and I recently learned why: Costco carries fewer products than Sam's Club.

SKU stands for stock-keeping units representing how many different items a store carries. According to a great blog called Frugal Rules Costco has around 4000 SKUs while Sam's Club carries between 6000 to 7000 SKUs.

If you're someone who enjoys a leisurely stroll through a big box store to discover what's new Sam's may be a better fit for you. Costco works for me as someone who loathes spending more time than necessary shopping.

2. Better deals

Simply put I spend less at Costco even though I pick up the same number of basics. While the difference isn't significant it's enough to remind me that Costco's overall prices tend to be lower. Every dollar counts.

Say I pick up items at Costco once a week saving $5 each trip. If I were to invest that $5 in a product with an average annual return of 7% it would be worth nearly $3500 in 10 years. While $3500 won't make me rich it's money that can be reinvested or plump up my emergency savings account.

3. A preference for Kirkland

One reason warehouse stores can afford to keep prices low is that they carry fewer name-brand products than traditional stores. For example Sam's (and its parent company Walmart) carries Member's Mark. Costco carries the Kirkland brand. From pain relievers to coffee I prefer Kirkland.

Quick caveat: One exception is Member's Mark honey roasted peanuts. Never have I experienced a better-tasting honey-roasted nut. In fact I've been known to make a trip to Walmart or Sam's just to pick up peanuts.

4. Healthier options

I sometimes long for the days when I could pick up groceries without worrying about how many preservatives were in a package. Today it's always on my mind. I don't always eat healthily but I find myself trying to more often than not. And that means stocking up on healthy options.

In my observation Costco makes eating healthy simpler than Sam's Club. This may be due to Costco carrying fewer items but the store also appears to carry higher-quality food. I find it easier to find organic cage-free preservative-free options at Costco.

Don't get me wrong; I can't go into a warehouse store without buying dark chocolate-covered pretzels. Still I'd prefer to have healthier food options in the house too.

5. General vibe

I may be imagining it but Costco always feels slightly less oppressive to me than Sam's Club. That may have to do with other factors like how crowded the store is how much shopping I have to do and whether anyone with me is prone to wandering off. Still I like the vibe in Costco more.

I also appreciate that Costco pays its employees more than Sam's Club pays its employees. According to Indeed.com the hourly wage for Costco employees ranges from $13 to just shy of $39. More importantly 83% of Costco employees surveyed believe they're paid fairly.

The average hourly pay for a Sam's Club employee ranges from $10.50 to nearly $22. I think the big difference is this: Only 54% of Sam's Club employees believe they're paid fairly.

The older I get the more I gravitate toward companies that treat employees well. I don't know enough about Sam's Club to say its employees aren't treated well but I like shopping at a store that tends to make its employees happy.

With time it's possible that Sam's Club will once again become my warehouse store of choice. In the meantime I'm taking advantage of the savings and healthier options available at Costco.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1hc2hlZC5jb20vOTc0NDcxL3RoZS1tb2xkeS1jb3N0Y28tbWVhdC1zdGljay10aGF0LWhhcy1yZWRkaXQtaG9ycmlmaWVkL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,The Moldy Costco Meat Stick That Has Reddit Horrified,"The Moldy Costco Meat Stick That Has Reddit Horrified

We're all used to searching for the best deals in grocery stores rummaging through aisles to find anything that will save a few cents. But perhaps we should be looking more closely at the quality of the goods we're purchasing — you only get what you pay for after all.

A particularly important place to start keeping an eye on the condition of items would seem to be Costco after Reddit started to raise alarm bells about mold being found on food. The social media site has also taken aim at meat sticks sold at Costco following a complaint from a user about mold.

User Fit-Seaworthiness712 uploaded a photo to Reddit showing what is believed to be a Chomps meat stick with a bulbous white mold growing in the middle. According to Chomps Original Beef Jerky Sticks cost $22.50 for 10 and are ""guaranteed to make a mouth-watering snack experience."" Eye-watering may have been a better description in this case. Redditors aren't happy that the moldy stick was allowed to be sold and are offering advice on what the purchaser should do next.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRhaWx5bWFpbC5jby51ay9uZXdzL2FydGljbGUtMTExNTM2MDMvQ29zdGNvLXB1dHMtY29mZmlucy11cm5zLXNhbGUtc3RvcmVzLWJhcmJlcXVlcy5odG1s0gFpaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZGFpbHltYWlsLmNvLnVrL25ld3MvYXJ0aWNsZS0xMTE1MzYwMy9hbXAvQ29zdGNvLXB1dHMtY29mZmlucy11cm5zLXNhbGUtc3RvcmVzLWJhcmJlcXVlcy5odG1s?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Costco puts coffins and urns for sale in stores next to barbeques,"Costco has stunned shoppers by putting up cheap coffins and urns for sale in stores next to the barbecues.

One shopper shared a picture to social media after spotting the display at the North Lakes store near Brisbane.

'Appropriately you can view this as a last minute impulse buy at the checkout' the shopper caption the picture.

The company founded in the US is one of the world's biggest retailers and sells wholesale items at low prices for members who pay a yearly fee.

The sombre display at the Queensland Costco store was spotted by a shopper near the barbecues (pictured)

The picture sparked a flurry of comments with some amused and others saying it was in 'awful taste'.

'Economy class the leg room is a bugger' one commenter replied.

'I did a double-take when I spotted them for sale. Not quite what I expected' another added.

'Do they deliver or do you need to drive away with it strapped to your car roof?' a third wrote.

Coffins bought from funeral parlours vary in price but are often several thousand dollars.

The Costco coffins retail from $899.99 while an urn will set customers back $159.99 and their caskets range from $3099.99 up to $1549.99.

The retailer has been selling the items since 2015 in Australia and for years in their American stores.

The display has previously been spotted in Melbourne's Ringwood store.

Tom McEwen has done the double at Land Rover Blair Castle Horse Trials as he took the crown in the CCI4*-L with Luna Mist and the CCI3*-L on Brookfield Cavalier Cruise.

Tom and nine-year-old Luna Mist produced one of only two jumping clears in the final showjumping phase adding just 0.4 of a time-penalty to complete their weekend on 32.3. Oliver Townend produced the other clear round to finish second on eight-year-old Cooley Rosalent. Nini French and Time For Harry knocked the first part of the double at fence seven and had 2.4 time-penalties but held on to third place and finished on 54.8.

Diane Johnson’s track was full of big square oxers and a treble combination at fence five plus an oxer on three strides to a vertical and two strides to another upright proved costly for many. Time was influential once again and while all the horses looked full of running the tight rollbacks caused six of the 10 horse and rider combinations that came forward to the showjumping phase to have time-faults.

“As everyone can see what a horse. She just popped round it – she made it look like nothing” Tom told H&H after his win.

Tom said the course felt “quite easy” with Martin Belsham’s talented mare but he said it was a “proper track”.

“Although it was a small field in a four-star long to me it’s no different to sort of a Bramham. You learn a lot about your horse and they built a proper decent very much up-to-height showjumping track so I found out she was unbelievable really” he said.

Oliver who was second in the CCI4*-S earlier in the day with As Is had to settle for second on Paul Ridgeon’s Cooley Rosalent but he was thrilled with the mare.

“She’s a top class mare and she’s never felt as good never felt as spectacular and she doesn’t know she’s not won the class” Oliver told H&H.

“Most importantly she’s had a very good experience and proved to me she’s as good as I think she is in all three bits and she’ll have a very exciting future. This is just a good result but no one will remember who was second at Blair – you won’t remember her for that. She’s as good as I’ve had in a mare and right up there with all the horses.”

Oliver said Cooley Rosalent will now enjoy a break and come out again next year.

“We’ll see how we go and maybe she’ll have a five-star at some point. It’s more important to keep her happy and good but for me the performance this week means there is nothing to say she shouldn’t go to a five-star” he said.

Blair Castle Horse Trials CCI3*-L

Earlier in the day Tom expertly piloted Brookfield Cavalier Cruise in the CCI3*-L showjumping to finish on his phenomenal 22.9 dressage – winning with two fences to spare.

“You’ve got to enjoy these moments and understand without moving too quickly what amazing horses and what amazing achievements both long horses have had. It’s phenomenal” said Tom.

“They’re two different horses; Brookfield Cavalier Cruise [Fletcher] takes everything in his stride and Luna Mist [Luna] is a true gritty fighter. They’re both amazing but both very different. Luna has fight down to her core and Fletcher literally could take anything in his stride – I’m sure he could be a police horse or he could be winning Badminton. He’s the most fantastic natured horse and I’m very much looking forward to getting to know him more.

Alison Swinburn John and Chloe Perry’s nine-year-old gelding has proved untouchable in his first ever three-star long.

“I thought the three-star was twisty and it sort of changed from a little bit smaller to very big and square so it was a good track” said Tom.

Sam Ecroyd was second with his mother Penelope’s Withington and finished on 31. Wills Oakden was third with his wife Stephanie’s Cooley Pot Of Gold.

“I’ve always really enjoyed jumping here at Blair” Sam told H&H. “I’ve had good rounds every time I’ve come. It feels like a big competition when you’re in there. They build it big but it’s very fair. I think the amount of clears to fault ratio that they had today was very good it’s sort of what you’re after. It rode well like a proper international track.”

Sam said the 11-year-old gelding has been a “tricky enough” horse to produce.

“He’s always had loads of ability. He’s perfectly behaved but it’s just been getting everything aligning in the right direction his concentration with all his power and ability – he found it hard to control all that” he said adding Withington had done “basically nothing” for three years owing to Covid and then Sam being out of action last year as he recovered from a rotational fall in which he suffered multiple injuries.

“He’s probably one of my favourite horses I’ve ever ridden not just the quality he has but in his personality. He’s quite a funny fish. He’s great I really love him and it’s just a pleasure to ride him. He’s really good in all three phases. My plan is to give him a really good break bring him back in the winter and get him really fit and strong for a proper four-star campaign next year.”

There’s also a footbridge which takes you directly inside the ruins where you can see the sturdy walls up close. The castle was built in the 1220s by the 6th Earl of Chester and it was well-maintained until the 16th century.

After being briefly used during the English Civil War it was partly demolished in 1646. Beeston Castle is even home to the deepest castle well in England. It’s reputedly where Richard II’s lost treasure was buried 1399 although it’s never been found.

The site has been occupied since the Bronze Ages and there is a replica Bronze Age Roundhouse located in the grounds. You can learn more about the site’s history at the Castle of the Rock exhibition.

There’s several walking routes to follow through the woodland which surrounds the castle. It’s rich in a variety of wildlife so you may spot foxes rabbits and even peregrine falcons on your walk.

Beeston Castle is operated by English Heritage and it’s open daily from 10am until 5pm. Tickets can be bought online or on the day although it's cheaper to book in advance.

He was the firstborn of Empress Augusta Victoria and Wilhelm II the future German Emperor during that time.

After Emperor Frederick III his grandfather passed away the 6-year-old Wilhelm became the crown prince. He retained this title for over three decades until the empire’s fall on November 5 1918. He was the commander of the 5th Army during World War II from 1914 to 1916.

He was also the Army Group’s commander throughout the war’s remaining years. The crown prince also became the Head of the House of Hohenzollern on June 4 1941 after his father died. He remained in the position until he passed away on July 20 1951.

The Early Life Of Wilhelm German Crown Prince

Wilhelm was born in Brandenburg province specifically in the Marmorpalais of Potsdam on May 6 1882. His father Wilhelm II was the final German Emperor and his mother was Princess Augusta Victoria of Schleswig-Holstein the first wife of his father.

When Wilhelm was born the reigning emperor was his great grandfather Kaiser Wilhelm I. Crown Prince Frederick the grandfather of Wilhelm was the immediate successor to the throne which makes Wilhelm the third one in line.

He was the eldest of the seven children of the Kaiser with his birth sparking an argument between his grandmother and parents. Before Wilhelm’s birth his grandmother had anticipated being asked for help in finding a nurse. However with her son doing his best to rebuff his mother the future Wilhelm II sought the help of his aunt Helena instead.

This hurt his mother and Queen Victoria his grandmother who was the great-grandmother of the younger Wilhelm was furious. After the death of both his grandfather and great grandfather in 1888 the young Wilhelm at the age of 6 became the heir-apparent to the Prussian and German thrones.

Association football was still a new sport back then in the nation but it was already supported by Wilhelm. He even donated a cup in 1908 to the German Football Association. This initiated German football’s oldest cup competition the Kronprinzenpokal currently known as Länderpokal. The original name of BFC Preussen the German club was BFC Friedrich Wilhelm to honor him.

It was in 1914 when the Kaiser commanded the establishment of Potsdam’s Schloss Cecilienhof for Prince Wilhelm together with his whole family. The Bidston Court found in Birkenhead in England somewhat served as an inspiration for the Schloss that resembled a Tudor mansion. The construction was finished in 1917 and for a time it also became the Crown Prince’s main residence.

On June 6 1905 in Berlin Wilhelm tied the knot with Duchess Cecilie of Mecklenburg-Schwerin. Following their marriage the couple resided at the Crown Prince’s Palace located in Berlin during winter as well as at Potsdam’s Marmorpalais. The Duchess was the daughter of the Grand Duchess Anastasia Mikhailovna of Russia and the of Grand Duke Frederick Francis III Grand Duke of Mecklenburg-Schwerin.",,,,,,

According to the court the statute stood in conflict with federal law.

In the wake of the ruling some first responders worry this decision will adversely affect the ability of emergency services to respond to calls jeopardizing efficient response times.

The ruling came down on Aug. 17 in the case of State v. CSX Inc. in which justices decided five to two that federal law preempts enforcement of Section 5589.21 of the Ohio Revised Code. The statute held that railroad companies blocking a crossing with a stopped train for longer than five minutes were guilty of a first-degree misdemeanor and could face a fine of $1000.

Legislation background

The Ohio General Assembly enacted the law on Oct. 27 2000 finding that obstruction of railroad crossings posed a “direct threat to the health safety and welfare of the citizens of this state” according to Revised Code 5589.20.

The recent ruling has been four years in the making. In 2018 law enforcement in Union County charged CSX Transportation with five violations of the statute.

CSX then filed a motion in Marysville Municipal Court to dismiss the charges on the grounds that federal law preempts enforcement of the Ohio statute. Judge James Rapp granted the motion writing that “Congress unambiguously and explicitly chose to preempt what is arguable common sense state regulation while making no direct provision for the safety of the public.”

“[T]he only remedy available to the people of Ohio” Rapp continued “is to direct their concerns to Congress and Federal officials.”

After a series of appeals the matter ended up in the hands of Ohio’s top court which agreed with the judgment in Marysville and granted the ultimate victory to CSX four years later.

However while the Ohio Supreme Court ruled in favor of CSX it was not contested by the justices that blocked railroad crossings pose a threat to public safety and emergency response times. In the lead opinion Justice Sharon Kennedy wrote “We acknowledge the significant danger to the public that is created when stopped trains obstruct the movement of first responders across railroad tracks.”

But as Judge Rapp wrote in the original ruling Justice Kennedy says these safety concerns must be taken to the federal level for regulation.

“However the regulation of railroad transportation is a matter of federal law and the federal government alone has the power to address the threat to public safety caused by blocked crossings” she concluded.

Implications at the local level

With several high-traffic roads in Lima intersecting with railroad crossings such as Cable and Eastown Roads residents of the city are already accustomed to long wait times at the tracks. Local residents might be concerned that the court’s ruling could worsen the congested traffic flow around these and other crossings.

Among those worried are first responders across the state. With the statute unenforceable there is now no recourse available to law enforcement to prevent trains from blocking the tracks or to expedite the process of clearing a crossing when a train is stopped.

A blocked rail crossing could force first responders to find alternate routes to the scene of an accident according to Tom Berger Director of the Allen County EMA. Alternatively a blocked crossing could result in first responders from another jurisdiction on the other side of the tracks being unable to reach the scene in a timely manner.

“It should be a concern for the public if the shortest route possible is not available” Berger said.

Following the ruling Hardin County Sheriff Keith Everhart expressed his dismay on the Sheriff’s Office’s official Facebook page.

“I am very concerned with this ruling as I know many of you are as well. This will adversely impact public safety response in every aspect. I find this to be a very troublesome situation all around” he wrote.

Everhart also shared comments from Seneca County Sheriff Frederick Stevens who expressed that the ruling leaves law enforcement powerless to keep crossings clear.

“This is going to affect not only the regular traffic flow for our county city and village residents but our law enforcement… responses as well. There will no longer be any ‘bite’ to the barking [complaints] when RR crossings are blocked for long periods of time” Stevens said.

When every second counts for first responders the results of these delays could be dire. It would now be in the hands of Congress to decide what if any next steps can be taken for legislation.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiSmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxlZ2FjeS5jb20vdXMvb2JpdHVhcmllcy9uYW1lL2V1Z2VuZS1ib2huLW9iaXR1YXJ5P2lkPTM2MzQ1NjI10gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Eugene Bohn Obituary - Highlands Family-Owned Funeral Home - Louisville - 2022,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.legacy.com/us/obituaries/name/eugene-bohn-obituary?id=36345625 on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiSmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxlZ2FjeS5jb20vdXMvb2JpdHVhcmllcy9uYW1lL2V1Z2VuZS1ib2huLW9iaXR1YXJ5P2lkPTM2MzQ1NjI10gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMif2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5iY21pYW1pLmNvbS9uZXdzL2xvY2FsLzYtaG9zcGl0YWxpemVkLWFmdGVyLXRyaS1yYWlsLXRyYWluLXNsYW1zLWludG8tYWJhbmRvbmVkLXZlaGljbGUtcGFydGlhbGx5LWRlcmFpbHMvMjg0NTI4NC_SAYUBaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cubmJjbWlhbWkuY29tL25ld3MvbG9jYWwvNi1ob3NwaXRhbGl6ZWQtYWZ0ZXItdHJpLXJhaWwtdHJhaW4tc2xhbXMtaW50by1hYmFuZG9uZWQtdmVoaWNsZS1wYXJ0aWFsbHktZGVyYWlscy8yODQ1Mjg0Lz9hbXA9MQ?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,6 Hospitalized After Tri-Rail Train Slams Into Abandoned Vehicle Partially Derails,"The Fort Lauderdale Police Department is investigating a crash Saturday morning after a Tri-Rail train slammed into an abandoned vehicle injuring six people police said.

Yes it’s ubiquitous and often thought of as one of America’s first “cute ute” crossovers but that description doesn’t give it enough credit. These things were reliable practical and their geometry made them fairly decent off-roaders. But despite these positive traits someone in Pennsylvania decided they wanted more so they turned one into a body-on-frame diesel-powered off-road beast.

I’m using this article as an excuse to declare my appreciation for the first and second generation Ford Escapes (the second gen which came out for 2008 was just a facelifted first-gen). Sure they are unibody crossovers with fully independent suspension that doesn’t do the greatest job at keeping the wheels on the ground at all times and they lack a low-range transfer case to get those wheels torque to handle really technical rock crawling but early Escapes did have decent overall geometry.

Ford’s specs say the first-gen model has an approach angle up to ~29 degrees and a departure angle around 22 degrees while the facelifted model has an approach angle somewhere between 19 and 24.5 degrees and a departure angle of over 28 degrees. Looking at the two vehicles it’s surprising that one has a great approach angle and one has a great departure angle but I bet we can attribute this to small parts of the bumpers hang a bit low in the planes that make up the approach and departure angles; the actual body itself and vulnerable hardware all appears to be out of the way of danger. The overhangs are short.

This is important because when it comes to off-roading geometry is king. Just watch this Escape equipped with what appear to be slightly oversized tires navigate this downhill grade:

Anyway it may not be a hardcore off-road vehicle but I’ve always liked the way it looks and with short nose and butt I’ve always thought the body would make for a great off-road platform if only one could get a real transfer case in there and some solid axles for a bit more articulation. Well apparently I’m not the only one who’s had these thoughts because look at this madness:

Check out that absurd ground clearance and how it meshes with the Escape’s short wheelbase and short overhangs to yield humongous approach departure and breakover angles. Plus behold the solid axles held to a real frame via a long-arm suspension; this thing must flex for days!

And if you look closely between the frame rails you can see a real transfer case:

Finally the Escape whose geometry I’ve always thought had so much off-road potential gets the drivetrain and suspension it deserves.

As for the powertrain under the hood replacing the excellent Duratec 25 (which is based on the Mazda MZR 2.5-liter engine — a genuinely reliable engine) is what appears to be a Cummins 4BT turbodiesel:

With probably somewhere around 105 horsepower and 265 lb-ft of torque the thing won’t be quick but it should be a monster off-road especially with the proper gearing; plus it should score decent fuel economy and never die.

I wish I had a bit more info on this machine (I’d love to know how they mated the frame to the unibody. I see one mount that appears to go to the Escape’s main unibody rail. How’d the builder get to the inside of the rail? Did they utilize the subframe mounts as well?). For now all I know is what I have from the photographer Pete Matesevac who told me he spotted the vehicle at a car show in Pennsylvania.

“The photos were taken at the monthly Motor Menders Cruise Night at a place called the Markets of Shrewsbury which is conveniently about halfway between Harrisburg PA and Baltimore MD” he told me over Facebook Messenger. “It is not unusual to have 1000+ cars here every month and everything from traditional muscle cars to exotics to weird little British stuff.”

Matesevac a Chevrolet S10 enthusiast who runs the pages “Pete’s S10 Page” told me it’s normal to see wild custom cars at the event but that this Escape stood out to him. “I’m watching all the classic hot rods trucks and customs coming in and then I see a Ford Escape which already has me scratching my head because it’s sitting really high” he told me. “Then I can hear it drive by with the unmistakable sound of a diesel. As it passes by I see a very glossy frame and a solid axle neither of which should exist.”

Strangely nobody was looking at the masterpiece. “I was surprised that I was the only person at that moment because everything was done very well. This looked like a high end shop built it. All the hardware looked fresh all the metal looked freshly painted. It had an AC compressor with a belt. It looked well executed and complete” he continued. “This definitely wasn’t a couple drinking buddies hacking up a nasty Escape the Ford itself was in nice shape.”

Incredible. I must see what this thing can do off-road.

A big welcome back to Young Men’s Progressive Club (YMPC)!

For the first time since they were demoted after the 2011 season Bayview Hospital YMPC have returned to the Barbados Cricket Association (BCA) Elite division Championship which started last Saturday.

The promotion and relegation system was introduced in 2009 and three years later the old First division was rebranded as Elite with ten teams.

YMPC’s return to the top division follows their capture of the First division Championship in 2019. There were no ‘league’ competitions in 2020 and 2021 because of the Covid pandemic.

Founded in 1934 the Beckles Road club won their first major title in 1988. They shared the 1991 Championship with Empire and won one more title in 2006.

This column features the 1988 season which will long be remembered as arguably the wettest since the turn of the 1980s.

In a rain-hit last round against Spartan at Queen’s Park chasing 82 to win YMPC dramatically triumphed by one wicket in rapidly fading light.

Rain affected the season to such an extent that there were only 11 outright victories and as many as 13 no results.

Of those wins YMPC under a new captain in batsman Stephen Lorde – he replaced left-arm spinner Winston Reid after a wretched 1987 season in which YMPC lost five matches and finished second last – had three and second-placed and dethroned champions Police two.

And YMPC’s 36 points – three more than Police – were the least for a team lifting the Championship in the decade.

Police led for the first time by all-rounder Dave “Chief” Cumberbatch a left-arm spinner and right-hand batsman (Cumberbatch was a former Barbados Youth team captain and West Indies Under-19 team player who also played at the first-class level for Barbados) were the only team to register a win in the opening round soundly beating Maple by nine wickets at Weymouth.

Pickwick briefly took over the lead after Series 3 when they defeated Spartan by 56 runs at Kensington Oval before Police returned to the top jointly with four other teams – Pickwick YMPC BCL and Carlton – on 13 points at the end of the fourth round.

Then Police led alone from Series 5 right down to the penultimate round when the Points table showed five teams with a chance of silverware – Police 30 YMPC 28 Empire 27 Maple 24 and St. Catherine 23.

Therefore in the final round the matches which mattered were: Police v Empire at Weymouth Spartan v YMPC at Queen’s Park and Maple v St. Catherine at Trents.

Rain again played a telling part and there was only one outright result.

At Queen’s Park there was no play on the first day and after losing the toss on Day 2 Spartan batting with two players short in Wayne Alleyne and Donovan Lovell were fired out for 40 off 16.4 overs on a slow pitch and a heavily-grassed wet outfield.

The only batsman to reach double-figures was Ezra Moseley with 27 at No. 6.

Moseley was one of four players in the Spartan team at the time with first-class experience – the others were Franklyn Stephenson Henderson Springer and captain George Linton. Two others in the side – Livingstone Puckerin made his first-class debut the next year and Ottis Gibson followed a couple seasons later.

YMPC used three bowlers in the first innings – all pacers. Improving all-rounder Anderson Cummins who batted as high as No. 3 for most of the season took three for nine Charles “Max Walker” Alleyne three for 25 and Wendell Coppin two for four.

With time of essence YMPC then scored 49 for three declared off 18.1 overs.

Cummins used as an opener made 33 before he was run out having added 42 for the first wicket with Roy Coppin (12).

Off-spinner Springer took two for three off two overs.

By the close of play Spartan were reeling on 25 for five off 19.4 overs in the second innings – just 16 runs ahead.

They lost two early wickets on the final day and were 35 for seven before Moseley and Springer added 32. The partnership was broken by Cummins who had Moseley leg before wicket co-incidentally again for the top-score of 27.

Spartan rallied to 90 all out off as many as 60 overs their effort helped by a last wicket stand of 23 between Springer (14 not out) and Lovell (13).

Wendell Coppin took three for 12 off 14 overs Cummins three for 28 off 13 overs and Reid three for 32 off 24 overs.

In their victory chase YMPC lost their first two wickets with only seven runs on the board. They were revived by Cummins again as an opener and left-hander Peter Sealy who put on 43 for the third wicket before a collapse set in.

At 77 for nine everyone was on edge when No. 9 William Bourne a former first-class pacer for Barbados and Warwickshire in the English County Championship was joined by Alleyne.

Following a couple blunders in the field YMPC squeezed home in 25.1 overs with a bye off the first ball of the very last over of the match from fast bowler Moseley to spark wild celebrations.

Mark Estwick then the YMPC vice-captain and wicket-keeper described the drama which unfolded.

“It was not easy. We were up against a star-studded Spartan team including the likes of Franklyn Stephenson Ezra Moseley George Linton Henderson Springer Ottis Gibson Livingstone Puckerin Feliston Gilkes Roy Alleyne and Ronnie Griffith” Estwick said.

“In our victory chase of 82 in roughly 25 overs including the mandatory 15 overs in the last hour we collapsed from 50 for two to 77 for nine as panic set in. Needing five from the second last over bowled by Stephenson the first ball was played by “Max Walker” straight back up the pitch. Inexplicably the batsmen ran through for an improbable single. Stephenson swiftly gathered the ball and threw at the striker’s end but missed the stumps with William Bourne still in mid-pitch” Estwick recalled.

“The next four balls were dots as Bourne swung mightily without connecting. Then with the light rapidly fading Bourne managed to connect a drive limply off the bottom of the bat to deep cover where it managed somehow to slip through the legs of Ronnie Griffith and into the boundary. A bye was then scampered off the first ball from Moseley.

“It was an absolutely amazing and emotional moment for us. We partied the entire night after leaving Queen’s Park around 10 o’ clock.”

Left-hander Thelston Payne the St. Catherine stalwart who played in the maximum 11 matches amassed the most runs (610) from 15 innings including three not outs and also boasted of the best average (50.83).

Payne and the Pickwick off-spinning all-rounder Joseph Harris each hit two centuries of 15 all told.

Payne slammed a career-best 203 not out against Banks at Bayfield in the fourth round and an unbeaten 154 off Police at Weymouth in Series 2 while India-born Harris made 107 v YMPC at Kensington Oval (Series 1) and 132 v Police at Weymouth (Series 4).

The Empire pair of Roland Holder (556; ave: 46.33) and skipper Carlisle Best (535; ave: 38.21) were the only other batsmen to score over 500 runs.

Emmerson Jordan the Maple captain and fast bowler was the sole bowler to take 50 wickets (ave: 10.68).

And there was a uniqueness about Jordan’s performance in that he was the only bowler as well to send down more than 200 overs (201.4) the most maidens (47) while conceding the most runs (534).

Jordan had a best haul of seven for 33 in the first innings against Carlton at Black Rock (now Desmond Haynes Oval) in the 10th round – match figures of 10 for 74 – in a 26-run win.

To boot he had the honour of grabbing a hat-trick in figures of five for 12 against St. Catherine.

His performance at the age of 29 led to a first-class debut the following year.

Anderson Cummins took the second most wickets – 45 – at 10.33 runs each.

Emmerson King of Empire was the top wicket-keeper with 30 victims (26 catches and four stumpings) while Pickwick’s Clinton St. Hill showed his consistently high standard in the field by taking the most catches (16).

Significantly eight of 17 players who represented YMPC that season resided within a couple miles of each other in the southern parish of Christ Church. They were: Wendell Coppin (Lead Vale) his cousin Roy Coppin and David Holder (Waldron Village) Anderson Cummins (Packers) (he is another cousin of Wendell Coppin) Peter Sealy (St. Patrick’s) Malcolm Powlett (Fairview) DeCoursey Eversley (Charnocks) and Alwin Callender (Pilgrim Place ‘B’).

YMPC team (with matches in brackets) – Stephen Lorde (captain 9) Anderson Cummins Roy Coppin Peter Sealy Mark Estwick Winston Reid Charles Alleyne (11) David Holder (9) Jeffrey Butcher (8) Malcolm Powlett (6) Keith Seale (5) William Bourne Andrew Ince (4) DeCoursey Eversley Wendell Coppin Alwin Callender (3) Cliff Cudjoe (2).

Her cropped black tank top showed off her abs and paired with low rise black pants that draped in loose waves around her legs as she walked.

The Academy Award winning actress paired the outfit with chunky black sandals and accessorized with an ICARE quilted tote by Yves Saint Laurent made of lambskin and detailed with gold chains. She had on a large pair of sunglasses and some simple gold jewelry around her neck and in her ears. Her hair was parted to the side and left hanging down.

Jolie seemed relaxed though recent weeks have involved quite a few challenges as details of her ex-husband Brad Pitt's behavior that led to their separation were released. A report from the FBI was made public after the actress applied for the info using a pseudonym under the Freedom of Information Act. The couple split in 2016 after the incident which took place aboard their private jet. Allegedly he criticized one of their children and told Jolie she was “ruining the family” during their heated argument which escalated to a physical fight. The former couple share six children daughter Shiloh 16 twins Knox and Vivienne 14 daughter Zahara 17 and sons Maddox 21 and Pax 18. Pitt supposedly was targeting Maddox during the altercation.

Jolie filed for divorce just four days later after a five year marriage and they have since been battling for custody though they have been legally single since 2019. She is currently working on a new project directing an adaptation Alessandro Baricco’s short novel Without Blood. The film stars Salma Hayek as a woman who witnessed horrific violence and war crimes and plays on themes of revenge and forgiveness according to the director.

“The reality of these never-ending wars we have has helped me to look at violence and trauma and revenge in very different ways and there is no easy answer” she told Variety.

Yet the rap legend reveals that his first interaction with Dr. Dre was one in which he failed to rise to the occasion admitting that he “froze up” when given the initial opportunity to rap for Dre.

“He [Dr. Dre] came over one Thanksgiving and Warren G had me nervous because he was telling Dre ‘Snoopy can rap’” Snoop recalled during an appearance on the Checc’N-In Podcast with Big U. “And I was like man shut the f**k up I ain’t ready yet.”

More from VIBE.com

Snoop also recalls hearing the instrumental for Eazy-E’s 1988 hit “Eazy-Duz-It” before its release. Dre offered him a chance to showcase his skills by rapping over the beat. “So Dre takes us to the back room and he starts playing that ‘He once was a thug from around the way’ before it had even come out” he continued. “He [Dr. Dre] turned to me and was like ‘you rap?’ And I’m like ‘nah I don’t rap!’ That was my moment and I froze up on cuz. I wasn’t ready.”

Fortunately Snoop would eventually get the courage to perform in front of Dre who first featured him on the 1992 soundtrack single “Deep Cover” then on Dre’s solo debut The Chronic and the rest is history.

Snoop recently confirmed that he and Dre are currently working on music together but has not specified in what capacity or when listeners can expect to hear the finished product. “We’re cooking up a little something” Snoop said earlier this month. “I don’t wanna talk about it too much but we’re back together again.”

McKinney played three years of college football at the University of Alabama under head coach Nick Saban. During his three seasons there Alabama lost a total of four games.

Then McKinney was a second-round pick by the Giants in 2020 and everything changed. There hasn’t been a whole lot of winning in East Rutherford and the 24-year-old is getting a bit impatient.

“[I’m getting] pretty impatient. I try not to think too much about it because it’s a new year and obviously we’ve got to focus on what’s here” McKinney told reporters this week. “We had to go through those rough times and we went through all of that losing. For me I’m ready to get back out there I’m ready to win games but I think that starts with the stuff we do out here in practice the stuff that you guys see.

“It starts with the things that we do in the film room; it starts with what we do in the weight room. All the little things matter. That’s what I’ve noticed that’s what it’s always been. That’s the difference between winning and losing — the little things. I think we’ve done a great job of taking care of that and I think the rest will take care of itself.”

McKinney missed most of the 2020 season with a fractured foot but in the 23 games he’s appeared he’s recorded 112 tackles (68 solo) six passes defended six interceptions and a touchdown.

At 6-foot and 201 pounds McKinney isn’t the biggest guy on the field but he’s proven that he is capable of doing his job. Now if the rest of the team can get healthy the Giants might actually have a chance.

In a state where 80 percent of businesses are family-owned that’s a lot of legacy to preserve. But when there’s no one left to take over many establishments must either sell or shutter.

It’s happened at Maine’s biggest companies. In 2015 L.L. Bean named Stephen Smith its first CEO who wasn’t either family or someone who’d been there for years. Dead River and Getchell Brothers Ice were sold to out-of-state interests in December.

Legacy businesses have survived various economic ups and downs and now are battling back from a worldwide pandemic. Statewide employee shortages have some looking to lure foreign workers or seeking government help. But for two Presque Isle business owners the key is trying to keep afloat what local families spent decades building.

Having an exit strategy is important but only 13 percent of family businesses have one according to the Institute for Family-Owned Business a Maine nonprofit organization. The chance a business will pass from the second to third generation is only 13 percent.

When Alden and Pat Rathbun were ready to retire in 2016 no family members were there to take over 70-year-old Rathbun Lumber which Alden’s father founded. Then-manager Jamie McLaughlin had no desire to close the store he’d worked in for 16 years so he bought it.

In December months after second-generation owner Lionel Theriault died his family decided to sell Theriault Equipment. The John Deere dealer had been in business for 63 years and also owned Harvest Equipment in Vermont. The buyer: United Ag & Turf Northeast led by a former Harvest owner.

Scott Miller

“I can see all the trepidation that comes through with the selling process. People tell me about the concrete floor they poured back in the 1940s” said Scott Miller president of United Ag & Turf Northeast.

Miller has helped oversee the purchases of 17 equipment dealers from New York to Maine — and has dealt with the emotions that accompany each family’s decision to sell.

It’s hard for family members to walk into a place that was once their own and know that it’s different he said. And when families want out or can’t afford to keep going they face letting their legacy die.

“That’s really what we’re trying to prevent is businesses dying” Miller said. “[It’s] succession planning. As owners are looking to retire or sell how does this business stay open and serve the community?”

Miller has spent a lot of time in Presque Isle which he called the heart of Aroostook County. He started out sweeping floors at a John Deere dealership in Vermont and later started Harvest Equipment with his business partner. By 2012 they decided to sell and enjoyed a solid relationship with the Theriault firm.

The deal has now come full circle. More than anything Miller’s company wants business to continue as usual and retain all the employees who aren’t ready to retire.

Because he’s been on both ends of the spectrum he knows the struggles. And no matter how it’s handled the transition from one owner to the next is difficult.

“We do our best to make sure that [things are] communicated well but change is change and that’s the hard part we have to recognize” Miller said.

Like Miller McLaughlin was familiar with the company he took over because he had worked there so many years three of those as manager. So when the Rathbuns talked about retiring he had a plan.

“I didn’t want to see it go away. They were at retirement age and wanted to sell. It was a right time right place thing really” McLaughlin said.

The family was happy to know who the buyer was. And because he knew the business and the community knew him there weren’t many roadblocks to a successful transition.

One of the first things he undertook was remodeling the store and increasing product lines to keep pace with what customers were seeking.

But since COVID-19 the real challenges have been the increased costs of materials supply chain delays and — more than anything — finding enough people to work. Rathbun has lost some longtime employees to retirement but that was expected McLaughlin said.

Now he just wants to keep a full staff of seven.

“We sold ourselves on service. We’re the small guy so that’s how you win” he said. “That’s been a huge challenge with the lack of help but we’re all in the same boat.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFncmlsYW5kLmNvLnVrL2Zhcm1pbmctbmV3cy9qb2huLWRlZXJlLWFubm91bmNlcy1kZWFsZXItY2hhbmdlcy1pbi1saW5jb2xuc2hpcmUv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,John Deere announces dealer changes in Lincolnshire,"Long-standing John Deere dealer JW Doubleday is to be sold to Ben Burgess in line with the manufacturer’s Dealer of Tomorrow strategy.

Doubleday has sold John Deere’s agricultural machinery for more than 40 years – an anniversary marked in June 2022 – but an agreement has been reached with Ben Burgess to transfer all staff and sites with a completion date expected before the end of October.

The deal will see Ben Burgess which has been a John Deere dealer since 1964 expand into Lincolnshire for the first time adding four more sites to its existing seven.

It will take over the sites at Holbeach Old Leake and Swineshead in Lincolnshire as well as increasing its footprint in Norfolk with Doubleday’s depot at Kings Lynn.

It means that from November Ben Burgess will serve farmers and contractors in Norfolk Suffolk Cambridgeshire Northamptonshire Leicestershire Lincolnshire and Rutland.

John Deere Limited divisional business manager Joedy Ibbotson said: “I would like to express our gratitude to the Doubleday-Collishaw family for what they have done supporting and growing the John Deere brand since becoming a dealer.

“The agreement with Ben Burgess – which ensures the continuity of the Doubleday team and dealership outlets within the John Deere network – is great news as it brings together two outstanding dealerships both with a long history of representing John Deere.

“The two businesses are closely aligned. Both have a strong culture of customer support helping customers embed John Deere’s products and cutting-edge technological innovations into their farming operations.”

Ben Turner director at Ben Burgess said: “We are delighted to be able to confirm the agreement that has been reached with the Doubleday group which has an enviable reputation for being a strong successful and customer-centric business for 50 years.

“Farmers and contractors in Lincolnshire and Norfolk have been served fantastically by the group’s talented staff and we are privileged to be taking on the outstanding legacy the Doubleday dealerships have built in the territory.

“We are both family businesses and share the same values. We will uphold our high standards for sales and service moving into the future.

“Both groups are committed to business continuity as usual for customers and staff while the deal is completed.”",,,

The agreement with Delta’s Propel program the airline’s pilot-career pathway was finalized earlier this month and comes seven months after Skyborne announced a new partnership with United Airlines’ Aviate program.

Skyborne also has established partnerships with: SkyWest Airlines the nation’s largest regional carrier; Endeavor Air which operates as a Delta Connection; and Envoy Air a wholly owned subsidiary of American Airlines and formerly known as American Eagle Airlines.

In addition the academy has agreements to train pilots for two charter airlines.

“It’s certainly good for business” Ed Davidson managing director of Skyborne’s Vero Beach flight school said of the partnerships. “It increases our top-line revenues and it’s always nice to have those relationships especially at a time when airlines need more pilots.

“Delta is a great addition to our stable” he said.

Delta’s Propel program launched in 2018 to identify select and develop the next generation of pilots is designed to take candidates through to their commercial and certified flight instructor ratings on their path to becoming a first officer.

According to a statement from Delta Propel is a highly selective program that provides current Delta employees who have worked for the company for at least three years with a transition opportunity and the support to pursue a career as a commercial airline pilot.

To qualify candidates must have a private pilot’s license and at least 100 hours of flight time.

Only a select few are chosen each year. They are then given a defined path timeline to become a Delta pilot and five-year leave of absence to complete their training.

After being trained by Skyborne and working no more than 42 months at a Delta Connection carrier Propel participants may transition to a pilot position at Delta Airlines.

“This program will allow Delta to continue to invest in its people tapping into their passion for aviation and the strength of the Delta culture” the company’s statement reads.

Davidson said Propel candidates can expect to spend 30 to 40 weeks at the academy where they’ll train in single-engine Piper Warrior aircraft.

“Every aspect of our training is designed to prepare cadets for airline operations in terms of core knowledge and decision making flight deck procedures and professionalism” Davidson said.

Apparently Skyborne’s global reach and commitment to filling the cockpits of major commercial carriers has drawn the attention of industry leaders.

“Skyborne has the level of professionalism and training rigor we look for in our flight school partners” Delta Propel program manager Kelvin Mason said.

While the Skyborne flight training remains the same the programs offered by each airline is different Davidson said adding that some carriers pay for cadet training and others make conditional job offers.

He said he expects the academy to have as many as 200 candidates on campus by the middle of next year and 300 by the end of 2023.

“We’ve been progressing at a pretty good rate” Davidson said.

Earlier this year after the academy’s agreement with United was announced Skyborne Chief Executive Officer Lee Woodward said the partnerships with major carriers produced a “significant rise in applications.”

Skyborne which was founded at the Gloucestershire Airport in the United Kingdom in 2018 has quickly earned an international reputation as one of the most respected commercial-pilot training schools in the industry.

Skyborne purchased Flight Safety Academy in Vero Beach in May 2021.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiR2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNhY2JlZS5jb20vbmV3cy9uYXRpb24td29ybGQvbmF0aW9uYWwvYXJ0aWNsZTI2NTAxNDI3NC5odG1s0gFHaHR0cHM6Ly9hbXAuc2FjYmVlLmNvbS9uZXdzL25hdGlvbi13b3JsZC9uYXRpb25hbC9hcnRpY2xlMjY1MDE0Mjc0Lmh0bWw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Three injured by turbulence on airline flight to Utah officials say. ‘We just dropped’,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='www.sacbee.com', port=443): Read timed out.

Veteran short seller Jim Chanos has a new target in his sight: the humble data centre.

In June Chanos — who won big bets on the downfall of US energy group Enron and the German payments company Wirecard — announced that his eponymous investment firm is raising several hundred million dollars for a fund that will take short positions in US-listed data centre groups.

He argues that the move towards the cloud predominantly driven by Big Tech groups such as Microsoft Amazon and Google is the “enemy” of bricks-and-mortar real estate investment trusts such as Equinix and Digital Realty.

These players buy large swaths of land build vast complexes source major energy contracts and allow companies to lease space in their centres to process their data.

The Big Tech groups by contrast utilise their own equipment and process clients’ data for them in the “public cloud”. Dubbed “hyperscalers” they either store their hardware and server equipment in real estate investment trusts such as Equinix — or increasingly build their own supersized centres to meet ballooning demand for their services. One Microsoft data centre in Chicago spans 700000 sq ft the size of 52 Olympic swimming pools.

Chanos who has also been hurt by a longstanding bet against Tesla believes the tech behemoths which he says account for around two-thirds of data centre demand will increasingly move towards building and running their own real estate. He argues they will do this because the technology used by legacy groups is becoming old and redundant and because cash-rich Big Tech groups can build more cheaply. This will render the independent real estate investment trusts redundant.

But other investors argue the data centre and specialist operators have life in them yet. Nathan Luckey senior managing director of digital infrastructure at Macquarie Asset Management who has spearheaded several recent investments in data centre assets said the best companies are those sitting on prime real estate in strategic locations.

“Hyperscalers are looking for trusted partners where they can house more and more compute power” he argued. “If there is someone who already has land and a property in a market they want to expand into that’s a very relevant factor.”

Billions of dollars in private equity capital have poured into the industry with bulls arguing that traditional data centre groups will remain indispensable given their strong position in top locations and expertise in procuring resources such as power land and labour. They also cite their privileged position as so-called “carrier hotels” an industry term meaning they connect lots of different businesses.

These groups and their PE cheerleaders are wagering that data demand will continue to grow and a wide range of customers — from cloud service providers to banks and government departments — will continue to store at least some of their workloads in traditional data centres.

Last year the world’s biggest private equity firm Blackstone acquired Kansas-headquartered QTS Realty Trust for $10bn while KKR and GI Partners purchased Texas-based CyrusOne for $15bn. Earlier this month Macquarie bought a significant minority stake in British data centre provider Virtus for an undisclosed sum betting that Big Tech groups will be forced to lease as they expand into Europe.

Chanos derided these transactions as “rash” with valuations that were “stretched by any measure” and predicted a “post-takeover hangover” in a presentation.

Cloud business has been the engine of growth for groups such as Amazon Microsoft and Google over the past year. In the first quarter of 2022 Amazon Web Services’ revenue was up 37 per cent year on year to $18.4bn while revenue at Microsoft’s Azure platform increased by 40 per cent.

“The compute workloads for Google and Meta are just unimaginable” said Martijn Blanken chief executive of EXA Infrastructure which supplies networking infrastructure for the hyperscalers. “It’s a scale game and there’s no enterprise that can compete with them.”

By contrast listed US data centre groups have posted healthy — but less impressive — growth. Yet those in the data centre industry argue Chanos’s thesis is dated given that the same arguments have emerged several times over the past 15 years including a highly publicised short position taken against Digital Realty by Highfields Capital Management in 2013. Highfields made money but Digital Realty is still in business.

“There’s a fallacy in the argument that we’re not growing as fast as the cloud providers which means we are threatened by them” said Andy Power president and chief financial officer at Digital Realty. He added that “co-location” groups such as Digital Realty — where one party provides the real estate and customers provide the tech — “enable” the transition to the cloud and have seen an increase in leasing from many hyperscalers in recent years rather than a dip.

Tech groups have made a noticeable shift towards greater leasing over the past six months driven by a handful of key companies including Meta Microsoft ByteDance and Twitter. This uptick has reversed a previous trend towards greater in-house construction.

“I don’t think [hyperscalers] can keep up with the pace of their business on their own” said Charles Meyers chief executive officer of Equinix.

Power added: “These cloud service providers are blessed with lots of capital yes but they have better uses for it honestly.”

Brendan Lynch an analyst at Barclays pointed out that in many metropolitan areas of the US Equinix is the first- or second-largest data centre provider giving the company a higher degree of pricing power. “That’s why we still like Equinix even though we realise there are some risks to our thesis” he said.

One key risk is that should the land labour and energy supply crunches ease Big Tech groups may shift to constructing more of their own data centres.

For independent operators to maintain their appeal differentiation is key argue analysts. Most big businesses use a suite of different services from Gmail to Workday all hosted on different clouds. For all of these software applications to run smoothly together there need to be physical locations where data can pass quickly and seamlessly from one to the other.

Equinix’s “secret sauce” is this networking capability according to Meyers given it is nearly impossible for hyperscalers to replicate.

“Cloud service providers have spent billions building their own data centres” said Nick Del Deo an analyst at MoffettNathanson. “They have not spent a single dollar trying to replicate what Equinix has built.”

So-called “interconnection” constitutes around 35 per cent of Equinix’s earnings as compared to 14 per cent of Digital Realty’s according to MoffettNathanson calculations — though the latter has sought to expand in this market.

By contrast Digital Realty along with private groups CyrusOne and CloudHQ have focused heavily on the bricks-and-mortar business. This segment is more vulnerable to increased competition from the big cloud service providers as well as smaller data centre groups that are being pumped with billions of capital from private equity firms and infrastructure investment funds.

“I do think there may be a glut at some point because everyone and their uncle is building data centres at the moment” said David Friend chief executive of Wasabi a cloud storage company that leases from several data centre groups. “Right now there is an undersupply but it’s going to be like oil prices: everyone is going to drill drill drill — and then it will force prices down until there’s greater consolidation in the market.”

Honestly Sam's Club and Costco have always struck me as interchangeable. Historically I would join whichever happened to be closer to my house. And while convenience is important I recently decided to drive a bit farther down the road to get to Costco. I allowed my Sam's Club membership to expire and became a Costco member. Here's why.

1. Less time spent mulling around

I do not enjoy SIRL (shopping in real life). For me a trip to a store means ""get in get out and get home to put things away."" From my experience Costco shopping takes less time and I recently learned why: Costco carries fewer products than Sam's Club.

SKU stands for stock-keeping units representing how many different items a store carries. According to a great blog called Frugal Rules Costco has around 4000 SKUs while Sam's Club carries between 6000 to 7000 SKUs.

If you're someone who enjoys a leisurely stroll through a big box store to discover what's new Sam's may be a better fit for you. Costco works for me as someone who loathes spending more time than necessary shopping.

2. Better deals

Simply put I spend less at Costco even though I pick up the same number of basics. While the difference isn't significant it's enough to remind me that Costco's overall prices tend to be lower. Every dollar counts.

Say I pick up items at Costco once a week saving $5 each trip. If I were to invest that $5 in a product with an average annual return of 7% it would be worth nearly $3500 in 10 years. While $3500 won't make me rich it's money that can be reinvested or plump up my emergency savings account.

3. A preference for Kirkland

One reason warehouse stores can afford to keep prices low is that they carry fewer name-brand products than traditional stores. For example Sam's (and its parent company Walmart) carries Member's Mark. Costco carries the Kirkland brand. From pain relievers to coffee I prefer Kirkland.

Quick caveat: One exception is Member's Mark honey roasted peanuts. Never have I experienced a better-tasting honey-roasted nut. In fact I've been known to make a trip to Walmart or Sam's just to pick up peanuts.

4. Healthier options

I sometimes long for the days when I could pick up groceries without worrying about how many preservatives were in a package. Today it's always on my mind. I don't always eat healthily but I find myself trying to more often than not. And that means stocking up on healthy options.

In my observation Costco makes eating healthy simpler than Sam's Club. This may be due to Costco carrying fewer items but the store also appears to carry higher-quality food. I find it easier to find organic cage-free preservative-free options at Costco.

Don't get me wrong; I can't go into a warehouse store without buying dark chocolate-covered pretzels. Still I'd prefer to have healthier food options in the house too.

5. General vibe

I may be imagining it but Costco always feels slightly less oppressive to me than Sam's Club. That may have to do with other factors like how crowded the store is how much shopping I have to do and whether anyone with me is prone to wandering off. Still I like the vibe in Costco more.

I also appreciate that Costco pays its employees more than Sam's Club pays its employees. According to Indeed.com the hourly wage for Costco employees ranges from $13 to just shy of $39. More importantly 83% of Costco employees surveyed believe they're paid fairly.

The average hourly pay for a Sam's Club employee ranges from $10.50 to nearly $22. I think the big difference is this: Only 54% of Sam's Club employees believe they're paid fairly.

The older I get the more I gravitate toward companies that treat employees well. I don't know enough about Sam's Club to say its employees aren't treated well but I like shopping at a store that tends to make its employees happy.

With time it's possible that Sam's Club will once again become my warehouse store of choice. In the meantime I'm taking advantage of the savings and healthier options available at Costco.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNjbXAuY29tL3lwL2Rpc2NvdmVyL2xpZmVzdHlsZS9hcnRpY2xlLzMxOTAyNjMvbGVzc29ucy1saWZlLWFuZC1kZWF0aC1ob25nLWtvbmctZnVuZXJhbC1kaXJlY3RvctIBbGh0dHBzOi8vYW1wLnNjbXAuY29tL3lwL2Rpc2NvdmVyL2xpZmVzdHlsZS9hcnRpY2xlLzMxOTAyNjMvbGVzc29ucy1saWZlLWFuZC1kZWF0aC1ob25nLWtvbmctZnVuZXJhbC1kaXJlY3Rvcg?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Lessons in life and death with a Hong Kong funeral director,"As a funeral planner Chen Pui-hing is no stranger to death. Still when his maternal grandfather recently passed away his bereavement caught him off guard.

“It was a weird feeling” the 29-year-old said. “But what worried me most was my mother. She was devastated.

I was trying to comfort her while she grieved.”

“Even adults feel like orphans when they lose their parents” he said.

Grief and loss cause mental wounds that no one sees but with time and support they too will heal

In addition to planning funerals at Wing Fook Funeral House in Hung Hom Chen is also a co-founder of the youth organisation HobbyHK where he teaches people about life and death.

He found his calling in secondary school after watching the 2008 Japanese film Departures which tells the story of an unemployed cellist who takes a job at a funeral home.

Deeply moved by the film Chen devoted himself to the after-death service industry in 2019 after graduating with a degree in philosophy from Lingnan University.

Initially his parents didn’t support his decision as they wanted him to pursue a more prosperous career.

“I think it is a meaningful job. I want to help the deceased and their families by planning the funeral wholeheartedly with a human touch” said the undertaker.

Working as a funeral director includes many daunting tasks from picking up death certificates to transporting the body and arranging the details of the funeral. He also provides make-up and dying-at-home services visiting the home of a person who will soon pass away to discuss what kind of funeral service they want.

“It is stressful. You have to make sure nothing goes wrong since everyone only has one funeral” he said explaining that it usually takes two weeks to plan a service.

About 50000 people die every year in Hong Kong. The Covid-19 pandemic has claimed over 9000 lives in the city so far – an extra blow to the healthcare system and the after-death industry.

What is ambiguous loss? How to handle grief that can’t end

During the city’s devastating fifth wave Chen observed a surging demand for funeral services. At its peak he dealt with as many as 10 cases per month. The overwhelming workload and pressure even made his hair start falling out.

“I feel like I am offering ‘disaster relief’. The pandemic has brought death to the forefront and for some young people it was their first time handling the loss of a family or friend” the undertaker noted.

Even though he has witnessed countless farewells at funerals Chen said that death and grief still touched his heart especially when the deceased was a young person.

“It’s different from dying of old age. You don’t expect people to leave the world when they’re so young” he said. “The grief of those left behind is so much heavier because they weren’t prepared for the loss.”

Day of the Dead celebrations help change Hong Kong teens’ perception of death

A funeral can help the families of the deceased handle their pain and regret. Chen recalled a case of a woman whose younger brother died suddenly at the age of 24. To honour the brother and his memory he helped the family create a mini exhibition at the funeral hall to showcase the deceased’s artwork. In doing so his family and friends could release their emotions and grieve.

“It helps shift their focus from the suffering of death to the love that the person has left behind and encourages them to carry on living” he shared. “Every family has a different way of coping with the loss.”

“I have seen so much love.”

Although death is often thought of as a loss Chen believes it can teach people to reflect on their lives. It’s why he co-founded HobbyHK with his friends in 2018. The group provides education in four subjects based off the interests of its tutors: life and death astronomy ecological environment protection and artistic craftsmanship.

Grief can be a very difficult emotion to handle and there’s no right or wrong way to approach it. Photo: Shutterstock

“Students need to discuss death” Chen said. “Through talking about death they can learn that their time is limited and how important it is to plan their lives.”

To engage students in a discussion of the topic Chen has designed different activities such as lying inside coffins to simulate death and funerals and reading and writing a will. Traditionally a will explains what should happen to a person’s belongings but it could also act as a final letter from the deceased.

Chen said students could explore their relationships and learn empathy through reading and writing a will.

As an example he chose an actual letter written by a victim of the 1985 Japan Air Lines Flight 123 crash one of the world’s deadliest single-plane disasters which killed 520 people.

Should mental health education be mandatory in school?

The seven-page letter from a father read: “Dad is very sad but I’m sure I won’t make it ... It’s 6:30 now. The plane is turning around and descending rapidly. I am grateful for the truly happy life I have enjoyed until now.”

“It is a special and powerful will” Chen noted. “Wills can be used to express regret sorrow or even hatred but this one is full of love. You could tell from his words that he is a gentle father and this is a perfect example of love family and death.”

At present his group has organised more than 30 talks and workshops at schools and feedback has been positive. He has also been surprised by what he’s seen from students.

“They mention small things in their wills reminding their mothers to eat healthier or appreciate the little things in life” Chen said.

Sometimes people find it easier to write down their emotions rather than say them out loud. Photo: Shutterstock

These messages resonated with the educator who was once reserved and didn’t know how to express his love for his family.

“Working as a funeral planner I have become more alert to the people around me especially my parents and their ageing. I’ve learned to show that I care about them.”

“I believe that when people die a light turns off. And as I encountered more death and regrets in my job I began agreeing with cliché sayings such as how you should cherish the people around you and the time you have with them.”",,,,,,

It's already been one year since The Washington Post reported dollar stores were seeing an uptick in business due to rising prices at other retail stores driving them to seek less expensive alternatives. At the time inflation was up 5.4% annually. Since then inflation has risen to 8.5% with supermarket prices up 13.1% according to the Consumer Price Index. So can you guess what people tend to spend most of their money on at dollar stores? That would be groceries according to GOBankingRates. ""When you only have a certain amount to spend it's like why not just go to the dollar store?"" remarked one consumer who had transferred most of his local grocery store business to his local dollar store to The Washington Post.

Indeed Dollar General reported increased sales in consumable products (i.e. groceries) for its second fiscal quarter according to its most recent earnings report dated August 25 2022. ""We are pleased with our second quarter results"" Dollar General's CEO Todd Vasos told investors. Since last year Dollar General's net sales increased by 9% and operating profits by 7.5% – bolstered in part by an increase in foot traffic to all of its stores both new and old. Over at Dollar Tree which also reported Q2 results last week net sales increased by 6.6% and operating profits by 25.7% since last year (via press release).

Coresight Research reports 4432 new store openings compared to 1954 store closures equaling a net gain of more than 49 million square feet of new retail space.

Store closures have slowed since the same period of 2021 when retailers announced 4130 closures. Store expansion also slowed from a year ago with 4554 new store announcements.

Analysts said many retailers seek to right-size store holdings which may mean a mix of closures and openings. Retailers are also experimenting with new formats as shopping behaviors continue to evolve.

Athleisure specialty retailer Athleta owned by Gap is among those adding stores in 2022. Athleta said it’s on track to open up to 40 new locations this year including its first two outlet stores in Chicago this summer and Leesburg Va. scheduled to open this fall. The outlet locations aim to reach new customers looking for value in at-leisure apparel.

“Our new outlet stores are intentionally designed to stand out from traditional outlet and clearance store models helping drive new customer acquisition and increased brand awareness for Athleta” said CEO Mary Beth Laughton.

The off-price retail sector is also expanding with more stores this year. TJX announced plans to open 150 new TJ Maxx stores in 2022 in the U.S. on a base of nearly 4700 stores. Burlington plans to open 90 new stores on a base of about 840 stores and Ross Stores plans to open 75 Ross Dress for Less Stores and 25 of the DD’s Discount banners this year on a base of more than 1900 total stores. Ross opened 65 U.S. stores in the last year.

Earlier this year discounter Five Below outlined an aggressive new store plan with 1000 new locations by 2025. The plans called for between 375 and 400 new brick-and-mortar stores this year and next with the balance of stores opening in 2024. Former Walmart executive Joel Anderson is the CEO at Five Below. He said that the business was well positioned in June from an inventory standpoint with improved in-stocks and accelerated receipts for summer and back to school.

“With the planned openings and conversions in scale this year we are on track to end the year with nearly half of our stores in the new Five Beyond format. We are capitalizing on real-time opportunities in the marketplace including merchandise and real estate while piloting new products and services that embody the rituals of life and milestones of growing up” Anderson said.

He said the macro environment looks challenging through the balance of 2022. Coresight CEO Deborah Weinswig said discounters like Five Below should be in a strong position if the economy slows.

“Shoppers watching their budget can still feel good about themselves when they find bargains at $5” Weinswig said.

The dollar store segment leads the retail sector in new store announcements again this year. Goodlettsville Tenn.-based Dollar General plans to open 1102 stores this year. That will equal 11.7 million new square feet of retail square footage. Dollar General is also experimenting with a new format called Popshelf a concept that offers accessories decor cosmetics party items and household supplies at prices of $5 or below. The first 30 Popshelf stores opened last year with more than 200 new locations on tap this year.

Virginia-based Dollar Tree also has a growth plan to add 590 new stores with 800 Family Dollar renovations this year. Dollar Tree is experimenting with a Family Dollar-Dollar Tree combo format in rural south Arkansas areas like Lake Village and Hope. The company said 350 new Family Dollar stores would be the combo format.

Walmart is also experimenting with a new store format in a partnership with hospitality group Getaway for tiny general stores at campsites across the country. The first Walmart general store is slated to open in September in Wimberly Texas south of Austin. Walmart said the partnership also plans for general stores in Moodus Conn. Running Springs Calif. Roscoe N.Y. and Osceola Mo.

The “General Stores” concept will be on wheels in small wooden slope-roofed cabins. Walmart’s name and starburst logo are in yellow in smaller print under signage saying The General Store. The store’s tote bags say “Quality Goods Great Outdoors” with Walmart in a smaller font. Inside are rustic wooden shelves displaying a small heavily curated selection of goods.

“Walmart’s partnership with Getaway furthers our mission to help people live better no matter where they are” said Casey Schlaybaugh vice president of brand marketing for Walmart U.S. “We are going beyond just saving people money by enabling guests to maximize Getaway’s experience and empowering them to spend more quality time with those who matter most.”

Items sold at The General Store will also be sold on Walmart.com via a particular Getaway shopping page. And those who visit Outpost over the next year will receive a free trial of the retailer’s membership program Walmart+ the retailer announced on July 28.

“In partnering with Walmart we are able to amplify our efforts to a larger audience and provide our guests with more free time helping them prepare for their stays and enjoy the comforts of nature once they arrive” said Carlos Becil chief experience officer at Getaway.

Discounter Big Lots also plans to open 50 new stores this year including one in Rogers at 210 S. Promenade Blvd. Like many of the recent Big Lots locations planned this year the Rogers location which opened in May is a new format that features furniture and home furnishings including patio and other outdoor items. The new format does not sell consumables fashion or health and beauty aids like a traditional Big Lots format. The company has roughly 1400 stores in 47 states.

Big Lots typically sells closeouts at a reduced price to traditional retail. The chain has struggled with inventory shortfalls amid the supply chain challenges of the past couple of years but said it will continue to invest in the new format and add 500 stores by 2030.

The Spalding County Board of Commissioners approved two requests in recent months. They include the High Falls Logistics Park and distribution space off Jackson Road. A third request is also up for consideration.

Georgia 16 has direct access to I-75 at exit 205. The first distribution center in the vicinity — Dollar General — opened in 2018. Since then developers have proposed projects representing over thirty million square feet of industrial space.

High Falls Logistics Park

The High Falls Logistics Park plans to construct 4.3 million square feet of logistics space in four buildings. The property consists of 348.6 acres located on the south side of Highway 16 east of High Falls Road.

The four buildings range in size from 280000 square feet to nearly 2 million square feet of space under one rooftop. The primary intended use for the development will be as distribution centers.

Vehicle access will be off Georgia 16 via an existing curb cut and median break. There will be a secondary access point for emergencies only off High Falls Road. Finally the applicant is donating an acre of land on High Falls Road for Spalding County to build a future fire station.

Spalding County approved a rezoning request for the project in June 2022.

During the commission’s August 25 meeting another rezoning request gained approval from Spalding County. This request is for fifty-four acres at the northeast corner of Jackson Road and Wallace Road. The property is immediately adjacent to the Dollar General distribution center.

The developer is planning to construct a 316400 square foot warehouse on the property. Vehicle access will be off both Jackson Road and Wallace Road. As part of the zoning approval the applicant will be upgrading the sections of road parallel to their property to support heavy truck traffic.

The development will build around an existing church Bethel Grove CME on Wallace Road. There will be a seventy-foot buffer between the church and distribution center. The developer will add landscaping and trees to visually separate the properties. The applicant also agreed to preserve natural forest on the back corner of the property.

Tomochichi Road at Chehaw Road

Finally eighty-six acres at the intersection of Tomochichi Road and Chehaw Road is being considered for rezoning. The applicant is proposing a 1 million square foot building for the property.

The property has road frontage to an existing curb cut and median break along highway 16. A secondary access point is also depicted off Chehaw Road. The concept site plan is proposing no direct access to Tomochichi Road.

The Spalding County Planning Commission will consider the project during the August 30 meeting. The board of commissioners will consider the request at a later date.

It's already been one year since The Washington Post reported dollar stores were seeing an uptick in business due to rising prices at other retail stores driving them to seek less expensive alternatives. At the time inflation was up 5.4% annually. Since then inflation has risen to 8.5% with supermarket prices up 13.1% according to the Consumer Price Index. So can you guess what people tend to spend most of their money on at dollar stores? That would be groceries according to GOBankingRates. ""When you only have a certain amount to spend it's like why not just go to the dollar store?"" remarked one consumer who had transferred most of his local grocery store business to his local dollar store to The Washington Post.

Indeed Dollar General reported increased sales in consumable products (i.e. groceries) for its second fiscal quarter according to its most recent earnings report dated August 25 2022. ""We are pleased with our second quarter results"" Dollar General's CEO Todd Vasos told investors. Since last year Dollar General's net sales increased by 9% and operating profits by 7.5% – bolstered in part by an increase in foot traffic to all of its stores both new and old. Over at Dollar Tree which also reported Q2 results last week net sales increased by 6.6% and operating profits by 25.7% since last year (via press release). The question is with inflation reducing consumer purchasing power how is it that dollar stores are now doing better than ever?",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiaWh0dHBzOi8vdGFsa2J1c2luZXNzLm5ldC8yMDIyLzA4L3RoZS1zdXBwbHktc2lkZS11LXMtcmV0YWlsLWV4cGFuc2lvbi10by1pbmNsdWRlLTQ0MzItbmV3LXN0b3Jlcy1pbi0yMDIyL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,The Supply Side: U.S. retail expansion to include 4432 new stores in 2022,"Brick-and-mortar retail is alive in 2022 with more than twice the number of new store openings compared to store closures through the first seven months of this year.

Store closures have slowed since the same period of 2021 when retailers announced 4130 closures. Store expansion also slowed from a year ago with 4554 new store announcements.

D,Dominion Energy,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiaWh0dHBzOi8vbWFyaXRpbWUtZXhlY3V0aXZlLmNvbS9hcnRpY2xlL2RvbWluaW9uLW1heS1lbmQtMTBiLW9mZnNob3JlLXdpbmQtcHJvamVjdC1vdmVyLXBlcmZvcm1hbmNlLWNsYXVzZdIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Dominion May End $10B Offshore Wind Project Over Performance Clause,"The giant utility Dominion Energy has found itself in a disagreement with state regulators over a proposed performance guarantee for its $10 billion Coastal Virginia Offshore Wind project one of the largest planned wind farms in the U.S. development pipeline. The clause is enough of a concern for Dominion that it has threatened to scuttle CVOW altogether and walk away - a seismic shock for the budding U.S. offshore wind industry.

Dominion has historically been one of the most committed players in the U.S. offshore wind business. It was an early and enthusiastic entrant beginning its planning for a small pilot project as early as 2012. The pilot stage was completed in 2020 and is one of only two (small) offshore wind farms operating in the U.S. today.

To build the full-scale 2.6 GW facility Dominion is buying the only U.S.-built wind turbine installation vessel on the market the future Charybdis at a price of half a billion dollars - a financial commitment that no other developer or shipowner has been willing to match yet. Construction on the vessel is already well under way.

However the Virginia State Corporation Commission (SCC) - a regulator with a broad mandate governing insurance railroads and utilities - has made a decision that may make CVOW untenable according to Dominion. The SCC will allow Dominion to bill the cost of CVOW's development to household ratepayers in the form of a miniscule rider fee - but only if its turbines perform at a 42 percent capacity factor or better in any three-year period. Any shortfalls would be Dominion's to cover.

Dominion has appealed the decision describing it as unprecedented and ""unlawful."" The firm warns that the guarantee is so broad that it would leave Dominion on the hook for any decline in power output - whether caused by a hurricane cyberattack climate change or any other factor.

""The Commission’s unprecedented imposition of an involuntary performance guarantee condition on its approvals however is untenable. As ordered it will prevent the project from moving forward and the company will be forced to terminate all development and construction activities"" Dominion wrote in an appeal. ""As recognized by the Commission the project is favored by the General Assembly’s support for offshore wind generation as a cornerstone of the Commonwealth’s plan for a clean and reliable energy future.""

The disagreement follows a just few weeks after Dominion celebrated formal approval from the SCC for the project to move forward. The initial order was released August 8 and it noted that there would be some form of performance requirement but did not give any details - until now.

Dominion's appeal to the SCC begins a rehearing process and the company sounded an upbeat note in a statement to local TV media.

""We look forward to completing the Coastal Virginia Offshore Wind Project as a regulated project to build on our long record of affordability and reliability"" a Dominion spokesperson told local media.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZ2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJlYWNvbmpvdXJuYWwuY29tL3N0b3J5L25ld3MvMjAyMi8wOC8yOC9iZXN0LW5hdHVyYWwtZ2FzLWFuZC1lbGVjdHJpY2l0eS1yYXRlcy82NTQyMDEwMTAwNy_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,The latest advice on the best natural gas and electricity rates,"It’s time for another check-in about energy prices.

First let's talk electricity.

In an unprecedented move a few days ago NOPEC the area’s largest energy aggregator (bulk buyer) for communities announced it was moving 550000 customers back to FirstEnergy utilities.

Utility help:Check out Betty Lin-Fisher's guide

NOPEC or the Northeast Ohio Public Energy Council is a consortium with nearly 1 million gas and electricity customers in 242 communities including parts of Summit Portage Medina and Stark counties.

NOPEC has some communities that are both natural gas and electric — many Portage County communities and a few in Medina and Summit — but a large majority in Summit are gas-only communities. The village of Richfield and some northern Summit communities including Twinsburg and Sagamore Hills have NOPEC electricity.

To see if you're in NOPEC the easiest thing to do is to check its community map at www.nopec.org/communities/community-map or contact your local community.

NOPEC said it notified the Public Utilities Commission of Ohio of its intention to voluntarily return 550000 of its electricity customers who are on what’s called the Standard Program Price or its default price back to their local utility. In our area that would be Ohio Edison. Customers would get the utility default price often called the “price to compare.""

The reason is that while wholesale natural gas prices have been skyrocketing since last fall electricity prices didn’t do the same until recently Dave Jankowski chief marketing and communications officer for NOPEC told me during an interview. NOPEC’s default price which customers are automatically included on unless they had chosen the variable rate or longer-term fixed rate often changed monthly or every few months he said.

Why is advice different for electric rates and gas rates?

NOPEC's and other retailers' current electric rates are higher than the utility's ""price to compare"" because the utility's rate was determined largely in auctions conducted before April when energy prices were considerably lower NOPEC said.

This is where it is confusing for us because my advice for natural gas is to stay away from the utility’s default since it is based on current wholesale rates.

The advice now for electricity is to go with the utility’s default because the electricity default price is determined through several auctions held at different times that buy ahead and lock in a price. The current default price is largely based on pricing during auctions that happened before the run-up.

NOPEC’s current Standard Program Price would have been almost double Ohio Edison’s “price to compare” which is currently at 6.7 cents per kilowatt hour.

“As a consumer-focused non-profit NOPEC is always operating and advocating for what’s best for our communities and customers” Chuck Keiper NOPEC’s executive director said in a press release. “When we looked at the price forecasts it became increasingly apparent that the Price to Compare rate would be a better place for our customers to be through Winter 2023 to save significant money during these economically challenging times.”

Customers could make their own choice to come off the NOPEC rate but Keiper said the organization decided “it was in all our consumers’ best interest” to make the wholesale change and temporarily switch its customers.

Current NOPEC customers on the Standard Program Price do not need to do anything and will automatically be returned to their utility within one to two billing cycles depending on the billing date. There is no fee to leave the aggregation early.

NOPEC customers who are on the variable price which is 6% off the “price to compare” and customers who were on one of NOPEC’s 12- or 24-month contracts will remain though they can also choose to leave at no charge said Jankowski. Contract rates vary depending on when a customer locked in.

NOPEC is expecting electricity prices to stabilize by next spring and that its prices will be in line with the utility’s default pricing so the aggregation will send new opt-out enrollments at that time. That means customers in those communities will automatically be enrolled in the electric plan unless they opt out.

If you have questions NOPEC’s number is 855-667-3201.

What if I'm not in a NOPEC community?

If you're not in a NOPEC community you should still do a checkup to see if you're getting the best price possible for electricity. You can check your bill to see who your current supplier is or contact your local community to see if you are in an aggregation. Many communities in our area are on aggregation deals with Energy Harbor the former FirstEnergy Solutions. Those contract rates used to be a certain percentage off the utility’s “price to compare” but they are now all on fixed rates. If your community was locked in before this spring/summer run-up it’s possible you are on a better rate than the “price to compare” so you should stick with it or see if you can get into it.

Here are a few of the area Energy Harbor contracts: Akron and Barberton both are on a fixed rate of 4.97 cents/kWh through May 2025; Green is 4.91 cents/kWh through May 2024; and Tallmadge is 4.96 cents/kWh through May 2024. Summit County townships (with the exception of Sagamore Hills which is in the NOPEC aggregation) are in an Energy Harbor contract for 4.67 cents/kWh through May 2024.

You can call Energy Harbor to find out more: 888-254-6359. If your community is not with Energy Harbor call your local community or search online.

The bottom line is that if your community aggregation rate is below the current “price to compare” of 6.7 cents/kWh stick with your current contract. Similarly if you locked in to a fixed-rate contract on your own that beats the price to compare stay where you are.

I looked at the PUCO’s Apples to Apples chart www.energychoice.ohio.gov for electricity prices and there is one that is close to the utility “price to compare” but it is laced with monthly fees and hefty cancellation fees. Other rates are 8 cents/kWh and above so I would not lock in to a public fixed rate and I would go back to Ohio Edison as the default which just means you cancel your current contract if you have another provider listed on your bill.

OK so what about gas?

Natural gas prices have been all over the place since last summer. The prices have mostly been way up as the energy markets have reacted to typical gas and storage issues but had the added nervousness from world events.

Last fall I suggested readers find a low fixed rate — either on their own or through their community aggregation or bulk-buying group — and get off the Dominion Standard Choice Offer or SCO. The SCO is the monthly rate based on wholesale rates plus a state-approved formula. For years we enjoyed great prices on the SCO when prices were close to wholesale rates.

The SCO has been all over the map since last fall as low as $4.17 in January and $9.08 in June. It is $8.87/mcf as of Aug. 11 bills.

There isn’t a one-size-fits-all answer but my advice remains the same to try to find the best rate.

If you locked in to a good fixed rate in fall 2021 before the run-up in prices and you're still on that rate for a while you are in good shape. I was able to get an excellent $2.49/mcf rate with Ohio Electric & Gas for 11 months in October 2021 with a $50 cancellation fee. My rate is ending next month and my community aggregation rate is not one I want to join so a few days ago I locked in to the cheapest fixed rate with no cancellation fee on the PUCO's Apples to Apples chart or at www.energychoice.ohio.gov. That was Direct Energy with a $6.29/mcf rate with no cancellation fee for 32 months. You can call 877-698-7551 or go to www.directenergy.com for that rate. Rates can change quickly so if that’s not available find a decent rate with no cancellation fee. I probably won’t stay on that for 32 months but it’s a decent rate for now.

If you live or have a small business in the city of Akron the aggregation with Constellation Energy moved to its $4.06 fixed rate in May and that lasts through November 2024. That is a very good price given where we are now. Last fall I was not in favor of the Akron rate since it was going to mirror the higher SCO rates through the winter months when people use the most gas though I said the fixed rate was decent. Akron residents and small-business owners are allowed to opt in. Call Constellation at 833-500-2738. It will take one to two billing cycles to switch over.

If you are still on the SCO or a price that is based on the SCO see if your community has an aggregation rate that's better and see if you can get in. There are some communities that locked in prices that were only OK a few years ago but they locked in for several years and that price looks good now. (Stow's rate is $2.84/mcf fixed through 2024.) See if they will let you in; each has different rules. I would not be on the SCO now.

If you live in a NOPEC gas community which is a large portion of the Akron region NOPEC's default is called its program rate. That is currently at $7.80/mcf. Its variable is 3 cents below the SCO (too high) and its fixed rates are $8.65 for 12 months and $7.75 for 24 months. None of those prices are great so I would probably lock in to the $6.29/mcf Direct Energy rate and watch to see if NOPEC rates come down. There is no fee to leave NOPEC. Also NOPEC gas customers are not being returned to the utility; only the default electricity customers are.

Caroline McKay had just one criterion when she began searching for an upstate getaway from her New York City studio apartment earlier this spring: No fixer-uppers. “People have been waiting on supplies and furniture forever. I wanted something I could use immediately” explains McKay a publicist for design-forward brands.

While her friends all imagined it would take months to find a move-in ready home—one that didn’t even require a new paint job—it took just 30 days (and many late nights) on Zillow for “the one” to materialize: a 900-square-foot A-frame with a moody all-black exterior in Livingston Manor New York. She immediately inquired and found there was both good and bad news to be shared about the covetable cabin.

Seno Dining Table Article.

The good? It was listed for sale by the owner a real-estate agent named Avi Adiv who had flipped it. The bad? Ten-plus offers were already in the works one of which was accepted.

“But he told me he didn’t think it would go through and if it didn’t he’d give me a call and I could come up and see it” recalls McKay. A few hours later that same day her phone rang with the update she had hoped for. “I literally dropped everything to go there” she says laughing including borrowing her cousin’s car to make the last-minute trip. “I made an offer that same afternoon. Total whirlwind.”

A week later McKay brought up a mattress to throw on the floor and considered herself moved in. All that had to be done to make her ’70s mod-meets-Scandi neutral dream a reality was to furnish the empty spaces—a primary bedroom in the loft upstairs the living and dining room that now duals as her WFH office and the downstairs guest room. Adiv had already done all the hard stuff: adding new appliances hardwiring light fixtures installing the new wood floors and updating the bathrooms.

Adiv had also swathed nearly every single surface in white paint including the kitchen cabinets a move McKay decided to keep as it made the entire space feel bright airy and bigger than it actually is. “I felt like too many colors in such a small space would make it feel like a dollhouse” she says. “So I was very specific about neutrals with pops of colors that fill well.” But landing on those exact contrasting accent hues was easier said than done. Living with the space as well as rummaging through estate sales in New York and Connecticut helped her nail down a palette. The catalyst? A pair of vintage marble table lamps she scored at an online auction.

The poppy color was so good McKay says she “was ferociously bidding against one other person” for them. Once she had the duo in hand though the drawn-out exchange was worth it: Everything else from the velvety pillow shams to the striped linen duvet fell into place. The red tone inspired other warm moments throughout the cabin including the coral pillow covers pink-y prints and chestnut-hued throw blankets all of which mingle neatly among the wood and brass details dotting every room.

After solving her color conundrum other obstacles McKay had to troubleshoot included the super-angled walls and a lack of storage. “The triangle of the frame goes all the way to the bottom” she explains. “I had to be really specific about sizes and dimensions.” The main pain point was finding a sofa that wouldn’t jut out too far from the sloped side. “I started looking for a range of 30 to 37 inches of where it would hit on the back so it had to be pretty short” she shares. The solution came in the form of a modular model from Valyou. “When I originally ordered it it came in three pieces so I was able to order an extra to give it more of an L-shape instead of adding a separate chair.” It’s now where she prefers to take Zoom calls and where her pup Ollie loves to lounge.

Keeping a low profile with furniture was a trick she also employed in both bedrooms. The affordable close-to-the-floor frames she found on Amazon make the tall ceilings appear even taller (and help minimize the hefty price tag of her sectional buy).

With the interiors all squared away her design eye has been cast outside lately. She chose Adirondack chairs that match the cabin’s pigmented exterior and a smokeless Solo Stove that’s ready for fall fires in the backyard. The deck nearly the same length of the home has been left relatively untouched; she has added a table and bench from Novogratz and is toying with the idea of a hot tub (a luxury she wouldn’t have ever been able to consider so soon if renovations had been a part of the plan or budget). For now she’s content to leave a fixer-upper (way) in the future.

The Goods

Real-estate agent (and house flipper) who made move-in day a breeze: Hunter Lake Development—Avi Adiv and Josh Rosh. Be sure to follow them because they do great work and are always working on new projects up in the western Catskills.

Favorite local shop to frequent for vintage finds: Locally I love Long Weekend in Livingston Manor. But honestly I’ve found the majority of my furniture and accessories at Furniture on Consignment II (in Westport Connecticut) and Monger’s Market (in Bridgeport Connecticut). My mom and I love to go to estate sales and vintage shops in that area; it’s truly a gold mine.

Where I found the triangle dresser that looks like my A-frame cabin: This was actually my father’s who bought it when we lived in London. He saw it in a store and really loved it so my mother gave it to him as a Christmas gift. Apparently it was originally crafted in Indonesia.

Why I still hung art on only two usable walls: I have always loved finding unique spaces to place art and decor. I think it unexpectedly draws the eye and makes you think more about the intention behind the pieces. You’ll find that there are a few spots where I had to be creative: I put one piece right above the floor at the end of the hallway and another tucked in a corner above the couch.

The pattern and textile that are so me: I always splurge on bedding and textiles and I got everything from Pom Pom at Home which is one of my favorite places for high-quality bedding. One thing that was very fun for me throughout this project was mixing different textiles and patterns that normally feel subtly opposing. I personally love the Pom Pom at Home striped linen duvet (I can’t tell you how many compliments I get on it) in the loft contrasting with the berry-colored velvet pillows. The pillows subtly match the red marble lamps (my favorite vintage find for the home) and the combination of the three really brings the loft bedroom together.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMigAFodHRwczovL3d3dy50aW1lc25vd25ld3MuY29tL3ZpcmFsL2phcGFuZXNlLW1hbi1jbGltYnMtbW91bnQtZnVqaS1kcmVzc2VkLXVwLWFzLXBpenphLWRlbGl2ZXJ5LWd1eS1qdXN0LWZvci1mdW4tYXJ0aWNsZS05MzgxODk0NtIBhAFodHRwczovL3d3dy50aW1lc25vd25ld3MuY29tL3ZpcmFsL2phcGFuZXNlLW1hbi1jbGltYnMtbW91bnQtZnVqaS1kcmVzc2VkLXVwLWFzLXBpenphLWRlbGl2ZXJ5LWd1eS1qdXN0LWZvci1mdW4tYXJ0aWNsZS05MzgxODk0Ni9hbXA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Japanese man climbs Mount Fuji dressed up as pizza delivery guy just for fun,"Japanese man climbs Mount Fuji dressed up as pizza delivery guy for fun | Image: Twitter/Yamap

A photo of a man in a Domino's Pizza shirt appearing to deliver pizza at the top of Mount Fuji in Japan has gone viral on social media.

The picture shows the man carrying a Domino's Pizza thermal bag on his back.

The man is said to have started his journey at 7:38 am and reached the peak at 1:27 pm around six hours later.

He even posed with his ""customer"" who received the box of pizza he ""ordered"" from him.

However the man is not a delivery guy and does not work with Domino's.

He is just a regular office worker named Umanami Futoshi. He enjoys hiking up mountains according to Asahi TV.

He likes to cosplay as delivery workers of different companies.

Umanami said that he got his hands on a thermal delivery bag from Uber Eats about a year ago and thought it would be ""interesting"" to hike up Mount Fuji with it.

When fellow hikers cheered for him he started donning the uniforms of delivery workers of different companies.",,,,,,,,,

Not a subscriber? You can sign up right here.

New York CNN Business —

August is about to come to a close which means that the summer is almost over in the Northern Hemisphere. (Have fun in the sun Australia!) If that’s not enough to bum you out then this might: September which begins on Thursday is historically the worst month of the year for the stock market.

The Dow and S&P 500 fell sharply in September last year and in 2020 even though the broader market rallied in both years. That doesn’t mean stocks are doomed to finish this September in the red of course. Stocks rallied in each of the three Septembers prior to the pandemic.

But here’s another potentially ominous sign: This is a midterm election year. The Dow has fallen in 11 out of the last 18 pre-midterm Septembers going back to 1950 according to data from The Stock Trader’s Almanac.

So don’t count on past performance to dictate future results. At the end of the day investors should focus on fundamentals instead of dates on the calendar. Earnings the economy and Federal Reserve interest rate policy will matter far more to stock performance than what month it is.

Still there’s reason to be nervous.

The Fed’s next meeting about rate hikes is on September 21. Several key economic reports are on tap that will give investors more clues about the health of the job market and whether inflation pressures are abating. Congress will be back in session just after Labor Day as well.

“There is no question that there are a number of geopolitical concerns and economic data that could lead to volatility. Investors should be prepared for that” said Josh Emanuel chief investment officer of Wilshire.

Traders should keep a close eye on the Fed and the economy he added and the good news is that there are signs that the job market remains healthy and that inflation is finally starting to cool.

If that trend persists Emanuel said “a soft landing could be a plausible scenario” meaning that the Fed won’t cause a recession by hiking rates too aggressively.

The stock market had a miserable first half of the year which could mean that the recent rebound (July’s sharp rally and a flat albeit choppy August) may continue.

“The historical concerns about September and October are less relevant this year. There are forces in play that are more significant” said Alex Chaloff co-head of investment strategy at Bernstein Private Wealth Management. “There are a number of potential catalysts for a fall rally.”

Chaloff said that if the slowdown in inflation continues “the market will cheer that significantly” and the Fed might be more likely to raise interest rates next month by just a half percentage point instead of three-quarters of a point. That could be “critical in establishing momentum for a rally” Chaloff added.

Chaloff also thinks that a soft landing is possible for the economy or in a worst case a “mild recession.” Investors don’t need to be too worried about a sharp economic downturn because “strength in consumer and corporate spending will be more than enough to carry us through” he said.

So as long as the economy keeps chugging along and inflation fears move further into the rear view mirror the market just might avoid a big September swoon.

Or an October crash. Don’t get us started on 1929. Or 1987. Or 2008…

All eyes on the jobs report

Worries about an imminent recession subsided after the stronger-than-expected-jobs report for July. The government reported that 528000 jobs were added far more than expected.

August jobs numbers are due out on Friday. Economists expect a slowdown in hiring but nothing that’s likely to lead to louder recession alarm bells.

Economists are forecasting an increase of 285000 jobs to August payrolls according to Reuters and that the unemployment rate will remain flat at 3.5%. If those estimates are met the Fed (and the markets!) will likely be happy.

“The July jobs report was so unabashedly strong so it’s hard to imagine the Fed will be worrying about the August numbers. The labor market speaks to the underlying strength of the economy” said Jake Remley senior portfolio manager at Income Research + Management.

Investors will also be keeping a close watch on the wage growth numbers in the jobs report. Any signs of a slowdown in wages could be viewed favorably by investors as more evidence that inflation pressures are cooling.

Economists are forecasting a slight increase from July with wages expected to rise 5.3% over the previous 12 months…up slightly from June’s 5.2% growth rate.

A small uptick in wage growth probably won’t set off alarm bells. But neither the Fed nor investors will want to see wages skyrocketing. That might be good news for consumers in the short run but it would not be welcome in the long haul.

As Fed chair Jerome Powell put it in Friday’s speech at Jackson Hole “a failure to restore price stability would mean far greater pain” for the economy.

Dig out your old baseball cards. They might just be worth eight figures at auction.

A Mickey Mantle baseball card from 1952 sold for a jaw-dropping $12600000 early Sunday morning according to a news release from Heritage Auctions shared with CNN. The sale makes the card the most valuable sports collectible in the world according to the auction house.

The price almost doubled the previous record for a baseball card set when a rare Honus Wagner sold for $6.6 million last year. And it also beat out the record for any item of sports memorabilia bypassing the $9.3 million sale of Diego Maradona’s famous ‘Hand of God’ jersey.

The Mickey Mantle card is especially valuable because it’s so well-preserved. The card was graded “Mint+ 9.5” by the Sportscard Guaranty Corporation according to Heritage Auctions.

Mantle spent 17 years playing for the New York Yankees and was inducted into the Baseball Hall of Fame in 1974. The record-breaking card is from his rookie season and was produced by trading card giant Topps.

For the auction house the sale represents the growing draw of sports collectibles.

“An eight-figure auction result in the sports market was the stuff of fantasy just a decade ago” said Chris Ivy Heritage’s director of sports auctions said in the release.

“We always knew this card would shatter records and expectations. But that doesn’t make it any less of a thrill to be part of an auction during which a single item breaks the eight-figure threshold for the first time. It’s an extraordinary accomplishment for our wonderful team of sports experts at Heritage Auctions. And of course we could not have done it without our consignor Anthony Giordano who put his trust in Heritage to bring this amazing card to market.”

Anthony Giordano bought the Mantle card for what was a record-breaking price in 1991: $50000. He kept it hidden away for three decades before bringing it to Heritage Auctions according to the release.

“It bears the finest qualities any 1952 Topps can possess: perfect centering registration and four sharp corners” said Ivy in the release. “That this Mantle rookie card remained in this condition for 70 years is a true miracle.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiowFodHRwczovL3d3dy56ZWViaXouY29tL21hcmtldC1uZXdzL25ld3Mtc3RvY2stbWFya2V0LW9uLW1vbmRheS1pbmRpYW4tZXF1aXR5LWluZGljZXMtbWF5LXJlYWN0LW5lZ2F0aXZlbHktYWZ0ZXItdXMtbWFya2V0cy1jb2xsYXBzZS1vbi1pbnRlcmVzdC1yYXRlLXdhcm5pbmctMTk2MDg10gGnAWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnplZWJpei5jb20vbWFya2V0LW5ld3MvbmV3cy1zdG9jay1tYXJrZXQtb24tbW9uZGF5LWluZGlhbi1lcXVpdHktaW5kaWNlcy1tYXktcmVhY3QtbmVnYXRpdmVseS1hZnRlci11cy1tYXJrZXRzLWNvbGxhcHNlLW9uLWludGVyZXN0LXJhdGUtd2FybmluZy0xOTYwODUvYW1w?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Stock Market on Monday: Indian indices likely to react negatively after US markets collapse on interest rat...,"On the back of negative global cues and the statements by the US Fed Reserve after Jakson Hole symposium the Indian markets are also likely to react negatively on Monday analysts estimated.

The US indices plunged up to 4 per cent on Friday with Dow Jones and S&P 500 slipping over 3 per cent while Nasdaq witnessed maximum sell-off to close nearly 4 per cent lower.

“US Fed statements after the Jakson Hole symposium showed the central bank’s strong commitment towards controlling inflation over growth. In cues for major central banks across the world Fed Chair Jerome Powell said that inflation is likely to remain higher for a longer period and thus require an aggressive stance”Siddhartha Khemka Head Retail Research Motilal Oswal Financial Services said.

""This is likely to be negative for equity markets. The impact was clearly visible in US markets which fell more than 3 per cent. Indian markets are also likely to react negatively on Monday with increasing volatility over the next few days.""

For Monday Zee Business Managing Editor Anil Singhvi said “Nifty will take strong support between 17350 to 17450 and will hold resistance between 17625 to 17725. While Bank Nifty will take support between 39750 to 39850 and profit booking may come between 39250 to 39450.”

The domestic markets on Friday managed to end marginally higher in a volatile trading session in continuation of the prevailing consolidation phase. After the initial uptick the benchmark inched gradually lower as the session progressed.

Markets will react to the US Fed chair’s address at the Jackson Hole symposium in early trade on Monday Ajit Mishra VP - Research Religare Broking said.

Indications are mixed at present and a decisive break from the 17300-17800 range in Nifty would trigger the next directional move Mishra added. “Participants should continue their focus on risk management and maintain extra caution in stock selection.”

US Fed Chair Powell sounded ultra-hawkish in his brief speech at Jackson Hole Dr. VK Vijayakumar Chief Investment Strategist at Geojit Financial Services said. “The Fed chief warned of ‘some pain’ ahead in the economy an indication of large rate (75bps) hike in September despite reiterating that the rate hike decisions will be data driven.”

D.R.Horton Americas Largest home building is proposing a high-end single-family residential development in the North End of the city. D.R. Horton has been building homes since 1978 when they started in Fort Worth Texas. Since then that company has built more than 890000 homes throughout the US. The company operates in 44 of homebuilding’s top 50 markets in the U.S. and ranks among the top 5 in 35 of these.

The proposal is for 195 single-family homes to be built on 83.537 acres of land on the North Side of Circleville. The property proposed is located on the west side of North court street just past Marshall dr. The development will extend from there to around the area of Pickaway Craft mall located at 2146 North Court Steet in Circleville. The land is currently unused and no residential structures are on the property.

The plans propose a development with ponds landscaped entry features open spaces and natural areas with other community amenities consistent with single-family residences. The homes are proposed to have minimum sq footage of 1200 feet a two-car garage and are priced in the 250000 dollar range and up. Homes would be offered as single-story and two-story.

Documents show that most of the homes that were planned to be built in this location were more in the 1600 sq size and up to 2600 sq foot homes that boasted a three-car garage four bedrooms a study and a second living room area upstairs.

A Public Hearing for a Rezoning will be held at Council Chambers in Circleville on Tuesday September 6 2022.

Vehicle-to-grid (V2G) experiments are happening in many places. EVs store electricity from the grid in their batteries but electricity doesn’t care which way it flows. Some of that stored electricity can flow back onto the grid under certain conditions. In an ideal world all vehicles would be battery-electrics that could store energy from renewable sources when supply is high and return some of it back to the grid when the supply of renewable energy is low. Batteries can also help control voltage and frequency variations on the grid something baseload generators and peaker plants can’t do.

Vehicle-To-Grid In Massachusetts

Electric school buses are ideal candidates for use in V2G applications. They sit idle during the day when schools are in session which allows them to soak up lots of excess electricity generated mid-day when the output from solar power plants is highest. They also are parked when the school day ends which allows them to feed electricity back to the grid when demand increases but solar output declines.

Thomas Built Buses makes Saf-T-Liner Jouley battery electric school buses using batteries supplied by Proterra. In the summer of 2021 one of those buses was used in a vehicle-to-grid experiment to test how well the V2G technology works. According to School Bus Fleet that one bus sent nearly three MWh of energy back to the grid in 30 instances spanning a total of 60 hours.

That experiment involved National Grid Proterra Thomas Built Buses Rhombus Energy Solutions and Highland Electric Fleets — a provider of fleet electrification as a service and several other partners. This summer two electric buses were included in the experiment and supplied more than 7 MWh of electricity to the grid. The Rhombus Energy Solutions 60 kW high power DC fast charger certified to UL 1741-SA standards can provide bi-directional charging capabilities for up to five school buses per power control system.

“Electric school buses are ideal assets for V2G applications” says Sean Leach director of technology and platform management at Highland in a press release. “Nearly 500000 school buses in North America spend most of their time parked. Fossil fuel-powered buses provide no value when idle. Electric buses on the other hand can be used effectively as mobile batteries when not transporting students to provide additional power that supports grid stability and resiliency. We’re excited to work with top tier partners to scale V2G programs and benefits to other communities.”

“Communities across the country are transitioning to a 100% clean energy and clean transportation future” said Chris Bailey president of Proterra Powered & Energy. “Electric school buses can play an important role in driving this switch — bringing a cleaner quieter mode of transportation for our students while also supporting a more local and resilient energy system by delivering stored energy back to the grid when it’s needed most.”

The lessons learned from the past two summers will enable National Grid and other utilities to scale similar V2G programs in the future for more sustainable energy systems. The partners now plan to offer the service to school bus operators in Vermont Maryland Colorado California and Virginia.

Vehicle-To-Grid In Red Hook

Last week Revel NineDot Energy and Fermata Energy announced that the first V2G program connected to the New York City grid is now in operation at Revel’s warehouse in Brooklyn. Revel partnered with V2G and V2X provider Fermata Energy and clean energy developer NineDot Energy to deploy a bi-directional charging system that can send energy stored in EV batteries back to the ConEdison grid.

The V2G system uses three Fermata Energy bi-directional chargers that send energy back to the grid from 2 pm and 6 pm when the demand for electricity is highest. The three bidirectional chargers can export approximately 45kW back to the grid.

“NineDot Energy is excited to see this V2G program come into operation as we believe electric vehicles and V2G charging can play an important role in decarbonizing our environment. As a leading developer of urban community-scale energy projects we see significant potential for V2G to augment the battery energy storage solutions we are building in the New York City and surrounding areas and we look forward to hosting these capabilities at some of our sites” said David Arfin CEO of NineDot Energy.

NineDot Energy and Fermata Energy activated the V2G system at Revel’s Red Hook warehouse following a successful testing period conducted over the summer. The V2G system currently operates with Nissan LEAF EVs but the partners expect to incorporate more EV models as V2G technology becomes more available.

“With the right technology EVs support grid resilience rather than acting as just a grid drain. That’s an important change that New York and Con Edison are bringing to the industry” said David Slutzky CEO of Fermata Energy. “Both Revel and NineDot are forward thinking companies that understand the importance of V2G and V2X technologies in supporting the grid and decarbonization and we are honored to be working with them.”

The Takeaway

Vehicle-to-grid technology is in its infancy but a lot of people and companies are taking an interest in it. Ford has partnered with Sunrun to allow owners of its new F-150 Lightning electric pickup trucks equipped with the Intelligent Backup Power System connected to a Home Integration System. to power their homes using the batteries in their vehicles. While Ford is focused on the ability to power a home during a blackout Duke Energy in Florida is now working on a pilot program that uses the F-150 Lightning in a V2G system. Owners who participate receive a stipend of $25 a month.

It’s fair to say utility companies have been reluctant to jump into the world of distributed power where electricity gets fed in at the margins instead of at a centrally located generating facility at the center of the grid. It takes a while for new ideas to break through conventional wisdom but utility companies are looking at investing major sums of money to install grid scale battery systems. If they could tap into vehicle batteries to perform much the same service why wouldn’t they?

Many automakers are interested in vehicle-to-home systems as well. For new car customers the ability to use their car as a zero emissions emergency generator is a powerful selling point. Going from V2H to V2G involves installing some extra hardware but if drivers could actually reduce their monthly utility bills by doing so many would see that as a positive thing. Expect to hear about more vehicle-to-grid pilot programs in the months to come.

Update: Synop is an end-to-end EV software platform that bridges charging fleet operations and energy management into a single intuitive solution to take care of all fleet electrification needs. By providing telematics integration smart routing and AI-driven forecasting tools Synop makes charging more accessible reduces the administrative burden on fleet managers and enables fleets to scale with multiple vehicle classes and charging partners quickly. It was one of the partners in the vehicle to grid experiment in Massachusetts.

Ron DeSantis and Democrat Charlie Crist will give Florida voters a choice between two candidates with vastly different views about what they think is important to Floridians.

For the next two months the candidates will make their case to voters and talk about how they plan to tackle some of the biggest issues facing the state.

For starters they don’t exactly agree on what the top issues are.

On his campaign website DeSantis asks voters to fill out a survey that asks “What issues matter to you going into 2022?” The list of issues from which to choose: “fighting against big tech election integrity protecting our Second Amendment preserving Florida’s environment our economy protecting innocent life education/banning critical race theory in classrooms strengthening the border and other.”

By contrast Crist’s website spells out the top issues he thinks voters want addressed: “defending reproductive freedom voting is a right clean water for all office for new Floridians justice for all Crist action plan for Florida seniors affordable Florida for all plan Crist’s million solar roofs plan safer Florida for all accessibility for all freedom to learn Wall Street housing crackdown equality for all and Black voters for Crist.”

The following is a brief summary of the candidates’ public statements and promises to date on: reproductive rights the environment education gun rights the cost of living in Florida and voting rights.

Reproductive rights

Charlie Crist: After his nomination Crist repeated his campaign pledge to sign an executive order on his first day in office to protect abortion rights in Florida.

“Next year as your governor I’ll veto any anti-choice legislation that comes to my desk” Crist said during a speech in Tampa in May.

When Crist was a Republican governor he vetoed legislation that would have forced pregnant women to get an ultrasound before getting an abortion. While he now says he has “always” supported access to abortion his record on the issue has fluctuated over the years. In the 2006 gubernatorial race he cast himself as “pro-life” though he said he wouldn’t support overturning the U.S. Supreme Court decision Roe v. Wade that protected the constitutional right to an abortion.

Ron DeSantis: DeSantis has refused to publicly say whether he would support further abortion restrictions now that the Supreme Court has overturned Roe v. Wade.

The governor praised the Supreme Court ruling and promised that Florida “will work to expand pro-life protections” but he has not offered specifics. Last week he was asked what “pro-life protection” would look like in Florida if he is reelected. He said his focus was on “defending what we’ve done and we’ve done more than any governor in the modern history of the state” in reference to the state’s new 15-week abortion ban.

“We want to make sure that what we’ve done will stick and then work with the Legislature. But I will tell you though that 15 was very difficult to be able to achieve” DeSantis said. “We were happy that we were able to achieve it. And so we look forward and we welcome future endeavors. But this is we realize there’s still going to be a fight on the legal end.”

Education

Charlie Crist: Crist has laid out several education policy priorities including making Florida’s education commissioner an elected position again.

He wants to invest $5.5 billion to increase teacher pay an amount that would continue going toward raising the starting teacher salary to $47500 — an initiative pushed by DeSantis — and that would also go to pay veteran teachers at least $67000.

He also wants to make some changes to how teachers receive health care options. On his website Crist says he wants to give school districts the option to enroll in the state employee health plan because teachers and non-instructional staff “are public employees too.”

“The state will even pick up the tab if districts use existing expenditures to increase teacher and non-instructional staff pay” the website says. “The district and the union will decide how to allocate the salary increases.”

Crist was supported by the Florida Education Association the state’s largest teacher’s union during the primary election.

Ron DeSantis: It is difficult to discern what specific education policies DeSantis will want to enact next if he is reelected.

But what we know is that those policies are likely to be related to the governor’s constant push against what he calls “woke ideology” which has become somewhat of a catch-all phrase for what conservatives think is objectionable when it comes to teaching about race and gender.

DeSantis has made education a cornerstone of his reelection campaign and has been expanding the number of allies he has in local school board races all in the pursuit of his education agenda.

The priorities in that agenda are described broadly and focus on rejecting the teaching of what DeSantis calls “critical race theory” and “woke gender ideology.” He also wants to put more emphasis on civics education and increasing teacher pay. Those items have already been implemented so it is unclear exactly what DeSantis wants to do to build on those issues.

Next year DeSantis wants state lawmakers to give law enforcement officers and first responders easier access to temporary teaching certificates to help schools fill vacant teaching positions. He also wants to continue raising the minimum teacher salary to $47500.

Gun rights

Charlie Crist: Crist has said he would support gun control measures including required background checks for “all firearm sales” including those done at gun shows. To get that done he would have to work with the Republican majority in the Legislature.

“We’ll help law enforcement get illegal guns off our streets by limiting handgun purchases to once per month cracking down on untraceable ghost guns and asking Floridians to report when their guns are lost or stolen” Crist said at a news conference in March.

Crist also wants to strengthen Florida’s red flag law which gives police a path to ask a judge to temporarily bar dangerous individuals from possessing or purchasing a firearm. The law was enacted after the 2018 mass shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School with bipartisan support in the Legislature.

In June when Congress gave final approval to a bipartisan compromise intended to stop dangerous people from accessing firearms Crist called the measure an “important life-saving step forward” but called for further action. In particular he said he wants to see universal background checks for gun purchases and a ban on sales of assault weapons and high-capacity magazines.

Ron DeSantis: The governor has promised to push for a bill that would allow Floridians to publicly carry firearms even if they have not previously taken a training course or obtained a permit.

“I can’t tell you exactly when but I’m pretty confident that I will be able to sign ‘constitutional carry’ into law in the state of Florida” DeSantis said in April. “The Legislature will get it done.”

Handgun owners in Florida are currently required to get a license to carry their weapons in most public places. Gun owners are allowed to openly carry their firearms without a permit in certain limited circumstances including while hunting or while traveling to and from a hunting trip.

The incoming Republican House speaker Paul Renner has said his chamber plans to put forward a “constitutional carry” policy for gun owners. But he told supporters “we need to work on the Senate a little bit.” For DeSantis to keep his promise both chambers would need to approve the measure.

Cost of living

In nearly every major national ranking on housing energy health care property insurance and food the costs for those basics in Florida is higher than it is in most other states.

Crist and Democrats see that as an issue they intend to use to galvanize voters about a governor they say is more focused on culture wars than Floridians’ pocketbooks. DeSantis blames what he calls “Biden-inflation” and says that Florida is a victim of its success under his administration because as he kept schools and businesses open people were moving to Florida increasing demand for housing goods and services and raising costs.

Charlie Crist: He blames global forces the pandemic and interrupted supply chains for inflation. On general costs he wants to temporarily suspend the gas tax at the state level and reject “unreasonable rate increases” sought by utility companies.

On housing he wants to increase the affordable housing inventory and appoint a housing czar to place limits on corporations that buy up single-family homes and convert them to rental properties pricing locals out of the market. He wants to temporarily “but significantly” increase the documentary stamp tax paid by development firms when they close on a house with revenues to go toward the Sadowski trust fund for affordable housing. He also vows to fully fund the affordable housing trust fund and repeal the 2021 law that permanently diverted money from the fund. He also wants to expand down payment assistance programs for people buying a home.

On auto and homeowners insurance Crist wants to appoint a state insurance advocate who is more consumer-focused and repeal the 2021 reform law signed by DeSantis that opponents say has backfired and led to higher premiums. He wants to expand competition in the homeowners insurance market by requiring large insurers that sell auto insurance to Floridians to also offer homeowners insurance.

For health care he wants to expand Medicaid and negotiate lower prescription drug costs.

For state workers he promises to restore annual cost-of-living adjustments for worker pay.

Ron DeSantis: He blames Biden for cost-of-living increases and says the governor’s efforts to keep businesses open during the pandemic contributed to Florida’s economy. On general costs the governor signed a record tax reduction package for the next year that includes a $0.25 per gallon reduction in the state gas tax to run through the month of October. For the second year in a row DeSantis approved $1000 bonuses for all sworn law enforcement officers firefighters and first responders. And on Thursday the governor announced a toll relief program to give customers with at least 40 paid transactions a month a 20% credit to their SunPass account on toll roads owned by the state. Customers with 80 or more paid transactions will receive a 25% credit each month.

On housing DeSantis announced a Hometown Heroes program with a $100 million budget to provide workers in more than 100 eligible professions assistance with down payments and closing costs to help purchase a primary residence in the communities where they work. He has not addressed other issues related to affordable housing. He rejected requests to address rent relief in the legislative session. Since 2021 the state has distributed $1.5 billion in rental assistance funds provided to Floridians from federal COVID-19 relief dollars.

On property insurance Florida lawmakers held a special session in May and delivered property insurance reforms sought by the governor and favored by the insurance industry. The measure prohibits an insurance company from refusing to write or renew a policy based on the age of a roof and imposes other limits. Since then however a number of insurance companies have discontinued writing insurance in the state. Average rates in Florida have tripled since 2019 and the insurance rating agency Demotech has threatened to downgrade more than 20 companies potentially sending hundreds of thousands of policies into the high-cost state-run insurer Citizens Property Insurance.

DeSantis has not outlined any proposals to address the homeowners insurance issue since then but he has said “companies by and large are in better shape than they were six months ago” and he wants mortgage lenders to accept the downgraded companies. “We can use Citizens Insurance as kind of the reinsurer of last resort” he said.

For state workers DeSantis approved pay raises for state law enforcement officers that he says will amount to as much as 15% increases for some people. He approved $1 billion over four years to reach the goal of raising the minimum teacher salary to $47500 and approved three years of teacher bonuses.

Elections

Charlie Crist: He says he will “roll back Tallahassee’s misguided voter suppression law and make it easier to vote.” He will reverse the limits on mail ballots approved by DeSantis and if the Legislature refuses to act he would declare a state of emergency before the next general election and make the changes himself.

Crist wants Florida to join other states and automatically register to vote anyone who seeks a driver’s license. He wants to make Election Day a state holiday and proposes moving the Florida primary to the spring to encourage voter participation. And the former governor wants to make it easier for felons who have completed their sentences but may still owe court fees to be able to register to vote.

Ron DeSantis: The governor has signed bills into law that make it more difficult to vote by mail limit the use of ballot drop boxes require third-party groups to issue a warning when trying to register voters and create an Election Crimes and Security investigative force. He signed a 2019 bill that restricts the ability of felons to have their rights restored under a voter-approved constitutional amendment. When federal judges blocked both of the bills ruling they unfairly discriminate against Black voters the governor appealed the rulings.

DeSantis has said he will “hold people accountable who violated our election laws” and earlier in August announced the arrests of 20 individuals who voted in 2020 but did not have their rights restored. He said there will be more arrests.

Environment

Charlie Crist: On energy Crist wants Florida to reach one million solar roofs by expanding solar energy tax credits and low-cost financing installing solar on state government buildings and supporting installations on other government buildings. He wants to create low-income solar grants allow third-party ownership of solar arrays streamline permitting establish statewide energy efficiency standards and protect the current rule that lets customers who generate solar power sell excess energy to their utility company at retail rates. Crist also vows to repeal the law that restricts local governments’ natural gas hookups.

On water Crist promises to strengthen regulations regarding runoff from agricultural lands and limit back-pumping into Lake Okeechobee. He opposes state preemption over local control of environmental issues and the retail sale of fertilizer. He wants to use federal American Rescue Plan dollars to replace all urban septic tanks and connect them to central sewer systems. He wants to make more public lands available to store and clean water and restore wetlands. And the former governor wants to give state water regulators more resources to protect wetlands and waterways.

Ron DeSantis: On energy DeSantis vetoed a utility-written bill intended to reduce rooftop solar expansion citing the increasing cost it could have on people in an inflation-burdened economy. He has appointed three of the five members of the Public Service Commission which has approved rate increases for Florida Power & Light Tampa Electric and Duke Energy Florida. The tax break package signed into law this year includes tax credits for energy star appliances.

On water and sea level rise the governor vetoed a bill this year that would have given the sugar industry priority to water access over other Floridians. He secured $3.3 billion in state and federal funds for Everglades restoration about $800 million above his $2.5 billion goal. Funding initiatives also include $404 million for 113 environmental resilience projects throughout the state a statewide flooding and sea level rise resilience plan for 76 infrastructure projects totaling $270 million and $20 million for 98 projects statewide for inland and coastal community assessments.

Correction: This story has been updated to reflect that the state has distributed $1.5 billion in rental assistance funds provided to Floridians from federal COVID-19 relief dollars.

Designed by GKV Architects and developed by Park Tower Group and The Rockefeller Group the 400-foot-tall structure will yield 365651 square feet with 378 residences as well as 2548 square feet of commercial space and 138 enclosed parking spaces. Monadnock Construction is the general contractor for the property which is located at the intersection of Dupont West and Commercial Streets.

Recent photos show excavators and piling machines in action on the site which previously sat vacant. Work should continue to descend below street level over the coming months with the new superstructure likely emerging in the first half of 2023.

YIMBY also spotted a black and white rendering for 16 Dupont Street most likely depicting the wider northern elevation. The massing features a multi-story podium with stepped setbacks leading to the main tower which rises uniformly to the roof parapet topped with a mechanical bulkhead. The façade appears to be composed of floor-to-ceiling glass and metal paneling with a diagrid pattern of narrow beams giving depth to the design. A shallow setback is positioned on the eastern end toward the top of the building.

The closest train to the property is the local G train at the Greenpoint Avenue station to the southeast. The East River waterfront esplanade is located across West Street.

16 Dupont Street is slated for completion in the spring 2025 as noted on the construction board.

(KSNB) - There are several new things to see at the Nebraska State Fair including a new attraction that’s leaving people scratching their heads.

No one knows where and no one knows when but each day fair-goers are greeted by a strolling piano man.

He’s Josh Dupont. He tickles the ivories and sings the classics while the piano he’s playing inexplicably makes its way through the crowds.

Dupont said this is his first visit to the Nebraska State Fair and it’s been a good one so far.

“Ah it’s great! State Fair is fantastic folks are having a good time” Dupont said. “Nebraska has been spectacular we had kids dancing we had people yelling out some great songs everybody is singing and clapping having a great time strolling around with the piano and enjoying themselves it’s been great!”

Dupont is also looking forward to meeting everyone who comes out for the fair.

“Come on down request some songs throw some curve balls my way. We’ll see if I know them if I don’t I’ll fake my way through it and you can do most of the singing” Dupont said.

The Strolling Piano is performing every single day at the Nebraska State Fair.

What are the key trends in the packaging industry today? Cagnard: Moving away from plastic and favoring both metal and fiber-based packaging is an increasing trend for the industry in both primary and secondary packaging. Along with that the replacement of material of concerns such as bisphenols PVC PFAS styrene mineral oil and hexavalent chromium is key in the development of innovative solutions to address both safety and sustainability concerns while providing appealing solutions for consumers. McCaulley: Also the recyclability and elimination of materials of concern in food and beverage packaging is an ever-increasing trend as more and more consumers are concerned about wellness in the wake of COVID.



2. How can new coatings enable packaging designers and converters to meet the challenges created by these market trends and regulations? What are some of the most exciting opportunities you see? McCaulley: The directions for what may and may not go into my single-stream recycle cart are bewildering. I look forward to the day when almost all of the packaging that enters my home can be put in the bin. New coating technology will be key to developing more readily recyclable packaging. For example better barrier coatings are needed to expand the addressable application space of fiber-based packaging for food. Cagnard: In metal packaging the industry has always been able to decrease metal thickness and increase line speed to improve efficiency. Coating technology always had to adapt to fulfill the requirements. To illustrate the tin plate used in can coatings is going to remove its hexavalent chromium passivation treatment and that creates an adhesion challenge for the existing coatings. At the same time it creates an opportunity for new and greener coating technology to be implemented including safer solvents.



3. How can raw material suppliers and coating formulators help shift some of the negative perceptions from consumers regarding the safety of packaged food items? McCaulley: We must develop new products that contain no intentionally added materials of concern and minimal migration of non-intentionally added substances (NIAS). This should be backed up with more transparency about what’s in these products. Lastly we have to do a better job communicating to consumers the progress that is being made. Cagnard: Raw material suppliers not only stay on top of current regulations but also anticipate what would be the next material of concern that will come under scrutiny. Working with all the various players of the value chain in a candid and transparent way would prevent some of the negative perceptions from consumers.



4. It seems consumer and brand owner preference as well as increasing regulatory pressure is driving conversion to BPA-NI linings in food and beverages. What is your view of the current situation and the future? Cagnard: BPA-NI conversion is already achieved at a high rate in both the U.S. and Europe and other regions are getting ready to convert. The recent EFSA proposal is likely to accelerate the conversion process including for exterior coatings. McCaulley: I agree with Alain. The recent EFSA proposal to reduce the tolerable daily intake (TDI) of BPA by a factor of 100000 in the EU is likely to accelerate and broaden the adoption of BPA-NI linings in food and beverage cans. Many U.S. consumers might be surprised to learn that nearly all food cans produced here are already BPA-NI. I expect this to be true in much of the world in the next 5 to 10 years.



5. Do you think consumers and therefore brand owners retailers. and brand are willing to pay more for more sustainable packaging? McCaulley: The value chains for packaged foods beverages and other consumer goods are very long. Even a substantially higher cost for sustainable packaging coating ingredients if it were passed on to consumers would not have a noticeable impact on retail price. Cagnard: At the consumer level BPA-NI conversion results in increased coatings cost of a cent or less for a food or beverage can so it will not be noticed. However at the retailer and brand level even one cent times billions of cans mean a substantial increase in spending. With pressure from nongovernmental organizations and sustainability commitments taken by brand owners and retailers some higher costs will be required to honor such commitments.



6. How can raw material suppliers help coating formulators meet future needs in packaging coatings and inks? Cagnard: This is achieved through intimate collaboration with formulators but also downstream in the value chain to anticipate future material of concerns or future regulatory changes. Through a strong commitment to both innovation and sustainability Eastman is supporting its customers globally with in-depth technical and market expertise. McCaulley: To hit a moving target we have to aim in front of it. We must understand emerging market needs and the regulatory landscape so that we can develop new materials that deserve a lasting place in the market. At Eastman we do this through active engagement with all points in the value chain as well as NGOs trade associations and governments.",,,,,,,,,,,,

Queen Elizabeth has over 1000 employees some of whom have come forward to describe how Her Majesty treats her staff members. Here’s what the Queen’s former staffers said about what it was like working for the royal family.

Former staff members described working for Queen Elizabeth and the royal family

A couple of Queen Elizabeth’s former employees shared their experiences working with the royal family. One said the family makes staff feel “recognized” for their “hard work.”

“One of the best things about working for the royal family is when you are recognized for your hard work” Grant Harrold former butler to Prince Charles and Duchess Camilla told Town & Country. “The family would show this by inviting staff to Christmas parties tea parties and balls. A fond memory of mine is getting to dance with the Queen at the Gillies Ball in the Balmoral ballroom.”

Another staff member Simon Morgan who served as a Royal Protection Officer from 2006 to 2013 described the perks of working with royalty.

“You find yourself in places you wouldn’t normally have access to” Morgan said. “You are very fortunate to be in these positions to travel by private charter or travel first class or to be on super-yachts or to eat in some of the nicest restaurants the world can offer.”

A former royal staff member said his first meeting with Queen Elizabeth was ‘really lovely’

Another former staffer Steven Kaye worked as Queen Elizabeth’s royal footman for three and a half years. He opened up about how Her Majesty treated him when he first met her.

“She said welcome to the Royal household I’m looking forward to seeing you next week and she had obviously been briefed about my mother who is a machinist for a company based in Long Eaton where I’m from” Kaye told Slingo. “They have the Royal warrant of appointment for providing soft furniture to the Royal household and the Queen spoke about how she knew my mother was working for a Royal warranted company.”

Kaye added “She’s obviously briefed to make you feel at ease and like she knows something about you. It was really lovely.”

Queen Elizabeth: Does the Queen give her royal staff gifts at Christmas? Protocol revealedhttps://t.co/XukBUUgeHQ pic.twitter.com/0Apq62hNeA — Daily Express (@Daily_Express) December 20 2019

Her Majesty gives her employees the same Christmas gift every year

Working for the royal family has many perks and one is the annual Christmas gift Queen Elizabeth gives all of her staff members.

Each December the Queen gives each staffer a Christmas pudding a greeting card and a gift or book voucher loaded with a dollar amount that varies depending on how long the employee has worked for her (per Reader’s Digest).

Queen Elizabeth also gives the presents to each staff member directly. A senior officer calls out each employee’s name in order of their rank starting with the most senior. Her Majesty then hands each gift to the staff members personally. It’s a tradition the Queen has upheld since she took the throne in 1952."

What about a playsuit sported by Olivia Rodrigo or cropped jeans from Maisie Williams?

The chance to buy clothes directly from a celebrity has become a new shopping option thanks to a slew of famous names teaming up with websites that sell secondhand clothes.

The celebrity stylist Harry Lambert who counts Harry Styles and actor Emma Corrin as clients launched his first personal store on pre-loved clothes website Depop last week. In the same week the US resale site ThredUp unveiled its latest partnership starring Stranger Things actor Priah Ferguson. Created to discourage Gen Z from buying fast fashion it offers a “confessional hotline” where users will hear advice directly from Ferguson on how to make smarter choices. They can also shop from a curated edit of secondhand pieces chosen by the actor.

Elsewhere the Love Island finalist Tasha Ghouri has recently been named as eBay’s first ever “pre-loved ambassador”. This marks the first non-fast fashion brand partnership to come out of the cult TV series.

Items from Lambert’s wardrobe clearout included a yellow Prada tote bag (£1000) a black hoodie (£140) from cult London streetwear brand Liam Hodges and a bespoke T-shirt (£90) made for Big Little Lies star Alexander Skarsgård for a magazine shoot. Within hours most of the items had sold. “The first piece to sell was the Harry Styles cover of Beauty Papers. It is an authentic and limited-edition biannual magazine so a very rare collectors’ item. I’m not surprised it was snapped up pretty quickly” Lambert says.

Celebrity collaborations with brands aren’t new but this latest crop marks a notable change in the types of partnerships stars are willing to promote. A-listers are quickly starting to associate themselves with the resale market.

“They can see the backlash against fast fashion so they want to align themselves with the tidal wave of where the next generation of consumers want to spend their time and money” says Alex Goat CEO of youth culture specialist Livity. “It is circular in a way. Celebrities have followers in their own right but they are also gaining more influence by being on these resale platforms.”

For younger shoppers the combination of celebrity plus resale is a winning one. “It’s like borrowing a piece of memorabilia from the Hard Rock Cafe” explains Dr Carolyn Mair a behavioural psychologist. “As a fan to get an item of clothing a celebrity has owned is the closest thing to touching their body.”

In 2019 when the Kardashian family launched the Kardashian Kloset a dedicated online space to sell their worn clothing they immediately drew criticism for being greedy. Kim’s net worth alone is an estimated $1.4bn. Just two years later it’s no longer taboo. Goat says this is because it makes celebrities feel more relatable – they are just like the sites’ own users who buy and sell items. “Before it may have been seen as desperation whereas nowadays it’s like ‘cool just like me they are part of the circular fashion discussion’.”

Not all celebrities choose to profit from selling their used wares. Lambert decided to give all proceeds of his Depop sales to the LGBTQ+ charity Mermaids. Past collaborators including singers Rodrigo and Charli XCX have given all profits to charity too.

Goat adds that this appeals to the Gen Z sense of authenticity.

Olivia Courtney a 19-year-old marketing trainee from Newcastle follows Lambert on social media because of his association with Styles. As soon as his store went live she bought a £15 tote bag emblazoned with the word “Pleasing” from Styles’s official brand.

“It feels cool to say I bought something from Harry Lambert. I asked if he could write me a small message in it. Knowing that he works with Harry makes it feel more special somehow.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiSmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRhaWx5c3Rhci5jby51ay90ZWNoL25ld3MvZmlyc3QtZ2VuLWlwaG9uZS1jb3VsZC1lYXJuLTI3ODAzNTE00gFOaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZGFpbHlzdGFyLmNvLnVrL3RlY2gvbmV3cy9maXJzdC1nZW4taXBob25lLWNvdWxkLWVhcm4tMjc4MDM1MTQuYW1w?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,First-gen iPhone could earn you thousands of pounds on eBay - but there’s a catch,"It might not feel like it but this year marks 15 years since the launch of the first iPhone.

Packed full of old-hat hardware Apple's first smartphone looks positively ancient stacked next to some of the advanced models the tech giant has released since.

However just because the first iPhone is old by today's standards doesn't mean it's worthless. In fact the first-gen iPhone is becoming increasingly rare. If you have one sitting around in the attic you could potentially make thousands of pounds selling it on eBay to eagle-eyed collectors.

In the right condition original iPhones now sell for up to £18000 online.

One listing for an 8GB Apple iPhone on eBay is currently priced at £16456.00. That might sound like a lot of money but in this case the iPhone is completely unactivated in the box and apparently still in full working condition.

According to the seller it's worth so much because many unopened 1st Gen iPhones are no longer working because a battery which has never been charged degrades over time to the point where it no longer works.

However original iPhones which still work can fetch tens of thousands of pounds. In this case the sellers claim to have carefully unboxed the iPhone and given it a full charge every 3/4 years. They also bought it on the first day that the iPhone was released and kept it in its original packaging.

Other 1st Gen iPhones which don't work can still fetch a few hundred or even a few thousand pounds if they're in the original packaging but unless you've charged yours every few years it's unlikely that the device will still work.

Since the launch of the first iPhone Apple has released more than 34 models. These days they boast an impressive technical spec speed storage space and cameras that were unimaginable in 2007.

Next month it's likely that Apple will launch the latest iteration of its smartphone range the iPhone 14.

It is a mystery as to how the 90-year-old painting ended up in Derian’s possession having been anonymously donated to one of its charity shops among other items.

Today the building is in a state of neglect and awaits the results of a £4 million funding bid to restore it to its former glory.

Derian House assistant shop manager Tony Smalley reunites a 90-year-old painting with Jayne Allman of Banana Enterprise Network after it went missing and was later found on the charity shop's eBay site

When campaigners fighting to save the hall spotted the artwork on the popular auction website they contacted the charity to purchase the relic.

But staff at Derian House gifted the painting to the Rock Hall team happy for it to be placed where it belongs inside the grand building.

The hall which has been empty since 2014 and has nothing of value inside has been subject to theft and vandalism over the past few years.

This prompted husband and wife team Jayne and Christopher Allman of Banana Enterprise Network (the Charity that has been working hard to save Rock Hall since January 2020) to search for items that could have once been displayed within the hall’s walls.

The pair met with Derian House assistant shop manager Tony Smalley to collect the masterpiece and in exchange donated some goody bags and gifts for the hospice’s shops.

Not only that but the Save Rock Hall project raised money for Derian House at their latest event that saw over 150 supporters and volunteers gather in Moses Gate Country Park nearby Rock Hall to spell out ""Save Rock Hall"" with their bodies.

The Save Rock Hall Project was born in 2014 when Jayne and Chris began to look for a permanent headquarters for their charity Banana Enterprise Network and they came across the historic structure.

The couple plan to turn Rock Hall into a vibrant destination venue for the community.

Jayne CEO and Founder of Banana Enterprise Network said: “We’re so grateful to Derian House for donating Ernest Holden’s painting to us.

“We’re very pleased that it can now be restored to its former glory and hopefully if things go to plan it can hang proudly inside Rock Hall.

“When Derian handed over the painting we wanted to thank them and so brought them some gifts that they can sell in their retail shops. We hope to support their work in the future.”

Andrew Upton-Ford Head of Retail and Online Sales added: “We had no idea that the painting that was donated anonymously was an unknown piece of Lancashire history. You really never know what treasures you might find in our shops.

“We were pleased to be able to return the painting to Jayne and Chris and wish them all the best in their mission to restore Rock Hall.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiU2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxpbmNvbG5zaGlyZWxpdmUuY28udWsvbmV3cy9sb2NhbC1uZXdzL3JhcmUtNTBwLWNvaW4tc2VsbHMtZWJheS03NTE5NDMy0gFXaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cubGluY29sbnNoaXJlbGl2ZS5jby51ay9uZXdzL2xvY2FsLW5ld3MvcmFyZS01MHAtY29pbi1zZWxscy1lYmF5LTc1MTk0MzIuYW1w?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Rare 50p coin sells on eBay for 274 times its value with thousands more still in circulation,"Sign up to our free email alerts for the top daily stories sent straight to your e-mail

A rare 50p coin has sold online for £137 and there are stills thousands more out there in circulation. The rare coin bagged its owner 274 times its original value as collectors look to snap up the rare piece.

The Kew Gardens 50p is perhaps the most popular coin for collectors. This is due in part to its scarcity with only 210000 ever being minted and also because of its stunning design.

The coin the famous Chinese Pagoda at the Royal Botanic Garden on the tails side. The Queen's face features as normal on the other side.

A total of 10 bids were placed on the eBay listing before the winning bid of £137 was made. In recent weeks we have spotted the same coins selling for as much as £270.

Kew Gardens 50p - selling advice

If you've been lucky enough to find a Kew Gardens 50p in your change and want to sell it then its important to check the date on the coin first. This is because in 2019 the coin was reminted as part of a celebration from the Royal Mint of 50 years of the 50p coin and this version doesn't sell for anywhere near as much.

According to the change-checking website Coin Hunter the Kew Gardens 50p piece normally sells for between £150.89 and £161.50. This coin has sold for slightly under-value and we've spotted a few coins selling for similar amounts at the moment so you may be better off waiting to sell but if you're looking to purchase the coin this could be the perfect time.

If you're looking to begin your own collection it is also important to make sure you're not falling for any scams. Coin enthusiast website Change Checker has some tips on the best ways to ensure a Kew Gardens 50p coin is genuine.

They say the important things to look out for include the 'frosted design' or 'very high relief' on the design which can be used on fakes. They have also warned that circulated coins that are 'too shiny' could be fakes seeing as they have been in circulation since 2009 and most will have lost their shine by now.

It's big business,"Edwin Low has built his business around authentic and genuine products.

It's led him to becoming the founder of the Secret Sneaker Store Australia's biggest sneaker marketplace for guaranteed genuine limited-edition sneakers and apparel.

Together with his team of 35 they sniff the real from fake an industry worth billions.

""There is no textbook on how to spot a fake and it's often a game of cat and mouse"" Low said.

Authenticity is everything

The Melbourne founder said his own personal experience of being scammed led him to starting up the business back in 2017.

Low was previously scammed after buying a pair of rare sneakers worth $500 from a seller in a Facebook group which turned out to be fake.

""I didn't think it would ever happen to me until it did"" Low told nine.com.au.

""The seller had a legitimate Facebook profile but when I tried to get a refund – he instantly blocked me.

""It was a really frustrating experience.

""I spoke told my friends and was shocked when they said almost everyone buying sneakers on social media would eventually run into a scammer them included.""

After that experience the 31-year-old quit his job as a pharmacist and launched the Secret Sneaker Store.

The outlet now protects customers from buying fake sneakers online.

""Everything we sell is guaranteed"" Low said.

""The store operates on a consignment business model where we sell sneakers on behalf of the people who are lucky enough to get their hands on these coveted 'kicks'.

""We assess each seller for their history within our sneaker community network which in itself weeds out people selling fakes.

""They can bring the shoe to one of our four locations we agree on a price and we put it on the shelf. When it sells we take a commission and the owner is paid out the rest.""

'Scammers are everywhere'

Low said it was ""nearly impossible"" to purchase limited release items due to the tactics of 'Sneaker Botters' and the ""proliferation of fakes circulating online"".

He said Sneaker Botters were renowned for using technology to jump the 'online queue' and purchase in demand items.

""Sneaker botters dictate how much these limited-edition sneakers sell for"" he said.

""They buy in bulk.

""Unless you have special software that circumvents the systems put in place by the online stores that sell these rare shoes it is near impossible to buy these sneakers at their recommended retail sale price.

""On top of this there are so many fakes circulating around the world when you buy shoes from unverified online marketplaces – you are rolling the dice and might be buying a fake.""

Low said fake sneakers often look similar to the real ones but said the materials and workmanship were inferior.

He said most came from unregulated factories with inhumane work practices.

""Everything we resell goes through a rigorous authentication process tagging shoes with our tamper proof authenticity tag to mark them as legitimate"" he said.

""It's a constant battle against scammers for us.""

Since opening five years ago the store has authenticated over 100000 pairs of limited-edition sneakers."

Video game producer Electronic Arts (EA 0.02%) has performed well for investors in 2022. The stock has significantly outpaced the S&P 500 index year to date down only 4% compared to the index decline of 13%.

The video game industry is attractive for investors because of the ability of the most popular games to keep players entertained and spending money on content updates for long stretches of time. EA's top games are delivering exactly that in a challenging economic environment.

Here are three reasons to consider buying the stock now.

1. Live services growth

The most important indicator of how well a video game company is keeping players engaged with certain titles is the money they spend on extra content while playing a game. Companies use different terms for in-game spending but EA calls it live services.

Live services refer to what games have become in the gaming industry. Games are no longer one-time sale opportunities; they are year-round services. Players stick with the same game for months at a time playing online with friends and that means lucrative sales opportunities for digitally delivered content updates.

EA includes several items in its live services revenue such as subscriptions extra content and other revenue earned outside the base games. The extra-content portion of live services such as in-game spending nearly doubled to $3.9 billion over the last four years according to Statista.

EA expects total bookings for fiscal 2023 to grow 6% year over year to about $8 billion so growth in extra content will serve as an important driver.

EA's FIFA and Apex Legends games are key contributors of extra-content sales that still have opportunities to grow. The interest in soccer globally has been a key momentum driver of FIFA. The best-selling soccer title just completed a record first quarter in Asia and management is looking to build on that momentum with the upcoming release of FIFA 23.

2. Apex Legends is on fire

EA's player network grew to nearly 600 million players in the fiscal first quarter of 2023. The growth stands out against the decline in monthly active users at rival game producer Activision Blizzard which has seen its player base decline to 361 million from 408 million in the same quarter last year.

Apex Legends has been stiff competition for Activision's Call of Duty over the last year. In the second quarter Activision reported a decline in in-game bookings which the company credited to lower spending in Call of Duty: Vanguard compared to the previous release in the series.

Meanwhile Apex Legends has experienced consistent growth since launching in early 2019. The number of viewers that watch others play the game on Amazon's Twitch streaming platform has increased from fewer than 20000 in 2019 to nearly 100000 this year according to Statista.

The growing viewership on Twitch mirrors the game's contribution to EA's top line. Apex Legends posted double-digit growth in net bookings in the last quarter and EA just launched a mobile version of the game which should keep interest growing.

3. The best value in gaming

EA has the right mix of sports action shooters and lifestyle games (e.g. The Sims) to deliver consistent returns for investors. The company seems to have established a nice rhythm of releasing frequent content updates for its games that encourages players to keep coming back for more. This gives EA recurring revenue streams that are particularly valuable during challenging economic times.

The stock trades at a modest valuation of just 17 times forward earnings estimates. That is a discount to the S&P 500 average price-to-earnings multiple of 21. The relatively lower valuation makes EA the best value among the top video game stocks right now.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmdpYW50ZnJlYWtpbnJvYm90LmNvbS9nYW1lcy9hbWF6b24tcHVyY2hhc2luZy1lbGVjdHJvbmljLWFydHMtZ2FtaW5nLmh0bWzSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Amazon Purchasing Electronic Arts In Huge Gaming Acquisition,"What don't they own?

By Jason Collins |

Market and financial experts have been warning us for years that the consolidation of the gaming industry is inevitable as the industry continues to grow. With every passing year the things that the experts have warned us about are coming to pass: Sony has abandoned exclusives and is acquiring smaller studios establishing a foothold into the PC and MMO gaming markets. Microsoft is acquiring Blizzard in a historic acquisition and the latest rumors suggest that Amazon is acquiring Electronic Arts.

Earlier today USA Today claimed that Amazon was planning to make an offer to purchase Electronic Arts — one of the gaming industry giants — in bidding in which reportedly Disney and Apple were supposed to partake in as well. However according to a report published by For The Win Amazon is not expected to make a bid for Electronic Arts and neither company has offered an official statement regarding the rumors leaving gaming news media in disarray as to what’s actually going on.

And there is some conflicting information regarding said rumors and reports. While USA Today has claimed that Amazon was planning on bidding For The Win cited CNBC Now as their source debunking the rumor. However an earlier report from VGC has stated that Amazon is planning to bid alongside Apple Disney and of all companies Comcast-NBCUniversal (CNBC). While it’s virtually impossible to know which side is acting as a credible source at this point we’ll take the liberty to discuss both eventualities.

Amazon’s alleged acquisition of EA doesn’t really come as a surprise to anyone considering that the conglomerate has been trying to break into the gaming industry for years. So far they only offered third-party titles on their Prime-Gaming platform the company’s main Steam competitor. However by gaining access to Electronic Art’s assets Amazon could start offering established gaming titles and their sequels to its customers and gain access to highly-experienced gaming developers that would adapt the company-owned franchises — like the upcoming Rings of Powers — into video games.

From Amazon’s The Lords of the Rings: The Rings of Power

On the other hand CNBC is apparently trying to refute Amazon’s involvement in the acquisition of Electronic Arts maintaining that Amazon’s involvement is just a rumor and nothing else. Now it’s entirely possible that CNBC is actually buying EA thus negating Amazon’s involvement or the company is trying to lower EA’s stock market price — which climbed 15% after Amazon’s involvement was reported by USA Today — before bidding. After CNBC’s report negated Amazon’s bidding the price of Electronic Arts stocks went down by approx. 6%.

It would seem that Electronic Arts is actively pursuing a sale or a merger of the company especially after Microsoft announced its acquisition of Activision Blizzard for an eyewatering $69 billion. EA had previously negotiated with CNBC about a possible merger/acquisition with CNBC looking to assume control over the combined entity. Apparently the negotiations failed as both sides couldn’t agree on price and structure and the entire deal went under.

At this point the status of the rumored acquisition/merger remains unknown and all aforementioned companies including both Amazon and Electronic Arts haven’t commented on the matter. The only company that was vocal about it was CNBC.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMifWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmhpbmR1c3RhbnRpbWVzLmNvbS90ZWNobm9sb2d5L2lzLWFtYXpvbi1hY3F1aXJpbmctc3BvcnRzLXZpZGVvLWdhbWVzLWNyZWF0b3ItZWxlY3Ryb25pYy1hcnRzLTEwMTY2MTU4NTk1NDIyNy5odG1s0gGBAWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmhpbmR1c3RhbnRpbWVzLmNvbS90ZWNobm9sb2d5L2lzLWFtYXpvbi1hY3F1aXJpbmctc3BvcnRzLXZpZGVvLWdhbWVzLWNyZWF0b3ItZWxlY3Ryb25pYy1hcnRzLTEwMTY2MTU4NTk1NDIyNy1hbXAuaHRtbA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Is Amazon acquiring sports video games creator Electronic Arts?,"Online retail giant Amazon is not expected to bid for taking over video game creator Electronic Giants (EA) which is the creator of popular games including the FIFA soccer series.

The company has rejected reports that it would make an offer for the videogame publisher Reuters quoted a CNBC report. After the news of a speculated takeover spread like a wildfire the EA shares jumped by 15 per cent in the premarket trading. The shares were up by four per cent in the early trading Reuters reported.



However both Amazon and Electronic Arts said they don't comment on rumours and speculations related to merger and acquisitions.

Earlier this month Amazon had offered to buy Roomba vacuum maker iRobot Corp for $1.7 billion. The online retail giant has hit the acquisition trail and is looking to diversify its business under new chief executive officer Andy Jassy.

Amazon owns the videogame live-streaming platform Twitch. It has also purchased MGM Studios the maker of blockbuster ‘Rocky’ and ‘James Bond’ movies for $8.5 billion.

Earlier this year Microsoft bought Activision Blizzard the maker of games like Call of Duty and Candy Crush for a whopping $68.7 billion. The new deals are also blurring the line between personal computer and mobile gaming companies and come against the backdrop of a struggling global gaming industry as the pandemic-fueled surge in demand ebbs.

The global gaming market is expected to grow just 2% in 2022 from a year ago data from research firm Newzoo showed a far cry from the 23% growth clocked in 2020.

EA has forecast lacklustre adjusted sales numbers saying it was not ""completely immune"" to recession.

Its shares had lost about 3% to Thursday's close compared with a nearly 30% drop for Take-Two.

EA has yet to release any major new titles this year and is still grappling with fallout from Battlefield 2042 which debuted last November to mediocre reviews and poor fan reception.

Department of Human Services to announce new contracts,"Editor’s note: This story has been corrected to show that Anthem changed its name to Elevance Health Inc.

Iowa health care providers serving Medicaid patients hope increased competition will improve health outcomes patient choice and quality of care for poor and disabled Iowans.

But after a sometimes-tumultuous six years of the privatized Iowa Medicaid program — which saw the exit of two for-profit insurers over heavy financial losses — providers and critics warn adding new insurers could cause disruption and patient confusion.

“We hope that patients benefit with appropriate management and appropriate care and quick prior authorizations” said Joe Lock president and CEO of Eastern Iowa Health Center in Cedar Rapids.

The federally qualified health center serves patients regardless of their ability to pay including vulnerable children and adults in Benton Linn Jones Iowa and Johnson counties.

Roughly 70 percent of the more than 50000 patient visits Eastern Iowa Health Center will see this year rely on Medicaid for their insurance Lock said.

“It remains really difficult for people with severe profound disabilities of all different kinds and it’s going to be confusing” he said. “It’s going to be confusing for patients and it’s going to be hard on our staff as well just to help patients navigate things that should be fairly routine and simple. And often they’re just not.”

Lock though said he’s hopeful that increased competition will “make everybody work harder and ideally work harder for their patients which is what everybody wants.”

Five insurers have submitted bids to join Iowa’s $6 billion-plus Medicaid and Children’s Health Insurance Program or CHIP as state officials search for another managed-care organization.

The Iowa Department of Human Services which oversees the Medicaid program is expected to procure contracts with up to four bidders to provide care through the Iowa Health Link Medicaid program — meaning up to two additional managed-care organizations could join the state program in the near future.

However the final number of awarded contracts under the procurement will be up to the discretion of DHS according to its request for proposals.

The contracts are worth approximately $6.5 billion annually. Awards are expected to be announced Wednesday Aug. 31 with implementation to begin July 1 2023.

New contracts will run for four years with one possible two-year extension.

The five insurance companies who submitted bids to provide managed-care services are:

Aetna a private insurance company headquartered in Connecticut doing business as Aetna Better Health of Iowa

Current Iowa Medicaid managed-care organization Amerigroup Iowa

CareSource Iowa — The Dayton Ohio-based CareSource is a nonprofit managed-care organization

Molina Healthcare of Iowa — Long Beach Calif.-based Fortune 500 company provides managed health care services to approximately 5.2 million members under the Medicaid and Medicare programs and through the state insurance marketplaces

UCare Iowa doing business as Ucare is a Minneapolis-based nonprofit insurer providing health coverage and services in Minnesota and western Wisconsin.

Medicaid is jointly funded by states and the federal government to provide health insurance primarily for lower-income individuals under the age of 65 and those with disabilities.

Medicaid health benefits in Iowa currently are administered by two managed-care organizations — Amerigroup Iowa a subsidiary of Indiana-based Elevance Health Inc. and Iowa Total Care a subsidiary of St. Louis-based Centene.

Amerigroup’s contract will end in 2023 and Iowa Total Care’s contract is up in 2025.

As of July Amerigroup and Iowa Total Care served nearly 790000 Medicaid and CHIP enrollees. Iowa’s Healthy and Well Kids in Iowa (Hawki) population is served by the same managed-care organizations and included in the total Medicaid population.

Approximately 93 percent of all Iowa Medicaid members are enrolled in a managed-care plan with 7 percent remaining in fee-for-service.

A rocky transition

Iowa’s transition from a state-run system to a managed-care model in 2016 that put private insurance companies in charge of administering Medicaid benefits has been rocky.

The federal Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services postponed the state’s original plan to begin managed care on Jan. 1 2016 saying too many issues remained to safely transfer the care of 560000 poor and disabled residents to three private for-profit insurance companies.

But once implemented in April the new Medicaid program in Iowa known as IA Health Link was plagued by complaints that service suffered payments were not being made to service providers and promised savings never materialized.

Two carriers entered and quickly left the market within the first few years due to financial losses and what they described as chronic underfunding from the state.

CareSource officials however told The Gazette in September of last year that they believe Iowa’s Medicaid market is now financially viable for at least four managed-care plans and were excited to help Iowa “re-imagine what Medicaid can do for Iowans.”

“As a nonprofit organization we focus on our members and the communities we serve instead of shareholders. This makes CareSource unique in Iowa’s current managed care environment” CareSource President and CEO Erhardt Preitauer said in a statement at the time.

“Our industry-leading social programs complex care capabilities and core operations will result in improved quality and health outcomes for Iowa’s Medicaid population while also providing a better experience for both members and the providers who care for them.”

Last year state Auditor Rod Sand issued a report alleging the state’s privatized Medicaid system had illegally denied services or care to program recipients and the both private insurance companies managing the system violated terms of their contracts with the state.

Sand’s report was based on an investigation that examined cases from 2013 through 2019 which he said found a massive increase in illegal denials of care by managed care organizations.

The head of Iowa’s Medicaid program called the audit “incorrect and flawed” stating the report inaccurately compared the previous “fee-for-service” system with a managed-care approach the Associated Press reported.

Medicaid Director Elizabeth Matney questioned Sand’s methodology stating the comparison failed to factor improvements built into the manged-care organizations’ appeals process.

Since then things have stabilized said Lock and Aaron Todd CEO of the Iowa Primary Care Association in Des Moines.

The association provides technical assistance and training to Iowa’s 13 community health centers and one migrant health program.

Both said by and large payments are being made on time and issues resolved more quickly with managed-care organizations that have been more responsive.

Getting there though has required beefed up staffing to work with the insurance companies and pushing them for adequate service and on-time payments.

“The market is considerably more stable than it has been” Todd said. “The state has stepped up and is funding the program at a level that is significantly more sustainable than it was when it was first rolled out.”

‘Merry-go-round’ of different providers

Adding two or three more MCOs would ensure patient choice and gird against the state having to provide services directly should another plan fail or leave the state. Doing so however will be disruptive to many low-income Iowa families Todd said.

“It’s really going to come down to the way in which the state decides to make this transition” he said. “Are they going to reassign patients who are already with a current plan or are they going to do it through some type of attrition process as there’s churn with Medicaid patients?”

Todd noted that will be problematic for Iowa Medicaid patients at a time when its also preparing for the end of a federal public health emergency that could impact coverage for tens of thousands of Iowa Medicaid and CHIP recipients.

The health emergency required Iowa Medicaid to take certain measures to protect Medicaid recipients during the COVID-19 pandemic. Those included waiving monthly premiums expanding access to certain services and continuing coverage for those in the program even if their income changes.

Those protections are expected to expire this fall. Once the federal government ends the public health emergency Iowa DHS goes back to its normal eligibility process — meaning tends of thousands of Iowans no longer eligible for Medicaid but still in the program because of the public health emergency could lose benefits and be forced to find other insurance plans.

“We’re going through a big period of transition for folks and this is coming at the same time” Todd said. “And so it’s really important that the communication is really clear.""

Iowa House Democratic Leader Jennifer Konfrst D-Windsor Heights agreed.

“Adding to more (managed-care organizations) to the mix will certainly add confusion — patient confusion and provider confusion” Konfrst said Thursday during an Iowa Democratic Party weekly conference call with reporters. “And there needs to be a much better system of communication to those people who are getting these services.”

Konfrst added Iowans served by Medicaid don’t have the means to “wait for this system that we’ve been experimenting with for several years to figure itself out.”

“Iowans deserve a system that works for them” she said. “And whether we have two or three or four so far we’re not seeing that its doing what we need for it to do.”

Democratic state Sen. Herman Quirmbach of Ames joined Konfrst on the conference call.

“This merry-go-round of different insurance providers has done nothing but destabilize the patient-doctor relationship” Quirmbach said. “I’ve had so many calls so many different cases from my constituents of people whose continuity of care has been interrupted by that.

After his score to tight end Ryan Griffin in the first quarter the second-year signal caller kept his foot on the gas pedal and led yet another scoring drive.

Following a missed field goal by the Browns Fields and the Bears went on a drive that took just five plays and spanned 52 yards ending with a touchdown. Wide receiver Dante Pettis shook his defender out of his cleats on a post corner route in the end zone getting open for an easy touchdown from Fields to go up by two scores.

Pettis has been active during this game on both offense and special teams. He has three catches for 37 yards and has been fielding punts. He’s fighting for a roster spot and is showing everything he can in the preseason finale.

Fields meanwhile has been on point all day and has just two incompletions through three drives. He’s 9-of-11 for 102 yards and two touchdowns with a quarterback rating of 144.5. The Bears lead the Browns 14-0 midway through the second quarter.

Clarion Ledger

“Get out now.”

That was the message from Jackson Mayor Chokwe Lumumba to residents of low-lying areas in Jackson during a Saturday press conference at the Jackson Command Center.

Moments after Gov. Tate Reeves declared a state of emergency for Jackson and areas affected by recent flash flooding and thunderstorms as well as areas expected to be flooded by the Pearl River that is now projected to crest at 36 feet on Monday morning some 24 hours earlier than originally estimated Lumumba said “If you are able to get out of your home do it now.”

“The daylight hours we have left to get things done are almost over” he said.

Lumumba said as many as 150 homes could be affected.

Reeves made his announcements in a Saturday morning press conference ahead of the expected flooding in the Jackson area as well as areas south of Jackson.

The new flood crest of 36 feet as early as Sunday night or Monday morning was updated Saturday morning after Jackson and central Mississippi have experienced heavy rainfall throughout the month of August and the reservoir is at capacity and is releasing more water into the lower Pearl River.

“We are 12 to 18 hours from the peak of the flow coming into the reservoir and 24 hours away from the flood reaching the spillway” reservoir general John Sigman said. “(The reservoir depth) is already at a scary place and and it is getting scarier by the moment.”

Chad Entremont a meteorologist at the National Weather Service said the forecast for the next 48 hours is for scattered showers throughout the area that he does not expect to negatively impact the rise of water in the reservoir.

Lumumba touched on several issues for residents to focus on before peak flood waters prevent evacuation and other planning measures.

Jackson Transit will be available to help resident evacuate as long as streets are passable.

Entergy will strategically cut off power in flooded areas.

The Jackson evacuation shelter is open at 3000 St. Charles Avenue.

He and Reeves also talked at length about flood victims removing important documentation from their home or placing them high enough that flood waters cannot reach them. They also discussed taking pictures on everything in homes to be prepared in the event there needs to be an insurance claim made.

Lumumba said the New Jerusalem Church across from the precinct 4 of the Jackson Police Department was being made available to allow people to park vehicles away from dangerous flood waters.

Jackson City Council members are in charge of handing out bottled water in their districts and will communicate plans with their constituents.

Reeves also stressed a sense of urgency that accompanies the new weather information reported Saturday morning.

“I do want to highlight that this new prediction as of this morning is anticipated to crest in the Jackson area about 24 hours earlier than was anticipated” Reeves said.

Dozens of streets in downtown Jackson and businesses around the Town Creek area of Jackson will flood Reeves said.

“There will be streets and homes in northeast Jackson subdivisions near the river that may also flood” Reeves said adding the projected flooding will be similar to flooding that occurred in Jackson in 2020. The state’s response efforts are already underway Reeves said in a press statement released after the press conference.

“MEMA has deployed 126000 sandbags in preparation for this flooding. Mississippians can get more information on how to get sandbags by contacting their county or city. “Additionally search and rescue teams are on standby and are prepared to respond at the request of local emergency managers.”

He advised people to monitor road conditions by visiting the Mississippi Department of Transportation website.

Mississippi Emergency Management Director Stephen McCraney said people should prepare now.

“Moving up 24 hours is significant” McCraney said. “You’ve got a limited amount of daylight. Now you've got the rest of the day on Saturday and you've got the rest of the day on Sunday during daylight hours to try to prepare yourself for 2020 (levels). If you were in a flooded area in 2020 that should be your watermark that should be what you're planning for.”

Officials also encouraged people to gather important insurance documents and to take photographs of valuable items for insurance records.

How to Prepare Before a Flood

Collect important documents records and valuable items and to move them to a safe place.

Gather important insurance documents

Take photographs of valuable items for insurance records.

Sandbags available

Sandbags are already available at 4225 Michael Avalon Street in Jackson until 5 p.m. today and will be available for pickup on Saturday and Sunday from 9 a.m. until 6 p.m.

Shelters

One shelter for those fleeing flood waters is open at the Jackson Police Academy at 3000 St. Charles Street. Another shelter will be opened by the city and announced as needed.

School buses

Jackson Public Schools expects there to be some disruption of school buses in the coming days but won't know until they know the exact places where there will be flooding. They urged parents and students to be aware of any updates as they come.

How to get help information

Jackson officials say if anyone has issues with mobility or transportation to leave their home because of potential flooding they should call 311 as soon as possible. If residents can't get through on 311 the city advises them to call the Jackson Police Department's non-emergency number at 601-960-1234 or the Hinds County Emergency Operations Center at 601-968-6771. These numbers are available 24 hours.

Security and building projects in the Brookhaven School District are “rounding third and heading for home” according to architect Steve Cox.

Cox gave updates on the projects to the School Board during its regular meeting Tuesday.

“The security project is 99 percent complete” Cox said. “The contractor is awaiting the arrival of some materials but we’re almost there.”

The new construction at Lipsey Middle and Alexander Junior High have both been inspected by the City Cox said and are ready to turn over to the schools to add whatever equipment they need to.

A hallway in Lipsey still needs its floor replaced but the contractor has been authorized to go ahead with it working around the traffic needs of the school.

“The band hall and addition at the Elementary School are very close to complete” Cox said. “I would say 85 to 90 percent complete. It will probably be complete by the next board meeting.”

Four doors in the high school were missed in the original list for repair or upgrades. Two need replacing and two need additional security equipment. The board approved going ahead with that addition to the project.

“Security is obviously the most important issue. We’ve got to expedite this as soon as possible” Board chair Patrick Brown said.

Brown urged Cox to keep them better informed as to progress delays and any other issue he comes across. The original completion date was set for July 15 more than five weeks ago.

“We were not officially asked to extend the deadline” Brown said. “We appreciate y’all. Just keep us aware of what’s happening.”

The projects are expected to be complete at each campus no later than mid-October at which time the board will take an official tour of the facilities.

In other business:

• Superintendent Rod Henderson informed the board that “a better solution” was needed for the high school and district office campus in case of power outages. A battery-powered backup is currently in place but is not sufficient to “keep the power going and keep the network up” he said.

“When the power is out the phone lines also go down” Henderson said. “Entergy has done a great job helping us out but we need a more permanent solution.”

Henderson said the district plans to purchase a large generator which will be located outside the high school’s main building enclosed in a new walled structure to match the school’s existing façade.

• The board approved Brookhaven Elementary to accept the donation of $800 worth of wireless headsets donated by Consistency Beyond Limitations.

• The board approved fundraising effort requests from the BHS Student Council BHS Diamond Club and BHS Track Team as well as an out-of-state trip request from the BHS Band to San Antonio/Austin Texas.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMigAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5jbGFyaW9ubGVkZ2VyLmNvbS9zdG9yeS9uZXdzL2Jsb2dzLzIwMjIvMDgvMjcvamFja3Nvbi1tcy1yYWluLXdlYXRoZXItcGVhcmwtcml2ZXItZmxvb2RpbmctbGl2ZS11cGRhdGVzLzY1NDU4Njg1MDA3L9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Live updates: Gov.

Officials urge preparedness concerns over Ross Barnett Reservoir

Officials have said some roadways in low-lying areas are already flooded and have encouraged residents of affected areas to prepare their homes and evacuate immediately.

National Weather Service Advanced Hydrologic Prediction Service

A main concern is rain in areas above the Ross Barnett Reservoir causing more water to flow into the reservoir from the Pearl River. Officials have said the reservoir is nearing maximum capacity and they are releasing water necessary to keep the reservoir level from breeching the levy.

During a Friday afternoon press conference John Sigman reservoir general manager said his agency at Pearl River Water will do what it can but that nothing is certain.

""A whole lot of water has come into the reservoir and it has to go through"" Sigman said. ""What comes in has to go out. We can retain very little water. But we are and will continue to hold as much as possible and we will use all of the capacity in the lake that we have.""

Designed by Solomon Cordwell Buenz and developed by EQT Exeter with Studio Bryan Hanes behind the landscape design the 700000-square-foot-plus building is part of Cathedral Square a redevelopment master plan for the block-sized archdiocesan campus around the iconic Cathedral Basilica of Saints Peter and Paul. The building will offer 450000 square feet of office space on floors two through 14. Luxury residential space will span 250000 square feet on floors 15 through 34. The ground level will feature 4500 square feet of retail. No permits have apparently yet been filed so we did not expect to see any construction progress at the site yet we still recently paid a visit to the location to check on its status as we show in the photos below.

The development will include parking for 200 cars as well as a bicycle storage room. The building will be serviced by eight office elevators two residential elevators a freight elevator and a swing passenger-freight elevator within the residential component.

At the time of our visit we found that the parking lot located at the northeast corner of the Archdiocesan Campus is still being used for its intended purposes and discovered no sign of upcoming construction. This stands in great contrast to One Cathedral Square a 244-foot-tall 23-story tower that nears completion at 1701 Race Street at the southeast corner of the campus. One Cathedral Square will offer 273 condominiums as well as street-level retail upon completion.

Two Cathedral Square promises to make a dramatic statement on the Philadelphia skyline while filling in a major street gap at the junction of Center City and Lower North Philadelphia. We look forward to further progress on the development.

EQIX,Equinix,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiP2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZ0LmNvbS9jb250ZW50L2I3MDEyMTViLTljMDUtNDc1YS05MjFjLTdkNWZjNWEwYzBjZNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Will the cloud kill the data centre? Jim Chanos thinks so,"Print this page

Veteran short seller Jim Chanos has a new target in his sight: the humble data centre.

In June Chanos — who won big bets on the downfall of US energy group Enron and the German payments company Wirecard — announced that his eponymous investment firm is raising several hundred million dollars for a fund that will take short positions in US-listed data centre groups.

He argues that the move towards the cloud predominantly driven by Big Tech groups such as Microsoft Amazon and Google is the “enemy” of bricks-and-mortar real estate investment trusts such as Equinix and Digital Realty.

These players buy large swaths of land build vast complexes source major energy contracts and allow companies to lease space in their centres to process their data.

The Big Tech groups by contrast utilise their own equipment and process clients’ data for them in the “public cloud”. Dubbed “hyperscalers” they either store their hardware and server equipment in real estate investment trusts such as Equinix — or increasingly build their own supersized centres to meet ballooning demand for their services. One Microsoft data centre in Chicago spans 700000 sq ft the size of 52 Olympic swimming pools.

Chanos who has also been hurt by a longstanding bet against Tesla believes the tech behemoths which he says account for around two-thirds of data centre demand will increasingly move towards building and running their own real estate. He argues they will do this because the technology used by legacy groups is becoming old and redundant and because cash-rich Big Tech groups can build more cheaply. This will render the independent real estate investment trusts redundant.

But other investors argue the data centre and specialist operators have life in them yet. Nathan Luckey senior managing director of digital infrastructure at Macquarie Asset Management who has spearheaded several recent investments in data centre assets said the best companies are those sitting on prime real estate in strategic locations.

“Hyperscalers are looking for trusted partners where they can house more and more compute power” he argued. “If there is someone who already has land and a property in a market they want to expand into that’s a very relevant factor.”

Billions of dollars in private equity capital have poured into the industry with bulls arguing that traditional data centre groups will remain indispensable given their strong position in top locations and expertise in procuring resources such as power land and labour. They also cite their privileged position as so-called “carrier hotels” an industry term meaning they connect lots of different businesses.

These groups and their PE cheerleaders are wagering that data demand will continue to grow and a wide range of customers — from cloud service providers to banks and government departments — will continue to store at least some of their workloads in traditional data centres.

Last year the world’s biggest private equity firm Blackstone acquired Kansas-headquartered QTS Realty Trust for $10bn while KKR and GI Partners purchased Texas-based CyrusOne for $15bn. Earlier this month Macquarie bought a significant minority stake in British data centre provider Virtus for an undisclosed sum betting that Big Tech groups will be forced to lease as they expand into Europe.

Chanos derided these transactions as “rash” with valuations that were “stretched by any measure” and predicted a “post-takeover hangover” in a presentation.

Cloud business has been the engine of growth for groups such as Amazon Microsoft and Google over the past year. In the first quarter of 2022 Amazon Web Services’ revenue was up 37 per cent year on year to $18.4bn while revenue at Microsoft’s Azure platform increased by 40 per cent.

“The compute workloads for Google and Meta are just unimaginable” said Martijn Blanken chief executive of EXA Infrastructure which supplies networking infrastructure for the hyperscalers. “It’s a scale game and there’s no enterprise that can compete with them.”

By contrast listed US data centre groups have posted healthy — but less impressive — growth. Yet those in the data centre industry argue Chanos’s thesis is dated given that the same arguments have emerged several times over the past 15 years including a highly publicised short position taken against Digital Realty by Highfields Capital Management in 2013. Highfields made money but Digital Realty is still in business.

“There’s a fallacy in the argument that we’re not growing as fast as the cloud providers which means we are threatened by them” said Andy Power president and chief financial officer at Digital Realty. He added that “co-location” groups such as Digital Realty — where one party provides the real estate and customers provide the tech — “enable” the transition to the cloud and have seen an increase in leasing from many hyperscalers in recent years rather than a dip.

Tech groups have made a noticeable shift towards greater leasing over the past six months driven by a handful of key companies including Meta Microsoft ByteDance and Twitter. This uptick has reversed a previous trend towards greater in-house construction.

“I don’t think [hyperscalers] can keep up with the pace of their business on their own” said Charles Meyers chief executive officer of Equinix.

Power added: “These cloud service providers are blessed with lots of capital yes but they have better uses for it honestly.”

Brendan Lynch an analyst at Barclays pointed out that in many metropolitan areas of the US Equinix is the first- or second-largest data centre provider giving the company a higher degree of pricing power. “That’s why we still like Equinix even though we realise there are some risks to our thesis” he said.

One key risk is that should the land labour and energy supply crunches ease Big Tech groups may shift to constructing more of their own data centres.

For independent operators to maintain their appeal differentiation is key argue analysts. Most big businesses use a suite of different services from Gmail to Workday all hosted on different clouds. For all of these software applications to run smoothly together there need to be physical locations where data can pass quickly and seamlessly from one to the other.

Equinix’s “secret sauce” is this networking capability according to Meyers given it is nearly impossible for hyperscalers to replicate.

“Cloud service providers have spent billions building their own data centres” said Nick Del Deo an analyst at MoffettNathanson. “They have not spent a single dollar trying to replicate what Equinix has built.”

So-called “interconnection” constitutes around 35 per cent of Equinix’s earnings as compared to 14 per cent of Digital Realty’s according to MoffettNathanson calculations — though the latter has sought to expand in this market.

By contrast Digital Realty along with private groups CyrusOne and CloudHQ have focused heavily on the bricks-and-mortar business. This segment is more vulnerable to increased competition from the big cloud service providers as well as smaller data centre groups that are being pumped with billions of capital from private equity firms and infrastructure investment funds.

“I do think there may be a glut at some point because everyone and their uncle is building data centres at the moment” said David Friend chief executive of Wasabi a cloud storage company that leases from several data centre groups. “Right now there is an undersupply but it’s going to be like oil prices: everyone is going to drill drill drill — and then it will force prices down until there’s greater consolidation in the market.”

That’s what residents of a mobile home park in Clarkston say about their current living situation.

Megan Green and her family moved into Independence Woods in January 2010 and paid around $300 a month for a space for the mobile home they purchased.

Two years later Utah-based Kingsley Management Corp. purchased the park and that’s when things began to change according to residents. The park was locally-owned before that.

Green said her monthly lot rent has increased to over $700 with additional fees for water and trash services that had been provided at no cost. In 2019 the average lot rent with trash pick-up was $258 in Michigan according to ManufacturedHomeLiving.org.

“(The investor groups) buy these parks just to make money with no intentions of doing any good for the community” said Green. “They don’t add anything to make it better. You don’t see where your dollars go.”

Others in the park report their monthly lot rents increased $300 the past two years. As a result some are considering legal action against the company.

Green who plans to move out of the community said her family and her neighbors are being taken advantage of by management as rents rise and repairs and improvements are not made.

Kingsley Management did not respond to numerous requests seeking comment about Independence Woods.

Changing housing market

Nationwide institutional investors have been swooping in to buy mobile home parks as inventory and profits for traditional rentals – single- and multi-family homes and apartment buildings – have dwindled.

These purchases of what has been one of the most affordable housing options are putting residents in a bind according to experts since most mobile homes — despite the name — cannot be moved easily or cheaply.

Owners can either accept large rent increases spend thousands of dollars to move their home or abandon it and lose tens of thousands they’ve invested.

In Michigan rent increases combined with outdated state oversight is making the once affordable manufactured housing option lose its luster.

Advocates say the increases are due in part to state laws for mobile home parks not being updated since 1987. The current laws have left a vacuum for corporate owners and private equity firms to buy mobile home parks and raise rents.

The Mobile Home Commission Act of 1987 provides little protection for mobile home park residents for upward rent control and very few limits on investors for licensing and leasing requirements.

Housing costs are rising across the country both in home prices and rent causing affordable housing stock to drop over 20% in Michigan. These increases are hitting Michigan’s mobile home park communities where many residents live on fixed-incomes have no other affordable options for housing and are making decisions about paying bills or rent.

According to MHVillage.com a Grand Rapids-based online marketplace for buying and selling manufactured homes there are over 1200 mobile home parks with 248000 homes in Michigan. In Oakland County there are 68 parks with nearly 16000 homes according to the most recent federal data. Those numbers are among the highest in the state.

George McCarthy president and CEO of the Lincoln Institute of Land Policy a Massachusetts-based nonprofit that researches and recommends creative approaches to land usage said mobile home parks are traditionally housing of last resort because residents cannot afford to buy a home or live in other types of rental housing.

There are 4 million mobile homes in the United States. According to the institute around 20% or around 800000 are in parks that have been purchased in the past eight years by institutional investors.

He describes the behavior of investor groups buying up mobile home parks as predatory and egregious because they typically reduce services to cut costs increase lot rents and make very few investments in community improvements such as infrastructure or facilities.

“Investors are taking full advantage of the fact that this is really housing of last resort” he said. “We’re willing to allow global capital to outbid residents for shelter. It’s a crisis that’s been unfolding for at least a decade or more. We have to take some kind of proactive action to prevent capital markets from stealing away necessary shelter from families.”

McCarthy said investors very often shift the cost of services onto residents including for trash collection and internet.

“They’re deferring maintenance and basically milking the parks for the cash flow that they can get” he said. “Based on our research mobile home parks are one of the top three leading returns in real estate investment trusts over the last five years. I think it’s almost unconscionable that these kinds of bottom feeder investors are buying up the parks just to make a quick buck.”

Holly Hook co-founder of the group Michigan Mobile Home Residents for Affordable Housing and recently appointed by Gov. Gretchen Whitmer to the Michigan Manufactured Housing Commission lives in Swartz Creek Estates mobile home park in Swartz Creek.

Before Havenpark Communities a Utah-based investment firm purchased the park Hook said her rent was reasonable and that she could afford to live alone. She now lives with two roommates as a result of rent increases.

Over the past three years her rent has increased over 40% from $300 to $432 per month. If you tack on fees for trash school taxes water and sewer her rent jumps to $550 per month.

“The rent increases are showing no signs of stopping” she said. “The investors have no regard for the people that live in these parks. They don’t see us as a people. We are just a resource to make money. They squeeze us as hard as they can. You feel trapped because it’s too expensive to move your home and the investors know it. It gives them license to do whatever they want.”

Hook said the park’s lease agreements are month-to-month which allows Havenpark to hike lot rents whenever they want.

Current state law does not require mobile home park owners to offer year-long leases or rental agreements to tenants which makes those without long-term leases susceptible to any changes the owner wants to make at any time.

Josh Weiss a Havenpark spokesperson told The Associated Press that the company must charge prevailing market rates when it purchases a park at fair market price. That said the company has moved since 2020 to limit its rent increases to $50-a-month.

“We understand the anxiety that any rent increase has on residents especially those on fixed incomes” Weiss said. “While we try to minimize the impact the financial realities do not change.”

Cody Reynolds a resident in the Oakland Glens mobile home park in Novi said his community was purchased by YES! Communities in 2020 and his rent has doubled since then.

YES! one of the nation’s largest owners and operators of mobile home communities owns 60 mobile home parks in Michigan and is owned by Stockbridge Capital Group LLC. a San Francisco-based global institutional investment group.

YES! Communities and Stockbridge Capital Group LLC. did not respond to requests for comment.

“When I moved into the community in 2019 my lot rent was $799” said Reynolds. “Since 2020 my rent has gone up $50 to $100 each year. My lease just came up and I was told there was no option for renewal.”

Every few months Reynolds said management offered him the opportunity to buy his trailer once his lease ended. When his lease expired June 30 he was moved to a new trailer nearby. His rent is $1509.

Making changes

John Lindley president and CEO of the Michigan Manufactured Housing Association which represents the industry in Michigan said the great majority of mobile home park communities are well-operated.

When it comes to investor groups buying mobile home parks and implementing outsized lot rents increases Lindley said those are isolated incidents and not common practices.

“The Michigan Manufactured Housing Association condemns the practices of a few bad actors but it is important to note that the evidence is clear they are outliers” he said. “The notion of big national companies buying up communities and broadly imposing huge rent increases runs against the fact that doing so is a bad business model and furthermore is not supported by broad market observations.”

He said investors are consistently using their money to make community improvements to enhance the short- and long-term value of mobile home communities including amenities streets walkways street lighting and water and sewer lines.

The mobile home industry argues the communities are still the most affordable housing option noting that average rent increases across parks nationwide were just over 4% in 2021. Spending on improvements was around 11%. Significant investments are needed they said to make improvements at older parks.

Jim Schaafsma a housing support attorney with the Michigan Poverty Law Program disagrees with industry officials saying lot rents are going up as park conditions decline not improve.

What is needed he said is for the state Legislature to create limits for rent increases and place limits on fees being added to rent costs that have become very common when investors take over.

“One reality that differentiates mobile home park residents from other rental tenants is that these residents who own their homes are more stranded he said. “The nearly prohibitive cost for them of moving a home means that they have nowhere to go. There is a huge barrier to moving out so tenants will accept pretty much whatever the owners raise the rents to.”

Schaafsma said mobile home park owners especially private equity recognize that park residents are stuck in this way and their business model reflects and exploits it which includes relentlessly raising rents.

According to the U.S. Census Bureau the median sales price of a Michigan manufactured home was around $39000 in 2020 the most recent data available. That’s around an 8% increase year-over-year making it even more difficult for renters to afford to buy if they had the option.

Last year a package of legislation was introduced to update the 1987 state law and regulate investors. The package includes fixing issues regarding titles to abandoned homes in mobile home parks altering leasing requirements and revising licensing requirements for owners.

The bills passed the House 97-10 with bipartisan support but negotiations have stalled in the Senate after the Michigan Manufactured Housing Association pulled its support after working on it with stakeholders including investors such as Havenpark and YES! Communities.

Those in the mobile home park industry have urged the Federal Housing Administration to make financing available to mobile home park residents many of whom rely on high-interest loans to purchase homes. They also want the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development to allow housing vouchers to be used for mobile homes.

This has been a sticking point for sellers — several told Reuters that the recommended method would include providing financial technology platform Plaid with their banking username and password.

Etsy also reportedly provided an option to self-verify though some found it “tedious.”

Plaid last year agreed to pay $58 million to settle a case alleging it had used peoples’ financial information without consent. But the company has said it’s looking to provide a “secure experience” for users.

One seller critiqued Etsy for having a “history of less-than-stellar communication and customer service contributes to a general lack of trust in Etsy.” A transaction fee increase at the site also provoked negative reactions earlier in the year. And some users have said they may quit the platform over the various issues.

Etsy didn’t immediately respond to a PYMNT request for comment.

Even with the derision though Etsy reported 6 million new buyers in Q2 and a 10% increase in revenue in spite of the current economic conditions PYMNTS wrote.

The company said the rate of new buyers was “meaningfully elevated” from pre-pandemic levels. CFO Rachel Glaser said the revenue for the quarter had come from changes the company made such as the transaction fee increase along with adding Depop and Elo7 to its brand portfolio.

And CEO Josh Silverman said the results from that quarter showed that Etsy had kept up with the gains it made during the pandemic.

(Reuters) – Etsy Inc said on Friday U.S. sellers on its marketplace will either need to self verify their bank accounts or do it via third-party riling up sellers over data privacy concerns.

The sellers Reuters talked to and several others on discussion forums were annoyed over the move saying the recommended mode of verification involved providing financial technology platform Plaid with their banking username and password.

“This is so typical of Etsy on any controversial subject but when it has to do with our finances it’s unacceptable” said Dorothy Domingo who has been selling functional pottery on Etsy since 2008.

Plaid which last year agreed to pay $58 million to settle a case that alleged it used financial information without consent did not immediately respond to a request for a comment.

“In connection with anti-money laundering and related regulations in the United States marketplaces like Etsy are adjusting practices to further verify any American bank accounts on file” Etsy said.

The company has also provided sellers the option to self verify their bank accounts with test deposits but one seller said the process was tedious.

“Unfortunately a history of less-than-stellar communication and customer service contributes to a general lack of trust in Etsy” said a seller who did not want to be named.

This is the latest in a series of issues faced by some sellers. A few went on strike earlier this year to protest an increase in transaction fee at Etsy.

Etsy is still a key source of income to its nearly 8 million active sellers but some said they were considering exiting the platform.

“I haven’t fully reopened my Etsy shop because so many of my wonderful customers have been going to my website to support me. But with this I may be forced to shut down my Etsy shop permanently” seller Kristi Cassidy said.

With the wind in your hair and your starting point a speck on the horizon suddenly those everyday worries don’t seem so significant – for a moment it is simply you and the sublime.

In theory it is hard to argue with how wonderful this all sounds. And yet how many of us when we hear the words “hiking holiday” think with a gulp of traversing the Alps with walking poles or suffering four days of altitude sickness and blisters on the Inca Trail? The good news is in comparison to its more extreme cousin trekking hiking is more or less what you want it to be.

The word itself comes from Middle English “icchen” which means to move or stir – if you like it is simply a long walk. Nor despite what some purists claim must a “proper” hiking holiday mean sacrificing comfort at the end of the day in a soggy tent. Many tour operators offer luxury accommodation from poolside resorts to spa hotels all the better to rest those weary novice-hiker feet.

And hiking’s star is on the rise. This year slow travel company Inntravel reported a 40 per cent increase among new customers in its “entry-level” walking holidays many of them first-time hikers – so it seems we are embracing a broader definition of the concept: more accessible beginner-friendly non-exclusive.

Maybe it is a legacy of all those lockdown walks maybe it is simply a post-pandemic desire to see the world in a more exhilarating “up close and personal” way. Either way hiking is having a moment – and it is time we all found out why.

Noreen McGuire an Eversource Underground Lineworker Leader secures a new energy release manhole cover into place on Massachusetts Avenue in Boston.

Manhole covers will be safer in Boston thanks to a new effort by Eversource which aims to enhance the safety of the underground electric system across the city.

Eversource told WCVB that new latching manhole covers will increase safety by replacing about 6000 manhole covers in the city by the end of 2023.

“The manhole cover unseats itself comes up and there’s potential to injure people and injure property” Craig Hallstrom president of Electric Operations at Eversource told the news outlet. “When you think about manhole incidents in general they can happen anywhere but downtown Boston has the highest risk profile.”

In June manhole explosions shattered windows and evacuated buildings in downtown Boston. One person was sent to the hospital in that early-morning incident. A month later in July an exploding manhole cover injured two workers in Beacon Hill.

Hallstrom told WCVB that the goal is to keep the city’s manhole covers in place. The covers weigh about 200 pounds and can travel 15 feet in the air. But the newer energy-release manhole models will lift slightly — about 3 to 4 inches — then drop back in place.

According to Eversource the goal is also to increase the cycle of inspections and prevent manhole explosions from happening in the first place.

“We get in the manholes very routinely we do inspections we have some new technology some new equipment” Hallstrom told the outlet.",,,,,,,,,,,,

But there’s a catch that goes unmentioned. And it’s a big one. The land that’s up for sale on the Mystic River in Everett sits in a designated port area limiting what could go there to water-dependent industrial operations. Translation: None of the advertised uses are allowed there today.

The Mystic Station marketing brochure describes the 45-acre power plant property as a “transformational development opportunity” on Boston’s doorstep — with room for labs offices multifamily housing stores and maybe even a hotel or two.

With a possible New England Revolution soccer stadium in mind House leaders last month adopted language in their economic development bill to exempt the Mystic site from DPA restrictions. The Kraft Group has long sought a standalone home for the Revs in Greater Boston separate from Gillette Stadium in Foxborough and the Mystic site has been a rumored contender for several years.

The Conservation Law Foundation went to war after the “soccer stadium amendment” came to light lobbying against what the group called a last-minute backroom deal that could undermine the local maritime economy; CLF also blasted language that would exempt the property from construction limits under the state’s Chapter 91 law governing tidelands. Time ran out on formal sessions before the House and Senate could reach an agreement on the broader economic development bill.

The fate of that bill — a $4 billion-plus potpourri of tax cuts and economic-related program funds — remains up in the air. As a result so is this key piece of Everett’s riverfront renaissance. And the entire debate underscores pressing questions about our old industrial waterfronts and how they should evolve.

At Mystic a viable mixed-use project might be possible under Chapter 91 tidelands rules. But the DPA issue could be a deal breaker potentially preventing anything from getting built.

That wouldn’t sit well with Everett Mayor Carlo DeMaria. Along with Wynn Resorts executives DeMaria wants the site to become an entertainment and hospitality destination to complement the $2.6 billion casino that Wynn opened across the street in 2019 and the related development the company is pursuing along Broadway. A Revs stadium would fit perfectly with that vision. City officials last year gave themselves the authority to take this site from plant owner Exelon — now Constellation an Exelon spinoff — by eminent domain if necessary.

The eminent-domain threat forced Constellation’s hand prompting it to hire brokerage CBRE to market the 45 acres. It no longer uses its shuttered turbines there though Eversource has an easement to operate a switchyard; another section is essentially water undevelopable. Not included are two natural-gas fired units next door. Constellation gets special payments to keep those two going because of their importance to New England’s grid until the spring of 2024. Then what remains of this decades-old power plant closes for good.

All a Constellation spokesman would say is that the company hopes to conclude the sale by year’s end with Everett’s redevelopment plan in mind.

It’s in this context that the House leaders tucked the Everett language into the back of their economic development bill. Down-to-the-wire negotiations with the Senate got sidetracked by an unexpected revelation that the state may need to budget for nearly $3 billion in income tax credits. But the bill is not dead by any means.

Legislative leaders are waiting for clarity on the exact cost of those credits. They could choose to pass much of the bill in an informal session when roll calls can’t be taken. Controversial items like this Everett language are generally avoided in informal sessions because a single lawmaker can block a bill.

With CLF watching closely it’s unlikely the Everett language could survive in an informal session. From CLF’s perspective maintaining the state’s port infrastructure is crucial. Once an industrial port makes way for high-end development CLF’s Deanna Moran argues it’s gone for good. CLF doesn’t want oil tanks and dirty power plants either. But Moran said these properties could be ideal for “blue-tech” and clean-energy uses like the wind-farm work planned for Salem’s waterfront.

Legislators are only expected to meet in informal sessions until January but it’s possible they could be called back for a rare special formal session to wrap up the tax cuts bonding proposals and other goodies in the bill. In a formal session the Everett measure might very well make it through.

While there is precedent for removing properties from DPAs through legislation Mystic Station’s road to redevelopment becomes considerably longer without State House help. The next option: ask the state’s Coastal Zone Management office for a formal DPA boundary review. The agency is currently reviewing such requests for two different areas in East Boston. One is led by warehouse developer Jacob Citrin who wants to remove several industrial parcels on Route 1A from a port area. The second is being pursued by the Boston Planning & Development Agency and involves properties in and around Central Square.

This route can be lengthy — no less than six months and often much longer. Citrin said he applied more than two years ago and expects the final decision next month; BPDA initiated its request in early 2020. But in the case of the Mystic parcel land-use experts say DPA regulations probably wouldn’t offer enough leeway to remove it from its respective port area anyway.

Another possible path is even more circuitous but could prove beneficial in the long run: rewriting the DPA rules. The system established in the 1970s is seen by many as anachronistic. State environmental regulators would include many waterfront stakeholders in that process — environmental groups property owners municipal officials. Julie Wormser of the Mystic River Watershed Association sees this as the best possible outcome: a robust regional conversation about updating the DPAs instead of dealing with them on a piecemeal basis.

The fight for the future of this power-plant land might end up not only being about bringing relief to Revs fans who have long hoped for a soccer stadium to call their own. It could end up being about the kind of future we want for the industrial waterfronts in and around Boston and what it will take to get there.

For those trainers who may have missed it Niantic rolled out another storage expansion for Pokemon Go.

This update expanded the maximum item and Pokemon storage by 50 for a total of 5150 and 6150 storage spaces respectively.

Unfortunately players aren’t happy with the premium currency cost of upgrading their storage to the max and took to social media to voice their frustrations.

Pokemon Go fans voice frustration over bag upgrade costs

Pokemon and item storage increases can be extremely helpful to veteran trainers but some aren’t happy about the premium cost.

Niantic tweeted out the news on August 26 2022 as tons of fans replied with their concerns about the upgrade’s cost.

Article continues after ad

“+50 storage space every 200 poke coins make it 100. You’re making people spend $100 just to upgrade one storage to [max.]” said user Sourguy12YT.

Each 50 additional storage spaces cost 200 of Pokemon Go’s premium currency which players are able to buy 100 coins for $0.99 in the in-game store.

“There really needs to be more free ways to expand your storage. If you’re not a whale the game stops being fun at like level 35 because of storage bottleneck” replied turniprincess.

Article continues after ad

Of course there are free ways to earn coins in Pokemon Go and that’s through leaving Pokemon at gyms.

With gyms trainers can potentially earn up to 50 coins per day. Unfortunately as others pointed out in the replies it’s not as easy as it sounds.

Article continues after ad

When replying to a player who claimed to have 9000 coins just from gyms TsukiNoAkuma13 pointed out that “Some people have no gyms [or] very few locally or live in very busy areas where their Pokémon don’t last long and they can’t spend all day guarding a gym.”

While there are options to earn premium currency for free it seems as though more avenues to earn storage upgrades for free would go a long way with the Pokemon Go community.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMigwFodHRwczovL3d3dy5qYWdyYW5qb3NoLmNvbS9nZW5lcmFsLWtub3dsZWRnZS9ob3ctdG8tY2xlYXItc3RvcmFnZS1zcGFjZS1vbi1hbmRyb2lkLXBob25lcy1jaGVjay10aGVzZS1maXZlLWZyZWUtdHJpY2tzLTE2NjE2NzU4ODgtMdIBhwFodHRwczovL3d3dy5qYWdyYW5qb3NoLmNvbS9nZW5lcmFsLWtub3dsZWRnZS9hbXAvaG93LXRvLWNsZWFyLXN0b3JhZ2Utc3BhY2Utb24tYW5kcm9pZC1waG9uZXMtY2hlY2stdGhlc2UtZml2ZS1mcmVlLXRyaWNrcy0xNjYxNjc1ODg4LTE?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,How to Clear Storage Space On Android Phones? Check these 5 free tricks,"Smartphones have become an integral part of our daily lives. To make payments or to keep track of our medical status we have dedicated applications for everything. However these apps sometimes are also responsible for slow performance camera or gaming issues. Though the easiest way seems to uninstall these apps but really not the best solution. And to deal with this baffling situation we have got top 5 free ways:

Uninstall Unused Apps The large web of the internet sometimes leads us to unnecessary installation. There are a plethora of apps in our phone that are left unused for months. Such apps are never used and simply occupy a large space in our phone. Mark and uninstall these useless apps to free some storage space. Also enable ‘Verify before install’ from your setting to avoid any further fake app installation in your smartphone.

Delete the Audio Files Exchanging messages are not limited to text messages anymore. The era of smartphones has provided multiple options like audio message GIFs videos & more. We often share or receive audio messages with our friends and families. And once after listening to them we often forget to delete them which increases the storage of the phone. Users through their WhatsApp media folder can get directed to the audio section and can select and delete all the unwanted audio messages to free up some extra storage space.

Find & Remove Large Media Files A one perfect picture needs almost 99 ‘can be better’ photos. And these rest 99 pictures or videos are often left saved without any reason. This data unknowingly occupies a large space of our phone and drains the storage. So for a smooth execution of apps and other processes it is better to delete these idle lying images and videos.

Use Google Photos Choosing between ‘Keep’ and ‘Delete’ is not an easy task. In case you feel puzzled about your selection but still freeing up space is mandatory switch to Google Photos. Use your gmail id to sign in Google photos and then move all your photos and videos to Google Photos. Once you have successfully ported all your media delete it from your smartphone.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiaWh0dHBzOi8vZG90ZXNwb3J0cy5jb20vcG9rZW1vbi9uZXdzL3Bva2Vtb24tZ28tZ2V0cy1iYWctYW5kLWl0ZW0tc3RvcmFnZS11cGdyYWRlLXdpdGgtc3BlY2lhbC1zdG9yZS1vZmZlctIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Pokemon Go gets bag and item storage upgrade with special store offer,"Niantic the developer of Pokemon Go has just increased storage for trainers in the game with a higher cap available for purchase.

Recommended Videos

All trainers full of items and Pokémon can slightly increase their storage spaces which since the last update of Aug. 26 can reach 6150 Pokémon Storage and 5150 Item Storage through shop purchases.

The store will receive a special Training Box for 550 PokéCoins starting at midnight tonight and players who purchase it will receive:

The Pokemon Storage Upgrade

An Item Bag Upgrade

30 Poke Balls

Five Lucky Eggs

Each Upgrade to both the Pokémon Storage and Item Bag increases the current storage capacity by 50 units and usually costs 200 PokéCoins. You can also purchase Lucky Eggs separately in the shop for 80 PokéCoins each. In total this Training Box can save your players 250 PokéCoins.

This type of storage capacity upgrade is already common for Niantic to do from time to time especially as more Pokémon are added to the game and their players need more spaces to store and manage their catches.

Players who need extra Poké Balls for events can claim items from Amazon Prime Gaming’s second August bundle!

Now a year later some are still using the same bags — but not all.

It’s surprising how attached you can get to a bag — especially the bag that you use to carry your laptop your sweater your lunch your notebook your exercise shoes your kids’ diapers or any of the other stuff you need. Whether you’re heading to the office visiting a friend hanging in a coffee shop going on a hike or just sitting outdoors to read or work having a bag that can accommodate everything on your “gotta have this” list can help you avoid a lot of aggravation.

So here’s this year’s staff picks — some old some new. Most of the staff wrote about their backpacks but toward the end we’ve added a few different types of bags as well.

I got a large Timbuk2 messenger bag in 2015 — just in time to haul it around a CES show floor — after wearing out a few smaller options from fancier brands. (According to one company’s associate in hitherto-undiscovered ways; I am very hard on my accessories.) It’s comfortable low-profile fairly affordable and has a big main compartment with as many little sub-pockets as I could ever want. The only downsides are a) I feel sort of basic when a co-worker shows off some gorgeous Peak Design product and b) I like it so much that I feel like I must have struck an unwitting faustian bargain with a trickster god. Unfortunately it looks like Timbuk2 doesn’t offer the customization options I got anymore so maybe the catch is that I can never buy another one that feels just right. — Adi Robertson senior reporter

The Tom Binh Synapse 25 is quite expensive for a backpack (though I assume some of that cost comes from the fact that it’s made in Seattle) but I knew that it had been a good buy when I was stuck out in the rain with it all night and it kept my stuff dry. That same week I had to jump on a plane and go across the country for a week and I was able to fit all my clothes and electronics into it and use it as a single carry-on.

Since then I’ve taken it on dozens of trips and have subjected it to muddy outdoor worksites for hours on end. It’s held up to everything remarkably well and has been one of the most well-built and thoughtfully designed bags I’ve had the pleasure of using. The main compartment perfectly fits a laptop and a few packing cubes and the water bottle pocket is right in the center of the bag keeping it from weighing too heavily on one shoulder. The zippers feel great and I absolutely love the orange color I got it in as well as how tough the material feels. Overall it feels like it strikes the perfect balance: it’s tough (and light) enough for prolonged outdoor use while still being classy enough to tote your laptop and lunch to the office. — Mitchell Clark news writer

Tom Bihn Synapse 25 $ 235 The main compartment of this backpack perfectly fits a laptop and a few packing cubes and the water bottle pocket is right in the center of the bag keeping it from weighing too heavily on one shoulder. $235 at Tom Bihn

I see I’m not the only person with a Timbuk2 bag so I’ll just join the chorus to recommend my personal bag the Custom Prospect Laptop backpack. It has a good-sized laptop flap (Timbuk2 advertises a 15-inch screen fit and it’s always held my MacBook Airs comfortably) a spacious interior and a handy flap up top that lets you add a little extra space to the interior of the bag. I’ve had mine for nearly seven years even using it for my weekly grocery store runs and it’s held up like a champ throughout. Plus with this bag you can personalize it with your favorite colors or reflective material. —Jay Peters news writer

Timbuk2 Custom Prospect Backpack $ 139 This custom-designed backpack holds a 15-inch laptop has a spacious interior and includes a handy flap up top that lets you add a little extra space to the interior of the bag. $139 at Timbuk2

A couple of years ago I picked up the Black Diamond Creek Transit 32 for what once was my daily commute downtown. While I wish it looked a bit more professional at times — most Black Diamond equipment is built for the climbing crag not the cubicle — I’ve always appreciated it for its relative simplicity and the sheer amount of gear it can carry. The 32-liter pack takes a cue from the company’s ultra-durable haul bags and as such it’s made with a waterproof shell and ballistic nylon that can take a bit of a beating (I’ve tested this). It also features a cushioned 15-inch laptop compartment on the rear a zippered top lid and separate bottom compartment where I can stash my gym clothes running attire and — yes — a decrepit pair of climbing shoes for those times when I decide to take it bouldering outside the city limits. — Brandon Widder senior editor commerce

After months of searching and fretting over the width of straps ease of entry and general bulk of profile I finally picked up the Mission Workshop’s The Monty Advanced (now called The Monty: AP) messenger bag in brown canvas. The strap on it is big and padded enough that it won’t dig in if I’m carrying a couple of laptops a bunch of camera gear and the general odds and ends I cram in a bag and the quick release makes it easy for me to adjust the bag so it fits closer to the body on longer walks. It’s also totally waterproof a thing I accidentally tested on day two when I was caught in a deluge. But if there is a spill the lining is easy to clean — it has handled chicken curry and rum punch with more aplomb than my stomach lining. I love that it can switch between being a flap-style bag or a roll top depending on how much stuff I’ve tried to pack in. But its style definitely skews rugged.

When I need a little more professional bag I use a the Telfar Medium Tan Shopping Bag which a friend sold me on by saying it could hold a 15-inch laptop charger wallet and two bottles of wine. She was correct. — Alex Cranz managing editor

Mission Workshop The Monty AP $ 275 Mission Workshop’s The Monty AP messenger bag in brown canvas has a strap that is big and padded enough that it won’t dig in if you’re carrying a couple of laptops a bunch of camera gear and general odds and ends. $275 at Mission Workshop

“Laptop bag” to me is any bag that fits a laptop but also gets jam-packed with too much camera equipment. The slightly unwieldy but lovely Peak Design Everyday Backpack 30L has been my main work bag for well over two years (I have the first-gen version) and it has traveled with me all over the country and beyond while holding up to abuse and looking clean in its charcoal colorway. I have at times packed it with multiple full-size camera bodies lenses and accessories along with either a 16-inch MacBook Pro (which is easily swallowed up in its laptop pocket) or a 13-inch MacBook Air that takes a cave-diving excursion into its inner depths. The structuring of this bag and the way gear is meant to slot into its three shelves and pocket walls with side-access may not be for everyone but if you want to carry a lot of camera and tech-adjacent gear it offers lots of versatility. Do yourself a favor and try to make the smaller 20L version work for your needs so when you inevitably overpack it you can save your back more than I do with the 30L. — Antonio G. Di Benedetto writer commerce

I found the Mystery Ranch Urban Assault 18 at a warehouse sale and it has since become my go-to for every occasion. It is not geared toward tech but has two laptop sleeves and three mesh pockets that fit my dongles books laptop small tripod camera and personal items with room to spare. It also makes heavy loads easy to carry for long periods with super comfortable shoulder straps and a chest strap. The best part about it though is the way it zippers down the middle. This has been great for taking out single items even if they are packed at the bottom. I thought I would never quit my Chrome backpacks but the Mystery Ranch is lighter more comfortable for long trips and the vertical zipper is now a must-have for me. — Becca Farsace senior producer

It’s okay to like a backpack with lots of pockets (and from looking at the rest of this article many of my colleagues do). Sleeves for laptops side pockets for pens mesh lining for sunglasses. Whatever. And reader I was once one of those people. But after using the Errant backpack for a little over a year I came to the conclusion that sometimes it’s possible to overthink things. I mean sure the Errant was great when I was commuting every day with exactly the same combination of laptop notebook and other work accessories. But the second I needed to carry around something else — like groceries — I found the sheer amount of extra pockets just ate away at valuable bag space.

So instead for the past two years I’ve been using the simplest backpack I could find. It has one big compartment that holds everything from my laptop to a sweater or a grocery shopping trip with one small compartment for pens and chargers. I don’t have to think about which compartment to put everything in and I don’t have to spend any time organizing anything because everything inevitably becomes a mess the second I zip the bag up. But you know what? I haven’t spent any time thinking about backpacks since buying this thing two and a half years ago. And that’s exactly the way I like it. — Jon Porter reporter

Years ago while wandering through the gift shop in a museum I was struck by a large shoulder bag made from a lovely tapestry-like material. It had a zipper running down the length of its main strap so that if you unzipped it one strap became two and the bag could be worn like a backpack. I spent a long time trying to convince myself I didn’t really need it until eventually my partner grabbed it and bought it for me — and I’ve used it constantly ever since.

The Danny K Classic Backpack isn’t “classic” by any means — as I said it is basically a shoulder bag that converts to a backpack. It’s also not quite large enough for a laptop. But it’s got loads of pockets and accommodates a lot of stuff — including my phone a charger a small tablet a folded-up rain jacket a water bottle and more. It also looks great. I’ve used mine until some of the tapestry has begun to unravel but even that sort of adds to its feel of something old-fashioned but still useful. — Barbara Krasnoff reviews editor

For obvious reasons I wasn’t going out very much in 2020. I did not need my lipstick. I did not need a notebook. I did not need my cellphone charger. I did not need a light sweater or a book or a place to tuck away a half-empty bottle of sparkling water. When I did leave my house what I needed was my phone my keys and my wallet. And honestly I didn’t even really need my whole wallet since both the grocery store and the liquor store took Apple Pay.

So I bought the Lululemon Everywhere belt bag (a nice euphemism for a fanny pack) in very practical all-purpose black. It’s smaller than other belt bags I’d looked at and also features mesh pockets on the inside — good for stashing your phone or keys so you can open the bag on the go without fear of important things falling out. There’s also a nice little outside zipper pocket on the side of the bag that faces the body which is a good spot for a transit card folded mask or vaccination record.

I’ve been using the bag regularly for two years and it’s worn well — no scratches no tears no fading and no issues with the zippers or pockets. I adjust the strap to sling it cross-body over my torso or to wear it around my waist (like a true fanny pack) depending on how dorky I’m feeling at any given time. It’s perfect for errands great for a walk and it’s even useful when traveling. (I wear mine at the airport and then tuck it away into my larger “personal item” backpack when it’s time to board the plane.)

The only problem with this bag is that it got TikTok-famous this year which I guess I should have known once I saw half the people in my neighborhood walking around with some version of my bag in various colors. If you manage to catch a restock you won’t regret it. — Sarah Jeong deputy features editor

[Note: Until the Everywhere Belt Bag is available we’ve substituted the Lululemon Athletica Wunderlust Belt Bag.]

Although not a bag per se but rather a tool for bag organization I swear by packing cubes. I wasn’t always a diehard fan of packing cubes though; I’m actually a recent convert. Having schlepped across multiple continents with a carry-on I consider myself a pretty efficient traveler so I shrugged off the need for packing cubes for years. It wasn’t until I began to regularly visit a friend every few months in New York City that I had to reevaluate.

My suitcase would explode across her apartment and I became the house guest every New Yorker hates to have. My piles of clothes simply took up too much room. Finally begrudgingly I ordered a set of packing cubes to help contain my various outfits supplies and laundry. To my surprise they not only worked but I also fell in love with them. I won’t travel without them now. I can pack more save on space and best of all I only pull out one cube as needed instead of rummaging around in an unorganized suitcase. — Kaitlin Hatton audience manager

It’s been over a decade since I had a commute and while I have a few backpacks in rotation (including an ancient Tom Bihn Brain Bag and an Evergoods Civic Panel Loader) I wouldn’t qualify either as a favorite. The Brain Bag is a bit floppy and the CPL has excellent construction but a few confounding design flaws — most since rectified. But technically the prompt for this article was “favorite way to carry your stuff around.” If a child counts as stuff then I do have a favorite: the BabyBjörn Baby Carrier One Air.

The Björn as we invariably call it (“would you like to björn the baby or shall I?”) is comfortable versatile and can haul kids either front- or rear-facing — or even on your back. Ours has survived seven years and three kids and we’ve used it everywhere from grocery stores and zoos to hikes in the woods. It’s especially clutch for travel. Passengers at Amsterdam’s Schiphol Airport earlier this month witnessed me sprinting across the terminal toward our gate with a 27-pound two-year-old on my front and a backpack on my back. We made the flight. — Nathan Edwards senior editor reviews

The Maruti Suzuki Alto has stayed on top of the game for well over two decades in the entry-level hatchback segment. Over 43 lakh units of the model have been sold since its inception. The Alto is offered in two versions namely the Alto 800 and the Alto K10. The more powerful K10 was discontinued a couple of years ago due to the BS6 emission norms. And now the K10 is back in its new avatar as it gets a new design features and a lot more.How is the new Alto K10 to drive and how different is it from the previous generation? Read the complete review for all the answers.The design of the new Alto K10 looks new and fresh. Based on the same Heartect platform as the S Presso the design of the new Alto K10 reflects a good evolution from the previous generation.It gets a wide hexagonal grille which accentuates the width of the car and now it gets sleek headlights with a subtly sculpted chin. Moving on to the side there’s not much that has been changed the gently raked C-pillar makes the car look tall and premium. It gets 13-inch steel wheels wrapped up in 145/80 R13 size while alloy wheels come as an optional extra with two customised themes that Maruti calls Glinto and Impacto.The rear design of the new K10 looks like it has taken inspiration from the new Celerio. It gets squared tail lamps which look good and you also get an integrated spoiler.The new Alto K10 measures 3530 mm in length 1490 mm in width and 1520 mm in height which makes it shorter in length by 15 mm and taller by 45 mm compared to the outgoing K10. If you compare it with the Alto 800 the K10 is 85 mm longer and 45 mm taller and the wheelbase is longer by 20 mm compared to the older K10.The interior of the new Alto K10 features a grey colour scheme that looks plain and simple but the lighter shade used on the pillars seats and headliner tries to enhance the perception of space inside.Once you step inside the cabin of the new C3 the first thing you notice here is that the cabin has become a lot more modern than the previous generation. The steering wheel digital speedometer and 7-inch infotainment system have been borrowed from the S-Presso.The steering wheel has mounted controls for the infotainment system and the 7-inch infotainment system comes with Apple CarPlay and Android Auto.The layout of the digital speedometer is pretty good and one can easily get all the information on the go without having to take your eyes off the road but it misses out on the tachometer.The absence of manual dimming function on the interior rear view is another miss that but one that needs quick fix considering how most drivers on our roads use high beam unnecessarily.The car gets manual air conditioning with chunky rotary knobs that click right into place and also there’s a huge storage space with two cup holders beneath them.The front window power buttons are placed oddly placed in between the dashboard and there are no power windows for the passengers. The placement of the buttons in the dashboard is partially attributed to the cost savings that come with it as lesser wiring harness is used in comparison to the door placement.In terms of practicality and space there’s a lot of space inside for occupants and storage. Even in the rear seats there’s enough headroom and legroom. The boot space is around 214 litres which are decent for a car of this size and class. Owing to the longer wheelbase and slim front seats the Alto K10 offers more leg room than earlier. The only area of improvement at the back is the under-thigh support which could have been a bit better.Overall the new K10’s interior is functional appealing and offers impressive creature comforts from a segment perspective.The 2022 Alto K10 is powered by the K10C 1.0-litre three-cylinder petrol engine. The engine produces a maximum power of 66.6 bhp and peak torque of 82 Nm and can be had either with a 5-speed manual or an AMT.The three-cylinder engine is smooth and even at idling it feels refined. First we drove the 5-speed manual version and the acceleration and power delivery turned out to be quite good. The engine feels strongest in the top half of its rev range. With a kerb weight of 740 kilos the car has a very healthy power-to-weight ratio and offers good fun with a go-kart like feeling at times.The AMT works as you would expect an AMT to work and it does the job of giving you the convenience of an automatic at a much lower price. You will find a few head nods and a bit of lag between the shifts but that’s pretty much expected because you’re getting the technology at a much lower price.The engine feels very tractable in the city and it’s got healthy low-end & perfect gearing which means you get a good drive at almost any given point of time.The new Alto K10 comes with a McPherson strut suspension at the front and a torsion beam with coil springs at the rear.For a small urban car the Alto K10 offers impressive handling despite its small and skinny tyres. The car doesn't mind quick directional changes and the front just follows where you point it as long as one drives with the lids of sanity in place. Braking too is good and the steering offers good feedback instilling confidence in the car.Ride quality is a sorted affair on the new Maruti Suzuki Alto K10 . The suspension does a decent job of soaking in the undulations and we felt things are much quieter now when going over bad surfaces.The 2022 Alto K10 comes with dual airbags ABS + EBD driver + passenger seatbelt reminder & pre-tensioners and reverse parking sensors. The VXi and the VXi+ variants get speed-sensitive auto door locks and central locking. This particular model is yet to be crash tested so on paper things look good from a seent standard.The Maruti Suzuki Alto K10 is available in 4 variants – STD(O) LXi VXi and VXi+. Prices start from Rs. 3.99 lakh for the base STD(O) and range from Rs. 4.82 lakh for the LXi to Rs. 5.33 lakh for the VXi+ variant. AMT is offered on the VXi and VXi+ with prices starting from Rs. 5.49 lakh and going up to Rs. 5.83 lakh for the VXI+ AGS. The new Alto K10 is priced at Rs 60000 more than the previous generation.The new Alto K10 has gotten better in every way than the previous generation. It gets a comfortable and spacious cabin efficient engine an AMT and a lot of bells and whistles for this segment. All variants of the new K10 have been packaged smartly and offer good value for money which is important for this segment's buyers.With a fresh design new engine features and added space the Alto K10 in our opinion right now is an impressive car in its price segment and there’s little reason to doubt the new Alto K10 continuing to be loved by Indian buyers."

In a significant milestone in the Biden-Harris administration’s efforts to combat the climate crisis the Bureau of Land Management has approved ExxonMobil Corporation’s proposal to sequester carbon deep underground in Lincoln and Sweetwater counties Wyoming.

The proposal includes a carbon dioxide disposal well pad and pipeline. Once completed the infrastructure will provide the opportunity for permanent underground storage of carbon dioxide produced along with natural gas at the existing Exxon Mobil Shute Creek Plant near Kemmerer.

This is the first project of its kind to be approved on B.L.M. managed lands.

Currently ExxonMobil sells carbon dioxide for commercial uses and excess carbon dioxide is vented into the atmosphere under a permit approved by the Wyoming Department of Environmental Quality.

“This project is a prime example of how the B.L.M. can work together with industry leaders to combat climate change” said B.L.M. Wyoming State Director Andrew Archuleta. “Projects like this will allow the B.L.M. to play a part in reducing carbon dioxide levels in the atmosphere.”

The disposal well will sequester approximately 60 million cubic feet of carbon dioxide daily at a depth of roughly 18000 feet in the water leg of the Madison formation which is an approved disposal zone. The injection of carbon dioxide into underground geologic formations offers safe secure and permanent disposal.

Earlier this year the B.L.M. issued a new policy on the geologic sequestration of carbon dioxide on public lands.

Geologic carbon sequestration is the process of safely injecting carbon dioxide deep underground permanently preventing it from entering the atmosphere and contributing to the climate crisis. Carbon dioxide has been injected underground in the United States since the 1940s typically as a temporary measure to produce more oil.

Northeastern Wyoming is working towards becoming an international hub for coal research. Carbon capture is part of that research and is heavily promoted by Governor Mark Gordon.

This is the first time the B.L.M. has issued a policy to allow for the permanent underground storage of carbon dioxide.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMinwFodHRwczovL3d3dy5zdGFicm9la25ld3MuY29tLzIwMjIvMDgvMjgvc3BvcnRzL2N1bW1pbmdzLWxvZGdlLWNoYXJsZXN0b3duLWludG8tYm95cy1zZW1pLWZpbmFsLW5ldy1jYW1wYmVsbHZpbGxlLWVhc3QtcnVpbXZlbGR0LXNlY3VyZS1naXJscy1xdWFydGVyZmluYWwtd2lucy_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Cummings Lodge Charlestown into Boys semi-final New Campbellville East Ruimveldt secure Girls quarterfinal wins,"Defending champion Cummings Lodge and Charlestown stormed their way into the Boys semi-final while New Campbellville and East Ruimveldt punched their tickets to the Girls final four section when the quarterfinal round in the ExxonMobil U14 Football Championship concluded yesterday.

The facility on a small island off the coast of Attica does not cater just to Greece’s needs. Several importers are vying for space at the terminal in order to sell the gas to countries such as Bulgaria and Romania. Competition has further heated up ahead of the opening of bids by the National Natural Gas System Operator (DESFA) for the LNG supplies that will be used as reserves in 2023.

In August 15 LNG loads were dropped at Revithoussa compared to just three in August 2021. There are 13 more coming in September and another six in October. The latter however exceed September’s in volume.

DESFA’s revised 2022 procurement scheduled has emphasized exports: From the 28 loads in August and September seven were or will be transported by Bulgaria’s Bulgargaz and Hungary’s MET while in October Austria’s OMV will make its appearance with a huge load equivalent to 1 million megawatt-hours.

Among domestic importers Mytilineos steadily leads by volume while smaller loads are carried by Elpedison public gas company DEPA the Public Power Corporation and Motor Oil.

Traffic is expected to be boosted in October with the new floating storage unit (FSU) entering service.

In the first half of 2022 the Revithoussa facility covered 44% of Greece’s natural gas imports and exports rose 134.33%. As in 2021 most of the LNG has been imported from the United States; the US accounted for 58.94% of the 16.61 terawatt-hours of supplies in the first half followed by Algeria Egypt Nigeria and Oman.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZvb2wuY29tL2ludmVzdGluZy8yMDIyLzA4LzI4LzItZW5lcmd5LWNvbXBhbmllcy1iZW5lZml0aW5nLXRyYW5zaXRpb24tdG8tZXZzL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,2 Energy Companies Directly Benefiting From the Transition to Electric Vehicles,"You could try to find a niche name in the EV space -- or how about two companies with massive experience fueling autos?

Electric vehicles are hot at least with auto manufacturers which are increasingly pushing into the space. Eventually that's expected to lead to a huge increase in the number of EVs on the road even though only about 9% of global auto sales were electric vehicles in 2021. Still that was a fourfold increase over the share EVs held in 2019.

All of these new electric autos need to be charged -- a fact that hasn't escaped the notice of European energy giants Shell (SHEL 0.73%) and TotalEnergies (TTE 0.15%).

Shifting gears

When oil demand and prices plunged during the early days of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 European energy companies were among those making hard decisions. Shell and BP (BP -0.53%) both cut their dividends and at roughly the same time announced plans to materially increase the size of their clean energy operations. TotalEnergies made the same business shift but didn't cut its dividend. U.S. giants Chevron (NYSE: CVX) and ExxonMobil (NYSE: XOM) basically decided to stick with oil and natural gas.

For long-term energy-company investors worried about a future that will increasingly include clean energy the path of the European integrated oil giants should be pleasing to see. They are basically using their carbon-heavy businesses to adjust with the times; this includes projects like buying and building wind and solar farms. But there's also a more direct EV angle here.

One of the key foundations at TotalEnergies Shell and BP is their massive reach in the gasoline space. They not only produce the fuel but they also have the storefronts that sell it directly to customers. These are prime locations for installing EV chargers.

Buying some exposure

But this isn't new for TotalEnergies which started focusing on the space many years ago. For example in 2018 it bought G2mobility a leading provider of electric vehicle charging solutions in France. It increased its focus with the 2020 agreement to buy Blue Point London the largest EV charging network in that city. Also in 2020 it added Charging Solutions making TotalEnergies a big EV charging operator in Germany. And in 2021 it bought Bluecharge a large charging-point operator in Singapore.

TotalEnergies is clearly focused on gaining scale quickly in the EV charging space. That should help to augment its already strong footprint in gasoline and perhaps give it more name value as it looks to merge the two lines of business. For example the company notes that it is looking to add charging points to its 500 or so European gas stations resulting in at least 1000 charging stations along key motorways one every 150 kilometers (93 miles).

Shell is no slouch here either. It bought the largest EV charging network in the United Kingdom in 2021 and acquired Cable Energía which operates in Spain and Portugal in July 2022. Again that should help it push into the EV space and help it expand the services offered at its current gas stations.

These are just notable examples of the efforts being made by Shell and TotalEnergies; they aren't exhaustive. And to be fair despite what might sound like aggressive investment efforts EV charging is still a small business for both of these energy giants right now. But it is the long term that's important because EV charging will allow Shell and TotalEnergies to capture revenue that would otherwise go away as customers move from vehicles powered by combustion engines to ones that use electricity. This isn't just a side business it is a way to prepare for a future that is likely to eventually look very different from today.

While the financial benefit may be modest at this point the benefits are likely to snowball over time as the companies build experience their brand images and hopefully loyalty among customers.

While BP is following a similar path TotalEnergies and Shell both have stronger balance sheets with debt-to-equity ratios of 0.5 and 0.4 respectively. BP's debt-to-equity ratio is a much higher 0.8 even though it's been benefiting from high oil prices. Its European peers are just better positioned to spend the money needed on the EV front.

Yield or dividend growth?

TotalEnergies and Shell are not interchangeable investments. TotalEnergies stock has a generous yield of roughly 5.1%. Shell's dividend yield is just shy of 3.8%. Shell's dividend cut is clearly part of the story here though that reduction has given it more leeway for dividend hikes which have been fairly generous over the last couple of years.

So if you're interested in owning an energy stock with strong EV credentials TotalEnergies is the high-yield play and Shell looks like the dividend-growth option. But the best part is that both will continue to use the cash they generate from the still-large numbers of gasoline-fueled autos to fund their ongoing and perhaps advantaged pushes into the EV space.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiI2h0dHBzOi8vYWdlbmRhLmdlL2VuL25ld3MvMjAyMi8zMjYx0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Tbilisi hosts 200 tennis players from 15 countries on international tournament,"The international tournament Ten-Pro Georgia Cup 2022 launched on Sunday on the courts of Tennis Academy named after Georgian professional tennis player Leila Meskhi in Georgia’s capital Tbilisi hosting 200 players from 15 different countries.

They’re always hard although we get a wildly difficult swath or two. They’re always artful though sometimes the grid design is particularly dazzling. Today’s puzzle Hemant Mehta’s third for The New York Times and third on a Saturday is notable because every entry longer than eight letters is a debut (with one exception that’s been absent since 1981). That includes the triple center stack and three out of four of the chunky corners. Fortunately most of these new entries are far from obscure and they’re all entertaining to uncover.

Tricky Clues

I struggled a bit with some of the shorter clues. “Locale for a pin” for example is MAT (like a surface for mounting the corpse of a beetle for example or a defeated wrestler) instead of MAP. “It’s raised by the best” refers to an old pole vault idiom that involves a BAR.

17A. This pun took a minute. “Moving film?” sounds cinematic but the subject of the clue SHRINK WRAP is used to prevent breakage and to protect an item from the elements often on goods being transported.

28A. Both expressions in this stack are new entries but I think they are deducible with a few crosses because of their sensible clues. This “Demand for honesty” is simply DONT LIE TO ME. At 31A “No need to elaborate” is a more polite way of saying “enough already!”: I UNDERSTAND.",,,,,,,,,
FICO,Fair Isaac,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiQ2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnJlYWx0b3IuY29tL2FkdmljZS9maW5hbmNlL3doYXQtaXMtYS1nb29kLWNyZWRpdC1zY29yZS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,What Is a Good Credit Score? The Number You Need to Buy a Home,"If you’re hoping to buy a home with a conventional mortgage one number you’ll want to get to know well is your credit score. Also called a credit rating or FICO score (named after the company that created it the Fair Isaac Corporation) this three-digit number is a numerical representation of your credit report which outlines your history of paying off debts.

Why does your minimum credit score matter? Because when you apply for a mortgage to buy a home lenders want some reassurance a borrower will repay them later! One way they assess this is to check your creditworthiness by scrutinizing your credit report and score carefully. A high FICO rating proves you have reliably paid off past debts whether they’re from a credit card or college loan. (Insurance companies also use more targeted industry-specific FICO credit scores to gauge whom they should insure.)

In short this score matters especially in real estate. It can help you qualify for a home a car loan and so much more. Which brings us to an important question: What type of average credit score is best to buy a house?

Inside your credit score: How does it stack up?

The typical credit score range can fall anywhere from 300 to 850 with 850 being a perfect credit score. While each creditor might have subtle differences in what they deem a good or great score in general an excellent credit score is anything from 750 to 850. A good credit score is from 700 to 749; a fair credit score 650 to 699. A credit score lower than 650 is deemed poor meaning your credit history has had some rough patches.

While FICO credit requirements will vary between mortgage lenders generally a good or excellent credit score means you’ll have little trouble if you hope to score a conventional loan. Lenders will want the business of home buyers with good credit and may try to entice them to sign on with them by offering loans with lower interest rates instead of higher interest rates says Richard Redmond at All California Mortgage in Larkspur and author of “Mortgages: The Insider’s Guide.”

Since a lower credit score means a borrower has had some late payments or other dings on their credit report an issuer may see this consumer as more likely to default on their home loan. All that said a low credit score doesn’t necessarily mean you can’t score eligibility for a mortgage loan—but it may be tough when looking at qualifying requirements. They may still give you a type of mortgage but it may be a subprime loan with a higher interest mortgage rate or private mortgage insurance says Bill Hardekopf a credit expert at CardRates.com.

How a score is calculated

Credit scores are calculated by three major U.S. credit bureaus: Experian Equifax and TransUnion. All three credit-reporting agency scores should be roughly similar although each pulls from slightly different sources. For instance Experian looks at rent payments. TransUnion checks out your employment history. These reports are extremely detailed—for instance if you paid a car loan bill late five years ago an Experian report can pinpoint the exact month that happened. By and large here are the main variables that the credit bureaus use to determine a consumer credit score—including debt-to-income ratio—and to what degree:

Payment history (35%): This is whether you’ve made debt payments on time. If you’ve never missed a monthly payment a 30-day delinquency can cause as much as a 90- to 110-point drop in your personal finance score.

This is whether you’ve made debt payments on time. If you’ve never missed a monthly payment a 30-day delinquency can cause as much as a 90- to 110-point drop in your personal finance score. Debt-to-credit utilization (30%): This is how much debt a consumer has accumulated on their credit card balances divided by the available credit limit on the sum of those accounts. Ratios above 30% work against you. So if you have a total credit limit of $5000 you will want to be in debt no more than $1500 when you apply for a home loan amount.

So if you have a total credit limit of $5000 you will want to be in debt no more than $1500 when you apply for a home loan amount. Length of credit history (15%): It’s beneficial for a consumer to have a track record of being a responsible credit user. A longer payment history boosts your score. Those without a long-enough credit history to build a good score can consider alternate credit-scoring methods like the VantageScore. VantageScore can reportedly establish a credit score in as little as one month; whereas FICO requires about six months of credit history instead.

VantageScore can reportedly establish a credit score in as little as one month; whereas FICO requires about six months of credit history instead. Credit mix (10%): Your credit score ticks up if you have a rich combination of different types of credit card accounts such as credit cards retail store credit cards installment loans and a previous or current home loan.

Your credit score ticks up if you have a rich combination of different types of credit card accounts such as credit cards retail store credit cards installment loans and a previous or current home loan. New credit accounts (10%): Research shows that opening several new credit card accounts within a short period of time represents greater risk to the lender according to myFICO so avoid applying for new credit cards if you’re about to buy a home. Also each time you open a new credit line the average length of your credit history decreases (further hurting your credit score).

How to check your credit score

So now that you know exactly what’s considered a good vs. bad credit rating how can you find out your own credit score and minimum credit score requirements? You can get a free credit score online at CreditKarma.com. You can also check with your credit card company since some (like Discover and Capital One) offer a free credit score as well as credit reports so you can conduct your own credit check and determine how to reach a higher credit score.

Another way to check what’s on your credit report—including credit problems that are dragging down your credit score—is to get your free copy at AnnualCreditReport.com. Each credit-reporting agency (Experian Equifax and TransUnion) may also provide credit reports and scores but these may often entail a fee. Plus you should know that a credit report or score from any one of these bureaus may be detailed but may not be considered as complete as those by FICO since FICO compiles data from all three credit bureaus in one comprehensive credit report.

Even if you’re fairly sure you’ve never made a late payment many Americans find errors on their credit file Errors are common because creditors make mistakes reporting customer slip-ups. For example although you may have never missed a payment someone with the same name as you did—and your bank recorded the error on your account by accident.

If you discover errors you can remove them from your credit report by contacting Equifax Experian or TransUnion with proof that the information was incorrect. From there they will remove these flaws from your report which will later be reflected in your score by FICO. Or even if your credit report does not contain errors if it’s not as great as you’d hoped you can raise your credit score. Just keep in mind regardless of whatever credit-scoring model you use you can’t improve a credit score overnight which is why you should check your credit score annually—and improve your credit score—long before you get the itch to score a home save for a down payment or apply for any type of loan.",,,,,,,,,,,,

(Published 2022),"CLEVELAND — When a young man from Florida barely old enough to enter a bar began buying up office buildings in downtown Cleveland many in the real estate industry here were eager to do business with him. Even though Chaim Schochet wasn’t forthcoming about who his financial backers were or the particulars of his employer Optima he had deep pockets and his company apparently was able to pay in cash.

It was 2008 and the city had fallen over the edge of a massive foreclosure crisis. Cleveland was hurting and Optima (which has used different versions of its name) eventually became its largest holder of commercial real estate. And Cleveland was not alone. In communities from West Virginia to Kentucky a desperate need for investors led elected officials in struggling cities and towns to roll out the red carpet for Optima which bought up steel plants factories and commercial real estate.

But things that seem too good to be true often are. In 2019 a Ukrainian bank filed a lawsuit in Delaware alleging that Optima was a front for two Ukrainian oligarchs who used it to launder hundreds of millions of dollars of stolen money. The Federal Bureau of Investigation raided Optima’s offices the following year. In 2021 the State Department issued sanctions against one of the oligarchs Ihor Kolomoisky.

Cleveland has now become a poster child for the need for more transparency in the U.S. real estate industry. A raft of new anti-money laundering laws and regulations is aimed at the industry which has attracted more than $2 billion in illicit funds over a recent five-year period according to one report. Chipping away at the culture of anonymous ownership is a good thing and is long overdue. But the new rules won’t address the elephant in the room: Many cities and small towns especially in the American Midwest badly need investment and sometimes shadowy foreign money is the only kind that comes calling.",,,,,,,,,,,,

Route Consultant

FedEx and its largest contractor are locked in a contentious battle over how to handle rising costs.

The acrimony increased Friday when FedEx filed suit against Spencer Patton's company.

Hours later FedEx Ground terminated all of Patton's contracts. Here's how we got to this moment.

On Friday FedEx filed a lawsuit against what was its largest delivery contractor Spencer Patton.

Hours after filing suit seeking ""permanent injunctive relief and monetary damages"" related to ""false and misleading statements"" about FedEx Ground the Memphis company terminated all contracts with Patton.

""I am being forced to pull our small businesses out of the communities we serve but we are working hard to re-home our employees"" Patton said. The logistics part of Patton's business has 225 employees in 10 states. The lawsuit is directed at Patton's consultancy for the delivery businesses Route Consultant Inc. which the case claims is the true beneficiary of all Patton's efforts to date.

""We can confirm FedEx Ground exercised its rights to immediately stop contracting with a small number of service provider businesses owned by one individual"" a FedEx Ground spokesperson said in a statement. ""While those businesses operate in several locations they constitute less than 0.5% of the approximately 60000 total routes across the FedEx Ground network. We have contingency plans in place and do not anticipate any impact to service based on these contract actions.""

Friday's events are the most dramatic yet in a fight that got serious in July when Patton warned that FedEx Ground's unwillingness to address the concerns of the 6000 independent contractors who deliver its packages was driving many out of business and putting its network in ""peril.""

Since then Patton has moved to form a trade group to represent contractors and talked about getting the small businesses franchise status. He has encouraged his fellow contractors to be wary of FedEx's pay offerings for the upcoming holiday season and said that if FedEx didn't make operational and contractual changes by November 25 he would shutter his delivery service — a threat that is now null.

FedEx has said the Ground network is sound and that it will consider any attempt at collective bargaining a breach of contract.

Here's how the contentious partners got to this point:

Unhappy holidays

FedEx Ground contractors have various long-standing grievances. High on the list is FedEx's move to seven-days-a-week service in May 2019 — many say there's not enough demand on Sundays to make it profitable.

But things got worse last winter when FedEx overestimated package volume for the 2021 holiday season. The disconnect between projections and reality meant many contractors didn't make enough to cover the cost of ramping up operations and many told Insider they have still not recovered financially.

In January 800 contractors signed a letter to FedEx Ground detailing their problems with rising costs especially fuel and diminishing returns. ""We need help fast!"" the letter read. Contractors said that from 2020 to the 2021 holiday season their payouts decreased by 20% although package volume was roughly the same. Vehicle costs were up $10000 and wages 30% lower compared to one year ago the letter said.

Fuel surcharges on the fire

In a March 18 letter to contractors FedEx Ground's CEO John Smith said the company took a look at the gas and diesel compensation for contractors and decided no special action was necessary. ""Our data indicates that service providers operating with either type of fuel are seeing weekly fuel-related payment increases that are commensurate with the recent market fuel price changes"" Smith wrote.







""What really lit this powder keg"" Patton told Insider last week was ""when FedEx released and highlighted in their earnings report that they had successfully passed through fuel surcharges to the US consumer and then did not pass through the entirety of those to their contractors.""

Summer of discontent

In late July Patton published his first video plea to FedEx raising the alarm about contractors' financial health. He called for increased pay and promised to have his fellow contractors elect a 10-member committee to represent their interests.

Contractors who participate in the September vote will join what Patton calls the Trade Association for Logistics Professionals. He later said that as a last resort the body could pursue getting FedEx contractors reclassified as franchisees.

In a response to Patton's tactics Smith said that any contractors who attempt to bargain collectively would be in breach of contract.

In a mid-August talking points memo for staff obtained by Insider FedEx said it has ""multiple contingency levers available"" to keep service consistent despite claims that contractors are failing.

As to the franchise threat the document says every business ""must determine whether membership in any trade association is in their organization's best interest."" It also says the current service-provider model ""does not align with a franchisor/franchisee relationship.""

Patton threatens FedEx's sacred cash cow

Last week more than 4000 FedEx contractors — representing roughly two-thirds of the FedEx Ground network — convened in Las Vegas for the conference Patton hosts every year. He used the venue to declare that he would shut down his delivery service if he didn't see operational and contractual changes by Thanksgiving.

Patton also encouraged his fellow contractors to take a hard look at FedEx's contract offering for the holidays calling the deal a chance for the company to ""restore the faith of their contractors."" If a critical mass of contractors rejects the deal that could affect FedEx's capacity to cash in on its busiest season. ""It is one of the most powerful forms of leverage that me and my independent business is able to exercise with FedEx Ground"" Patton said in a conference session last week.

""My heart is in this to see FedEx Ground make lots of money"" Patton said during one of two keynotes he gave at the conference. ""I just need to see the contractors make money as well.""

FedEx strikes back

In its lawsuit FedEx accused Patton of creating a ""fictionalized crisis"" between FedEx Ground and its contractors ""as an advertisement for the purported need for Route Consultant's consultancy and other services.""

In a statement issued after the suit was filed Patton said ""I am not afraid of a lawsuit from FedEx."" He also told Insider in July he knew that losing his contracts was a possibility.

""For years FedEx Ground has used bullying tactics when interacting with their contractors to create an environment of intimidation"" he said Friday evening. ""This move to cancel our contracts is a clear case of a $60 billion corporation silencing anyone with a voice.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiV2h0dHBzOi8vZ29sZndlZWsudXNhdG9kYXkuY29tLzIwMjIvMDgvMjgvcm9yeS1tY2lscm95LXdpbnMtdG91ci1jaGFtcGlvbnNoaXAtZmVkZXgtY3VwL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Rory McIlroy pulls off stunning comeback to win Tour Championship and FedEx Cup,"ATLANTA – Rory McIlroy pulled off an improbable comeback rallying from six strokes back to knock off World No. 1 Scottie Scheffler with a final-round 4-under 66 at East Lake Golf Club to win the Tour Championship.

McIlroy became the first player to win the FedEx Cup the PGA Tour’s season-long competition three times. He did it in dramatic fashion on Sunday authoring the largest final-round comeback in Tour Championship history and finishing at 21 under one stroke better than Scheffler and Sungjae Im. McIlroy said he wasn’t giving himself much of a chance to claim the top prize of $18 million at the start of the round figuring he’d need to shoot 61 or 62.

“What a week what a day. I feel like Scottie deserves at least half of this today” McIlroy said. “I feel sort of bad that I pipped him to the post. He’s a hell of a competitor and an even better guy. It was an honor and a privilege to battle with him today. I’m sure there will be many more. I told him we’re 1 all in Georgia. He got the Masters and I got this.”

The Northern Irishman spotted Scheffler six strokes in the staggered-start scoring system implemented at the Tour Championship. McIlroy gave him an even bigger head start by pulling his opening tee shot of the tournament on Thursday out of bounds and made triple bogey at the first and bogey at the second to fall 10 strokes behind.

“I got off to the worst start possible” said McIlroy who said he thought of South Korea’s Tom Kim who opened the Wyndham Championship with a quadruple bogey and went on to win.

“It just shows you anything’s possible even when you’re a few behind or a few in front in the tournament. Anything can happen” said McIlroy who rebounded to shoot 67 on Thursday. “I’m going to remember this week mostly for that.”

He chipped away at Scheffler’s lead with another 67 on Friday and then made his move on Saturday. After the third round was suspended for the day due to lightning McIlroy returned Sunday morning and made birdies on his final two holes to cap off a round of 7-under 63.

“It’s a perfect way to end the round” McIlroy said.

Still Scheffler who made four birdies in his final six holes of the third round entered the final round with a six-stroke cushion. It disappeared quickly.

“Everybody talks about how fun it is to win. It’s not” NBC’s Paul Azinger said. “It’s the hardest thing in the world to do. It’s only after the fact that it’s fun.”

On a bright steamy day McIlroy stumbled again at the first hole but bounced back with four birdies in a five-hole stretch beginning at the third. Trying for his fifth win of the season Scheffler struggled to three bogeys in his first six holes.

“This is a disaster” Azinger said after Scheffler flubbed a flop shot into a greenside bunker at No. 6. “It’s hard to watch this happen to a guy of this pedigree this caliber. This was always going to be a hard day for him a hard weekend and he’s really feeling the heat now.”

McIlroy made birdie one hole later to tie for the lead. But Scheffler wouldn’t go down without a fight. He stuck his approach to 5 feet at No. 8 to regain the lead. McIlroy knotted the tournament again with a short birdie at No. 12 but surrendered a stroke when he failed to get up and down at 14. He got the stroke back in dramatic fashion sinking a 32-foot birdie putt one hole later and sending the pro-McIlroy gallery into a frenzy. For the day McIlroy was the top putter gaining nearly four strokes on the field on the greens.

The lead belonged to McIlroy one hole later when his chip from behind the green hit the flagstick and stopped 7 feet away. McIlroy coolly canned the par putt to stay 21 under and Scheffler missed from 9 feet.

“That was a combination of skill and luck” McIlroy said of his par at 16 which knocked Scheffler from the lead for the first time all tournament.

Scheffler failed to birdie either of the last two holes and closed in 3-over 73 which tied for the highest score of the day among the 29-man field and his six-stroke cushion matched losing the largest lead going into the final round in Tour history.

“I really fought hard today” Scheffler said. “Rory just played a really good round of golf. He made some key putts there at the end and he definitely deserved to win.”

Despite a double bogey at 14 when he duffed a flop shot the 24-year-old South Korean Im birdied two of his last four holes to shoot 66 and concluded his most successful season to date with quite the payday. He took home $5.75 million for finishing tied for second.

“My goal this week was to finish top 5 and to be finishing this high up is very unexpected” Im said. “I’m glad how everything came out together.”

So too was McIlroy who previously won the 2016 Deutsche Bank Championship after being 4-over through three holes and overcoming a six-stroke final-round deficit there as well. Why does he thrive in the role of chaser?

“Because I think out of anyone in the field” he said “I care the least about the money.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYWh0dHBzOi8vZ29sZi5jb20vbmV3cy90b3VybmFtZW50cy9yb3J5LW1jaWxyb3ktc2NvdHRpZS1zY2hlZmZsZXItd2luLXRvdXItY2hhbXBpb25zaGlwLWZlZGV4LWN1cC_SAWFodHRwczovL2dvbGYuY29tL25ld3MvdG91cm5hbWVudHMvcm9yeS1tY2lscm95LXNjb3R0aWUtc2NoZWZmbGVyLXdpbi10b3VyLWNoYW1waW9uc2hpcC1mZWRleC1jdXAv?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Marvelous McIlroy!

Rory McIlroy was back on his heels.

He had made up six strokes on Scottie Scheffler in the first seven holes to tie for the lead during Sunday’s Tour Championship final round but had made bogey on 14 after a perfect tee shot. Now he was standing on the long par-3 island-green 15th $18 million on the line.

What does he do?

Hit it to 32 feet and then drill the putt to tie for the lead once again.

“Come on!” McIlroy screamed.

After a clutch par save on the 16th — with a little assist from the flagstick — McIlroy pulled away from Scheffler the FedEx Cup leader for most of the season with a final-round 66 to win the Tour Championship by a stroke over Scheffler and Sungjae Im and the $18 million first-place prize of the FedEx Cup.

“I just felt so close all year” McIlroy said moments after his victory. “I had a couple wins but I was just waiting for something. Maybe this was it. I got a little lucky with Scottie not playing his best golf today and I took advantage of that with my good play. But you know I went up against the best player in the world today and I took him down and that’s got to mean something.”

The final round was a matchup of the tour’s most successful player this season in Scheffler who led the tour with four wins including the Masters and its statistical best in McIlroy who led in scoring average and Strokes-Gained: Total. However Sunday afternoon Scheffler looked far from the player who dominated much of the Spring and had earned a two-stroke advantage to start the tournament in the staggered-start format. His cuts off the tee weren’t cutting he hit just half of his greens in the final round leading to his only over-par round of the week. He didn’t look like the player who made four birdies to finish his third round Sunday morning and open up a six-stroke lead over McIlroy and Xander Schauffele.

Meanwhile McIlroy had a picture-perfect start to his championship Sunday and carried it into the final round.

He first birdied the two holes he had left to play on a marathon Sunday to complete his third round.

“It’s the perfect way to start the day and hopefully I can continue that into this afternoon” McIlroy said in the morning.

And he did continue it. Despite a bogey on the first hole at East Lake — the same one he tripled to open the tournament on Thursday — McIlroy made four birdies in the next six holes to pull even with Scheffler at 20-under-par.

Scheffler quickly pulled ahead again with a birdie on 8 to take the lead outright again but that would be his last birdie of the day.

McIlroy pulled into a tie again on 12. Scheffler seemed indecisive on his second shot from 119 yards backing off several times and checking the wind in the trees. His approach came up short coming to rest nestled in the Bermuda rough. Scheffler made a great up-and-down to stay at 21-under but McIlroy stuck his second to 6-feet and drained the putt.

McIlroy looked poised to take control on the long par-4 14th after a perfect 346-yard drive one of his many 330-yard bombs for the week but blocked his second shot and short-sided himself. His third came up just short of the green and he made bogey to fall out of the lead.

After the birdie on 15 both players in the final pairing drove it left on 16. Scheffler’s ball was nestled down in the rough and he manufactured a shot into the front greenside bunker. McIlroy seemed to have the advantage in the fairway bunker just 130 yards from the hole. He seemed to like his approach even twirling his club but the ball sailed long into the gallery behind the green leaving a difficult third shot from the trampled down rough with the green running away from him.

His third was hot running too fast before he caught a break. The ball which looked to be going off the green hit the center of the pin and came to rest just 7 feet from the hole.

Scheffler failed to get up and down from the bunker while McIlroy drilled his par putt giving him a one-shot lead the first time anyone other than Scheffler had led all week.

The pair provided some light drama on the par-5 finishing hole as Scheffler left his second in the greenside bunker short right but McIlroy snap-hooked his approach left into the grandstand. He caught another break with the ball ricocheting back into to play.

Scheffler hit his third long of the green all but dooming his chances.

“It’s yours Rory take it” a fan could be heard yelling as McIlroy was playing his third.

Needing just a par McIlroy played it safe hitting his third to 20 feet and two-putting for the win after Scheffler’s birdie chip fell short.

McIlroy’s win puts a bow on a wild PGA Tour season in which the Tour saw a rival LIV Golf launch and sign several notable players. Among them were many of McIlroy’s longtime European Ryder Cup teammates. But McIlroy found himself as one of LIV’s most outspoken critics and along with Tiger Woods led some of the player effort to make wholesale changes to the PGA Tour. Just this week McIlroy announced the creation of a complementary league to the PGA Tour the TGL started by himself and Woods through their new TMRW Sports Group.

“Everyone on Tour has had to deal with a lot” McIlroy said as the recent upheaval in the pro game. “Even the guys that have went to LIV have had to deal with a lot. It’s just been a very tumultuous sort of era in our game. I said it in the sort of prize ceremony there this is the best place in the world to play golf. It’s the most competitive. It’s got the best players. It’s got the deepest fields. I don’t know why you’d want to play anywhere else.”

On Sunday evening McIlroy surely had nothing to regret about the path he has chosen. He is now the only player to ever win three FedEx Cups the last one coming with the largest single check of his career: $18 million.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZyZWlnaHR3YXZlcy5jb20vbmV3cy9mZWRleC1ncm91bmQtY3V0cy10aWVzLXdpdGgtbWlsaXRhbnQtZHJpdmVyLWNvbnRyYWN0b3LSAVxodHRwczovL3d3dy5mcmVpZ2h0d2F2ZXMuY29tL25ld3MvZmVkZXgtZ3JvdW5kLWN1dHMtdGllcy13aXRoLW1pbGl0YW50LWRyaXZlci1jb250cmFjdG9yL2FtcA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,FedEx Ground cuts ties with militant driver contractor,"FedEx Ground has played hardball and in so doing has tossed its most militant delivery driver contractor from the game.

Late Friday the ground-delivery unit of FedEx Corp. (NYSE: FDX) announced it immediately ceased working with a group of delivery service providers controlled by Spencer Patton a Nashville Tennessee-based contractor engaged in an increasingly hostile fight with FedEx Ground over the financial condition of its 6000-member contractor network.

In a statement late Friday FedEx said it had “exercised its rights” under its contract with Patton to sever ties with his companies. In a separate email on Saturday the company said the action was based on Patton’s businesses’ “continued failure” to meet the terms of their service agreements despite the company providing them opportunities to do so.

Patton’s 10-state operation accounted for less than 0.5% of the approximately 60000 total routes across the FedEx Ground network the company said. “We have contingency plans in place and do not anticipate any impact to service based on these contract actions” it said.

Patton oversaw a network called Patton Logistics with 275 trucks with 225 employees. Those employees are for now out of jobs.

Patton like all other FedEx Ground contractors operated across designated territories under contracts that run between 12 and 18 months. FedEx Ground uses a non-union contractor model to pick up and deliver packages and to provide linehaul service between the company’s hubs. Entities are required to purchase the right to operate the territories and are free to sell those rights as well.

Patton declined comment beyond a statement issued late Friday afternoon disclosing the termination. He did not mention in the statement what his next steps would be. Patton said that FedEx Ground has long used “bullying tactics when interacting with their contractors to create an environment of intimidation.”

The move to end the relationship is a “clear case of a $60 billion corporation silencing anyone with a voice” he said.





The move came hours after FedEx Ground had sued Patton’s consulting firm Route Consultant Inc. charging it with spreading false and misleading claims about the financial condition of the driver contractors. In the suit the company said the company sought to influence contractors into using its services to renegotiate their contracts.

FedEx Ground negotiates contracts directly with individual contractors and has said it has no interest in working with third parties seeking to negotiate on behalf of other contractors. The company said that Patton is looking to insert himself as a bargaining representative actions that would constitute a breach of contract.

Patton who has said it would make no sense to manufacture turmoil at the company it earns his living from has repeatedly warned that as many as 35% of contractors are in financial distress due to the rapidly escalating costs of fuel labor and equipment. In addition residential delivery volumes have leveled off along with post-pandemic e-commerce activity.

Without additional financial support from FedEx Ground many contractors may not make it through the end of the year Patton warned. FedEx Ground pays local pickup and delivery drivers a per-stop fee and its linehaul contractors a per-mile fee.

FedEx Ground has acknowledged the challenges facing the contractor network. Contractors can submit proposals to renegotiate their existing contracts the company said. In its suit FedEx Ground said it consented to 40% of renegotiation requests since July 1. More than 90% of those negotiations have resulted in higher contractual payments the company said.

Patton has argued that the company doesn’t even respond to requests to renegotiate contracts and that it denies many of the requests it does respond to.

Patton had become a polarizing figure in the FedEx Ground ecosystem and his efforts have drawn significant contractor support. A two-day conference he hosted last weekend in Las Vegas drew about 3500 attendees and thousands more watching and listening virtually.

At the same time there are contractors who believe that Patton doesn’t speak for them and that it is not his place to get between their businesses and FedEx Ground. One of those contractors said Friday night that “I’m saddened that it has come to this but it is not unexpected. As [Patton] stated he knew what he was getting into. Now I hope we can slow the rhetoric and get back to focusing on a successful peak [season].”





During his Saturday keynote Patton said he would cease working with FedEx Ground on or about Nov. 25 – the big shopping day known as “Black Friday” – unless the company helps out his business.

Patton also said that for the rest of the year he will refuse FedEx Ground’s offers to provide as-needed support at other company terminals. These arrangements known as “contingencies” are designed to fill short-term service voids at designated terminals until FedEx Ground can find contractors to serve the routes those terminals support."

Why one man says it's too soon to write off democracy in America,"CNN —

“You are more powerful than you think.”

That’s the title of one of Eric Liu’s most popular books but it’s also a theme that runs throughout the work of the author and activist. He’s spent much of his life trying to persuade people that “democracy still works and is worth believing in.”

Liu 54 is CEO and co-founder of Citizen University a nonprofit group based in Seattle Washington that teaches people how to cultivate civic power. He also is an evangelist for democracy a charismatic writer and speaker whose philosophy could be distilled in this observation from the late historian Howard Zinn: “Democracy is not what governments do; it’s what people do.”

“I am a Democrat but I am not a partisan for my party. I am a partisan for democracy” Liu told CNN.

Liu’s optimism may seem misplaced today. One recent poll found that 64% of Americans believe their democracy is “in crisis and at risk of failing.” Another recent poll found 72% of Americans say the US used to be a good model of democracy but not in recent years. More than half of Americans now say they expect a civil war to erupt in the near future.

But where some see chaos Liu sees vitality. He says engaged citizens get angry; apathetic and cynical citizens don’t make noise. And amid anxieties about Russian aggression and an emboldened China Liu says America’s tumultuous political climate is not a weakness but a strength.

In “Become America: Civic Sermons on Love Responsibility and Democracy” Liu wrote:

“American history is a record of small groups of people who keep remaking this country over and over and who reveal to us all that the perpetual remaking is the greatest statement of fidelity to our creed and our national purpose which is not to be like Russia white and stagnant and oligarchic or like China monoethnic and authoritarian and centralized but to be more like America hybrid and dynamic and democratic and free to be remade.”

Liu is the son of immigrants and a former White House speechwriter and policy adviser for President Bill Clinton. A popular TED Talk speaker (he calls his speeches “civic sermons”) he also conducts “Civic Saturday” events around the country at which people gather for music and spoken-word performances.

These include readings of “civic scripture” foundational American documents such as Lincoln’s “Second Inaugural Address” and the speech the 19th-century women’s rights activist Susan B. Anthony gave when she was put on trial for attempting to vote.

Liu is currently working on a new book “What an American Should Know” which seeks to detail the core civic knowledge all Americans should possess in this polarized era.

CNN recently talked with Liu about why he remains optimistic about America’s future how the move to censor history in public schools could backfire and his response to those who say they want to Make America Great Again. His comments were edited for brevity.

One sign of democratic decay is when most citizens don't vote because they are too apathetic or cynical Eric Liu says. Seth Herald/AFP/Getty Images

Democratic Rep. James Clyburn recently said it seems as if most Americans have given up on the pursuit of a more perfect union and that our democracy is in danger of “imploding.” What would you say to those who say that human beings are too tribal to make a multiracial democracy work in America?

I would say when you succumb to cynicism you give it power. What we are doing is hard because it is unprecedented. We are trying to be planet Earth’s first multiracial multicultural and multifaith democratic republic at scale. That hasn’t existed before. To those who conclude it’s not possible I would say it’s too early to say that. And by saying that you’re dooming the project.

The only way to determine whether this project is possible is to act as if it’s possible — that is to commit over and over again to become that country we’d like to see.

You’ve talked about the power of stories before. “Make America Great Again” seems like such an effective political slogan because there’s a story wrapped in it that implies that this country was once great when White Americans dominated and that people like Donald Trump are going to restore it to greatness. What kind of counter-story can those who have a different vision of America tell that address the fears of some White Americans?

The most simple and potent story to tell is ‘We’re all better off when we’re all better off.’ This country will be the most competitive and powerful in the world when every fit and able competitor can participate — PS everyone is potentially a fit competitor. The more of us that can participate the stronger we are as a country.

The narrative of Make American Great Again assumes that America once was great for everybody something went wrong and now you have to fix it. But I would say that the story of we’re all better off when we’re all better off also contains some assumptions and the assumption is we haven’t yet had a country that felt great for everybody and when we do it will be great for everybody.

But the other assumption embedded in this second story line is that life is not zero-sum that if people of color can enjoy opportunities rights and privileges in the same way that White Americans have always been able to do that will not diminish the opportunities that White Americans have. It will actually enlarge the pie not divvy it up.

Is there anything from our country’s history to back up what you said that we are all better off when we’re all better off?

I would point to most institutions in the United States. I’m a baseball guy. The institution of major league baseball is stronger healthier and more robust now that it includes players beyond White players. It’s a more thriving business.

Every Fortune 500 company is stronger more resilient and with a deeper capacity for innovation and more widespread diversified markets because the United States has moved into full economic citizenship and economic power for people of color as well as White Americans.

The military is another great example. Every chief of staff in each of the uniformed services will tell you that their service is stronger and more resilient and more adaptative and more capable because America is more diverse now. They didn’t think in zero-sum terms. They didn’t think starting in 1950 that if we desegregate the army there’s not going to be enough slots for White people in the army.

The US military has long been one of the most integrated institutions in America. The military grew stronger by becoming more diverse and so can other institutions Liu says. Robert Nickelsberg/Getty Images

The military seems like one of the last institutions where all of these different Americans come together from all walks of life. How do we create more spaces like that for people in the US?

I’m a champion of national service. It would be great to have more widespread expectation of national service for young people. I’m a champion of a year in the civilian or the military service where you are coming together with a group of people unlike yourself of having to work on something together to deepen your appreciation for one another and for the breadth beauty and the diversity of our country.

Some White parents and Republican legislators are campaigning against what they call “woke schooling” in public classrooms. School boards and teachers are being pressured not to teach history that they say shames people. If this battle against “wokeism” in public schools is successful what will the end result be?

The result will be a citizenry that is less capable of self-government. An education that forces every student to avoid the uncomfortable parts to steer clear of anything that might cause White students discomfort is going to leave all students more emotionally brittle more civically weak and less capable of governing themselves.

The point of public education is to make citizens capable together of living together in a diverse community. If all you’ve gotten is white-washed history and that everybody was a good guy and don’t talk about stuff that makes some people uncomfortable then the minute you graduate and walk into a community where there are people with different views and where there are bad things that have persisted since the beginning our country that have gone acknowledged when you walk into the real world outside of the classroom you are less capable of participating in democracy.

That kind of forced indoctrination is more befitting China than America. It’s more befitting a country that wants top-down indoctrination of correct thought other than viewpoint diversity.

I’ve heard you talk about the difference between optimism and hope. Why do you choose hope over optimism ?

Optimism is a spectator’s posture. I’m optimistic that the Yankees are going to pull out of this funk and win the World Series. But I have nothing to do with whether that comes to pass. I’m just watching. Hope implies agency. Hope says I have something to do with the outcome.

I have hope that American democracy is going to pull out of this funk and it becomes stronger and more adaptive for all. Why do I have that hope? Because I literally spend every waking moment working on that with people in every part of the country who are not famous or who might not have a million followers but are doing the work of holding a community together.

When you look back on the Jan. 6 insurrection and all the recent headlines have you ever lost hope?

I have not lost hope ever.

Really? Not even for a day?

Not even for a day. Are there days where I’m tired? Yes. Are there days where I wonder if what I’m doing is enough? You bet. But that’s a long distance from losing hope.

Once you get started working with other people — yes vote read the news pay attention —but the most important thing you can do is join a club. Join a group and build that muscle of being in association with other people.

And once you get involved with other people in trying to make something happen for some common purpose — it could be a civic purpose it could be a hobby like building a book club — you realize how hard it is to kill hope.

Hope dies fastest when you are alone when you are isolated and cut off from other people. But hope is a hard thing to kill when you are not alone.

Eric Liu says there are civic scriptures that every citizen should know. Abraham Lincoln's Second Inaugural address pictured here is a classic speech extolling the healing of a divided nation. General Photographic Agency/Hulton Archive/Getty Images

How much of your activism is shaped by being the child of immigrants? (Liu’s parents were born in China and moved to the US from Taiwan).

Almost everything I do civically is shaped by the fact that I am the child of immigrants. When you’re second-generation American it’s very vivid seeing how much most Americans take for granted. When you’re one generation removed from not having any of the rights and privileges of Americans you realize how fragile and precious these things are.

And by these things I mean our Constitution but I also mean a culture in which we create constant remixes and churn out new hybrids of music food and song and bloodline — everything that happens here that doesn’t happen in other places.

Americans who were born here stop thinking about that. It’s just the water you swim in. Being the child of immigrants I can see through my parents’ eyes how much they had to give up risk and sacrifice to come here and how precious things here are that made that sacrifice worth it. I have an urgent obligation to be a part of the solution to help this country deliver on its promises.",,,,,,,,,,,,

CREDIT Chris Kirkland and colleagues. GSA

A new study of zircon crystals from two of Earth’s oldest continents indicates that the formation of Earth’s continental crust goes through cycles with periods of increased crust production roughly every 200 million years corresponding to the solar system’s transit through the four primary spiral arms of the Milky Way galaxy. According to the study published in the journal Geology yesterday regions of space with dense interstellar clouds may send more high-energy comets crashing to the surface of the Earth seeding enhanced production of continental crust.

“As geologists we normally think about processes internal to the earth being really important for how our planet has evolved. But we can also think about the much larger scale and look at extraterrestrial processes and where we fit in the galactic environment” explains Chris Kirkland lead author of the study.

Among its many unique features Earth remains the only planet we know of that hosts continents and active plate tectonics. Plate-tectonic processes have helped make our planet hospitable to life—shaping the composition and behavior of the hydrosphere atmosphere and biosphere.

The data used in this new study came from two places where Earth’s earliest continental history is preserved: the North American craton in Greenland and the Pilbara craton in western Australia. In both locations decay of uranium in zircon crystals has been used to establish a timeline of formation spanning the period from roughly 2.8–3.8 billion years ago during the Archean eon. Hafnium isotopes measured within the zircon were used to identify periods of time when there were influxes of juvenile magmas associated with crust production. Using mathematical analysis the researchers uncovered the longer period pattern corresponding with the “galactic year.” They observed a similar pattern when looking at oxygen isotopes bolstering their results.

The researchers point to galactic traffic as the likely source of this pattern. Our Solar System and the spiral arms of the Milky Way are both spinning around the galaxy’s center but they are moving at different speeds. While the spiral arms orbit at 210 km/second the sun is cruising along at 240 km/second meaning it is surfing into and out of spiral arms over time. At the outer reaches of our solar system astronomers believe there is a cloud of icy planetesimals—named the Oort cloud—orbiting our sun at a distance of between 0.03 to 3.2 light years (for comparison the Earth is 8.3 light minutes from the Sun). As the solar system moves into a spiral arm interaction between the Oort cloud and the denser material of the spiral arms could send more icy material from the Oort cloud hurling toward Earth. While Earth experiences more regular impacts from the rocky bodies of the asteroid belt comets ejected from the Oort cloud arrive with much more energy. Kirkland explains “That’s important because more energy will result in more melting. When it hits it causes larger amounts of decompression melting creating a larger uplift of material creating a larger crustal seat.”

Spherule beds—rock formations produced by meteorite impacts—are another key piece of evidence linking periods of increased crust generation to comet impacts. Spherule beds are deposits of small spheres formed either as ejected impact melt or condensed and rained out from rock-vapor plumes after impact. The authors of the study observed that the ages of spherule beds are well-correlated with the solar system’s movement into spiral arms around 3.25 and 3.45 billion years ago. Determining the ages for more deposits of spherule beds could add more evidence to the story.

Phil Sutton an astrophysicist and coauthor of the study explains that these findings should motivate more investigation of how forces outside the solar system have shaped our planet. “It’s very hard to prove these things; we want to make that link and start the conversation to look at geological processes beyond the Earth beyond the Solar System and what might drive those. We didn’t just form in isolation.”

By the term conventional model we refer to the LSTM model in which no TL has been applied; in this context the conventional LSTM model is solely based on training with data from the target PV.

Baseline model performance

The stacked LSTM model has the following lag features: (a) Power output measured value (b) air temperature (c) global horizontal irradiance (d) humidity (e) month of the year (in the form of one-hot encoding) and (f) hour of the day (in the form of sine/cosine transformation). The above-mentioned features are fed into the LSTM model in the format of “5 inputs - 1 output” of hourly data. More specifically a point value for each feature is fed into the model for the last five hours and the PV power output for the next hour is predicted (one-hour ahead power output forecast).

Ensuring an accurate base model is a prerequisite for achieving accurate predictions in the target domain. In this context the performance of the LSTM model for the base PV is evaluated with the following procedure: The base PV dataset is split into train set and evaluation set using a 80-20 split keeping the first 80% as training and the remaining 20% as testing (17563 observations for the training process and 4391 observations for evaluation purposes) and the LSTM model is trained on the training set. The accuracy of the model is evaluated by computing the root mean squared error (RMSE) and the mean absolute error (MAE) of the respective forecasts across the evaluation period considered as well as the coefficient of determination \(R^2\) between the forecasts and the real values as follows:

$$\begin{aligned} RMSE= & {} \sqrt{ \frac{1}{n} \displaystyle \sum _{t=1}^{n} ({y_t-\hat{y_t}})^2 } \end{aligned}$$ (7)

$$\begin{aligned} MAE= & {} \frac{1}{n} \displaystyle \sum _{t=1}^{n} | {y_t-\hat{y_t}|} \end{aligned}$$ (8)

$$\begin{aligned} R^2= & {} 1 - \frac{ \displaystyle \sum _{t=1}^{n} ({y_t-\hat{y_t}})^2}{\displaystyle \sum _{t=1}^{n} ({y_t-{\bar{y}}})^2 } \end{aligned}$$ (9)

where \(y_t\) is the real value of the solar production time series at hourly interval t of the evaluation period \(\hat{y_t}\) is the produced forecast of the model and \({\bar{y}}\) is the average of the real values. Apart from these error metrics two additional metrics are calculated in order to make the model evaluation more complete: the Mean Bias Error (MBE) and the normalized root mean squared error (NRMSE). The MBE represents the systematic error of a forecasting model to under or overforecast while the NRMSE is suitable for the comparison between models of different scales connecting the RMSE value with the observed range of the variable. These two metrics are calculated as follows:

$$\begin{aligned} MBE= & {} \frac{1}{n} \displaystyle \sum _{t=1}^{n} ( {y_t-\hat{y_t})} \end{aligned}$$ (10)

$$\begin{aligned} NRMSE= & {} \frac{RMSE}{{\bar{y}}} \end{aligned}$$ (11)

The model achieves high accuracy managing to efficiently capture the daily patterns of the most important variables as reflected by the utilized metrics (\(MAE = 0.467\) \(RMSE = 0.992\) \(MBE = -\0.097\) \(nRMSE = 0.301\) \(R^2 = 96.254\%\)). However even these five error metrics are not enough to sufficiently illustrate the capabilities of the proposed model in comparison with other models in different geographical locations. According to Yang et al.5758 the accuracy of solar forecasting models (in general the term “solar forecasting” may refer to either solar irradiance forecasting or solar power forecasting; throughout this study the term refers to solar power forecasting) must be inter-comparable across different locations and different time periods through a common metric which is the forecast skill index. The forecast skill index is based on the comparison of the proposed model to a reference model on a specific error metric. However two issues arise: What reference model and which error metric must be used? The most common reference model to standardize the verification of solar forecasting models is the persistence model. More specifically the utilization of a smart persistence model as a reference model is highly recommended rather that using the naive (or simple) persistence model59. Regarding the optimal error metric the RMSE is the most suitable metric in the case of solar power production as a metric that is appropriate for capturing large errors57. Thus the formula of the forecast skill index is the following:

$$\begin{aligned} skill = 1 - \frac{RMSE_{proposed}}{RMSE_{reference}} \end{aligned}$$ (12)

where \(RMSE_{proposed}\) is the RMSE value of the developed LSTM model and \(RMSE_{reference}\) is the RMSE value of the smart persistence model.

The last question that arises concerns the selection of the smart persistence model in the case of solar power forecasting. For solar irradiance forecasting problems the smart persistence model derives from integrating clear sky conditions to the reference model59. The same also applies to PV power forecasts where several smart persistence models have been proposed60. More specifically a clear sky index has been proposed by Engerer and Mills in case that the characteristics of the PV panel are known61 while another PV smart persistence model based on scaling global horizontal irradiance to PV production value has been presented by Huertas and Centeno62. In this study the definition of Pedro and Coimbra is adopted which is based on estimating the expected power output under clear-sky conditions63. The formula of the adopted smart persistence model is described by the following equation:

$$\begin{aligned} {\hat{y}}(t+\Delta t) = {\left\{ \begin{array}{ll} y_{c-s}(t+\Delta t) &{} if\ y_{c-s}(t) = 0 \\ y_{c-s}(t+\Delta t) \frac{y(t)}{y_{c-s}(t)} &{} otherwise \end{array}\right. } \end{aligned}$$ (13)

where y(t) is the measured power output and \(y_{c-s}(t)\) represents the expected power output under clear-sky conditions. The purpose of this model is to decompose power output indicating that a fraction of the power output relative to the clear-sky conditions remains the same between short time intervals. Moreover at night conditions the forecast of the smart persistence model is considered equal to the clear sky power output. The approximated function for the clear-sky model can be created by averaging past power output values depending on the hour of the day (between 0 and 23) and the day of the year (between 0 and 255). The second step involves creating the smooth surface that envelops the above-mentioned function63. The power output expected under clear sky conditions for the base PV (\(PV_1\)) as a function of the hour of the day and the day of the year for the baseline model is presented in Fig. 4.

Figure 4 The power output expected under clear sky conditions for the base PV as a function of the hour of the day (ranging between 0 and 23) and the day of the year (ranging between 0 and 255). Full size image

The smart persistence model performance is reflected by the following error metrics: \(MAE = 0.582\) \(RMSE = 1.274\) \(MBE = 0.029\) \(nRMSE = 0.387\) \(R^2 = 93.811\%\). Although the smart persistence model shows quite good performance in comparison with the naive persistence model (\(RMSE_{Naive} = 1.985\) \(MAE_{Naive} = 1.110\)) it is evident that the LSTM significantly outperforms the smart persistence model. This is also highlighted through the forecast skill index of the LSTM model which is equal to 0.221. A positive forecast skill index indicates that the proposed model outperforms the smart persistence model while a negative one shows that the smart persistence model performs better.

Finally Fig. 5 depicts the results of the forecasting models (LSTM baseline model and smart persistence model) for two different periods. It can be concluded that the model manages to capture seasonality trends and weather-related variations both in summer and winter periods and thus offer significantly better forecasts compared to the smart persistence model.

The horizontal axis indicates the hourly time-step of the evaluation period while the vertical axis shows the solar power production. The example refers to a randomly selected summer week (between hours 54 and 222 of the validation set corresponding to 04-08-2020 and 11-08-2020) and a randomly selected winter week (between hours 4060 and 4228 of the validation set corresponding to 18-01-2021 and 25-01-2021) of the evaluation period.

Transfer learning methods

The TL models are equipped with exactly the same characteristics as the baseline model using the baseline pre-trained model to solve exactly the same problem with the same features and the same expected output in a different PV plant. Therefore the features of the TL models are: (a) Power output measured value (b) air temperature (c) global horizontal irradiance (d) humidity (e) month of the year (one-hot encoding) and (f) hour of the day (sine/cosine transformation) and the model output is a one-hour ahead forecast of the PV power output.

The validation process of the proposed TL strategies is implemented in 6 PV plants with different nominal and peak capacity located in 4 cities in Portugal. Four architectures are compared including the presented TL strategies as well as a conventional model where no TL has been applied. For the TL models a pre-training is applied on the whole dataset of the base PV (30 months of data). Then the four models are trained using one year of data (8760 h) and they are tested in the rest of the dataset. For each PV plant the size of the test dataset is different depending on data availability as presented in Table 1. The models’ accuracy is evaluated based on their performance on the evaluation data using RMSE MBE MAE NRMSE and \(R^2\).

20 training repetitions are performed for each model in order to eradicate randomness. This number of repetitions is generally proposed in the literature. The forecasting performance for all models is presented in Table 2 where the average values of RMSE MBE MAE NRMSE and \(R^2\) are reported providing some very useful insights.

Firstly it is worth mentioning that all LSTM models perform better than the smart persistence model in terms of RMSE. This fact illustrates the suitability of the selected model and the selected features for this problem. The only case that the LSTM performs worse than the smart persistence model is for the conventional LSTM of \(PV_2\). Even in this case the three TL models have lower error indexes than the smart persistence one. The forecast skill index varies between \(-\0.15\) (it is negative in the case of \(PV_2\)) and 0.48 for the conventional model while it varies between 0.28 and 0.56 for the TL strategies. The average percentage increase of the forecasting skill index between the conventional and the TL models is \(16.3\%\). Finally the MBE index shows that none of the developed models shows any indication of bias.

Table 2 Average forecasting performance (accuracy) of the smart persistence model and the stacked LSTM models with and without TL. Full size table

Regarding the comparison between the conventional LSTM and the three TL models the impact of TL is evident as TL strategies have better accuracy than the conventional one for all six PVs . The boxplots presented in Fig. 6 also show that the conventional LSTM has greater RMSE average value in all target PV plants while it also demonstrates a bigger variance compared to the TL models. Indeed the models that are used without TL suffer from high variance offering considerably different accuracy in each repetition. On the contrary models trained with the three TL strategies show nearly zero variance while also achieving more accurate non-biased forecasts. A remarkable point is that for \(PV_3\) where the evaluation period is only 38 days (910 hourly point forecasts) the three TL models do not seem to outperform the conventional model in the extent that they do for the other PV plants. This is due to the fact that the evaluation takes place solely on March (winter period) where the problem is more complex as weather patterns are often disturbed while another sign illustrating the forecasting difficulty in \(PV_3\) is that neither the smart persistence model is able to make better forecasts.

Data availability impact

As mentioned in the introductory section one calendar year of data is the minimum time interval for a model to be sufficiently trained in order to incorporate all seasonal and weather patterns of the problem. Also the presented results indicate that TL models can perform better than conventional models considering a scenario where one year of training data is available while conventional models are still better than reference smart persistence ones. However the application of TL offers the possibility to obtain reliable and accurate predictive models even when the available training data for the target domain are less than one year. In this context the proposed architectures are compared on the target PVs for different training periods namely 3 months 6 months and 9 months of available data. It must be noted that although the training period has changed the testing period has been kept the same for comparison purposes between the different scenarios.

Figure 7 presents the RMSE index of the four models in the four aforementioned scenarios of different training periods. Results indicate that the TL models are more robust considering different volumes of training data and that their performance slightly improves when more data are available. This can be contributed to their anterior training on the base PV over 3 years of hourly data. On the other hand the impact of data scarcity is apparent for the conventional LSTM model which radically improves when the training period increases and identifies new seasonal and weather patters. It is worth mentioning that none of the 3-month trained conventional models outperforms the smart persistence model while only three 6-month trained conventional models manage to achieve better accuracy compared to the smart persistence one. The same does not apply for the 3-month trained TL models which have lower RMSE compared to both the conventional LSTM and the smart persistence model.

Finally the difference in terms of RMSE between the conventional model and the best-performing TL model decreases as more training data are becoming available. This is evident in all six target PVs. For example the difference in terms of RMSE in \(PV_5\) is limited from \(150.5\%\) (3-month training models) to \(15.1\%\) about 10 times lower. Same decrease patterns are also identified in the other five PVs further highlighting the importance of TL especially when less than one calendar year of data is available.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiX2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFya2Fuc2Fzb25saW5lLmNvbS9uZXdzLzIwMjIvYXVnLzI4L2Fya2Fuc2FzLWZhcm1lcnMtaGFydmVzdGluZy1zdW5saWdodC1mb3ItcG93ZXIv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Arkansas farmers harvesting sunlight for power | Arkansas Democrat Gazette,"



Bearskin Farms east of Little Rock is installing one of the largest solar projects on a farm in Arkansas in a bid to gain some control over the farm's energy costs at a time when solar energy may be more accessible than ever in agriculture.

Renewable energy -- a priority in the recently passed Inflation Reduction Act -- is growing in Arkansas' agriculture sector as more farmers turn to energy sources like solar to power everything from fans in a poultry house to grain drying bins and well pumps.

The act which was signed into law by President Joe Biden on August 16 is described as an effort to combat climate change evident scientists say in the numerous reports of severe and often unpredictable weather that U.S. farmers face.

Bearskin Farm owner Lambert Marshall is installing a 2-megawatt solar array composed of 4500 panels that will produce about 3.6 million kilowatt hours annually at his farm in Lonoke and Pulaski counties.

Cotton corn rice soybeans and wheat are grown on the farm and solar energy will be used for irrigation grain drying and storage of crops.

""Bearskin won't be completely reliant on solar energy; in more rural areas of the farm electric irrigation equipment is not viable"" Marshall said.

""We hope to continue to convert more of our irrigation equipment to electric to lessen our environmental impact.""

Farming is a capital-intensive business Marshall said. ""Our farm uses a lot of energy producing and drying our crops"" he said.

""We think solar with help stabilize and lower our energy costs over time. Bearskin's solar array will have the capability and size to help generate significant savings for the farm.""

Renewable energy accounted for only 10% of electricity generated in Arkansas last year according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration but solar power generation is growing in Arkansas and accounted for a tenth of the state's renewable electricity generation last year 18 times greater than in 2016.

The USDA announced on Wednesday $121 million in investments to combat climate change in socially vulnerable communities in 49 U.S. states with funding from the Inflation Reduction Act.

Arkansas recipients received nine Rural Energy for America Program (REAP) Renewable Energy and Energy Efficiency grants totaling $127721 to help pay for installation of solar panels or LED lighting.

North Little Rock-based company Seal Solar is installing the array at Bearskin Farm and also installs solar power systems for agriculture residential and other projects across the state.

""The main thing we're seeing is farmers business owners and everybody else is just wanting to have control"" Seal Solar's co-founder and president Heather Nelson said. ""Solar gives farmers the ability to now have control over their electricity costs. It allows them to budget better.

""It allows them to deliver a [return on investment] on something that was just a sunk cost in the past.""

Arkansas farmers who produce solar energy can use net metering to offset their electricity costs.

Act 464 of 2019 allows utility customers who generate their own solar energy and produce an excess to send the extra power to their utility for a credit on their bills. The law also raised the limit for commercial customers of electric utilities with solar projects from 300 kilowatts to 1000 kilowatts.

The state Public Service Commission which regulates utilities posted new net-metering rules for solar development on June 1 2020. The rules allow existing agreements between utilities and non-metering customers to remain or be grandfathered in for 20 years or until 2040.

Farmers may have multiple meters tied to wells grain bins houses shops or barns and net meter aggregation allows them to build one solar project and tie all their meters together Nelson said.

Farmers with net metering will get a one-to-one credit for the energy they produce and send to the utility's power grid which is applied to their monthly electricity bill Arkansas Advanced Energy Association Executive Director Lauren Waldrip said.

""We design the [solar power] project based on 12-month usage and then once it's constructed we submit a list of those meters to the utility in the order in which the client would like the energy produced off their solar to offset those accounts"" Nelson said.

""They will rank those and once a year they're allowed to go back to the utility and change that order.""

Retired row crop farmer Tom Jacobs from DeWitt was the first to adopt solar power on a farm in Arkansas.

""The way I looked at it when I put [solar panels] in was -- it was like I was buying my own generator and I was buying a piece of farm equipment"" Jacobs said. ""I was going to see what my payback on that equipment was. It's been about eight years and the net amount that I paid for it well I will have saved that much on energy costs"" he said.

Jacobs supplements his electricity with solar energy from 84 panels that generate roughly 25000 watts to power grain drying bins a farm shop and a tenant house.

""At the time that we put that in Entergy was asking for a rate increase ... and this was a way of locking in the rate because we were going to be grandfathered in"" Jacobs said.

""Since it was going to be swapped one-for-one every kilowatt I produced whether I used it on my farm or it went to my neighbor then I got credit for that when I needed it during drying season or at one of my other places"" Jacobs said adding this was supposed to cover 70% to 80% of the farm's usage.

Act 464 also allowed third-party financing of solar projects which was intended to help tax-exempt organizations and government entities that wouldn't otherwise qualify for federal tax incentives to put in solar panels.

It allowed those entities to utilize solar by allowing them to sign lease agreements with third parties that install solar power projects. The state Legislature also passed Act 507 in 2019 which allowed government entities to issue bonds for energy savings projects. School districts may also participate.

This act allowed energy performance contracts to extend past 20 years if the project is guaranteed to last that long and if the project's useful life is more than 20 years.

POULTRY FLOCKS TO SOLAR

When certain factors line up solar energy is highly beneficial for the energy-intensive poultry production industry Poultry Federation President Marvin Childers said.

Poultry growers can use solar to generate electricity to power poultry houses which use fans to meet cooling requirements for broiler chickens.

Approximately 20.5 million chickens are processed in Arkansas weekly and poultry accounts for 50% of Arkansas's agricultural cash receipts Childers said. To determine whether solar energy makes sense Childers said farmers should first determine what energy provider's territory their operation is based in whether it's Entergy an electricity cooperative or a municipality.

""We know there are some banks that are providing 100% financing and I think if all of those line up to me it's almost a no-brainer for poultry farmers"" Childers said. Waldrip recommended farmers also get multiple quotes from different developers. Farmers may have varying returns in terms of cost savings as well she said.

Nelson said solar energy will deliver a return on investment for Arkansas farmers.

""When we started doing this years ago the longest warranty [for solar energy] you ever saw was 25 [years] and now its 30 so the technology is getting better and the warranties are getting longer"" Nelson said.

Childers said it may take some time to see a return on investment for solar panel installation costs but as long as farmers generate enough energy for a farm's needs they will have lower energy costs.

Farmers can utilize land that might be low-yield in terms of crop production for solar panels to offset their utility costs Nelson said.

Some Arkansas landowners are also engaging with solar energy on larger scale by setting up power purchase agreements.

""Some farmers will sell that power not to a utility necessarily but maybe to Amazon; we know Amazon has a couple projects set up in eastern Arkansas"" Waldrip said.

""That's why aggregation is so important because it doesn't have to be in the same location.""

NEW CLIMATE LAW

Costs to install solar in the U.S. have dropped by more than 60% over the last ten years though supply chain and shipping issues related to the pandemic and trade instability led to some price increases according to the Solar Energy Industries Association.

The Inflation Reduction Act package increases an existing energy investment tax credit to 30% for solar projects to include projects installed this year through the end of 2032.

The tax credit is also extended to battery storage technology.

Standalone energy storage systems such as lithium batteries are eligible for the 30% tax credit Nelson said.

""This means if you install a battery-only system or if you add batteries to your solar [power] system in the future they will qualify for the 30% tax credit"" Nelson said.

""Storage capacity needs to be at least 5 kilowatt hours for commercial and 3 kilowatt hours for residential.""

There is also an additional 10% tax credit for selling electricity generated by community solar projects to low-income individuals.

There is an additional 10% tax credit for using domestically produced hardware for a project.

Solar projects established in former ""energy communities"" can also get an additional 10% tax credit.

""There are ways to get a 40% to 50% solar tax credit for commercial projects"" Nelson said. ""Such as using American-made components and locating the project in a low-income community or on a brownfield. Projects over [1 megawatt] must meet additional labor guidelines"" she said emphasizing the company recommends customers refer to tax professionals for verifying tax-related solar concerns.

Nelson said direct pay should also be an option for solar projects commissioned in 2023 for tax-exempt nonprofit and municipal customers.

""Direct pay means the federal government will reimburse a tax-exempt organization at least 30% of the total cost of the system"" Nelson said.

Rural Energy for America Program funding could also see a boost because of the Inflation Reduction Act Nelson said.

Waldrip said the Act is also expected to promote domestic manufacturing which could generate millions of jobs in the U.S.

""A lot of these projects are required to use domestically sourced inputs specifically steel"" she said.

""We know that here pretty soon Mississippi County in northeast Arkansas is going to be the largest steel-producing county in the nation. They will certainly benefit from this.""

The exoplanet called WASP-39b is a hot gas giant with a mass similar to Saturn’s orbiting a Sun-like star 700 light-years away.

Besides providing important insights into this planet’s composition and formation the discovery of carbon dioxide in its atmosphere also offers hope that the Webb telescope may be able to detect and measure carbon dioxide in the thinner atmosphere of smaller rocky planets.

WASP-39b was first discovered in 2011 by an international consortium called Wide Angle Search for Planets with the help of a network of robotic telescopes. Unlike the cooler more compact gas giants from our solar system this planet orbits very close to its star completing one circuit in a just over four Earth-days.

While scientists have already detected the presence of water vapor sodium and potassium in its atmosphere Webb telescope’s unmatched infrared sensitivity has now also confirmed the presence of carbon dioxide providing the first clear detailed evidence for carbon dioxide ever detected on an exoplanet.

“As soon as the data appeared on my screen the whopping carbon dioxide feature grabbed me” said Zafar Rustamkulov a graduate student at Johns Hopkins University and member of the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) Transiting Exoplanet Community Early Release Science team which conducted this investigation. “It was a special moment crossing an important threshold in exoplanet sciences.”

“Detecting such a clear signal of carbon dioxide on WASP-39b bodes well for the detection of atmospheres on smaller terrestrial-size planets” added team leader Natalie Batalha a professor of Astrophysics at the University of California Santa Cruz.

Understanding the composition of a planet’s atmosphere is crucial for clarifying the planet’s origins and evolution. “Carbon dioxide molecules are sensitive tracers of the story of planet formation” explained team member Mike Line an associate professor of Planetary Science at the Arizona State University.

“By measuring this carbon dioxide feature we can determine how much solid versus how much gaseous material was used to form this gas giant planet. In the coming decade JWST will make this measurement for a variety of planets providing insight into the details of how planets form and the uniqueness of our own solar system.”

A detailed description of the composition of WASP-39b’s atmosphere and of what can be inferred about this planet’s formation and evolution will be published soon in the journal Nature.

REUTERS/Nathan Frandino

California is about to launch an experiment to cover aqueducts with solar panels a plan that if scaled up might save billions of gallons of otherwise evaporated water while powering millions of homes.

Project Nexus in the Turlock Irrigation District launches in mid-October amid Western North America’s worst drought in 1200 years and as human-influenced climate change exacerbates the dry spell.

The $20 million project funded by the state is due to break ground in two locations. One is a 500-foot span along a curved portion of the canal in the town of Hickman about 100 miles inland from San Francisco. The other is a mile-long straightaway in nearby Ceres.

Based on a similar project in the west Indian state of Gujarat the project is the first of its kind in the United States said University of California Merced project scientist Brandi McKuin. The Turlock project was inspired by a research paper McKuin published in 2021.

Modern California was built thanks to 20th century infrastructure that delivers water from the wet north to the arid south a network McKuin said now totals 4000 miles of canals.

Covering those canals with solar panels would reduce evaporation avoid using other land for solar farms and reduce aquatic weed and algae growth saving on maintenance costs McKuin said.

“It’s really exciting to test our hypothesis and the paper we published. We’ll have an opportunity to really understand if those benefits pencil out in the real world” McKuin said.

It would also help California meet its renewable energy goal of achieving 50% clean energy generation by 2025 and 60% by 2030.

If all 4000 miles of canals were covered with solar panels it could produce 13 gigawatts of renewable capacity roughly half of what California needs to meet its carbon-free energy goals she said.

A gigawatt or 1 billion watts is enough to power 750000 homes.

McKuin’s research also calculated water savings of 63 billion gallons enough to supply 2 million people and irrigate 50000 acres of cropland.

Like other utilities throughout the state Turlock Irrigation District is required to expand its renewable energy capacity.

“If this is something that works on these first two miles of Project Nexus that we’re doing there’s the potential that this could scale to multiple locations” said Josh Weimer the district’s external affairs manager."

CLEVELAND — Chuck Kyle has grown used to these big games and he's also grown used to them going down to (or beyond) the final minutes.

In the opening game of the legendary head coach's 40th and final season Saint Ignatius got things going on the right foot with a 26-20 triple-overtime victory over Mentor at FirstEnergy Stadium in Cleveland. It was a rematch of last year's first-round playoff matchup and marked the Wildcats' second straight win in what has become one of Northeast Ohio's best high school football rivalries.

The hero of this game was junior running and defensive back Sean Martin who tallied 114 scrimmage yards and three total touchdowns while also adding an interception on defense. His first score a 19-yard grab on a screen pass from Josh Papesh gave Iggy (1-0) a 7-0 lead that would later extend to 14-0 when Papesh hit Jonathan Merimee from 42 yards out.

Mentor (1-1) cut the deficit to 14-7 at halftime and in the third quarter took advantage of a Papesh interception when Scotty Fox hit Henry Schenk for a four-yard TD to tie it up. Early in the fourth Fox threw another one to Jordan Stapleton from 20 yards away and the Cardinals clung to a 20-14 lead after the extra point went wide.

Fox and the Mentor offense had a chance to run out the clock late but with 3:28 to go Martin picked off a pass and gave the Wildcats good field position and would later finish the drive off with a 10-yard touchdown. The subsequent PAT try was blocked and though Ignatius would get the ball back with 22 seconds left Papesh's completed Hail Mary to Ryan Kennedy was two yards short of the end zone forcing overtime tied at 20.

Both teams traded turnovers fourth-down stops and missed field goals in the first two extra periods before Mentor faced a third-and-23 in the third forcing a bad throw by Fox that ended with another interception. On the Wildcats' first offensive play Martin scampered 20 yards to paydirt to end what might have been the 21st century iteration of the ""Marathon by the Lake.""

First let's talk electricity.

In an unprecedented move a few days ago NOPEC the area’s largest energy aggregator (bulk buyer) for communities announced it was moving 550000 customers back to FirstEnergy utilities.

Utility help:Check out Betty Lin-Fisher's guide

NOPEC or the Northeast Ohio Public Energy Council is a consortium with nearly 1 million gas and electricity customers in 242 communities including parts of Summit Portage Medina and Stark counties.

NOPEC has some communities that are both natural gas and electric — many Portage County communities and a few in Medina and Summit — but a large majority in Summit are gas-only communities. The village of Richfield and some northern Summit communities including Twinsburg and Sagamore Hills have NOPEC electricity.

To see if you're in NOPEC the easiest thing to do is to check its community map at www.nopec.org/communities/community-map or contact your local community.

NOPEC said it notified the Public Utilities Commission of Ohio of its intention to voluntarily return 550000 of its electricity customers who are on what’s called the Standard Program Price or its default price back to their local utility. In our area that would be Ohio Edison. Customers would get the utility default price often called the “price to compare.""

The reason is that while wholesale natural gas prices have been skyrocketing since last fall electricity prices didn’t do the same until recently Dave Jankowski chief marketing and communications officer for NOPEC told me during an interview. NOPEC’s default price which customers are automatically included on unless they had chosen the variable rate or longer-term fixed rate often changed monthly or every few months he said.

Why is advice different for electric rates and gas rates?

NOPEC's and other retailers' current electric rates are higher than the utility's ""price to compare"" because the utility's rate was determined largely in auctions conducted before April when energy prices were considerably lower NOPEC said.

This is where it is confusing for us because my advice for natural gas is to stay away from the utility’s default since it is based on current wholesale rates.

The advice now for electricity is to go with the utility’s default because the electricity default price is determined through several auctions held at different times that buy ahead and lock in a price. The current default price is largely based on pricing during auctions that happened before the run-up.

NOPEC’s current Standard Program Price would have been almost double Ohio Edison’s “price to compare” which is currently at 6.7 cents per kilowatt hour.

“As a consumer-focused non-profit NOPEC is always operating and advocating for what’s best for our communities and customers” Chuck Keiper NOPEC’s executive director said in a press release. “When we looked at the price forecasts it became increasingly apparent that the Price to Compare rate would be a better place for our customers to be through Winter 2023 to save significant money during these economically challenging times.”

Customers could make their own choice to come off the NOPEC rate but Keiper said the organization decided “it was in all our consumers’ best interest” to make the wholesale change and temporarily switch its customers.

Current NOPEC customers on the Standard Program Price do not need to do anything and will automatically be returned to their utility within one to two billing cycles depending on the billing date. There is no fee to leave the aggregation early.

NOPEC customers who are on the variable price which is 6% off the “price to compare” and customers who were on one of NOPEC’s 12- or 24-month contracts will remain though they can also choose to leave at no charge said Jankowski. Contract rates vary depending on when a customer locked in.

NOPEC is expecting electricity prices to stabilize by next spring and that its prices will be in line with the utility’s default pricing so the aggregation will send new opt-out enrollments at that time. That means customers in those communities will automatically be enrolled in the electric plan unless they opt out.

If you have questions NOPEC’s number is 855-667-3201.

What if I'm not in a NOPEC community?

If you're not in a NOPEC community you should still do a checkup to see if you're getting the best price possible for electricity. You can check your bill to see who your current supplier is or contact your local community to see if you are in an aggregation. Many communities in our area are on aggregation deals with Energy Harbor the former FirstEnergy Solutions. Those contract rates used to be a certain percentage off the utility’s “price to compare” but they are now all on fixed rates. If your community was locked in before this spring/summer run-up it’s possible you are on a better rate than the “price to compare” so you should stick with it or see if you can get into it.

Here are a few of the area Energy Harbor contracts: Akron and Barberton both are on a fixed rate of 4.97 cents/kWh through May 2025; Green is 4.91 cents/kWh through May 2024; and Tallmadge is 4.96 cents/kWh through May 2024. Summit County townships (with the exception of Sagamore Hills which is in the NOPEC aggregation) are in an Energy Harbor contract for 4.67 cents/kWh through May 2024.

You can call Energy Harbor to find out more: 888-254-6359. If your community is not with Energy Harbor call your local community or search online.

The bottom line is that if your community aggregation rate is below the current “price to compare” of 6.7 cents/kWh stick with your current contract. Similarly if you locked in to a fixed-rate contract on your own that beats the price to compare stay where you are.

I looked at the PUCO’s Apples to Apples chart www.energychoice.ohio.gov for electricity prices and there is one that is close to the utility “price to compare” but it is laced with monthly fees and hefty cancellation fees. Other rates are 8 cents/kWh and above so I would not lock in to a public fixed rate and I would go back to Ohio Edison as the default which just means you cancel your current contract if you have another provider listed on your bill.

OK so what about gas?

Natural gas prices have been all over the place since last summer. The prices have mostly been way up as the energy markets have reacted to typical gas and storage issues but had the added nervousness from world events.

Last fall I suggested readers find a low fixed rate — either on their own or through their community aggregation or bulk-buying group — and get off the Dominion Standard Choice Offer or SCO. The SCO is the monthly rate based on wholesale rates plus a state-approved formula. For years we enjoyed great prices on the SCO when prices were close to wholesale rates.

The SCO has been all over the map since last fall as low as $4.17 in January and $9.08 in June. It is $8.87/mcf as of Aug. 11 bills.

There isn’t a one-size-fits-all answer but my advice remains the same to try to find the best rate.

If you locked in to a good fixed rate in fall 2021 before the run-up in prices and you're still on that rate for a while you are in good shape. I was able to get an excellent $2.49/mcf rate with Ohio Electric & Gas for 11 months in October 2021 with a $50 cancellation fee. My rate is ending next month and my community aggregation rate is not one I want to join so a few days ago I locked in to the cheapest fixed rate with no cancellation fee on the PUCO's Apples to Apples chart or at www.energychoice.ohio.gov. That was Direct Energy with a $6.29/mcf rate with no cancellation fee for 32 months. You can call 877-698-7551 or go to www.directenergy.com for that rate. Rates can change quickly so if that’s not available find a decent rate with no cancellation fee. I probably won’t stay on that for 32 months but it’s a decent rate for now.

If you live or have a small business in the city of Akron the aggregation with Constellation Energy moved to its $4.06 fixed rate in May and that lasts through November 2024. That is a very good price given where we are now. Last fall I was not in favor of the Akron rate since it was going to mirror the higher SCO rates through the winter months when people use the most gas though I said the fixed rate was decent. Akron residents and small-business owners are allowed to opt in. Call Constellation at 833-500-2738. It will take one to two billing cycles to switch over.

If you are still on the SCO or a price that is based on the SCO see if your community has an aggregation rate that's better and see if you can get in. There are some communities that locked in prices that were only OK a few years ago but they locked in for several years and that price looks good now. (Stow's rate is $2.84/mcf fixed through 2024.) See if they will let you in; each has different rules. I would not be on the SCO now.

If you live in a NOPEC gas community which is a large portion of the Akron region NOPEC's default is called its program rate. That is currently at $7.80/mcf. Its variable is 3 cents below the SCO (too high) and its fixed rates are $8.65 for 12 months and $7.75 for 24 months. None of those prices are great so I would probably lock in to the $6.29/mcf Direct Energy rate and watch to see if NOPEC rates come down. There is no fee to leave NOPEC. Also NOPEC gas customers are not being returned to the utility; only the default electricity customers are.

The incident happened around 12:34 a.m. near 6th and Juneau. Police said the suspect's vehicle was heading northbound on North 6th Street when they hit the pedestrian.

Police said the victim was crossing the street in the crosswalk when the driver ran the red light and struck him police said.

The driver of the vehicle drove off without stopping to help the victim. Police said the vehicle was last seen speeding northbound on 6th north of McKinley.

The vehicle is described as a black 2021-2022 Dodge Ram 1500 TRX with amber lights in the hood scoop flashing amber lights on both side mirrors and possibly flashing headlights. The vehicle should have front-end damage police said in a statement.

Police released the following photos:

Family identified the victim as 23-year-old Xaiver Casanova Davis.

Xaiver's mother Gloria Shaw told TMJ4 News that her son wanted to be a photojournalist and that he was planning to start classes at MATC this winter.

""He had his whole life ahead of him and whoever it was just took it"" said Shaw.

Submitted 23-year-old Xavier Casanova was killed in a hit-and-run near Fiserv Forum.

Casanova was taken to Froedtert where he died from his injuries.

""Turn yourself in please. You killed my heart you took an amazing young man from his family you took an amazing person with the most giving heart with the kindest spirit and you took him from me. Please turn yourself in"" said Shaw.

Milwaukee police said the suspect vehicle was a black pickup truck with a lift on it.

""I hope that you know justice is served for her family and her son. He does not deserve that at all"" Danielle Eager said.

Eager didn't know Davis but took the news hard. She and her family were hit by a car at the same intersection in 2019.

The family was heading to a show at Fiserv Forum when a car ran into them and then took off. Eager said her son died but was revived. She was angry to hear it happened again.

""That mom I can only imagine what she was feeling and especially when someone is so careless. It's really heartbreaking for that family that they have to go through that"" Eager said.

Eager's family is still dealing with the physical and emotional impact nearly three years later.

""It's a struggle for our family. You know it's traumatizing"" Eager said. ""The guy who hit us only got three years and I think we need harsher punishments for people that do this.""

As investigators work to track down the person who hit Davis Eager encouraged people to spread the word.

""The more you share the more it gets out there and the more you're going to see it. This guy is gonna get caught eventually"" Eager said.

There have been 10 fatal hit and runs so far this year according to Milwaukee police. In 2021 there were 12. In 2020 MPD reported 16 fatal hit and runs and in 2019 there were nine.

Anyone with information on this incident is asked to contact Milwaukee police at 414-935-7360 or Crime Stoppers at 414-224-TIPS.

Police said the victim was in the crosswalk around 12:30 a.m. when the driver of a pickup ran a red light northbound on 6th Street and struck the man identified by his mother as Xaiver Casanova Davis. He died at the hospital.

The driver didn't stop leaving Xaiver for dead.

""He can never be replaced"" said Gloria Shaw Xaiver's mother. ""He was just to know Xaiver was to love him. To me he was perfect.""

Xaiver was Shaw's only son. He captured life's precious moments along with people's hearts.

""His camera is sitting here"" said Shaw. ""He was big on family. He was loved by everyone. If you met Xaiver he had a million-dollar smile.""

His young life was cut short early Sunday by the driver of a black pickup with a lift.

""You took my heartbeat away from me"" said Shaw. ""You broke my heart.""

Now Xaiver's mother can only picture the future he would have had. She said her son had plans to go to Milwaukee Area Technical College this winter.

""He enjoyed the photography and photojournalism"" said Shaw. ""He wanted to not only be in front of the camera but behind. He was excited about the journey that was going to start in January.""

She's now holding onto the memories her son was so careful to capture sharing a message for the driver who took her son's life.

""Please just turn yourself in because you took my pride and joy away from me before he even got to live"" said Shaw.

Xaiver had just gotten a tattoo – a sleeve of roses. Shaw said she plans to get a tattoo herself to pay tribute to him.

Shaw said Xaiver was also a big brother to siblings on his dad's side. He loved old music all types of pasta and especially spending time with his family.

If you want to skip our detailed analysis of the agriculture industry click 5 Biggest Agriculture Companies in the World.

Agriculture has evolved from basic farming practices into a highly diverse sector with enhanced soil preparation techniques crop nutrients for a healthier yield genetically modified soils and superior seeds for super-crops. These developments have propelled the agriculture industry into a highly commercial sector of the economy. According to the OECD the global demand for agricultural output will grow by 15% in the next 10 years and the agricultural producers worldwide will be able to keep up with the elevated demand with enhanced farming practices.

There are several macro uncertainties after the Russian invasion of Ukraine and this makes it impossible to predict the future outlook for any industry accurately. The strong connection between the fertilizer and energy markets can lead to spillover effects for agricultural suppliers around the world. Although countries are shifting from their suppliers of agricultural inputs from Russia and Ukraine to alternative sources this will lead to significantly higher prices for commodities. Russia and Ukraine are among the largest exporters of agricultural raw materials.

Industry analysts have warned about impending food shortages in the current macro backdrop as the skyrocketing prices for fertilizers and soil nutrients are unaffordable for most small-scale farmers who cannot keep their yields up. Brazil a major exporter of soybean and corn reported that farmers are using least quantities of fertilizer for their crops. The Brazilian government is trying to mine potash from protected indigenous lands in the country.

Similarly farmers in Kenya and Zimbabwe have shifted to manure as a source of crop nourishment amid the skyrocketing prices for plant health solutions. The U.S. Department of Agriculture has projected that fertilizer bills will increase by 12% in 2022 compared to the 17% surge in the previous year. Russia and Belarus accounted for 40% of potash exports worldwide and Russia and Ukraine combined contributed to 30% of global wheat exports and 20% of corn exports. These quantities cannot be realistically matched by alternate producers around the world even at higher prices. This is why a global food crisis is on the horizon according to market experts.

Here is what Tweedy Browne Company had to say about FMC Corporation (NYSE:FMC) in its Q3 2021 investor letter:

“FMC Corporation (NYSE:FMC) provides crop chemicals for the agriculture industry. Crop chemicals protect farmers’ fields from insects fungus and weeds which allows them to increase their crop yields. As a result farmers are more than willing to pay a price premium for effective products. Similar to pharmaceutical companies crop protection products also are often “patented” which gives them pricing power. In addition the development time and investment combined with navigating the regulatory process in a variety of jurisdictions and then achieving distribution at scale provide immense barriers to entry in the industry. Small companies may be able to conduct research on active ingredients but it will be difficult for them to “commercialize” them. Given all of this FMC Corporation (NYSE:FMC) has enjoyed a high return on capital and has been a very profitable business earning a 27% EBITDA margin and a 25% ROE including goodwill for the year 2020. FMC is diversified geographically and by crop which should serve to make it a less cyclical business. It also has in our view a very good new product pipeline and aims to grow its revenues at 5% to 7% annually through 2023 and its EBITDA at 7% to 9% annually through 2023. The company also has had some insider purchases recently from both its CEO and CFO…” (Click here to see the full text)

“CNH Industrial (55% 2.51%; 16% 0.65%) a leading farm equipment and commercial vehicle manufacturer globally was another top performer for the year. CNH reported strong results throughout the year beating our initial conservative expectations. The US agricultural cycle has been firmly in the company’s favor driven by commodity price strength healthy farm balance sheets advanced technology adoption and aging fleets feeding replacement demand. We believe we are past the mid-cycle but expect the strong upcycle to continue with the solid order books and strong visibility. On December 31 2021 CNHI completed the demerger of its on-highway business which includes its IVECO commercial vehicles and FPT powertrain businesses. This transaction creates a pure play off-highway company comprising the higher-multiple agricultural construction and specialty vehicle businesses.

F,Ford Motor Company,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiOWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lndzd3Mub3JnL2VuL2FydGljbGVzLzIwMjIvMDgvMjkvcHVhZy1hMjkuaHRtbNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Ford-Spain signals plant closure more attacks on auto workers in Valencia,"Last week Ford Spain announced it was refusing millions of euros in corporate bailout from the Spanish government citing a “revised outlook for Europe.” This signals Ford’s intention to increase attacks on workers and potentially close the Almussafes plant in Valencia reneging on its earlier commitments.

It is a devastating exposure of the treachery of Spain’s unions and Socialist Party (PSOE)-Podemos government which only weeks ago were celebrating Ford’s investment commitments as a great victory. In June Ford announced plans to produce electric vehicles (EVs) after the General Union of Workers (UGT) rammed through historic wage cuts on workers to ensure the plant “won” a fratricidal bidding contest against Ford’s Saarlouis plant in Germany.

On Wednesday Ford said it had withdrawn its request to access European Union (EU) bailout funds. Approved last year by the government with support from the neo-fascist Vox party the fund consists of €140 billion earmarked for corporations and banks overseen by Podemos and the trade unions. The bailout which exposed official claims there was no money to fight to stop COVID-19 is to be paid for by workers with pension and job cuts.

Automakers in Spain are set to receive €700 million ($694.8 million). Ford applied for the funds in May to invest in launching EVs in June 2025. Last month it received €106 million ($105.2 million).

The funds are premised on brutal attacks on jobs and wages. SEAT part of Volkswagen received €167 million and is working with the unions to slash 2100 of its 15000 jobs in Spain. Mercedes is to receive €159 million; last month the union rammed through de facto wage cuts by accepting 2.25 percent wage increases between 2023 and 2026 way below inflation levels of 10 percent.

D-Hub a consortium of tech companies and large Spanish firms of the Ibex 35 stock index will receive €105 million to “re-industralise” Barcelona’s Nissan plan. In August 2020 the unions signed off on closing Nissan’s three Barcelona factories cutting over 2500 jobs at these plants and another 20000 indirectly.

Ford’s withdrawal from the funds are significant. The company claims that if it accepted the funding it would have to start producing EVs by 2026. Given that it cannot abide by these timelines citing a “revised outlook for Europe” Ford claims that it is postponing its investment plans to produce EVs in 2030 but that this does not represent a cancellation.

Such statements cannot be taken at face value. The bailout funds were going to help the Almussafes plant adapt its facilities to making EVs. That Ford is refusing this free money for investments made through 2026 when the Mustang Mach-E will supposedly start production suggests that plant closure is a possibility.

Ford claims it will work with local authorities to identify other potential public funding as they move to an all-electric passenger vehicle fleet by 2030. This begs the question as to what will happen until 2030. In March Ford split operations into separate businesses Ford Blue and Ford Mobil E—the first focusing on internal combustion engines and the other on EVs.

Almussafes will then be a Ford Blue plant of combustion not Mobil E. Soon there will be only one car in production with a combustion engine. Ford Blue is being wound down throughout Europe. The rationale for withdrawing from the funds that the situation in Europe has changed begs the question: what is the change? Everything points to laying the grounds for massive new attacks in Valencia in addition to the closure of Saarlouis.

Job losses and further wage cuts are expected until 2026. According to Economia Digital there were 3000 jobs at risk with the new electric conversion even before Ford’s announcement of no new EV-production in 2025-2026. Mondeo and the Transit Connect van will reportedly stop being built for the US market next month. Both represent around 20 percent of the factory’s production. In addition between the end of 2023 and 2024 the production of the S-Max Galaxy and Transit Connect for the European market is to end. These three models account for another 20 percent of production.

In June Ford warned of “significant” global job cuts. In July Bloomberg reported that it is planning as many as 8000 layoffs this year targeting white-collar workers and jobs in its internal combustion engine business. This was followed by last week’s announcement that Ford plans to lay off 3000 workers in the US Canada and India effective September 1.

As the World Socialist Web Site warned last week these attacks are a prelude to a wider attack on jobs. Fighting to dominate the markets for EVs and other new technologies global auto giants are restructuring their operations slashing costs and looting even more from workers for profits.

It is also part of a broader international growth of the class struggle. The ruling class feeling itself under siege is stroking inflation in order to counteract growing protests and strikes among workers.

Workers at Valencia require a new strategy to defend jobs and salaries. They cannot rely on the PSOE-Podemos or the trade unions which seek to downplay Ford’s announcement.

The PSOE-Podemos’ Ministry of Industry indicated that “the withdrawal is due exclusively to a corporate decision that will redefine the calendar and scope of the investments to be made in Spain focused on a new electric vehicle platform and on the new business model that it will be associated” insisting that this withdrawal does not put in question Ford’s decision to invest in Valencia.

The General Union of Labor (UGT) the largest union in the Almussafes works council called for “calm” at the plant. It claimed investments “are not in question” and will preserve “thousands of jobs in very good conditions.” It added “What was really decisive and fundamental for assigning Ford's new electric platform was for us workers to reach an agreement with the management which would ensure a stable work environment ...”

The UGT's lies—calling on workers to work with management and the PSOE-Podemos government sacrifice their wages and working conditions for Ford profits to “save their plant” and do so against their brothers and sisters in Saarlouis—are in shambles. The UGT had a strategy for defeat.

In April the UGT and Ford-Spain signed a collective agreement imposing the most savage attack on workers in the Valencia plant’s 46-year history. Worked out between the unions and management it imposes a four-year wage freeze and staggering cuts to real wages from inflation. With the latest Consumer Price Index (CPI) figures at 9.8 percent this would mean real wage cuts of 20 percent or more by 2026.

Aware of mounting anger the UGT refused to submit the agreement to a referendum though 97 percent of the unionised workers are UGT members. Instead they opted to submit the deal to a sham vote last February. Without the text available workers were forced to vote via a union app. It was thus impossible to count the vote.

At the same time to preempt opposition to the sham vote the UGT attacked the WSWS. Conscious that the main opposition to their deal was among workers UGT posted a YouTube video attacking the WSWS and describing its articles as fake news. The UGT now stands exposed as the biggest producer of fake news at the plant.

The World Socialist Web Site urges workers in Valencia to contact the rank-and-file committee in Saarlouis and build the International Workers Alliance of Rank-and-File Committees (IWA-RFC) to organise the fightback against Ford and connect workers in a growing number of industries. Rank-and-file committees democratically controlled by workers are the only way forward to organize a fight against job cuts.

The black Ford Escort RS Turbo driven by the late mother of Prince Harry and Prince William from August 23 1985 to May 1 1988 was sold at Silverstone Auctions on August 27.

According to the auction site Diana would not allow anyone to drive her Ford Escort and instead opted to have her guards sit by her in the passenger seat.

Princess Diana's Ford Escort she owned in the 80s sells at auction for £650000

A small car used by Princess Diana was put up for auction today and sold for a huge six-figure salary nearly 25 years after her death.

The black Ford Escort RS Turbo was driven by the Princess in the 1980s and was sold this weekend at Britain's Silverstone racing circuit for £650000.

The motor was driven from August 23 1985 to May 1 1988 and is believed to be the only example of the model made in black.

The RS Turbo Series 1 was only made in white but was painted specifically black to provide Diana discretion whilst driving around.

The Princess was photographed with the RS Turbo Series 1 outside the boutique shops of Chelsea and the restaurants of Kensington.

Engineers at the Ford factory were tasked with modifying the vehicle and assisting in a ""stealth makeover"" which involved fitting a regular five-slat front grille a secondary rear-view mirror for the protection officer with a radio in the glove box with the cable still visible.

August 28 2022 | 5 min.

By Nick Hunter

BRAINERD Minn. – Flirting with the cutline late during the second round Friday Californian Jake Knapp’s ace-eagle finish propelled him into the weekend where he played his final 36 holes in 15-under to claim a two-stroke victory at the 2022 CRMC Championship at Cragun’s Legacy Courses.



“I’d be lying if I said [missing the cut] didn’t cross my mind when I got to 14 and 15 Friday” Knapp said after his win Sunday. “I was stagnant all day—I felt like I had been hitting it good but I just couldn’t get anything going.



“It’s pretty nuts to think that 38 or 39 nine holes later I’m standing here.”



Knapp entered the final round with a one-stroke lead and held off Fortinet Cup points leader Wil Bateman by firing a 6-under 64 to earn his first victory in three seasons.



“Being the first event in the states it’s nice that someone from the states is able to take it home” he said. “It’s definitely a special week.



“Anytime you’re playing with the lead you’re trying to make sure you don’t go backwards. I’d say I played conservatively aggressive today and I knew I was hitting it well so if there were holes that fit me I was taking it at the pin.”



Knapp builds on a strong season during which he’s notched a runner-up finish at the first event of the season in June at the Royal Beach Victoria Open. Prior to his missed cut at last week’s CentrePort Canada Rail Park Manitoba Open Knapp claimed a third-place finish at the Quebec Open earlier this month.



During the final round Sunday Knapp scattered a pair of birdies over his opening nine to turn in 22-under for the championship to share the lead with Bateman. Knapp rolled in his 10-footer for birdie at the 10th to recapture the outright lead.



Following a Bateman birdie to keep pace at the 12th Knapp countered by rolling in an 8-footer for birdie to take the lead for good at 24-under.



Nearly recording his second ace of the week at the 15th Knapp converted a short birdie chance and clinched the tournament with a tap-in birdie at the last to claim a two-stroke victory at 26-under 254.



“I just stayed really patient all day. I’m someone who likes to play really aggressive and I’m not afraid to but sometimes that gets me in trouble” Knapp said. “Out here I wanted to make sure I made it as easy and not stress myself out as much as possible.



“Today it was nice not having to do anything too crazy to win. The more shots you can build up before then the better. I was driving it really well and I knew if I kept driving it well I was going to have a ton of chances.”



During his four rounds this week Knapp carded an ace four eagles and three birdies on holes 16-18 shooting 13-under par during the stretch.



A former University of California-Los Angeles golfer Knapp’s best season as a professional came in 2019 when he finished first at PGA Tour Canada Q-School before collecting wins at the Canada Life Open and the GolfBC Championship amassing more than 120000 Canadian dollars.



The 28-year-old from Costa Mesa Calif. made 36 starts on the Korn Ferry Tour last season making 16 cuts and claiming one top-10 finish to earn over $76000.



With his win Sunday Knapp moves up seven spots in the Fortinet Cup standings heading to next week’s regular season finale at the site of his last win at the GolfBC Championship in Kelowna British Columbia trailing Bateman by 17 points



“After a few of the wins in 2019 it was definitely emotional” said Knapp whose father is from Wisconsin while his mother hails from Winnipeg. “We’re an emotional family and they do all the crying for me. They know how much work I’ve put into this so it’s nice when you see your son get something out of what he’s putting in.”



Carding six birdies during his first seven holes Sunday Bateman quickly played himself into contention after beginning the round four shots off the lead.



He earned a brief share of the lead with his birdie at the 12th but couldn’t keep pace with Knapp despite moving to 24-under with his birdie at the 16th.



The 28-year-old from Edmonton Alberta took a step back with a bogey at the 17th but would tap-in a birdie at the last to finish in second at 24-under 256 to maintain his No. 1 position in the Fortinet Cup standings.



“I played great this week. A little bit of pressure going out there Thursday after going back to No. 1 [in the standings] last week” Bateman said. ""I thought I handled it really well.



“Out of the gates today just got it firing. Today I wanted to get off to a better start. I’ve been playing well for a really long time and I think it’s helping me get more comfortable. It’s been nice to really turn it on this year.”



A final-round 66 lifted former University of Minnesota golfer Justin Doeden five spots on the leaderboard to a 37th-place finish at 12-under 268. Fellow Gopher Angus Flanagan posted back-to-back rounds of 66 to begin the championship before founds of 69-68 put him into a tie for 44th at 11-under 269.



Former California Polytechnic State University golfer and son of CRMC Championship honorary chairman Tom Lehman Thomas Lehman placed 65th at 1-over 281.

(Published 2022),"It is let’s say 8:43 p.m. on a Saturday. You are watching a college football game that is taking place at this hour despite being played in the Midwest in November and the people in the stadium which is not entirely full look very cold and a little put off. The season schedule said kickoff was at 8 p.m. but it didn’t actually take place until 8:18. In the 25 minutes that have elapsed play has been interrupted for three commercial breaks. Each advertisement shown during these breaks has been for pickup trucks.

The announcers have just begun a discussion of your team’s head coach and his alleged inability to win “big games” which is indistinguishable from identical discussions held by other announcers in each of the team’s nine previous contests.

You will continue watching this broadcast until it ends at 11:47.

Why? Because you are a college football aficionado and the bond between you and the team you support is an idiosyncratic one that is hard to extinguish.

In an era in which television ratings are in decline the aggregate live-audience demand to which you contribute — some teams can bring in more than three million viewers every week on average — is valuable for the multinational corporation broadcasting the game. This demand lasts through the season which begins for most teams this weekend and runs through if you are lucky January of next year. It is not necessarily affected by the quality and care with which the broadcast has been produced.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiY2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmlucXVpcmVyLmNvbS9idXNpbmVzcy9jb21jYXN0LXBsYXlmbHktc3BvcnRzLWFkdmVydGlzaW5nLXBoaWxseS1zY2hyZWliZXItMjAyMjA4MjguaHRtbNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Comcast's Michael Schreiber is building a sports-advertising beast on the Main Line.,"The two-story atrium with basketball court on the ground floor and workstations around the upper floor at the headquarters of Playfly Sports in a renovated former roller rink and theater in downtown Berwyn. Read more

Michael Schreiber calls his start-up firm the biggest sports network that “you’ve never heard of and that’s OK.”

Almost two years ago the former Comcast Corp. executive launched the sports-ad firm Playfly Sports LLC in Chester County that now reaches 83% of U.S. sports fans pulsing 230 billion advertising impressions a year through 8500 professional and college televised games streaming platforms digital banners radio shows and newsletters.

It’s one half of a two-company mini-boom of sports-tech firms in Berwyn with connections to Comcast. Playfly’s offices are in a former roller rink on the outbound side of SEPTA’s Paoli/Thorndale line. Epoxy.ai also a start-up founded by former Comcast executives leases offices on the line’s inbound tracks within rock-throwing distance of PlayFly. Epoxy.ai personalizes sports bets through mobile phones.

Monetizing sports fan engagement is what it’s all about here: Playfly through advertising and Epoxy.ai through betting. And the former Comcast executives know all about economics of big-money sports the persistence of sports-TV ratings and squeezing value out of sports-media rights.

“It was hard to work in the programming side of Comcast without being involved in sports” said Chris Reynolds an Epoxy.ai cofounder who knew and worked with Schreiber at the Philadelphia company.

Mining advertising revenue regionally

Schreiber’s idea has been to create a sports platform for national brands such as TD Ameritrade or BMW to reach regional sports fans without those brands calling around to local sports teams. An alcoholic beverage company for instance could advertise hard-seltzer drinks in New York and low-calorie beers in Los Angeles “with one invoice” Schreiber said.

The sports advertising market is huge and diffuse. About 800 brands collectively spent $6.2 billion on advertising during NFL telecasts during the 2020-21 season according to one ad-research firm and reported by the Sports Business Journal. The NFL is just one league and most of the advertising is national. Playfly mines the sports advertising on the regional level.

Andrey Mikhailitchenko business professor at California State University in Sacramento said sports fans are five times more likely to recall brands advertised during college or professional games than they are to recall brand advertised during movies or general entertainment.

To sprint quickly out of the blocks Playfly has acquired seven companies supporting Schreiber’s vision for more than $100 million giving it access to a technology platform and advertising inventory for professional baseball basketball and hockey games that it can sell to national advertisers. The most significant of the deals were three former Fox Corp. companies: Home Team Sports Impression Sports and FOX Sports College Properties. Other acquisitions allow Playfly to sell sponsorships to colleges and sell naming rights to arenas.

Schreiber declined to provide revenue for the private company but said it was profitable. In addition to Schreiber Sinclair Broadcast Group and Baltimore investment firm Access Holdings have invested into Playfly.

Sports fans are five times more likely to recall brands advertised during college or professional games than during movies or general entertainment. Andrey Mikhailitchenko California State University

The firm employs 50 staffers in Berwyn. On its website Playfly has posted job openings in Berwyn or Philadelphia. Playfly employs 350 in other parts of the country with posted openings in New York; El Segundo Calif.; Atlanta; Chicago; and Detroit. In addition Playfly hires about 300 contractors.

In July the Orlando Sentinel reported that Playfly entered a 13-year deal with the University of Central Florida agreeing to pay the institution $125 million for its media rights.

“Playfly is betting that they will make more than $125 million to pay off Central Florida” for those rights said Kirk Wakefield a professor of retail marketing and expert on sports advertising at Baylor University in Texas.

Playfly and UCF confirmed in news releases that they reached a deal. They did not disclose the financial terms.

In college sports Playfly is taking on heavyweight Learfield owned by the investment fund Atairos Group Inc. Wakefield said. Atairos also has links to Comcast — deep ones. Former Comcast chief financial officer Michael Angelakis controls Atairos based in Bryn Mawr and about nine miles from Playfly’s offices. Comcast agreed to finance Atairos with $4 billion.

Sports advertising used to be about a mass audience. But Wakefield said that brands now want to know that their advertising has “changed the minds and behaviors” of consumers he said. “The organization that can go in with that kind of data will win the day.”

For some fans sports games and arenas already feel saturated with advertising.

“Saturation can take place if you are overloading [teams] with easy money” said Mikhailitchenko the professor in Sacramento pointing to professional hockey jerseys in Europe patched over with multiple brand logos.

But he also believes that there is an “endless market” for marketing on sports because advertisers can segment the audience targeting fan groups by demographics lifestyle geography or behavior.

The close proximity of the Playfly and Epoxy.ai offices is not a coincidence. Towns in the western suburbs are Comcast bedroom communities accessed by Regional Rail which also carries reverse commuters from Philadelphia to Berwyn.

Epoxy.ai “had a great team that lived primarily in Center City and they had to be OK with a reverse commute” Reynolds said. “And there is nothing more manageable than getting off the train and walking to your office.”

Reynolds also said it was great to see spin-offs and start-ups cluster in the region similar though on a smaller scale to Silicon Valley or other innovation hubs.

Passionate fans as advertising targets

Schreiber 46 a Baltimore native who worked at NBCUniversal relocated to the Philadelphia area when Comcast bought NBCUniversal in 2011.

“The goal was to take everything on the television in your living room and make it available on digital platforms such as the iPhone” Schreiber said of his first Comcast project.

Negotiating content deals for Comcast Schreiber said he realized that big advertisers could reach a general sports audience on ESPN and other national networks. But they couldn’t easily reach local sports fans who are most passionate and prized eyeballs for advertisers.

In 2016 Schreiber left Comcast for a new post as chief content officer at Altice USA a cable TV and broadband provider in New York. He didn’t want to relocate his family in Paoli so he commuted to the Altice offices by train.

Schreiber quit Altice in June 2020 and several months later he launched Playfly and began looking for a local headquarters. “I did not want to be in a strip plaza somewhere” Schreiber said.

He was charmed by the Berywn Theatre which opened in 1913 and brought Broadway plays to the suburbs. Later uses included a roller rink and then law offices.

After $2 million in renovations Schreiber opened the Playfly offices in the building in May. An indoor basketball court was put in the excavated basement and employee desks ring the court above like a press box. Outdoor turf was laid on that main floor emulating a football field. Professional and college team banners cover walls. There are a gym and areas to hang out.

Before the interview Schreiber tossed a basketball. “Take a foul shot. You have to make one before every meeting.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZveGJ1c2luZXNzLmNvbS9tYXJrZXRzL2ZlZGV4LWN1dHMtdGllcy1ncm91bmQtZGVsaXZlcnktY29udHJhY3Rvci1maWxlcy1zdWl00gFdaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZm94YnVzaW5lc3MuY29tL21hcmtldHMvZmVkZXgtY3V0cy10aWVzLWdyb3VuZC1kZWxpdmVyeS1jb250cmFjdG9yLWZpbGVzLXN1aXQuYW1w?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,FedEx cuts ties with ground delivery contractor files suit,"FedEx Corp has severed its relationship with one of its largest delivery contractors effective immediately.

The package delivery company filed suit asking a federal judge to stop the contractor from spreading misinformation about its business for financial gain.

Spencer Patton has 225 FedEx Ground routes in 10 states as well as businesses that offer services to the roughly 6000 U.S. contractors that transport and deliver packages for that unit.

Patton for weeks has said that up to 35% of FedEx Ground delivery providers are at risk of financial failure. He urged its leaders to improve compensation and has been rallying ""peers to his cause.""

FEDEX GROUND CONTRACTORS DEMAND INFLATION HELP TO PREVENT DELIVERY COLLAPSE: ‘ENORMOUS FINANCIAL STRESS’

""Really what I've been advocating and really making the public aware of is that we're in enormous financial distress"" Patton Route Consultant founder and president told FOX Business’ Dagen McDowell on "" Mornings with Maria "" in an interview earlier this month.

""We've seen our fuel prices double in a year. We've seen our wage rates up our vehicle costs up"" Patton said at the time. ""And I'm sounding the alarm that the risk of network interruption in FedEx Ground is as high as I've ever seen it.

FedEx's lawsuit seeks injunctive relief and monetary damages from a ""coordinated and multi-faceted campaign orchestrated"" by Patton.

FEDEX CUTTING OUT DELIVERIES IN SOME MARKETS ON SUNDAYS

Without talking about the case Patton went public with the termination of his relationship with FedEx saying the company's ""move to cancel our contracts is a clear case of (it) silencing anyone with a voice.""

FedEx said the affected routes account for less than 0.5% of Ground's 60000 routes and that contingency plans are in place.

In its lawsuit FedEx alleged that Patton is disparaging its Ground business through a series of false and misleading statements about its commercial activities.

In the lawsuit FedEx alleged that unfavorable news coverage stemming from Patton's campaign could harm Ground's reputation with the shippers that pay it to deliver packages and erode goodwill within the contractor network.

FedEx alleged that Patton's actions are a promotional campaign for his company that offers consultancy brokerage and other services to delivery providers.

Lockhart is known as the BBQ capital of Texas and soon it may be known for something else too.

Micron is one of the largest semiconductor companies in the world with products used in cars computers phones and more.

The company has filed applications through the State's Comptroller's Office for tax breaks in Lockhart with plans to develop an eight phased semiconductor manufacturing facility called 'Project Evergreen.'

Micron's investment would total at least $80 billion and at least 80 jobs.

""This town is growing not too fast like Kyle or Buda but it’s still growing you know so I think that would be okay to bring something like that to here"" Lockhart visitor Marco Duque said.

Locals said they encourage the growth.

Lockhart Texas

""It would be a great thing for Lockhart I think it would be a good thing for the company. I’m all for it"" Lockhart resident Terence Gahan said.

It's not a done deal yet. Several locations are being considered.

The Micron application states receiving the tax break is crucial for the expansion to happen in Lockhart. It's filed under Chapter 313 which allows public school districts to offer tax incentives for businesses that invest in their communities. Several other high-tech companies have used it in the past including Samsung and Tesla.

Gahan said if the company does come to town he hopes the community will embrace the growth.

(Published 2022),"It is let’s say 8:43 p.m. on a Saturday. You are watching a college football game that is taking place at this hour despite being played in the Midwest in November and the people in the stadium which is not entirely full look very cold and a little put off. The season schedule said kickoff was at 8 p.m. but it didn’t actually take place until 8:18. In the 25 minutes that have elapsed play has been interrupted for three commercial breaks. Each advertisement shown during these breaks has been for pickup trucks.

The announcers have just begun a discussion of your team’s head coach and his alleged inability to win “big games” which is indistinguishable from identical discussions held by other announcers in each of the team’s nine previous contests.

You will continue watching this broadcast until it ends at 11:47.

Why? Because you are a college football aficionado and the bond between you and the team you support is an idiosyncratic one that is hard to extinguish.

In an era in which television ratings are in decline the aggregate live-audience demand to which you contribute — some teams can bring in more than three million viewers every week on average — is valuable for the multinational corporation broadcasting the game. This demand lasts through the season which begins for most teams this weekend and runs through if you are lucky January of next year.

Read more

Michael Schreiber calls his start-up firm the biggest sports network that “you’ve never heard of and that’s OK.”

Almost two years ago the former Comcast Corp. executive launched the sports-ad firm Playfly Sports LLC in Chester County that now reaches 83% of U.S. sports fans pulsing 230 billion advertising impressions a year through 8500 professional and college televised games streaming platforms digital banners radio shows and newsletters.

It’s one half of a two-company mini-boom of sports-tech firms in Berwyn with connections to Comcast. Playfly’s offices are in a former roller rink on the outbound side of SEPTA’s Paoli/Thorndale line. Epoxy.ai also a start-up founded by former Comcast executives leases offices on the line’s inbound tracks within rock-throwing distance of PlayFly. Epoxy.ai personalizes sports bets through mobile phones.

Monetizing sports fan engagement is what it’s all about here: Playfly through advertising and Epoxy.ai through betting. And the former Comcast executives know all about economics of big-money sports the persistence of sports-TV ratings and squeezing value out of sports-media rights.

“It was hard to work in the programming side of Comcast without being involved in sports” said Chris Reynolds an Epoxy.ai cofounder who knew and worked with Schreiber at the Philadelphia company.

Mining advertising revenue regionally

Schreiber’s idea has been to create a sports platform for national brands such as TD Ameritrade or BMW to reach regional sports fans without those brands calling around to local sports teams. An alcoholic beverage company for instance could advertise hard-seltzer drinks in New York and low-calorie beers in Los Angeles “with one invoice” Schreiber said.

The sports advertising market is huge and diffuse. About 800 brands collectively spent $6.2 billion on advertising during NFL telecasts during the 2020-21 season according to one ad-research firm and reported by the Sports Business Journal. The NFL is just one league and most of the advertising is national. Playfly mines the sports advertising on the regional level.

Andrey Mikhailitchenko business professor at California State University in Sacramento said sports fans are five times more likely to recall brands advertised during college or professional games than they are to recall brand advertised during movies or general entertainment.

To sprint quickly out of the blocks Playfly has acquired seven companies supporting Schreiber’s vision for more than $100 million giving it access to a technology platform and advertising inventory for professional baseball basketball and hockey games that it can sell to national advertisers. The most significant of the deals were three former Fox Corp. companies: Home Team Sports Impression Sports and FOX Sports College Properties. Other acquisitions allow Playfly to sell sponsorships to colleges and sell naming rights to arenas.

Schreiber declined to provide revenue for the private company but said it was profitable. In addition to Schreiber Sinclair Broadcast Group and Baltimore investment firm Access Holdings have invested into Playfly.

Sports fans are five times more likely to recall brands advertised during college or professional games than during movies or general entertainment. Andrey Mikhailitchenko California State University

The firm employs 50 staffers in Berwyn. On its website Playfly has posted job openings in Berwyn or Philadelphia. Playfly employs 350 in other parts of the country with posted openings in New York; El Segundo Calif.; Atlanta; Chicago; and Detroit. In addition Playfly hires about 300 contractors.

In July the Orlando Sentinel reported that Playfly entered a 13-year deal with the University of Central Florida agreeing to pay the institution $125 million for its media rights.

“Playfly is betting that they will make more than $125 million to pay off Central Florida” for those rights said Kirk Wakefield a professor of retail marketing and expert on sports advertising at Baylor University in Texas.

Playfly and UCF confirmed in news releases that they reached a deal. They did not disclose the financial terms.

In college sports Playfly is taking on heavyweight Learfield owned by the investment fund Atairos Group Inc. Wakefield said. Atairos also has links to Comcast — deep ones. Former Comcast chief financial officer Michael Angelakis controls Atairos based in Bryn Mawr and about nine miles from Playfly’s offices. Comcast agreed to finance Atairos with $4 billion.

Sports advertising used to be about a mass audience. But Wakefield said that brands now want to know that their advertising has “changed the minds and behaviors” of consumers he said. “The organization that can go in with that kind of data will win the day.”

For some fans sports games and arenas already feel saturated with advertising.

“Saturation can take place if you are overloading [teams] with easy money” said Mikhailitchenko the professor in Sacramento pointing to professional hockey jerseys in Europe patched over with multiple brand logos.

But he also believes that there is an “endless market” for marketing on sports because advertisers can segment the audience targeting fan groups by demographics lifestyle geography or behavior.

The close proximity of the Playfly and Epoxy.ai offices is not a coincidence. Towns in the western suburbs are Comcast bedroom communities accessed by Regional Rail which also carries reverse commuters from Philadelphia to Berwyn.

Epoxy.ai “had a great team that lived primarily in Center City and they had to be OK with a reverse commute” Reynolds said. “And there is nothing more manageable than getting off the train and walking to your office.”

Reynolds also said it was great to see spin-offs and start-ups cluster in the region similar though on a smaller scale to Silicon Valley or other innovation hubs.

Passionate fans as advertising targets

Schreiber 46 a Baltimore native who worked at NBCUniversal relocated to the Philadelphia area when Comcast bought NBCUniversal in 2011.

“The goal was to take everything on the television in your living room and make it available on digital platforms such as the iPhone” Schreiber said of his first Comcast project.

Negotiating content deals for Comcast Schreiber said he realized that big advertisers could reach a general sports audience on ESPN and other national networks. But they couldn’t easily reach local sports fans who are most passionate and prized eyeballs for advertisers.

In 2016 Schreiber left Comcast for a new post as chief content officer at Altice USA a cable TV and broadband provider in New York. He didn’t want to relocate his family in Paoli so he commuted to the Altice offices by train.

Schreiber quit Altice in June 2020 and several months later he launched Playfly and began looking for a local headquarters. “I did not want to be in a strip plaza somewhere” Schreiber said.

He was charmed by the Berywn Theatre which opened in 1913 and brought Broadway plays to the suburbs. Later uses included a roller rink and then law offices.

After $2 million in renovations Schreiber opened the Playfly offices in the building in May. An indoor basketball court was put in the excavated basement and employee desks ring the court above like a press box. Outdoor turf was laid on that main floor emulating a football field. Professional and college team banners cover walls. There are a gym and areas to hang out.

Before the interview Schreiber tossed a basketball. “Take a foul shot. You have to make one before every meeting.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZveGJ1c2luZXNzLmNvbS9tYXJrZXRzL2ZlZGV4LWN1dHMtdGllcy1ncm91bmQtZGVsaXZlcnktY29udHJhY3Rvci1maWxlcy1zdWl00gFdaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZm94YnVzaW5lc3MuY29tL21hcmtldHMvZmVkZXgtY3V0cy10aWVzLWdyb3VuZC1kZWxpdmVyeS1jb250cmFjdG9yLWZpbGVzLXN1aXQuYW1w?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,FedEx cuts ties with ground delivery contractor files suit,"FedEx Corp has severed its relationship with one of its largest delivery contractors effective immediately.

Learn more ›

While many activity trackers strive for sleek discreet designs Garmin created the Instinct 2 Solar for those who like classic outdoor watch styling without sacrificing advanced features. Despite its rugged rather old-school body and display the second iteration of this Garmin solar watch is a robust smartwatch with highly accurate GPS wrist-based heart rate monitoring and integrated solar charging. While there haven’t been many changes on the exterior the watch’s software has some updates that many will appreciate mostly related to activity tracking. The Garmin Instinct 2 Solar promises to give you more accurate training information and keep you from charging as often and in most respects it delivers.

The Garmin Instinct 2 Solar’s design

As already mentioned the Garmin Instinct 2 Solar doesn’t look very different from the original Instinct Solar. The case is made of the same fiber-reinforced polymer the display is still Garmin’s transflective memory-in-pixel (MIP) display and both versions are topped with Corning Gorilla Glass for durability. The Power Glass tech allows the watch to charge by absorbing sunlight through both visible side panels and an invisible layer atop the display. The bezel has been ever so slightly redesigned though it’s like a spot-the-difference game to see what changed since it’s so subtle.

The smaller 40mm size option is a nice choice for those with small wrists and hands. Abby Ferguson

The Instinct 2 Solar comes in the original 45mm 53g case options and a new smaller 40mm 43g size (technically designated the 2S). The latter—in the color “Neo Tropic”—is the watch I have been eating sleeping and breathing in for the past month or so. Despite my child-sized wrists it fits well and thanks to the 13.3 mm thickness it doesn’t look clunky like other sports watches I’ve used. The band that comes with the smaller size is quite short however. So while it fits me (just barely) many will likely need to purchase a separate longer band.

Though I could loosen the watch some I’ve almost maxed out the tiny band on the 2S even with my small wrists. Abby Ferguson

It is a rugged watch intended to be put through the wringer. It’s water-rated to 100 meters so it can stand up to some deep free-dives making a bit of sweat and rain a piece of cake. And it’s thermal and shock resistant so if you climb with it on and take some hard falls it should easily survive. I wore mine to the gym knocking it on a fair share of weight racks and bushwhacked through some dense forest and it still looks brand new without so much as a scratch anywhere.

The display is a slightly higher resolution than the original Instinct Solar (156 x 156 pixels for the 2S vs. 128 x 128 pixels for the original) but as mentioned it is still the same old-school monochrome look. This basic display contributes significantly to the Instinct’s 21-day battery life even when in smartwatch mode. It isn’t very fancy to look at however.

The watch has a pretty large bezel which eats up quite a bit of screen real estate. So while it collects tons of data and shows you graphs of certain things such as sleep quality I have found it a bit difficult to read and assess the graphs on the watch itself because of the small monochrome screen. If I really want to see the information it’s a much better experience to pull it up in the Garmin app instead.

Setting up the Garmin Instinct 2 Solar

Garmin makes the setup process for any of its watches incredibly easy especially if you already have a Garmin watch and account. The watch comes with a partial charge right out of the box so you can get to set up right after opening it. You will need to download the Garmin Connect app (available for iPhone and Android) but the watch guides you through the process step-by-step and makes it very easy to pair with your phone/app using a Bluetooth connection.

I was already a Garmin user so the setup took only a few minutes on my Samsung Galaxy S10. But even if you are starting from scratch it shouldn’t take much longer. Of course if you want to take the time to customize things like notifications tones and watch faces right out the gate you could spend quite a while in both Garmin Connect (the watch’s settings/metrics hub) and Garmin Connect IQ (the watch’s app or “widget” store which did not work with the original Instinct). When in Connect you’ll see steps that still need to be completed for full setup by tapping on the watch at the top. However some such as connecting to Garmin Pay can wait or not be done at all depending on what you want to use.

The Garmin Instinct 2 Solar’s features

The Instinct 2 Solar is a comparatively simple smartwatch despite costing $450 lacking some of the fancier features of higher-end Garmin offerings like the multisport fēnix 7 Sapphire Solar and premium running Forerunner 955. Those watches offer color touchscreens more advanced training suggestions and more detailed navigation maps. But the Instinct 2 Solar is still plenty feature-rich and provides loads of insights and data.

Battery life

I would be remiss if I didn’t start out with the feature advertised in the name since “Solar” is one of the main selling points of this watch. Because of the basic display and the solar charging it can last a seriously long time though that seems to be with some caveats.

You can track how much solar life your watch is taking advantage of (and how much sun you’re soaking up too) in the Solar Intensity Glance. Abby Ferguson

According to Garmin the Instinct 2 models improve slightly on the original and the 40mm Instinct 2S can last 21 days in smartwatch mode/51 days with solar and has potentially unlimited battery life when in battery saver mode (more in the standard-sized model). However I have not been able to get that kind of battery life out of it partially because it assumes the watch gets 3 hours of 50000 lux sunlight conditions a day and partially because that number is based on general wear with no or at least limited activity tracking. With a GPS-enabled activity nearly every day and sometimes more than one I have to charge it about once a week (running GPS nonstop battery life is rated at 22 hours/28 with solar). Admittedly I’m also not spending much time in the most intense sun right now thanks to the summer heat so I’ve not been able to take full advantage of the solar functionality—though I plan to gauge the battery life claims more as I evaluate other sports watches so this section will be updated. Even without taking full advantage of solar however it still lasts longer than my much-loved Forerunner 745 and some time on the window sill or a sunbaked rock will keep it running for a day or two in a pinch.

You can change how often and what sensors pull from the battery so you can customize it to get more battery life. And when the battery is running low the watch prompts you to switch it to battery saver mode which gives you a very pared-down display with no smartwatch functionality. And when you need to plug it in for a charge with the provided proprietary multi-pin USB cable (though no wall adapter) it bounces back quickly. I was able to fully charge the battery from 0% to 100% in about three-and-a-half hours so it’s quick to top off the battery when you need to.

Activity tracker

If you’re buying a Garmin watch it’s almost certainly for its acumen as a fitness tracker. The Instinct 2 Solar offers activity modes for just about every type of exercise workout and sport you could imagine from treadmill and trail running and cycling (road eBike indoors mountain etc.) to climbing swimming and even breathwork and multi-day expeditions. HIIT timers are in the newer model as well. Some you will need to add to the watch but doing so hardly takes any time at all and can be done on the watch itself or the app.

Garmin also makes a few different editions of this watch which have unique hyper-specific modes. For example the Surf Edition has specific tracking for surfing kitesurfing and windsurfing along with tide data that you can’t access on the Standard Edition. There’s also a Tactical Edition with Jumpmaster activity waypoint projection dual-position GPS format preloaded tactical activity and a stealth mode. Of course the Standard Edition has just about everything other than some of those specialized activities so for most it will be the one to get.

No matter what type of activity you do it is straightforward to track it. Different activities offer specific information on the watch face though all of that is customizable so you can choose what information is most important to see while tracking. For example I like to have my heart rate and distance prominently displayed when on runs while things like cadence and lap time aren’t important to me.

You can also choose to silence tones and notifications during workouts. For example if I’m out for a run I don’t want to be notified that someone liked my Instagram post so I can easily choose to block those during that activity.

On suggested runs the data displayed varies from normal runs. It shows you if your pace is falling within the recommended range. Abby Ferguson

The watch can also give you suggested running workouts to help improve your fitness. When you click to start a run a screen will pop up with “Today’s Suggestion” that provides a brief summary of the run and its training effect. It’s a nice way to mix up your workouts without paying for a coach or doing your own extensive research.

Data collection and insights

The watch obviously collects quite a lot of data while recording activities relying on the plethora of sensors built into it. It connects with three Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS)—GPS GLONASS and Galileo—for better accuracy has the newer Garmin Elevate Gen4 optical heart rate sensor plus includes a barometric altimeter compass accelerometer and thermometer. But it also collects lots of data when you aren’t explicitly recording an activity. For example you can always see your heart rate and step count.

Garmin’s Elevate Gen4 optical heart rate sensor is one of several on the back of the watch. Abby Ferguson

If you wear the watch to bed it will also track your sleep giving you insight into your sleep stages throughout the night. I have found the sleep tracking to be hit and miss in terms of accuracy with some nights showing as excellent sleep even though I most definitely was awake for chunks of time and do not feel rested in the morning.

Though it’s not always accurate wearing the watch during sleep allows Garmin to get a more complete picture of your fitness and recovery status which is new on this Instinct 2 Solar. On this second version you can now access Garmin’s Training Status VO2 max and Recovery time. If you are serious about your training these are all very helpful.

While the provided VO2 max value relies on an algorithm and heart rate data the estimation yields similar results to a proper VO2 max test which relies on indirect calorimetry and requires expensive lab equipment. And if you click on the Training Status on either the watch or the app it will tell you if you need to adjust your training in any particular way to improve your fitness. Of course it is generalized so if you are training for something specific it may not be very accurate but it does a great job for general fitness.

Smartwatch features

Like most fitness trackers these days the Instinct 2 Solar is a full smartwatch. That means it pairs with your phone to provide notifications on the watch’s display. Any notification you get on your phone can come through though some allow more interaction than others. It’s handy when you are in a situation where you can’t or don’t want to pick up your phone but you want to know if any important calls or messages are coming through. When out and about I typically leave my phone in my purse when out and about and only take it out if it’s something I care to deal with right then.

The Instinct 2 Solar doesn’t have a cellular connection and it lacks a microphone so you can’t take calls or use a voice assistant etc. But you can set up prewritten responses to texts or calls and respond from the watch which is ideal for when you are in the middle of something. You can also like Instagram messages from the watch should you care to do that.

Safety features

One of the things that I love about the Instinct 2 Solar is the safety features. Garmin added Incident Detection to this second iteration which uses the sensors in your watch to detect if a fall or crash may have occurred on a walk run or ride. If it does detect an event it will text your emergency contact which you can set up in the app.

There is also the ability to request assistance manually though quickly if needed. By simply holding the top left button for three seconds the watch will send a text or email to your emergency contact with your exact location. It will continue to send your location until you end it and can even send an “I’m OK” text if things resolve themselves. You will need to have your phone on you and have service to use it but it is very nice to know that feature is there if I ever find myself in a dicey situation.

The TracBack feature lets you easily navigate back to your starting point. Abby Ferguson

As a robust GPS watch you’ll also be able to use Garmin’s TracBack. It is an extremely beneficial tool for any backcountry activities as it allows you to follow your traveled path without needing to place waypoints as you go. Should you get lost it makes it much easier to find your way back even if you don’t have expert-level navigation skills.

Lastly you’ll also have access to Garmin’s LiveTrack. When you start a run hike or bike ride you can send LiveTrack information to whomever. It’s an excellent feature for backcountry activities so that someone can know where you are and if your outing takes as long as expected. All these extra layers of protection make me feel safer when out alone on runs bike rides or hikes and make my husband more comfortable with my solo trips as well.

Garmin app

Though you can do a lot on the watch the Garmin Connect app provides the best method for viewing and analyzing data collected by the device. As mentioned it can be hard to decipher some data on the watch so being able to see all that information in the app is very useful. The app also provides even more information and training data than the watch does so you can really nerd out and get into the nitty-gritty.

The app also lets you fully customize your watch from downloading specialized faces to changing notification settings and enabling safety features. You can do much of that on the watch itself but it may be easier for some to do on the app.

For those who like the social aspects of staying active Garmin also has its own platform for that within the app. You can connect with other Garmin users with options to “like” or comment on their activities. There are even challenges that you can join to stay motivated. It’s not as feature-rich as apps like Strava but connecting with others can be a big motivator. And you can also link your Garmin account to Strava should you want your data to sync there.

Usability and accuracy

Overall the watch is easy and intuitive to use. The labels on the bezel help identify what key functions fall under each button (labeled Control Menu ABC GPS Set) but you will want to read through the manual or do a walkthrough to figure out where certain settings are hiding. I did find the menus slightly more confusing than on my Forerunner 745 but not overly so.

I had some lagging issues when pushing buttons for the first time in a while resulting in me waiting for it to go to the right menu when wanting to start a workout or view certain stats. It isn’t terribly long but it is enough to be a bit annoying and hasn’t been an issue on other Garmin watches I’ve used.

The Instinct 2S Solar’s display looks very old school next to the Forerunner 955’s large colorful screen but the data gathered by both is consistent and insightful. Abby Ferguson

I wore both the Instinct Solar 2S and Forerunner 955 Solar (which I’m also reviewing) on a handful of runs—both on my left wrist though I also had a chest-based heart rate monitor that I only had paired with the Instinct. Results did vary slightly across pretty much all fields when I examined them in Garmin Connect but it was all well within the margin of error. So I would fully trust the results from both watches. I anticipated any heart rate-related fields to be different since chest straps provide much more accurate and reliable data than wrist-based.

Garmin will suggest workouts for you when starting a run and interestingly those varied slightly between the two watches as well. The Forerunner 955’s recommendations seemed to align better with my current fitness level and pacing abilities though that is strictly based on perceived effort type insight. The Instinct Solar 2S also didn’t have any motivational type messages pop up after a run as the Forerunner 955 did. Although small and perhaps somewhat silly it made me prefer running with the Forerunner.

So who should buy the Garmin Instinct 2 Solar?

There are other fitness-tracking smartwatches that are sleeker and thus better suited for blending into everyday wear (such as the Apple Watch Series 7). The rugged styling of the Garmin Instinct 2 Solar means that it doesn’t necessarily fit well with fancy attire though I have to admit I am one of those who wear their Garmin no matter what the outfit so this is a matter of personal preference.

Though the watch fully tracks activities and collects loads of data it doesn’t present the information quite as elegantly or thoroughly as some of Garmin’s more specialized watches. As a result it probably isn’t the best option if you are an intensely focused multisport athlete (that’s where the fēnix 7 and even more expressive EPIX Gen. 2 series come in). And as a runner I much prefer the Forerunner 955 as it provides better workout suggestions and gives me more information about my preferred type of training. The higher-resolution color screen on the Forerunner also makes it easier to see data while running which I appreciate.

The durability and long battery life when outside however make the Garmin Instinct 2 Solar a truly fantastic smartwatch for outdoor enthusiasts looking for a more casual but still comprehensive activity tracker. It also has navigation modes that are helpful for activities. I definitely see the advantages of this watch for longer hikes climbs or multi-day adventures and plan on using it for such trips in the future.

Several Garmin wearables get new software updates and features.

FĒNIX 7 Series Epix (Gen 2) and Instinct 2 series will be the first ones to receive them.

Forerunner 945 LTE and the Edge 1040 series will likely follow the rollout later this year.

Several Garmin watch models have received new updates and software features this week. The select smartwatches include the FĒNIX 7 Series Epix (Gen 2) and Instinct 2 series. The company also plans to give the Forerunner 945 LTE — its superior running watch — and the Edge 1040 series the same treatment very soon.

The several enhancements to some of the best Garmin smartwatches include battery life improvements. In an accompanying blog post Garmin says the built-in SatIQ feature on the smartwatches will ""automatically turn on multi-band GPS in areas where it's needed most and it turns off when it's no longer necessary aiming users to get their most use of the battery.""

Further Garmin watch users can track their ""heart rate variability (HRV)"" during their sleep as part of the company's accurate tracking activity feature. The smartwatch users when paired with the smartphone will now be able to receive daily weather and workout suggestions with the new ""Morning report"" feature. The report includes a user's information about the previous night's sleep and HRV status. Garmin suggests that users can further customize it as per their preferences.

There is a new ""Race widget"" to help users to view race prep information that can involve ""race day-specific performance prediction race day weather and a countdown clock — all in one widget.""

The training status appears to be updated as well. New indicators for tracking HRV status recent exercise and performance routines come with the new feature. Athletes for instance are said to be able to receive insights into their overall effort implying their performance and straining stats.

Fitness enthusiasts interested in stocks can now glance at their stocks on their wrists with the new 'stock tracker' on their Garmin watches. They can check up to 50 stocks paired with the stocks app.

The Edge 1040 series of cycling computers also receives some pretty nifty features with the new software release. With the new 'Music controls' feature the Edge device users can now control their music on their wrist. The 'training status' feature also gets the same treatment for the Edge owners as outlined above for other series.

Further users can keep track of their intensity minutes on each ride which is now an added feature. Then there is the 'Full eBike support' feature which lets users connect to ANT or ANT+ compatible ebikes with which users can view ""custom eBike data adjust assistance levels and see remaining range based on a planned course.""

I love the introduction of the Luxe-style pebble structure for the Inspire 3 even though it means the Luxe is likely to be eventually phased out. The addition of a clip accessory adds versatility to the Inspire 3 unit allowing it to be separated from the band while still being usable.

However there’s something I really don’t like about it and it’s an extension of my biggest problem with Fitbit as a whole. It’s the Fitbit Premium paywall which I’ve always tolerated even when other devices such as Garmin offer their comparable companion app services for free. Fitbit Premium has historically been very good despite a string of recent PR mishaps.

In the past the Fitbit Inspire range was the cheapest way to get started using Fitbit’s excellent beginner-friendly services. It wasn’t just because the unit itself was reasonably priced and frequently discounted during major deals events but that the Inspire 3’s predecessor the Inspire 2 came with a free year of Fitbit Premium which would normally cost $9.99/£7.99/AU$15.49 per month although you can save a few months by buying a yearly subscription.

The Premium service allows Fitbit users to get access to a variety of features including your Daily Readiness Score Sleep Profile and actionable sleep tips historic graphs of your activity heart rate sleep data stress levels and over 1000 workouts recipes and guided meditations.

(Image credit: Fitbit)

It’s a genuinely good service but as some of your device’s best features are tied up with Premium you’re effectively adding the cost of the subscription to the value of the device.

All Fitbit devices come with a six-month free trial of Premium but the Fitbit Inspire 2 was unique in offering one year of the service free. Combine with being the cheapest Fitbit the bundled subscription made the Inspire 2 a good value package. The Fitbit Inspire 3 on the other hand only offers six months in line with the rest of the range which effectively adds an additional $40 £40 or around AU$70 to the cost of the fitness tracker.

When you look at it like that the Fitbit Inspire 3 stops looking like such a great deal and starts looking a little overpriced for what it is. Billed as the cheapest entry-level tracker to nudge you towards a healthier life in a sustainable way the materials aren’t premium with the metal casing of the Luxe’s pebble replaced by plastic and lacking many of the features of Fitbit’s other trackers such as the Lux and Charge 5. The Garmin Vivosmart 5 which usually retails around $150 is a one-time payment including the free Garmin Connect service.

I love the radical overhaul of the Fitbit Inspire 3 but the lack of value in this package means I’d probably recommend the Garmin or other competitors even cheap bands over this smart fitness tracker that locks you out of its best features unless you pay a premium.

Do you need a gravel-specific mini pump?!? Silca unveils new Gravelero

We’ve had gravel-specific versions of just about every bike component and accessory you can imagine over the past few years – the growing genre has been a marketeer’s dream – but a gravel-specific mini pump is a first.

Silca’s new Gravelero uses the same hose chuck and plunger design as its existing Tattico pump so what makes it gravel-specific? Silca says that compared with the Tattico it “pushes 35% more air from the same overall length”.

Silca also says “The design has been further refined for gravel and off-road use with a smooth outer texture and improved sealing to reject dirt and mud while also making for easy cleaning.

“A reversible chuck makes the pump suitable both for Schrader or Presta [valves] while the whole pump has been conceived both with high and low-pressure tyres in mind.”

The Gravelero features an aluminium handle and barrel and includes a frame mount bracket with quick-release straps although it’s small (243mm long) and light (a claimed 139g) enough to be carried in a back pocket. It has a claimed maximum pressure of 80psi and is priced at £70. That's a lot less than Silca's £125 Pocket Impero Mini Pump.

Loads of other products have been given a ‘gravel’ tag over recent years. Lezyne has its Gravel Floor Drive series of pumps (above) and Kask’s gravel-specific Mojito X Peak helmet (no longer in the range) was exactly like the standard Mojito but with a peak built into the front.

There are also a lot of gravel shoes out there like the Shimano RX8 (above) that look a lot like cross-country mountain bike shoes to the untrained eye.

Do you think we've finally reached peak gravel in the cycling world or do you think there's more to come? Anyone interested in a gravel-specific headset top cap?

Temple Cycles introduces Temple Road four-season road bike

Bristol-based Temple Cycles is set to introduce a Temple Road steel road bike that’s designed for year-round use. The new model is said to be inspired by the classic do-it-all clubman’s bike and is made from Reynolds 853 which Temple reckons allows it to “achieve a perfect balance between performance comfort and longevity.”

“The Temple Road is a performance steel road bike that takes design and geometry cues from do-it-all road bikes but with a modern sensibility that focuses on comfort as well as speed” says Temple Cycles.

“The Temple Road is Di2 and mechanical groupset ready and offers other modern touches in the form of disc brake and internal routing… The Temple Road also features plenty of mounting points for racks (perfect for mile-munching tourists) and mudguards (vital for the considerate club riders).”

The Temple road comes with thru-axles and space for 34mm tyres or 30mm with mudguards fitted.

Framesets will be available to order from October at £1295. A full build option is set for release in 2023 although the full spec and pricing have yet to be announced.

Flock Light that illuminates your legs smashes Kickstarter goal

A rear bike light called the Flock Light that's designed to highlight your moving legs has smashed its Kickstarter funding goal. At the time of writing the campaign has achieved 350% of its target with nearly three weeks to go.

The team behind the project says “The Flock Light has been designed to highlight you not your bike. That's why it not only shines light backwards but also down onto your moving legs highlighting your human movement. This helps you to be seen much sooner than a traditional rear-facing light and be recognised as a human while you ride.”

You need to pledge at least AUD$102 (about £60) to be in line for a Flock Light although pledging on Kickstarter is not the same as buying through a retailer.

Fossil Gen 5 Smartwatch review notes: I've been using the Fossil Gen 5 Carlyle Smartwatch for roughly a week running Wear OS version 2.8 with build number PWDU.190718.013 on the July 1 2019 security patch. It's been paired with my Google Pixel 3 for the duration of this review.

Fossil Gen 5 Smartwatch review: The big picture

Fossil Gen 5 Smartwatch

Wear OS is in an awkward place. A host of smartwatches from major fashion companies to tech brands still have devices running Wear OS 2 — the older version of Google’s operating system. More recently Google and Samsung announced Wear OS 3 which currently only runs on the Galaxy Watch 4. This is important as Google’s attention has seemingly turned towards the new OS version while Wear OS 2’s future and the future of devices that run it remains uncertain.

The Fossil Gen 5 is one of those devices. However despite its aging OS the Gen 5’s hardware offering remains solid even three years after its launch.

The Gen 5 Smartwatch runs on the Snapdragon 3100 chipset and it has a few features you won’t find on other devices of its era: custom battery modes plenty of RAM to help with performance and even a built-in speaker.

It remains in the running as one of the best Wear OS 2 watches out right now but it has more competition outside the relatively small Wear OS bubble. Can it really compete with the Apple Watch Fitbit and Samsung?

Fossil Gen 5 Smartwatch review: Design and display

Fossil Gen 5

Display: 1.28-inch AMOLED 416 x 416 resolution 328ppi

Case size: 44 x 12mm

Strap size: 22mm

Weight: 99.79g If you’re at all familiar with Fossil smartwatches you’ll be right at home with the Generation 5 smartwatch. It features a similar overall design to previous Fossil watches with a big bright 1.28-inch AMOLED display a sharp pixel density of 328ppi and three programmable pushers on the right side — the middle of which is a rotatable crown. The buttons are easy to press and the spinning crown provides a nice alternative to swiping on that tiny screen with your finger. It’s no rotating bezel like you’ll find on the original Samsung Galaxy Watch or newer Galaxy Watch 4 Classic but it’ll do.

There are three Gen 5 models: the Carlyle (our review unit) the Julianna and the newer Garrett model that launched at CES 2020. They’re all at the same price and come with a variety of different strap options. Our review unit has a black silicone strap but you can also buy variants with metal and leather straps. Of course the straps are interchangeable so you can swap them out for any 22mm straps you have lying around.

There’s no functional difference between the three models. They have the same case size — 44 by 12mm — though it’s clear Fossil is marketing the Julianna towards the more feminine crowd. Julianna models come with soft rose gold and pink rose gold with a tortoiseshell leather strap rose gold with a silver mesh strap and yellow-gold with a mesh strap colorways while Carlyle models are black and smokey stainless steel. The Garrett models are a little chunkier and come in five colors: dark grey stainless steel stainless steel with a blue silicone strap stainless steel with a red and blue bezel silver with a black silicone strap and yellow-gold.

The Fossil Gen 5 Smartwatch is classy versatile and a step in the right direction over the Generation 4 watches. It still isn’t my first choice for a workout companion but luckily it has the hardware you need if that’s what you need it for.

Hardware and performance

Qualcomm Snapdragon Wear 3100 SoC

1GB of RAM

8GB of onboard storage

Three custom battery modes

GPS Heart rate sensor

NFC

3ATM

Bluetooth/Wi-Fi No LTE connectivity



Short of the $1000 Montblanc Summit 2 Suunto 7 and SKAGEN Falster 3 the Fossil Gen 5 is probably the most stacked Wear OS 2 watch you can buy. It comes with the Snapdragon Wear 3100 chip which definitely isn’t new in 2022 but remains a reliable wearable chipset. Thankfully the jump up to the 3100 pays off for the Fossil watch — performance is excellent.

I really only noticed the watch stutter when pulling up the keyboard within the Google Play Store. Other than that no complaints here.

Every Wear OS watch needs the Snapdragon 3100 and 1GB of RAM.

That buttery smoothness is helped along by 1GB of RAM nearly double what other Wear OS watches offer. Fossil also included a full 8GB of onboard storage — plenty to store apps and music. That amount of ROM is good news for people who like to work out while leaving their phone at home.

What’s more the Fossil watch comes with NFC for Google Pay contactless payments as well as built-in GPS and an optical heart rate sensor. When manufacturers try to cut costs these are usually the first things to go so it’s nice to see them included here. Clearly Fossil isn’t trying to cut corners.

Fossil claims the heart rate sensor used is an upgrade of the Gen 4’s. I tested it against my Wahoo Tickr X chest strap and Garmin Forerunner 245 Music running watch during a 2.75-mile outdoor run. Check out the results below:

Fossil Gen 5 Smartwatch heart rate readings max heart rate at 6 minutes Fossil Gen 5 Smartwatch heart rate readings heart rate peak at 16 minutes

Garmin Forerunner 245 Music heart rate readings

The Tickr X heart rate strap reported an average heart rate reading of 117bpm and a max of 148bpm. This is a little under what the Forerunner and Fossil reported. Both wearables actually came back with the same max and average heart rate readings: 164bpm for max 148 for average. The Fossil smartwatch hit its 164 max heart rate at around the 6-minute mark while the Forerunner 245 didn’t hit 164bpm until the 16-minute mark.

Either way both the Garmin and Fossil watches were at least able to pick up on significant heart rate trends throughout the workout even though they both overshot their readings. I ran with all three of these devices two more times and both the Garmin and Fossil watches overshot max and average heart rate readings compared to the chest strap.

The fitness crowd will also be happy to hear that the smartwatch has a 3ATM water-resistance rating as well as an altimeter accelerometer and a gyroscope built in.

See also: Everything you need to know about Google Fit

For fitness tracking the Fossil Gen 5 connects with Google Fit. I’m not a huge fan of the platform’s barebones approach but I’ll admit it is growing on me. Luckily since this is a Wear OS device you can download a third-party fitness app to your watch if you’d rather stay away from Google Fit.

It's a struggle to find any complaints with the Fossil Gen 5's hardware.

Perhaps my favorite part of this hardware is the addition of a speaker module. This absolutely needs to be a standard on all Wear OS watches and thankfully we’re seeing this trend continue with newer devices. If you speak to your watch through Google Assistant you can actually hear things being said back to you. It’s great.

You can also play music through the watch’s speaker but I don’t know anyone who’d want to do that (probably the same people who like to look at photos on their watch).

Battery life is decent. It’s certainly better than the average Wear OS 2 watch — which in my experience lasts less than a full day — but it’s certainly no Fitbit or Garmin. I usually get through a full day on a single charge without any issues but I typically don’t have enough juice in the tank to wear it overnight for sleep tracking. I had the always-on display turned off so expect even worse longevity if you keep it turned on.

The smartwatch lost about 10% battery during a three-mile run with the GPS and heart rate monitor turned on.

Wear OS on its own doesn’t seem to have the best battery-saving techniques so Fossil threw in three custom battery modes (four in all) to help your device last a bit longer. First there’s daily mode which keeps every feature turned on simultaneously — location always-on display NFC speaker and everything else. This will obviously drain your battery the quickest.

Extended battery mode is one step down from daily mode. In this mode you can set Bluetooth to turn on and off on a schedule for the day allowing the watch to disconnect from your phone at bedtime so you’re not wasting battery when you’re asleep. This mode also turns off everything except for button-to-wake notifications and vibration.

Custom mode is my favorite — you can turn on or off anything you’d like. I keep everything turned on except for the always-on display and NFC. This setup allowed the Fossil watch to last over a day on a charge but not much more than that.

Finally a time-only mode gives you a black screen (not always-on) with the time date and a Fossil logo. This lets the watch last days or even weeks on a single charge depending on how much battery you start with.

In January 2020 Fossil rolled out these custom battery modes to all its Gen 5 smartwatches including those that don’t have the Fossil name.

The Fossil Gen 5 received a huge update in August 2020 which brought a variety of design updates and new features. It can now natively track sleep which is pretty uncommon for Wear OS watches. It also now has access to battery-saving workout modes with a new Wellness app and the ability to track VO2 max. It also gained a simplified design for custom battery modes and a new Phone app tile.

December 2020 brought a new screen brightness layout a buff to the tile limit theatre and cinema mode changes and the option to long-press the power button to activate Google Assistant.

In September 2021 the Gen 5 received another update to further improve its performance. The revision stripped away more than 30 watch faces that the majority of users reportedly didn’t use. This cull freed up on-device resources.

Wear OS problems and Fossil’s solutions

Wear OS gets a bad rap in the tech community. I can’t say the reputation is undeserved but I think it’s overblown. Every time I strap a Wear OS device to my wrist I remember how nice it is to have quick access to Google Assistant Calendar and the many other Google apps I use on a daily basis. The Tiles feature was a welcome addition too. I should mention one bug though: For the life of me I can’t get Google News to show headlines in the new Tiles feature. That’s really the only oddity I noticed throughout the review period.

Wear OS also works really well with Android phones — it isn’t the buggy mess it used to be.

However I understand people’s concerns about buying a Wear OS device especially one running Wear OS 2. Google takes its sweet time to issue updates (maintenance and major updates) so if something goes wrong with your device you may be waiting a while for that bug to get squashed. Big feature updates just don’t come around too often and it’s especially true as Wear OS 2 slowly fades into the background.

Instead Google relies on third-party watchmakers to make up for Wear OS’ shortcomings. In Fossil’s case that’s working out quite well.

It seems like Google doesn't focus on Wear OS as much as Fossil does.

Traditionally Wear OS 2 devices struggle to last all day on a charge but the Gen 5’s custom battery modes help make it achievable. The OS can also be quite slow and buggy without sufficient RAM but Fossil packed in more RAM than we’re used to seeing on 2019-era Wear OS devices. This ensures a smooth experience.

I don’t think Wear OS should keep anyone from buying the Fossil Gen 5 but you should know what you’re signing yourself up for. The Fossil Gen 5 isn’t eligible for the Wear OS 3 upgrade so if you want the latest features and regular software support you should avoid this smartwatch.

Value

All Fossil Gen 5 Smartwatch models — the Carlyle Julianna Garrett — launched at $295 no matter which strap type you choose.

$300 is a lot of money to spend on a smartwatch especially one that’s now three years old and running a dated version of Wear OS. However the Fossil Gen 5 is your best option for a well-working Wear OS 2 device.

Fossil Gen 5 Smartwatch With a stainless steel watch band and additional band options the Gen 5 is a good-looking alternative to other smartwatches. Even better you don't give up substance for style. The Gen 5 features fitness and heart rate tracking along with Google's Wear OS platform for seamless syncing with your Android phone. See price at Amazon See price at Fossil

If you really aren’t a fan of the Gen 5 for some reason or want a more modern version of Wear OS your only option right now is the Samsung Galaxy Watch 4. Starting at $249 it comes with a broader health tracking kit the promise of software support and quicker hardware. It’s the gold standard of Wear OS devices right now.

As for non-Wear OS options you shouldn’t overlook the Fitbit Versa 3 which also undercuts and outperforms the Fossil Gen 5. There’s also the Garmin Venu Sq for a more health- and fitness-focused user seeking oodles of battery life and a sub-$200 price.

If you’re an iPhone user you’re not entirely out of luck here. The Apple Watch Series 7 is by far the best smartwatch you can buy for your iPhone even if Apple hasn’t changed much in the last few years. And thanks to Fossil’s proprietary iOS application you can receive Bluetooth calls from your Fossil Gen 5 making Fossil’s smartwatch a solid option for iOS users. Notably Wear OS 3 devices no longer support iOS which means the Fossil Gen 5 is still your best bet for a Wear OS device for the iPhone.

The final alternative option we can offer you is Fossil’s own Gen 6. Like many sequels it aims to improve upon the Gen 5 and largely does so. The display is bright and impressive yet we felt let down by a few battery issues and the sleep tracking overall. More importantly it’s in line to receive the update to Wear OS 3 in the coming months. Also read: The best fitness tracker deals we could find

Fossil Gen 5 Smartwatch review: The verdict

The Fossil Gen 5 Smartwatch is still the best Wear OS 2 watch you can buy even through 2022. It delivers in nearly every area — performance aesthetics and customizability. I just wish the watch lasted longer on a charge without turning sensors on and off though that seems like more of a Wear OS problem than a Fossil problem.

Fossil nailed it with this smartwatch.

If you’re on board with Wear OS 2 and don’t mind its limitations you’ll love the Fossil Gen 5. Fossil nailed the hardware offering with this watch. It’s just unfortunate that its software future remains uncertain.

Noam Burcerril 9 said the incident happened on Friday when he was riding his bike on the Kaelepulu Stream bridge at Kailua Beach Park.

According to KHNL/KGMB Noam said a truck stopped beside him when he was crossing the bridge with a person inside the vehicle telling him to come to his truck.

The 9-year-old said he didn’t know the man so he turned in the opposite direction and rode back toward the school.

“My friend was over there and I was like ‘Can you call my mom? This guy is trying to kidnap me’” Noam said.

The friend at the park was Emily Hellman the mother of another student who goes to school with Noam.

“As we were talking the truck that he had described circled back around and he [Noam] quickly said ‘That’s the truck!’ And then he ran away. He was really scared at that time” Hellman said.

Hellman said she called Noam’s mother Julie Burcerril who was waiting for him at the friend’s house.

“When he talked to us on the phone he was crying” Julie Burcerril said. “When we saw him he was better but he was very scared.”

One thing that seemed to help Noam was that the bike path he was on was separated from traffic on the bridge.

“If he got out of his truck he has to go around [pointing toward Kailua town] while I could just go forward” Noam said.

The boy’s school sent a letter to all parents after the incident and Noam’s family said they have filed a police report.

“He did exactly what you should do: Go back get an adult someone that he knew and we were able to get him help” Hellman said.

The two mothers said they had never met before this incident but share a special bond now.

No it’s not just another new building. It is a liberation movement.

Usually a dedication to a new building isn’t big news except for those with a personal stake in the construction. Ribbon-cutting ceremonies are pro forma events that give those involved a deserved acknowledgment. Funders show up to congratulate one another.

Last Saturday August 20 was all of that but oh so much more.

The historic change brought by the construction of the Tom and Ruth Harkin Center and what it means to those with disabilities was evidenced when Kevin Nordmeyer an architect with BNIM wheeled up to the podium that was mechanically lowered to meet his needs as a speaker.

Little wonder he choked up when he began his remarks to tell the audience about this once-in-a-lifetime design process which would make this building genuinely accessible far beyond current accepted practice.

Tom Harkin represented Iowa for 40 years first in the House of Representatives (1975-1985) and then in the U.S. Senate (1991-2015). Harkin’s signature accomplishment was the Americans With Disabilities Act or ADA. This landmark legislation was the first big step in a liberation movement for the community. Harkin said it is now just the baseline for what can come.

Visitors to the Harkin Center will understand what this means when they enter the building and see an encircling ramp. That part of the design creates common access to building levels not just an elevator primarily used by some.

Says Nordmeyer:

The Tom and Ruth Harkin Center embodies a spirit of empathy and inclusion that embraces the broad spectrum of abilities and the human need to allow construction to go beyond the ADA. It includes principles of Generous Space Clear Path Equitable Experiences and Individual Empowerment as we defined with The Harkin Institute.

At this point the newest addition to the Drake University campus in Des Moines has established a gold standard in new construction design pushed to an extent by a Disability Policy Committee. As a result electrical outlets are different colors so the visually impaired can find them more easily. That’s just one of the dozens of ideas they inspired to create the final product.

And BNMI documented the process and put it into book form which will help guide future architects worldwide to embrace inclusivity.

Marsha Ternus is a former Iowa Supreme Court chief justice and was the first director for the Harkin Institute when it launched in 2013. Harkin retired from the U.S. Senate in 2015 and his papers are stored in the Drake University Archives & Special Collections at Cowles Libray.

It was Ternus who was credited with the idea for a building on campus. “The immediate concern was that we had outgrown our store-front space” she explained.

We needed more room for offices meetings and–if we were dreaming–events. On a more fundamental level it was important for the Harkin Institute to be accessible. Tom cares passionately about accessibility and the Institute’s space should exemplify that passion at work. We also wanted a facility that would allow us to tell Tom’s and the Institute’s story so those who visit the Institute would appreciate the importance of our mission and be inspired to take action themselves.

Drake’s President Martin added “The new Harkin Center is a model of accessibility for our campus and beyond. This beautiful new space will welcome anyone and everyone regardless of ability for lectures workshops and other gatherings of many forms.”

Ruth Harkin was the primary driver of the Institute before Tom retired. She envisioned creating a way for students and community members to understand the significance of public policy in our daily lives.

The building dedication was a capstone to their 50-plus-year partnership. Said Ruth Harkin: “We were fortunate to have an architect who understood from day one how liberating a building as this could be for people with disabilities.”

A toast to all involved especially Tom and Ruth Harkin

The Tom and Ruth Harkin Center

Personal note:

I’ve been a fan of Tom and Ruth Harkin since my days as a rebel without a clue in 1973. I had to pay bills to support the causes I fought for so I worked in a furniture store when Tom came in to offer me a job on his congressional campaign. At the age of 23 life changed.

I’ll say more about this during The Register’s Storyteller project on August 30 at Hoyt Sherman Place.

Richard and I are proud supporters of the Harkin Institute and the campus center bearing their name.

Upon his retirement I thought Tom deserved a hard-earned passing of the torch. But that was not to be. He and Ruth have spent much of their time and talent securing the Harkin legacy. As Founding Harkin Institute board member Michael Gartner joked in his remarks on Saturday they also contributed their grandchildren’s inheritance to build this physical symbol of inclusivity.

According to the Georgia Bureau of Investigation the lab was equipped to manufacture crystal methamphetamine and was located in a horse stable.

WGCL reports agents began investigating after they were informed about suspicious activity at the property. They executed a search warrant and discovered an active methamphetamine conversion lab inside one of the buildings.

Agents with the Appalachian Regional Drug Enforcement Office said they recovered 255 gallons of liquid methamphetamine solution and 5 kilograms of finished crystal meth.

Officials said with the amount of liquid methamphetamine solution found the lab was likely capable of producing more than 700 kilograms of crystal methamphetamine with a street value of at least $7.8 million.

According to authorities 34-year-old Dustin Burgess and 30-year-old Uriel Mendoza were arrested and are facing several drug-related charges.

Due to the size of the lab agents said they contacted the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration Clan Lab Team to help collect evidence and dispose of hazardous materials.

Just a few years ago it would almost have been unthinkable to describe General Electric's (GE -2.46%) power business as its best performer but that's where things stand now. While the other three segments (healthcare aviation and renewable energy) have all suffered significantly with supply chain pressures in 2022 GE Power is on track for its full-year guidance. It's an impressive performance and GE investors will need it to continue to help ensure the successful execution of its breakup plan. Here's why.

Why GE Power matters

Ongoing performance at GE Power is particularly important for three key reasons and they all relate to the upcoming breakup of the company. As a reminder GE will spin off GE Healthcare in early 2023 and then GE Vernova (a combination of GE Power and GE Renewable Energy) in early 2024.

Unfortunately GE Renewable Energy is not in great shape right now (it's currently generating losses) and GE Vernova will need GE Power to do more than its fair share in the next 18 months:

The turnaround at GE Power serves as a template for how GE Renewable Energy needs to restructure and the latter will be led by the same person who was instrumental in the former GE Vernova CEO Scott Strazik.

GE Vernova will need GE Power's earnings to help ensure a successful spinoff and reduce the absolute level of debt it can take on board when the spinoff happens.

Management will need GE Power's earnings and cash flow to support the turnaround in process at GE Renewable Energy.

As you can see above it isn't just about GE Power; the whole of GE needs the business to perform well. It's on a good track at the moment with management confirming expectations for low single-digit revenue growth and $1 billion to $1.2 billion in operating profit in 2022. It's an outlook in line with the guidance given during the investor day presentation in March. For reference management guided for $1 billion to $2 billion in GE Power segment profit for 2023.

GE Power has come a long way

To understand the significance of the turnaround at GE Power you must appreciate the significant change in end market conditions. In a nutshell the growth of renewable energy has lowered demand for new gas turbines -- GE Power's key product from which it generates higher-margin services revenue over a 15- to 20-year period.

The challenge faced by GE Power can be seen in the following chart of GE's heavy-duty gas turbine sales in terms of units. It reflects the slowing demand for gas turbines that created overcapacity in the industry and a subsequent collapse in profit margins. As such GE Power went from $5.1 billion in profit and mid-teens margin in 2015 to a business losing $1.1 billion at the low point in 2018. Given that GE Power is forecast to generate $1 billion to $1.2 billion in profit in 2022 even though end demand hasn't improved speaks volumes for Strazik's implementation of CEO Larry Culp's focus on initiatives to improve performance notably in its power services operations.

It also speaks to the ability to work through less profitable contracts while restructuring the business for a new growth reality -- a playbook that GE Renewable Energy is following now.

GE Power

Management believes GE Power is a low-single-digit revenue grower over time -- a realistic assumption given the ongoing importance of gas power for electricity production. If the segment can continue its growth and profit margin trajectory then the GE Vernova spinoff will be better received by investors. As such investors will be focused on management's commentary on potential earnings in 2023 not least to offset weakness at GE Renewable Energy and buy time to restructure the latter.

You could drive a bus through the current guidance of $1 billion to $2 billion and investors will be hoping for something closer to the high end of the range ahead of the spinoff in 2024. Given the improvements in the underlying gas turbine business over the last few years there's a reason for optimism that that scenario is possible.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiO2h0dHBzOi8vM2RwcmludC5jb20vMjkzNjgzLzNkLXByaW50aW5nLW5ld3MtYnJpZWZzLTgtMjctMjIv0gE_aHR0cHM6Ly8zZHByaW50LmNvbS8yOTM2ODMvM2QtcHJpbnRpbmctbmV3cy1icmllZnMtOC0yNy0yMi9hbXAv?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,3D Printing News Briefs August 27 2022: Research Partially 3D Printed Engines & More,"The Additive Manufacturing Coalition has announced its newest member; this is what we’re starting off with in today’s 3D Printing News Briefs. Moving on orders for GE Aerospace’s partially 3D printed engines are high. In research a multi-university team is working on synchronous multi-robot additive manufacturing and researchers from Colorado State University are 3D printing carbon fiber composites in a short amount of time but with minimal heat. Finally researchers from Singapore and China came up with an approach to incorporate alternative proteins like crickets into food inks.

SLM Solutions Joins Additive Manufacturing Coalition

The Additive Manufacturing Coalition the national nonprofit recognized as the voice for AM with decision-makers and stakeholders announced that SLM Solutions is its newest Member. With its US headquarters in Michigan SLM Solutions invented the selective laser melting (SLM) process and provides its integrated multi-laser metal AM solutions to customers around the world in major industries including automotive aerospace aviation energy defense and health sciences. The company is focused on developing and distributing the most production-oriented metal 3D printing systems with a global install base of about 750 and will help to drive the federal government’s vision for additive manufacturing.

“Having SLM Solutions as a member brings a new voice to our Coalition when we’re speaking to decisionmakers in Washington DC about additive manufacturing” said David Cherington Executive Director of the Additive Manufacturing Coalition. “As the company which invented the selective laser melting process and how that process is expanding the possibilities for AM [additive manufacturing] SLM Solutions helps to define the possibilities for AM now and into the future.”

Orders Spike for Partially 3D Printed Engines by GE Aerospace

GE Aerospace formerly GE Aviation reports that the demand and number of orders for its partially 3D printed engines has spiked helping to boost its revenues by 27% last quarter. This GE division uses AM to produce its fuel nozzles which are said to improve fuel consumption by 15% and 3D prints other components that support the overall product. GE has seen growth in its aerospace and aviation division particularly with its engine hardware and services and this growth was partially supported by a deal with Boeing which will have GE engines used on the 737-10 in Delta and Qatar Airways aircraft.

In its recent financial reports GE indicates that 3D printing product advancements could continue to drive further revenue growth; for instance its partially 3D printed Avio Aero Catalyst engine will be used in the Airbus Eurodrone surveillance vehicle. Last year GE Aerospace made the switch from casting to metal 3D printing for four turbine parts and its Singapore MRO facility is the first to be approved to use metal additive manufacturing for commercial jet engine component repairs.

Collision-Free Multi-Robot Additive Manufacturing

A collaborative team of researchers from Texas A&M University (TAMU) University of Michigan University of Texas at Austin (UT Austin) and University of Arkansas developed a unique approach for collaborative 3D printing robots (synchronous multi-robot AM). Their method is outlined in a published paper titled “LayerLock: Layer-Wise Collision-Free Multi-Robot Additive Manufacturing Using Topologically Interlocked Space-Filling Shapes” and is based on a class of topologically interlocked shapes called Delaunay Lofts. These shapes come about by as they explained “stacking layers of Voronoi partitions of a set of moving Voronoi sites based on wallpaper symmetries.” The team developed an algorithm for volume-partitioning cell sequencing and path planning for a two-robot AM system which is then numerically evaluated for parameters like cell resolution and part orientation. They demonstrated their approach by using the two-robot system to 3D print topologically interlocked space-filling structures.

“Our approach is based on two key insights. First each layer of a Delaunay Loft is simply a tessellation of convex polygons allowing for easy division of cells for collision-free simultaneous material deposition. Second the unique transition of Voronoi cells along the layers naturally leads to topological interlocking thereby providing better energy absorption ability compensating for the loss of structural strength due to segmented printing” the abstract states. “In this work we constrain our current investigation to a two-robot system and develop the LayerLock algorithm consisting of three steps: (1) a distance-based division of the Voronoi cells at each layer of the Delaunay Loft (2) a moving-front strategy for determining the sequence of cells for each robot and (3) print path generation based on the cell sequence which allows synchronous collaboration.”

3D Printing Free-Form Carbon Fiber-Reinforced Materials

Research out of Colorado State University‘s mechanical engineering department is focused on freeform 3D printing of carbon fiber-reinforced material—specifically thermoset polymer composites. The material is lightweight but strong and the researchers are said to be among the first in the world to complete this type of composite 3D printing where the material hardens on its own as it unfolds on a heated surface without the use of a mold or support structure. The technique combines both freeform and layer-by-layer 3D printing strategies without the need for a post-curing step. Together with two graduate students Mostafa Yourdkhani assistant mechanical engineering professor in the Walter Scott Jr. College of Engineering published a paper on the work which details the 3D printing of carbon fiber composites with minimal heat in a very short amount of time. This could result in a reduction time energy and cost for producing this kind of complex structure.

“3D printing of fiber-reinforced thermoset composites is desirable for rapid fabrication of 3D composite objects with minimal tooling. One of the main issues in 3D printing of thermoset composites is the low cure rates of matrix resins which prevents rapid curing and rigidization of composite materials during the printing process and capturing the desired print geometry” the abstract states. “Here we demonstrate a new technique for in situ printing and curing of carbon-fiber-reinforced thermoset composites without any postcuring or postprocessing steps. Upon extrusion and deposition of the composite ink from a printing nozzle the ink is cured via frontal polymerization leading to rapid printing of high-quality composites. Tailoring the processing conditions allows for freeform or rapid supported printing of 3D composite objects with zero void content and highly oriented carbon fiber reinforcements.”

3D Printing Food Inks with Alternative Proteins

Finally while people in some parts of the world are more used to consuming alternative protein sources like algae insects and plants it’s an uncomfortable thought for many. But as the population continues to grow so too is the demand for protein-rich food which is raising concerns about increased land and water consumption as well as greenhouse gases. A team of researchers from Singapore University of Technology and Design (SUTD) the University of Electronic Science and Technology of China (UESTC) Nanyang Technological University and Khoo Teck Puat Hospital are working together to make the idea of alternative proteins such as crickets more palatable by mixing them with common foods like carrots to create an extrudable ink for 3D printing appealing shapes and textures. This type of work is typically done using trial and error but this team developed a systematic engineering approach—based on established Response Surface Methodology—that can more efficiently incorporate alternative proteins into food inks. In their study they explain how they used the central composite design approach to optimize the different formulations and experimented with proteins like soy sericin cricket and black soldier fly larvae.

“This research study can also be generalised for other food ingredients and response of the food inks like texture printability water seepage may be included for optimization” explained Aakanksha Pant SUTD research associate and a corresponding author of the study. “The response surface method approach may lead researchers to adopt similar method for optimizing 3DFP food inks constituting complex multicomponent food ingredients.”

Since April three major multinational companies – FM Logistic Rhenus and Panattoni – have announced major plans in India.

FM Logistic the €1.4-billion French third-party logistics (3PL) company inaugurated its first owned multi-client facility (MCF) in India at Farrukhnagar in Haryana. Located on a 31-acre site about 70 km from Delhi the facility will provide warehousing and handling co-packing distribution e-commerce and omni-channel services to cater to the demands of customers both in India and overseas.

Alexandre-Amine Soufiani Managing Director FM Logistic India recently told BusinessLine that it has around 70 lakh square feet of space in India and plans to expand it to 1.2 crore sq.ft. by 2026 as the demand for 3PL logistics services is set to expand multi-fold. “We are in the golden era and we came at the right time to India” he said.

Germany’s Rhenus Group recently expanded its warehousing footprint in India by launching two new multi-user chemical warehouses in Jamalpur (Gurugram) and Bhiwandi (Mumbai).

Vivek Arya Managing Director Rhenus Logistics India the “industrial economy in the country is going through an evolution. The expansion of Rhenus warehousing facilities in India to up to 2.4 million sq.ft. follows a period of sustained growth for the company. We aim to reach around 5 million square feet in the next three years.”

The latest entrant is US-based Panattoni which plans to invest $200 million in India to develop four industrial and logistics parks across major cities as it sees huge growth potential amid rising demand for warehouses.

Pandemic a catalyst

Sandeep Chanda Managing Director India Panattoni said the Indian warehousing sector in India has been witnessing extensive growth with the pandemic being a major catalyst. The consumers’ shift towards contactless operations and quick doorstep deliveries have significantly boosted the e-commerce sector. Several retailers and e-commerce players are seeking to expand their warehousing space thereby driving the demand for new and modern logistics areas.

India’s quest to become a global manufacturing hub fuelled by the popularity of ‘China+1’ strategy is expected to propel the growth of India’s industrial and warehousing space. Coupled with this the e-commerce boom rising investor interest owing to favourable market dynamics and government initiatives such as ‘Make in India’ implementation of GST and accordance of infrastructure status to the sector have all converged to create a structural long-term story for India.

Space requirement

According to Market research firm ‘Research and Markets’ in FY20 the warehousing market was valued at ₹1050 billion. In terms of space requirement it stood at 265 million sq.ft. in FY21. The total revenue is projected to reach ₹2243.79 billion in 2026 expanding at a CAGR of 10.90 per cent.

The space requirement is expected to reach 483 million sq.ft. in 2026 expanding at a CAGR of 12.77 per cent he said.

On reasons for the warehousing sector attracting foreign companies Devi Shankar President Industrial & Logistics and Data Centres ANAROCK Capital attributed it to the growing need for quality industrial and warehousing spaces by e-commerce players and manufacturing companies. There is liquidity waiting to be deployed and looking for the right opportunities.

Various other policy measures in the past such as infrastructure status to the logistics industry draft logistics policy – which is in the final stages of finalisation – give a positive outlook for growth of this sector in India.

Acquiring the right land parcel with strategic location favourable to e-commerce and manufacturing will be a key differentiator for the companies she said."

Why GE Power matters

Ongoing performance at GE Power is particularly important for three key reasons and they all relate to the upcoming breakup of the company. As a reminder GE will spin off GE Healthcare in early 2023 and then GE Vernova (a combination of GE Power and GE Renewable Energy) in early 2024.

Unfortunately GE Renewable Energy is not in great shape right now (it's currently generating losses) and GE Vernova will need GE Power to do more than its fair share in the next 18 months:

The turnaround at GE Power serves as a template for how GE Renewable Energy needs to restructure and the latter will be led by the same person who was instrumental in the former GE Vernova CEO Scott Strazik.

GE Vernova will need GE Power's earnings to help ensure a successful spinoff and reduce the absolute level of debt it can take on board when the spinoff happens.

Management will need GE Power's earnings and cash flow to support the turnaround in process at GE Renewable Energy.

As you can see above it isn't just about GE Power; the whole of GE needs the business to perform well. It's on a good track at the moment with management confirming expectations for low single-digit revenue growth and $1 billion to $1.2 billion in operating profit in 2022. It's an outlook in line with the guidance given during the investor day presentation in March. For reference management guided for $1 billion to $2 billion in GE Power segment profit for 2023.

GE Power has come a long way

To understand the significance of the turnaround at GE Power you must appreciate the significant change in end market conditions. In a nutshell the growth of renewable energy has lowered demand for new gas turbines -- GE Power's key product from which it generates higher-margin services revenue over a 15- to 20-year period.

The challenge faced by GE Power can be seen in the following chart of GE's heavy-duty gas turbine sales in terms of units. It reflects the slowing demand for gas turbines that created overcapacity in the industry and a subsequent collapse in profit margins. As such GE Power went from $5.1 billion in profit and mid-teens margin in 2015 to a business losing $1.1 billion at the low point in 2018. Given that GE Power is forecast to generate $1 billion to $1.2 billion in profit in 2022 even though end demand hasn't improved speaks volumes for Strazik's implementation of CEO Larry Culp's focus on initiatives to improve performance notably in its power services operations.

It also speaks to the ability to work through less profitable contracts while restructuring the business for a new growth reality -- a playbook that GE Renewable Energy is following now.

Management believes GE Power is a low-single-digit revenue grower over time -- a realistic assumption given the ongoing importance of gas power for electricity production. If the segment can continue its growth and profit margin trajectory then the GE Vernova spinoff will be better received by investors. As such investors will be focused on management's commentary on potential earnings in 2023 not least to offset weakness at GE Renewable Energy and buy time to restructure the latter.

You could drive a bus through the current guidance of $1 billion to $2 billion and investors will be hoping for something closer to the high end of the range ahead of the spinoff in 2024.

By VICTOR SLEDGE August 2022

“This is the breaking down of the physical versus the digital” says GEN.ART founder Adam. “There is no blurred line anymore. It’s all just one.”

If there’s no blurred line between the physical and the digital in terms of art or otherwise it’s because of people like Adam and innovative organizations like GEN.ART one of the leading generative art platforms.

Adam was always a creative person interested in art and the business surrounding it. He eventually got involved with a tech start-up based around art which exposed him further to the business side and the issues that existed within it. Working at the start-up seeing how art and technology are often one in the same Adam saw potential to further that relationship and push the art world further.

“It was this beautiful confluence of events” Adam explains. “I started thinking about where all of this could evolve.”

He eventually took that experience and curiosity and founded GEN.ART. It is a platform dedicated to generative art that not only blurs the lines of the physical and the digital but also the artist and the collector creativity and business and ownership and collectivism.

The exclusive platform which now boasts a membership of over 5000 artists collectors and professionals across the globe helps artists release their work on the blockchain while also changing the ways in which people buy and sell art.

Adam also created GEN.ART in part to solve age-old problems in the buying and selling of art.

“Whenever you come from the traditional art world one of the things you struggle with is understanding provenance” Adam explains. “The blockchain is all based on provenance. If an artist created a specific piece of art it’s 100% verifiable. There’s never going to be any question.”

Immutable GEN.ART x Vellum LA. Courtesy @stassievee.

Even in the basic process of purchasing digital art Adam has created a system that ensures only members who are truly invested in the art for art’s sake are able to buy pieces through GEN.ART which helps both collectors and artists.

“I had this vision where people didn’t need to wake up at 4am because that’s what time an artist has scheduled a drop” he explains. “They could wait until a Friday night open a bottle of wine and listen to our podcast episode about the artist.”

Through a more personable process Adam envisioned that collectors would have more of a memorable intimate experience buying digital art. He hoped this would then benefit both the collectors who now own their own unique piece of digital art as well as the artists who can avoid having their art bought and sold on the secondary market by buyers who are only interested in the art for financial gain.

Artists like Alexander Reben who was featured in GEN.ART’s first physical exhibition Immutable this past June at Vellum LA can appreciate that aspect of GEN.ART.

“Now more than ever” Reben says “there’s a need for curation and critique of what’s going on in this space because people have been so motivated by capital versus culture.”

Reben is an artist that fully encompasses the continuous blending of art and technology. As a roboticist trained at MIT and an artist that explores humor absurdity play and prototyping amongst other themes Reben’s work dissects the relationship between humanity and the artificial.

For Reben who’s been working at the concurrence of technology and art for over a decade organizations like GEN.ART and exhibitions like Immutable that push the longstanding relationship between technology and art forward are a natural progression. GEN.ART facilitates that progression in a way that is constantly putting the art artists and collectors first.

That attention to artists collectors and their mutual relationship is an element that was built into the DNA of GEN.ART. Adam took that mutually beneficial relationship even further by making GEN.ART a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO).

Structuring GEN.ART as a DAO means that each member has a say in the future direction of GEN.ART. This structure has essentially made GEN.ART a self-regulating self-perpetuating organization where art-lovers are able to contribute their expertise whatever that may be to lubricating this well-oiled machine in a way that benefits everyone involved.

“GEN.ART being a DAO is an incredibly important part of people feeling a part of something that is greater than themselves” Adam says.

It’s these constant decisions to fuel the sense of community and collaboration within GEN.ART that really breathes life into the organization and its mission.

Recently GEN.ART teamed up with NFT-backed digital art gallery Vellum LA to bring their latest exhibit to life. Vellum LA brings brick and mortar to screens and algorithms. As forerunners among galleries creating a space that prioritizes digital art with Luma Canvas display screens which are as well suited to digital art as any canvas is to physical art Vellum LA was the perfect gallery for Immutable.

“They understand the NFT world how you want to convey the art and how to tell the story” Adam says.

Vellum LA’s mission is to help situate digital art in the larger context of art history.

“We are pleased to be partnering with GEN.ART on this important residency that not only champions the work of prominent generative artists within the space but also gives our LA community a glimpse into the iconic collections of some of the top NFT collectors that have been investing in and supporting digital artists since day one” says Vellum Director & Curator Sinziana Velicescu.

Vellum LA also aims to serve as a gallery that educates the public on the potential impact digital art such as NFTs can have on the future of art. That’s something that Vellum LA and Notion have in common.

“My hope for the next year or two is just education so that people start to understand what is so special about NFTs and generative art” Adam explains.

GEN.ART aims to bridge the gap between digital art digital artists and digital art collectors and those who have so far been more engulfed in the more traditional side of the art world.

To artists like Reben though that gap shouldn’t be too large.

“A lot of people view technology as separate from humanity” Reben says. “But to me technology is humanity.”

Organizations like GEN.ART galleries like Vellum LA and artists like Reben are proving this point. As humans have pushed both art and technology forward in ways that are integral to how we live and have lived throughout time it makes sense to think of technology as a living breathing being like ourselves.

“Things like AI genetic algorithms and generative art are all a part of that continuum of technology that follows humanity.” Reben explains.

It also makes sense that technology is at the forefront of artistic exploration right now. In fact as Reben explains it has always been at the forefront throughout art history.

“If you go back far enough” Reben explains “everything used to make art was once a technology. Oil paint was the bleeding edge of technology at some point.”

With that point in mind you realize that the art in Immutable or any of the other art galleries like Vellum LA displays are less of a leap across a river and more of the next brick being laid for a bridge that’s been in progress since the beginning of time.

“It’s all a matter of perspective and time” Reben says.

And at this time GEN.ART is pushing the envelope further continuing to build that bridge with new ideas and a bustling community continuously furthering art and its culture as countless minds and artists have done throughout history to bring us into new eras of art.

In Marriott Moxy hotels in the U.S. the front desk doubles as a bar and lobby furniture bear slogans like “Pizza is my spirit animal.” Marriott knew it had to localize Moxy to appeal to China’s Gen Z. It hired Ma CEO of China-focused digital marketer Qumin to sell the brand—energetic and lively—to China’s young consumers who are known for being skeptical of foreign influence and for “lying flat” to escape the rat race of China’s economy by doing as little as possible.

The project was a study in contradictions but it was up to Ma’s Qumin team to make it work.

They started by conducting a sort of unofficial ethnography of China’s Gen Z and found that members had an “innate confidence” in their own abilities and a desire to create. So Qumin enlisted a group of underground Gen Z artists with cult followings to paint the hotel’s interior and craft cocktails for the launch of China’s first Moxy hotel in Shanghai’s Hongqiao district. Local graffiti artists tagged the walls with robots and abstract images. A DJ played house music. There was a pit of pink and purple plastic balls and pillows specially designed for the opening plastered with pictures of guitars and red floating lips.

An accompanying campaign on Douyin China’s TikTok called “Where Brave Starts” featured influencers who’d made Moxy-themed videos and inspired followers to make thousands of videos of their own. “We kind of had this pyramid effect where we got creators to make pieces for the hotel which then could be turned into content” says Ma.

The “Make Moxy Yours” campaign generated “a phenomenal 420 million views and 5.98 million likes” on Chinese social media channels says Jennie Toh vice president of brand marketing for Marriott Asia Pacific. After the launch of the Shanghai Hongqiao location in June 2021 Marriott opened a second Moxy hotel in Shanghai and four others throughout the mainland. More locations are “in the pipeline” Toh says.

Occupancy figures rose 500% at Moxy’s flagship Shanghai location in the weeks after the campaign. Marriott declined to say if that success continued this year amid tight COVID restrictions but executives claim that the company’s business in China remains strong. “Many of [Marriott’s or its partners’] hotels are benefiting from increased volumes of domestic travel [in China] albeit some pauses when certain markets go into lockdown” Marriott CEO Anthony Capuano said on an earnings call earlier this month.

Marriott loved the marketing campaign’s results even if its leaders didn’t fully comprehend how Ma generated them. “[A Marriott executive] was like ‘Man I don’t understand what’s happening in any of these videos’” Ma says.

Foreign executives don’t have to see eye to eye with China’s Gen Z to recognize their power. China’s 270 million Gen Zers make up 19% of the nation’s total population a share that is set to grow to 27% by 2025 according to Chinese digital marketing agency Alarice. The spending power of China’s Gen Z is set to quadruple to $2.4 trillion from now until 2035 according to China Renaissance. But the quirks of Gen Z—their distaste for overwork and preference for local goods—defy generational shifts of the past. Western brands that want to remain relevant in the market of 1.4 billion have to rethink their China strategies and learn a new set of rules to crack China’s Gen Z code.

The disconnect

China’s Gen Z is not just indecipherable to foreign executives. Older generations of Chinese also struggle to understand a cohort that has grown up in a world of relative affluence and WeChat.

China’s Gen Z population was born between the years of 1997 and 2012 just as the country transformed from a plodding backwater into a global powerhouse. During that time China’s economy expanded by a factor of eight growing from the world’s seventh largest economy to second place. When the first Gen Zers were born in 1997 China’s economy was just starting to boom and the country had a per capita GDP of $781. By 2007 when Gen Zers turned 10 China’s per capita GDP had more than tripled to $2694. Gen Zers have only known China as an economic superpower a trait distinguishing them from their elders whose working years coincided with China’s rise.

“It’s the biggest gap between any generation and another probably anywhere in history” says Ma.

Smartphones have worsened the disconnect says Allison Malmsten marketing director at Daxue Consulting. China’s Gen Zers are defined by their digital lives. “In the West they’re kind of testing the waters with integrating social media and e-commerce” she says. “But in China they’ve already been doing this for a couple of years now…That means your social media time is more integrated with your shopping time which is more integrated with showing off what you are buying which is more integrated with hobbies.”

The gulf between Gen Z and older generations fuels movements like “lying flat” and “involution”—a term that refers to the opposite of evolution and encourages people to become stagnant. Older generations were willing to log long hours to grow China’s GDP. Gen Z is struggling to see the payoff; China is already a top economy and the rewards for their hard work have diminished.

This generation has grown up in a “super high-pressured environment” where the intense competition of trying to get into the right middle school or high school is followed by an equally intense scramble to find the right job or spouse says Zak Dychtwald CEO of consultancy Young China Group. But the rat race doesn’t pay the way it used to. In June China’s youth unemployment rate hit an all-time high of 19.3%. Buying a house is increasingly out of reach. In 2020 average housing prices in Chinese cities were nearly 13.7 times the average annual income nearly double the ratio of the U.S. “There has been a feeling of helplessness that no matter how hard [Gen Zers] work or compete that the things that they want in life are out of reach” says Dychtwald.

Lying flat and involution are not just online fodder experts say; symptoms of passive resistance are popping up across Chinese society. Some white-collar workers are quitting high-stress jobs and moving to the countryside. Experts also attribute China’s falling birth rates at least partly to a desire among Chinese women to avoid the governmental and societal pressures to have children.

Disaffected consumers promoting a “slacking culture” don’t make for easy marketing targets says Ashley Dudarenok founder of Alarice. But brands that do business in China are trying to reach them—with mixed results.

Last year a Russian man named Vladislav Ivanov who goes by the stage name Lelush became a national star and a symbol of the lying flat movement after participating in a Chinese singing competition reality show. After Lelush signed up for the show he purposely tried to lose and get himself voted off by deliberately singing poorly and pleading with viewers to not vote for him. Despite Lelush’s attempts to get kicked off he made it through 10 episodes barely missing out on a spot in the show’s finale.

Fashion brands Prada Gucci and Fendi have all since featured Lelush in ad campaigns in China. Extra chewing gum owned by American firm Wrigley featured Lelush in a commercial in which he chews gum while uninterestedly commuting to work going to the office and working out at the gym. These brands are playing into the lying flat “slacking culture” says Dudarenok.

Guochao or nationalistic buying

Ma argues that the “lying flat” narrative about China’s Gen Z may be “blown out of proportion.” With the Marriott campaign he found that Gen Zers were not necessarily apathetic; they just wanted to identify their passion and find a way to pursue it.

He says the hardest part of the Marriott assignment was selling young Chinese on a foreign brand. “Before Western brands were always seen as superior. That’s not the case anymore” he says.

Indeed guochao or nationalistic buying is rising in China amid a widening rift between the U.S. and Beijing; it’s especially popular among Gen Z consumers. Since 2011 the number of people who said they would buy a Chinese brand over a foreign one increased from 15% to 85% according to a 2020 McKinsey survey of 5000 people across 15 Chinese cities. And much of that rise is thanks to Gen Z. A Tencent survey recently showed that 45% of Chinese consumers born after 1995 often bought products that had guochao or nationalistic elements in them compared with 38% of consumers born in the 1990s and 27% born in the 1980s.

In March 2021 some young consumers burned Nike shoes to protest the company’s stance on forced labor in China’s contentious Xinjiang region. This month social media users threatened to boycott Snickers candy bars after a Snickers ad shown outside mainland China referred to Taiwan as a country. The Snickers backlash occurred shortly after U.S. Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi’s visit to Taiwan inflamed tensions. Snickers’ U.S. parent Mars Wrigley issued an apology on Aug. 5 declaring that Taiwan “is an inseparable part of Chinese territory.”

“China’s Gen Z is ‘woke’ in their own way” says Malmsten. “What is considered forward-thinking among Chinese Gen Z is being very critical of foreign influence.”

Foreign brands can’t ignore the guochao trend and lose out to patriotic competitors. Instead companies based overseas are collaborating more with local brands and institutions.

“Guochao is all about authenticity and nationalism…the only way for foreign brands to do it well is to borrow authenticity and borrow nationalism through local partners” says Ma. He cited Oreo‘s collaboration with Beijing’s Palace Museum a historical museum housed inside the Forbidden City as a successful partnership.

In 2019 Oreo and the Palace Museum created an imperial-themed line of Oreo cookies with flavors like green-tea cake red-bean cake and lychee-rose cake—the latter of which was a nod to the favorite snack of Qing Dynasty emperor Kangxi. Oreo claimed it had sold 760000 boxes of the new cookies online on the first day of their release and attracted 260000 new followers to its flagship store on Alibaba’s Tmall platform.

Other brands have clumsily played into Chinese patriotism sparking backlash from consumers who can easily spot guochao imposters.

American chocolate maker Dove launched its own Forbidden City–themed box of chocolates for Chinese Lunar New Year in 2020. But internet users complained that the boxes barely featured elements from Chinese history and were just a ploy to capitalize on guochao.

“Collaborations that are viewed as superficial or that embrace improper cultural components endanger the brand’s reputation” says Dudarenok.

Ultimately Dychtwald says foreign brands must approach the Chinese market with humility.

“You have to create products that appeal to [China’s Gen Z] market specifically which means having an intimate understanding of what they want” he says. “Global brands are investing in market intelligence for that but they’re not always empowering the local Chinese team to actually develop the strategy.”

The days of coasting on brand recognition alone are long gone Ma says.

“You can’t rely on the fact that you are a heritage foreign brand” says Ma. “That just seems really cocky these days…People don’t care where you come from. People care about what you’re doing right now.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiU2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRpZ2l0YWx0cmVuZHMuY29tL2NvbXB1dGluZy90aW1lLXRvLXVwZ3JhZGUtZ2FtaW5nLWNwdS1yZWFkLXRoaXMtZmlyc3Qv0gFXaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZGlnaXRhbHRyZW5kcy5jb20vY29tcHV0aW5nL3RpbWUtdG8tdXBncmFkZS1nYW1pbmctY3B1LXJlYWQtdGhpcy1maXJzdC8_YW1w?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Think it’s time to upgrade your gaming CPU?

AMD and Intel will undoubtedly both come out claiming ownership over the best gaming CPU but testing consistently shows that gaming CPU upgrades don’t have the biggest impact on your frame rate. There’s a lot going on in the next generation of processors so I’m going to help break down how to understand your CPU’s role in games and how you can determine when it’s time for an upgrade.

A layman’s guide to CPU bottlenecks

Gaming CPU upgrades all come down to bottlenecks in your PC. A bottleneck is when one component in your PC is limiting the performance of another and CPUs have a dirty secret when it comes to gaming — they don’t do much. Of course your CPU is active and critical to playing games but its main role is to get out of the way of your GPU.

Get your weekly teardown of the tech behind PC gaming ReSpec Subscribe Check your inbox!

A CPU bottleneck is when your processor is limiting your graphics card and it’s easy to check if that’s going on with your PC. Load up a demanding game you like to play with Task Manager open in Windows click More details and check where your CPU and GPU utilization are at. You have a bottleneck if your CPU utilization is above your GPU utilization.

Most systems have bottlenecks at various places so you’re mainly looking for large discrepancies (like your CPU at 100% while your GPU is at 60%). The goal with most games is to have your GPU running at full 100% utilization regardless of where your CPU is at. Your graphics card is the most important component when playing games so it should be in use more than your CPU.

There’s some complexity here though. For starters 100% GPU utilization doesn’t necessarily mean you don’t need to upgrade your PC. It just means you should upgrade your GPU instead of your CPU which is especially true if you’re pairing a weaker graphics card with a powerful processor.

The resolution you play at is a determining factor as well. The Core i5-12600K is about 15% faster than the Core i5-10600K at 1080p for example but there’s only around a 3% difference at 4K. The money you would spend upgrading your CPU is better spent on a new graphics card (or maybe even a 4K gaming monitor if you were already planning on upgrading).

Even with that most of the complexity comes down to the games you play. There isn’t a hard rule for which games use the CPU more but you can break down the titles you play to understand the role of your processor.

Dispelling gaming CPU myths

There are a lot of misguided ideas about gaming CPUs because frankly they’re complex. Some say you only need a quad-core CPU for gaming others say gaming performance is all about frequency and gaming processors like the Ryzen 7 5800X3D would have you believe gaming performance is all about CPU cache size.

The reality is that core count frequency cache and all the other specs of your CPU matter; it just depends on which of those things is most important. As AMD’s Robert Hallock explained to me games largely break down into three buckets. A game can be sensitive to frequency latency or graphics and identifying the sensitivities in your favorite games can tell you a lot about what you need out of a new gaming CPU.

In general competitive multiplayer titles like Rainbow Six Siege and Fortnite are sensitive to latency. The instructions for these games are simple for your CPU to execute but they’re random and based on player choice. Your CPU gets the instructions finished quickly but it needs those instructions as quickly as possible. This bucket of games is latency sensitive which is why the increased cache on the Ryzen 7 5800X3D offers such a big boost in games like Fortnite.

Frequency-sensitive games don’t have a lot of random instructions. The games are fairly predictable but they have a lot of instructions that need to be executed very quickly. You can see an example of that in Red Dead Redemption 2 where the increased core count and clock speed of the Core i9-12900K beats out the boosted cache on the Ryzen 7 5800X3D.

Finally graphics-sensitive games just aren’t too concerned with your CPU. These games lean heavier on your GPU so different CPUs won’t provide much of a benefit. Some examples include Cyberpunk 2077 and Assassin’s Creed Valhalla but it’s important to keep bottlenecks in mind with graphics-sensitive games. These games may not see a big boost with clock speed or increased cache but they’ll see a massive jump if your GPU is being bottlenecked.

You won’t find a game that’s only focused on frequency or only concerned with latency but it’s good to identify where the games you play lean. If you play a lot of Rainbow Six Siege for example you’ll see a benefit from a newer CPU with a larger cache pool but in a relatively straightforward shooter like Borderlands 3 you only need six cores at most on a fairly recent generation.

Platform features make a difference

AMD Ryzen 7000 and Intel 13th-gen Raptor Lake present a unique hurdle for CPU upgrades. Under normal circumstances I wouldn’t recommend you upgrade to a new generation if you’re focused on gaming (assuming you have a balanced PC otherwise). These two generations present the introduction of DDR5 and PCIe 5.0 however.

DDR5 memory isn’t as important as it might seem. I’ll dive deeper into DDR5’s role in gaming in my next column but it isn’t a reason to upgrade your CPU alone. The more interesting platform feature is PCIe 5.0.

PCIe 5.0 still has a lot of maturing to do but it was only a couple of generations ago that we were locked to PCIe 3.0. Intel 10th-gen and AMD Ryzen 2000 and older processors are locked to PCIe 3.0. That means you won’t get the best performance out of features like DirectStorage and it could be downright disastrous depending on the GPU you have (read my RX 6500 XT review for more on that).

Should you upgrade your gaming CPU?

If you should upgrade your gaming CPU comes down to what you have now what games you plan to play and what graphics card you’re pairing the CPU with. There’s a lot of advice in this entry for understanding your gaming CPU but I didn’t want to leave it without offering some buying advice too.

I went through all major game releases in 2022 and none of them call for more than six cores. Six cores with one of the last three CPU generations is where you want to be. Some games can take advantage of eight cores like Cyberpunk 2077 but the differences are much smaller once you hit six cores.

Your pairing of CPU and GPU plays a big role as well. My rule of thumb is to have my GPU and CPU within two generations of each other and to balance where they are in the product stack. If you upgraded to a card like the RTX 3060 Ti but are still sitting on a Ryzen 7 1700X for example swapping out your CPU will provide a massive uplift in performance. If you already have the newer Ryzen 5 5600X though you probably won’t see much of a boost.

There aren’t any hard rules for upgrading your gaming CPU. Ultimately the best way to avoid unnecessary upgrades is to develop a deeper understanding of the role your CPU plays in games and pay close attention to how your own PC handles them.

Traditionally consumers have deferred to product page reviews in order to understand more about them. In spite of the fact that this is the case it seems that this trend is shifting at least as far as Gen Z consumers are concerned.With all of that having been said and now out of the way it is important to note that a quarter of Gen Z consumers stated that they trusted reviews from influencers more than reviews left on the product’s own page. That might be because influencers provide a direct line of communication and they have become much more honest in their reviews as of late which helps Gen Z consumers to trust them more than Millennials did with all things having been considered and taken into account.Additionally 15% of Gen Z respondents to a survey by Higher Visibility said that they might not decide to buy a product unless their favorite influencer chose to review it. Members of the Gen Z demographic generally view influencers quite favorably with 42% of Gen Z people in New York and 30% in LA stating that they want to join this industry in the future.Interestingly men seem to like the idea of becoming an influencer way more than women did. 13% of female respondents said that they felt like becoming an influencer was their best possible career path whereas 20% of males said the same.17% of respondents went so far as to say that they would pay someone money if that helped them become an influencer. This career prospect had begun to stagnate but the recent years have shown that it still has a lot of growth in it. We might see an influx of interesting new influencers who will have been inspired by previous members of their industry who they grew up following.

In 2016 defense news sources reported that the U.S. Army was interested in developing a lightweight ground combat vehicle to accompany Infantry Brigade Combat Teams (IBCTs). Originally referred as a light tank U.S. Army officials named the new concept the Mobile Protected Firepower (MPF).

Citing a report published by the U.S. Congress currently the U.S. Army’s Infantry Brigade Combat Teams (IBCT) do not have a combat vehicle assigned that is capable of providing mobile protected direct and offensive fire capability. The MPF solution is an integration of existing mature technologies and components that avoids development that would lengthen the program schedule.

In November 2017 the Army issued a Request for Proposal (RFP) for the Engineering and Manufacturing Development (EMD) phase and in order to maximize competition planned to award up to two Middle Tier Acquisition (MTA) contracts for the EMD phase in early FY2019.

On December 17 2018 the Army awarded two Section 804 Middle Tier Acquisition (MTA) Rapid Prototyping contracts for MPF. The two companies awarded contracts were General Dynamic Land Systems (GDLS) Inc. (Sterling Heights MI) and BAE Systems Land and Armaments LP (Sterling Heights MI).

On June 29 2022 General Dynamics Land Systems a business unit of General Dynamics announced that its Mobile Protected Firepower (MPF) offering has been chosen by the U.S. Army through a competitive process to provide enhanced firepower for Infantry Brigade Combat Teams (IBCTs). The Low Rate Initial Production (LRIP) award is valued at $1.14 billion.

The MPF is a 38-ton tracked armored vehicle capable to provide soldiers with speed protection lethality and the ability to wage a multi-domain battle working in concert with other ground forces to overwhelm the enemy with multiple simultaneous challenges. It is based on a light tank conventional layout with the driver and engine at the front and the turret located at the rear of the hull. The turret has a crew of three including a commander gunner and loader.

The turret architecture of the General Dynamics MPF is based on the M1 Abrams tank using the M1A2 Sep V3 fire control system and CITV (Commander's Independent Thermal Viewer) armed with one 105 mm cannon. One 12.7mm heavy machine gun is mounted on the commander hatch.

The General Dynamics MPF is based on a tracked chassis with six road wheels with the drive sprocket at the front and the idler at the rear. It is motorized with a Diesel engine. The turbine solution used on the Abrams MBT hasn’t been retained.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMimQFodHRwczovL2dhZ2FkZ2V0LmNvbS9lbi93YXIvMTYxMzMwLWdlbmVyYWwtZHluYW1pY3MtcmVjZWl2ZWQtYW4tb3JkZXItZm9yLXByb2R1Y3Rpb24tb2YtMjUwLWFicmFtcy1tMWEyLXNlcHYzLW1vZGVybi10YW5rcy1mb3ItcG9sYW5kLWNvbnRyYWN0LXZhbHVlLWlzLS_SAZ0BaHR0cHM6Ly9nYWdhZGdldC5jb20vZW4vd2FyLzE2MTMzMC1nZW5lcmFsLWR5bmFtaWNzLXJlY2VpdmVkLWFuLW9yZGVyLWZvci1wcm9kdWN0aW9uLW9mLTI1MC1hYnJhbXMtbTFhMi1zZXB2My1tb2Rlcm4tdGFua3MtZm9yLXBvbGFuZC1jb250cmFjdC12YWx1ZS1pcy0tYW1wLw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,General Dynamics received an order for production of 250 Abrams M1A2 SEPv3 modern tanks for Poland contract value is $1.148 billion,Not only Fallout: 7 series based on the plot of computer games that are also worthy of attention,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMib2h0dHBzOi8vbmF0aW9uYWxpbnRlcmVzdC5vcmcvYmxvZy9idXp6L2Nhbi1tYXJpbmVzJUUyJTgwJTk5LWFkdmFuY2VkLXJlY29ubmFpc3NhbmNlLXZlaGljbGUtZ2V0LWpvYi1kb25lLTIwNDQ1NtIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Can the Marines' Advanced Reconnaissance Vehicle Get the Job Done?,"The top Marine might not be wholly convinced of the Advanced Reconnaissance Vehicle's design.

General Dynamics Land Systems (GDLS) one of America’s defense heavyweights recently released new details about the Advanced Reconnaissance Vehicle it has in development for the U.S. Marine Corps.

Speaking to Jane’s General Dynamics explained that it should have an initial platform available for testing by the Marine Corps along with a blast hull by this December—though what the vehicle could ultimately look like remains a mystery for now.

Phil Skuta GDLS’ director for U.S. Marine Corps programs told Jane’s that “this [design] was purpose-built.”

He added that “it will pass and disseminate the data that will be going through their intelligence surveillance and reconnaissance network. He also explained that [the prototype is] connecting both to the onboard and offboard sensors to the uncrewed air and eventually ground robotic systems and sensors.”

Previous statements from the Marine Corps explained that the Advanced Reconnaissance Vehicle is “a key Fleet Marine Force modernization initiative” and that “the ARV Command Control Communications and Computers/Unmanned Aerial Systems will host a suite of C4 equipment sensors and operate both tethered and untethered UAS.”

“The ARV C4/UAS will employ an effective mix of reconnaissance surveillance target acquisition and C4 systems to sense and communicate. These systems will enable ARV to serve as the manned hub of a manned/unmanned team and deliver next-generation multi-domain mobile reconnaissance capabilities.”

Given the Marine Corps’ amphibious nature the vehicle is expected to be amphibious as well as is the Corps’ new Amphibious Combat Vehicle. And while there has been talk that the Advanced Reconnaissance Vehicle could incorporate directed energy—i.e. laser—weapons that remains speculative for now.

What is more concrete however is that the Advanced Reconnaissance Vehicle will be a significant step up from its predecessor the Marine Corps Light Armored Vehicle.

While the Marine Corps has depended on the Light Armored Vehicle for armored reconnaissance since the 1980s that vehicle has since grown long in the tooth.

The Marine Corps has previously specified that the Advanced Reconnaissance Vehicle should have an automatic medium-caliber cannon; anti-armor capability to defeat close-in heavy armor threats; precision-guided munitions (PGMs) to defeat threats beyond the engagement range of threat systems; unmanned systems swarm capability to provide persistent multifunction munitions; and networked multifunctional electronic warfare (EW) capabilities.

Still the top Marine might not be wholly convinced of the design. Speaking to Congress Gen. David Berger explained that though he has “repeatedly stated that all-domain reconnaissance and counter-reconnaissance will be a critical element of any future contingency” he remains “unconvinced that additional wheeled manned armored ground reconnaissance units are the best and only answer – especially in the Indo-Pacific region.”

He added that the Marine Corps would “need to see more evidence during Phase III [development] to support this conclusion before engaging in an expansion of our existing capacity or committing billions of dollars in procurement funds towards the acquisition of an Advanced Reconnaissance Vehicle.”

Companies including Tyson Foods Inc. and Kraft Heinz Co. have been searching for carbon dioxide as supply disruptions this summer exacerbated existing shortages threatening production of goods from cold cuts to beer.

Carbon dioxide is widely used throughout food and beverage industries including to stun animals before they are slaughtered and to chill and process meat. The gas puts the pop in soft drinks and the fizz in beer and is turned into dry ice to keep food frozen.

Supplies of carbon dioxide a byproduct of industrial processes such as ethanol and fertilizer production have been tight since early 2020 when many Americans stopped driving due to the Covid-19 pandemic slashing ethanol demand. Now shortages of the gas have grown acute in parts of the country according to carbon-dioxide suppliers and food industry officials as production disruptions coincided with strong summer demand. Maintenance shutdowns at industrial facilities that produce the gas this fall are expected to keep supplies tight.

Some major suppliers have limited deliveries to their customers gas-industry officials said touching off a race by meatpackers brewers and others to find alternatives.

“Supply is in a very fragile state"" said Scott Van Pelt vice president of sales for Roberts Oxygen Co. a Maryland-based distributor of industrial gases such as carbon dioxide. “There’s no room for error.""

Meatpacking giant Tyson has sought carbon dioxide for meat and poultry plants across the country in recent months according to correspondence viewed by The Wall Street Journal. In May Tyson said in the correspondence that it was in an emergency state and needed help closing gaps in its carbon-dioxide supplies at plants in Iowa and Nebraska. In June the company said it was in need of gas for plants in 10 U.S. locations including in Maine Alabama and Arkansas.

“We have a very big need and anything would be greatly appreciated"" Tyson said in an email to carbon-dioxide suppliers.

A Tyson spokesman said the company monitors the availability of raw materials and production inputs including food-grade carbon dioxide. “We’re also exploring new options to help address future supply-chain issues related to carbon dioxide"" he said.

Rich Gottwald chief executive of the Compressed Gas Association a trade group said carbon-dioxide suppliers are working to meet customers’ needs and that the group anticipates a return to normal in mid-to-late October.

For now Mr. Van Pelt said he is warning customers that Roberts Oxygen likely will have to limit its deliveries in coming weeks and that he is encouraging companies to find ways to use less of the gas or reduce production.

Roughly 70% of carbon dioxide produced in the U.S. is used for food and beverages Mr. Gottwald said. That includes during the production of foods from pizza to chicken breasts which often move through carbon-dioxide-filled tunnels to be frozen. That process takes a fraction of the time and space that chilling in a mechanical freezer requires.

Kraft notified retailers in August of disruptions to the company’s meat supplies citing “severely constrained"" carbon-dioxide supplies and other issues. Kraft warned retailers about a major outage of deli-fresh turkey cold cuts and spot cuts of items such as Oscar Mayer bologna.

“Without CO2 we’d lose significant shelf life on our products"" according to a communication from Kraft to retailers viewed by The Wall Street Journal. The company said it is particularly exposed because many of its plants are in the Southeast where supply issues have been most severe.

Kraft declined to comment.

Carbon-dioxide supplies typically tighten during the summer as demand for products such as beer and soda increases and high temperatures this year have intensified that demand according to Mr. Gottwald.

Supplies of the gas have been further strained this year due to processing disruptions stemming from issues at a source known as Jackson Dome Mr. Gottwald said. Jackson Dome is an underground deposit in Mississippi that holds naturally occurring carbon dioxide and is owned by Texas-based energy company Denbury Inc. He said the situation which lasted for several weeks was resolved earlier this month.

A Denbury spokesman said its customers are receiving all of the CO2 they are requesting adding “We continue to work with certain of our customers with specific needs such as food and beverage grade requirements to address processing issues that may exist in their distribution chains.""

Maintenance shutdowns at other industrial facilities that produce carbon dioxide are scheduled for September and October Mr. Gottwald said which will keep supplies tight in coming months.

Some regional carbon-dioxide suppliers say they have been fielding dozens of calls each week from food and beverage companies hunting for alternate supplies. Some of those companies included General Mills Inc. and Butterball LLC according to one supplier.

General Mills recently faced the prospect of pausing production at an Iowa plant that produces the company’s Betty Crocker baking mixes if General Mills couldn't find additional supplies the supplier said.

General Mills declined to comment.

A Butterball spokeswoman said the company has been working since 2020 to mitigate its reliance on carbon dioxide but that some critical processes still require the gas. The company has been working to secure what it needs to keep operations running with minimal disruption she said.

Regional suppliers with gas to spare say they are shipping carbon dioxide as much as three times farther than normal to meet the needs of new customers while other suppliers are sending trucks hundreds of miles farther afield to secure supplies for customers.

Vinnie Cilurzo co-owner of California-based Russian River Brewing said his carbon-dioxide supplier recently informed him that it wouldn’t be able to keep supplying him. Mr. Cilurzo said he found a new supplier just before running out but paid double his normal price for the first delivery this week.

“Without carbon dioxide there is no beer"" Mr. Cilurzo said.

Unilever,"Hi Quartz members

What is the purpose of companies?

Advertisement

For the last half-century businesspeople have had an easy answer handed to them gift-wrapped back in 1970 by Milton Friedman. The purpose of a company the economist wrote was to make money for its shareholders. If it did that like a shark focused on hunting it would be working efficiently totally focused on the one thing it was made to do.

But like so many of the certainties of capitalism—”healthy economies are those that grow”; “striving for success is the goal of every worker”—this definition is being called increasingly into question. Now the heads of companies from BlackRock in finance to Danone in food are calling on business to help solve some of the modern world’s biggest problems: climate change inequality and intractable poverty.

There’s a problem though. It’s easy to make peripheral changes to a business model and hard to make big ones. What about when principle curbs profit gets a company criticized in valued markets or sours shareholders it wants to keep sweet?

This week saw a particularly stark example of purpose meeting what might be termed practicality — and losing. The company in question: Ben & Jerry’s the “mission-driven” ice cream company that was bought by Unilever in 2000 but that retains an independent board. A federal judge ruled against Ben & Jerry’s refusing to grant an injunction against the sale of the franchise’s ice cream business in Israel.

It was a test case: Could a small subsidiary really stand up to the might of its parent? The answer appears to be: No. The halo that Unilever has been polishing through its acquisition of “ethical” brands has been tarnished as a result. When push comes to shove it appears principles lose out to profit. All those other smaller mission-driven companies building their businesses will be watching and wondering: In the future will they be able to sell without selling out?

THE BACKSTORY

In July 2021 Ben & Jerry’s announced it would stop selling ice cream in the Occupied Palestinian Territories. The decision they were careful to note was not a protest against Israel per se—in other areas of the country the dessert would still be available. The founders of Ben & Jerry’s are Jewish they noted and do not believe their protest to be antisemitic.

Unilever Ben & Jerry’s parent came in for criticism from Israel where it sells many other products and from some shareholders. A year after Ben & Jerry’s took its position Unilever announced that to get around the problem it was selling Ben & Jerry’s in Israel to the local distributor which would market it in exactly the same way as before save for a change to Arabic and Hebrew names.

This past July Ben & Jerry’s filed a suit to stop as much of the sale as possible. (Much was already complete.) The pay of the ice cream maker’s independent board was frozen in retaliation its lawyers said. Out-of-court mediation collapsed. This week a New York judge rejected Ben & Jerry’s suit saying it hadn’t proved either that it had suffered “irreparable harm” or that its customers would be “confused.”

FLAVOR BOMBS

Ben & Jerry’s frequently expresses its politics in the form of limited-edition ice creams. Here’s a look at some its flavorful forays into social and environmental causes over the years:

🐒“Rainforest Crunch” (1988): Meant to support indigenous nut cooperatives and protect the Amazon rainforest; famously fails to deliver on its political premise.

🇺🇸 “Yes Pecan!” (2009): Proceeds from “Yes Pecan!”—a pun on Barack Obama’s campaign tagline—go to the Common Cause Education Fund which encourages US citizens to participate in politics.

🌎 “Save our Swirled” (2015): The “Save Our Swirled” flavor supports climate change action at the Paris Agreement talks that year.

🙅‍♀️ “Pecan Resist” (2018): “Pecan Resist” protests the impact of US president Donald Trump’s policies on women immigrants people of color and the environment.



✊🏿 “Change the Whirled” (2021): Football player and racial equality activist Colin Kaepernick helps create the vegan flavor “Change the Whirled.”

☕ “Change is Brewing” (2021): The “Change Is Brewing” flavor features coffee brownies and art by Black-owned businesses in support of US representative Cori Bush’s legislation for police reform.

🍫 “Chocolatey Love A-fair” (coming in 2023): A new flavor created in partnership with chocolate company Tony’s Chocolonely to promote the “mission to end modern slavery in cocoa farming.”

BUSINESS AS UNUSUAL

Unilever is not the only multinational company to do business in the Israeli settlements. In 2020 the United Nations Human Rights Office created a list of 112 firms operating in the Occupied Palestinian Territory including US-based companies Airbnb Expedia General Mills Motorola and TripAdvisor.

Airbnb had actually announced back in 2018 that it would stop listing properties located in the settlements. The following year facing an onslaught of lawsuits in the wake of the decision it reversed course. The company said it will not profit from the listings donating proceeds to humanitarian aid organizations.

Amnesty International has criticized Airbnb Expedia and TripAdvisor for legitimizing human rights violations by supporting tourism in the settlements.

General Mills meanwhile sold its majority stake in the Pi llsbury dough factory based in the West Bank this past June. The decision followed a boycott of Pillsbury products which was supported by some members of the Pillsbury family.

ONE 🪖 THING

Another prong of Ben & Jerry’s politics over the years has been its staunch criticism of NATO’s expansion in Eastern Europe — a position the ice cream company maintained even earlier this year after Russia invaded Ukraine. Ben Cohen one of the eponymous co-founders once took out a full-page New York Times ad accusing US defense contractors of lobbying hard for a NATO expansion that was really a “$60 billion boondoggle.” For NATO to push up so aggressively against Russia Cohen said in an interview was akin to Ben & Jerry’s trying to drive Haagen-Dazs out of business — even if Haagen-Dazs stopped selling ice cream and started selling hot dogs instead.

But more recently it has built a practice to help Republicans win elections and it has advised the Trump administration in its federal judge picks. The effects of Jones Day’s work on this front are fast becoming visible in the Supreme Court’s rightward turn and in the rungs of Republican power. “The next Republican presidential administration” the New York Times Magazine writes “will most likely be stocked with Jones Day lawyers.”

💎 Charming NATO. For years NATO officers posted in Naples encountered Maria Adela Rivera a socialite who ran her own jewelry and luxury business. Rivera was Peruvian but she had Russian connections: Her adoptive mother lived in Moscow and her husband was part-Russian. Only after Bellingcat revealed in 2018 that her passport was one of a sequence used by Russian agents did it emerge that Rivera had been spying for the GRU the whole time.

🍼 Sticking to formula. In February tens of millions of baby formula cans were recalled from the market. A particular kind of bacteria in some of these cans had been making children sick and an inspection of the Indiana factory run by their manufacturer Abbott Laboratories found bacteria samples on site. A BusinessWeek investigation tells the complicated story of this fiasco involving a disgruntled whistleblower a factory with a track record of problems and a questionable work culture.

💲 Private iniquity. In 2019 when St. Joseph’s Home for the Aged a tidy cozy nursing home in Virginia put itself up for sale it was flourishing. No one bought it though until 2021 when a New Jersey private equity firm named Portopiccolo Group added it to its portfolio of care facilities. Within two weeks staff cuts had been planned the name was changed the aviary and aquarium disappeared and residents started eating alone in their room s. And a home that had kept covid deaths down to zero saw 17 infections and six deaths in just four months under Portopiccolo — an example as the New Yorker explains of the way private equity firms think about their investments in the care sector.

😵 The murder that wasn’t. For 20 years Manuel Ramirez sat in a Mexican jail imprisoned for the murder of a man he insisted he didn’t kill. Then he was released his sentence commuted but his record as a criminal still intact. But was his supposed victim even really dead? Nothing is quite as it seems in the Economist’s account of the travails of Ramirez.

Dockers in Felixstowe have struck to demand better pay. Isabel Ringrose explores how despite drastic changes to the nature of their jobs they still can be powerful









Downloading PDF. Please wait...

Dock strikes in Felixstowe show that despite being drastically reduced in numbers by attempts to modernise the industry dock workers still hold power. Bosses are playing down the ­disruption caused by the strike by claiming there will be no “prolonged impact” to supply chains.

According to one industry source the total value of containers impacted by the eight-day strike is around £3.98 billion. “The congestion is expected to worsen across Europe with an increase in blank (cancelled) sailings and the container rollovers as a result of these cancellations will further impact the supply chain” said Josh Brazil.

He’s the vice-president of “supply chain insights” for Project44 which tracks supply chains. Maersk the second largest ocean carrier in the world said “We expect the strike to have a significant impact.” Workers do still have power if they use it.

Some 48 percent of all containers arriving in Britain are processed at Felixstowe. Without dockers the ­process would entirely fall apart.

It takes around 40 days for goods to reach Britain from southeast Asia meaning Christmas supplies may be hit. Brands such as Amazon General Mills Diageo Kellogg and Mars Foods will all feel the sting as their products stay packed up in ­containers.

Attempts will be made to reroute goods to other British ports or Europe. But a severe shortage of HGV lorry drivers the Tory Brexit fiasco and possibly strikes will also dent the freight handling supply chain.

The increased use of container ships to ferry goods from one side of the world to the other led to a sharp decrease in the number of dockers. Bosses hoped the workforce could be tamed. By 2016 there were 10000 ­registered dockers. Back in 1973 there were 43000 and over 80000 in the early 1950s.

Containerisation—sending cargo around in big metal boxes—was introduced to increase the amount of goods that could be quickly sent and received. Today container ships haul ­90­ ­percent of the world’s non-bulk cargo—unpacked goods in large quantities like oil coal sand and gravel. Felixstowe dock strikers show the power to win on pay Read More

Increasing capacity and capitalist profit-seeking means ships became ever bigger. Since 1968 they have increased by over 1200 percent. A 20-foot container is known as having one TEU. Early container ships from the 1950s carried between 500‑800 TEUs.

In 2019 they reached 21000‑25000 TEUs taking up a whopping 24 bays in a dock. That’s why some of the ships headed for Felixstowe will be too big to unload at other docks. As freight cargoes got bigger it became the role of workers using huge cranes to unload giant containers. This resulted in fewer dockers. But the centrality of cargo ships and docks to supply chains everywhere means a smaller number of workers hold an important source of power.

Last summer a quarter-mile-long cargo ship packed with 18300 containers got stuck and caused a six-day jam in the Suez Canal costing £8.47 billion a day. It shows how fragile the supply chain is—any barrier including ­workers’ action means huge profits sail away.

Strikes today are anchored in history of struggle

The docks have been a site of struggle since the early days of capitalism in Britain. In 1889 dock workers revolted against a system which meant they had to fight to grab a few hours of casual work. Their strike was a key part of the birth of a mass trade union movement.

In 1947 as a result of workers’ militancy the government set up the National Dock Labour Board to guarantee dockers a basic minimum fallback wage whether work was available or not. It was administered by the Transport and General Workers’ Union as well as bosses giving the union a 50 percent control over hiring and firing.

But the union leaders’ involvement was double‑edged. It gave workers some input. But some officials organised strikebreaking against unofficial strikes and allowed the sacking of militants if they disagreed with union leaders.

Yet militancy continued. A system in Glasgow and Liverpool of “spelling” and “the welt” became common which slowed down work in the docks. The 1964 Labour government called for a commission to “decasualise” and modernise the docks supported by the unions.

For workers it meant belonging to one employer instead of being hired out for half-days by the board. But the fierce solidarity in the daily battles for wages and conditions was weakened and this had a terrible impact.

As struggle was broken demoralisation spread. In 1968 some dockers marched in support of racist Tory MP Enoch Powell who had been sacked over his infamous “Rivers of Blood” racist speech.

But dockers’ militancy in 1972 overturned Tory anti-union laws by 1974. They won rights for workers still on the board’s scheme by guaranteeing full employment and large pay-offs if they were made redundant.

But there was not enough unity to keep jobs in the face of cuts or to save the scheme. And as trade shifted towards eastwards ports like Felixstowe and Dover became busier—neither of which had been part of the scheme.

They were seen as a weak link in later strikes. But Felixstowe now is in the vanguard of resistance.

Felixstowe solidarity goes global

It’s not just Felixstowe dockers striking for better pay in the face of the skyrocketing wealth of shipping container companies. Thousands of dock workers at Germany’s major seaports of Hamburg Emden Bremerhaven Bremen Brake and Wilhelmshaven struck for 48 hours at the end of last month.

It was the third strike by 12000 workers who previously walked out in June. Meanwhile a week‑long strike at the Port of Oakland near San Francisco by over 1000 truckers last month brought the docks to a standstill.

And truckers in South Korea also struck for a week adding strain to the global supply chain. The bottleneck means the TransAtlantic route from the United States to Europe is now at 27 days—the highest it’s ever been is 29.

It could take months for the congestion to be cleared as alternative ports including Rotterdam can’t cope with the volume. But workers in the Netherlands are ready to stand in solidarity—rather than help bosses.

The FNV Havens union—the largest in the Netherlands—and the trade union department of the port HPH ECT Rotterdam wrote a solidarity letter to Unite union. The statement called the decision not to raise salaries as “incomprehensible”.

Unite rep Bobby Morton said last week “I’ve had letters of support from the American dockworkers on the West Coast. They will refuse to handle any work that’s going to or from Felixstowe.”"

We want to hear from you: Contact the WSWS by filling out the form at the end of the article to tell us what health and safety conditions are like in your factory.

GM Wentzville Assembly

On Friday August 19 workers at the General Motors assembly plant in Wentzville Missouri located near St. Louis were informed by management that a coworker had tested positive for monkeypox.

A letter from the plant executive director Lamar Rucker which a worker shared with the World Socialist Web Site stated:

To communicate transparently and respond to employee concerns our leadership team wants to address a confirmed Monkeypox case in our plant. Here are the facts:



On Tuesday August 9 a 1st shift Trim employee did the right thing and promptly reported to his personal physician with symptoms. Medical was notified and has been awaiting test results which have now been confirmed.



Out of an abundance of caution we have thoroughly disinfecting the employee’s work area and Medical has assessed the risk in the employee’s work area. It was determined there was minimal contact and interaction with others therefore a low risk for workplace transmission per CDC guidelines. Cleaning supplies remain readily available for all employees.

The letter proceeds to cavalierly assert: “Monkeypox is NOT highly contagious. Disease transmission occurs through prolonged skin-to-skin contact (typical handshakes fist-bumps etc. are not considered a concern for spread).”



A virtually identical letter was sent to workers at GM’s Flint Assembly plant in Michigan over the weekend stating that there was a suspected case of monkeypox identified on Friday August 26. The individual who experienced symptoms works the third shift in Chassis and was still awaiting test results according to the statement.

More than 5800 workers are employed at the giant GM Flint Assembly plant while over 4000 work at GM Wentzville.

The United Auto Workers (UAW) has not released a public statement on either the confirmed or the suspected case of monkeypox in line with its efforts over the course of the COVID-19 pandemic to suppress information about the spread of the coronavirus and to ensure production and the flow of profits continue uninterrupted. To date the word “monkeypox” has yet to even appear on the UAW’s website.

A worker at Wentzville Assembly told the WSWS that workers are concerned that monkeypox may be circulating more widely than management is letting on. “People are saying ‘Can you believe there’s a monkeypox case? Probably more than one.’ They’re not telling us the truth. There’s got to be more. People are just done with this whole situation.”

The worker said that COVID-19 also remains a major concern and risk to workers’ health and lives yet neither management nor the UAW are providing any serious protections. “St. Charles County [where Wentzville is located] is supposed to be a high risk but they’re not saying anything about whether we would wear a mask. I know people who’ve had COVID twice and three times.”

The monkeypox case at GM Wentzville is at least the second confirmed case in an auto plant in the US. Earlier in August a case was reported at the Stellantis (Chrysler) Sterling Heights Assembly Plant in the Detroit area. Unconfirmed reports circulated a few days later of two more suspected cases.

Monkeypox is often an extremely painful and potentially deadly disease with a case fatality rate historically on par with COVID-19. The virus produces lesions on the skin along with other symptoms such as fever headache chills and swollen lymph nodes.

Contrary to misinformation circulated by reactionary and fascistic forces monkeypox is not just a sexually transmitted infection nor is it limited to men who have sex with men.

While scientists are still working to understand the disease more clearly—and direct skin-to-skin contact and respiratory droplets appear to be the most common form of transmission—monkeypox has shown to be able to spread via aerosols (microscopic particles which can hang in the air) and contact with contaminated surfaces. Moreover compromised immune systems—a potential consequence of infection or repeated infection with COVID-19—can heighten the risk of infection with monkeypox.

The seven-day average of daily new cases has hovered around 450 in the US since early August accounting for nearly half the daily cases being reported worldwide although with tests frequently hard to attain the figures are no doubt a substantial undercount. As of August 26 17336 cases had been reported in the US and 48227 globally according to Our World in Data. Vaccines meanwhile remain in extremely limited supply.

Monkeypox cases in Michigan according to state data climbed 47 percent in a week larger than the national growth of 31 percent. Between August 16 and August 24 Wayne County which is part of the Detroit metro area added 26 new cases for a total of 68. Oakland County climbed from 18 cases to 29 and Macomb County increased from 13 to 19.

The reopening of schools to in-person learning under conditions of the simultaneous COVID-19 and monkeypox pandemics has the potential to fuel the spread of both and worsen what is already a disastrous public health crisis.

Workers should demand that every scientific measure be taken in order to protect them from these preventable diseases including contact tracing the provision of high-quality N95 masks and the emergency shutdown of plants if workers deem conditions unsafe with full income provided.

Will Lehman a Mack Trucks worker and candidate for UAW International president this year issued a statement earlier in August demanding such measures be taken after the first monkeypox case was reported at Sterling Heights Assembly. Denouncing the UAW bureaucracy for doing nothing to protect workers he urged workers to form rank-and-file committees in order to fight to ensure their safety stating:

I call for the formation of rank-and-file committees in every auto plant and workplace to oversee health and safety and other workplace conditions. We need to build a network of rank-and-file committees to link up autoworkers everywhere including with our brothers and sisters overseas. We cannot allow COVID and now monkeypox to continue to spread in our workplaces and society as a whole.

A young second shift worker at GM Flint Assembly told the WSWS “I heard about the monkeypox report first from a co-worker on Saturday. She had just received a text from management. It was pretty late into our shift. We were both very angry about hearing this for the first time since the message said the case was known on Friday August 26.

“They’re not doing anything to prevent this except wiping surfaces here and there. I was not contacted by anyone from management or the union. Nothing! No one! It says to me that communicating this way serves to minimize the danger and the spread of monkeypox. There is no contact tracing. Their message claims the worker had no contact with us. This cannot be verified!

“It’s the same way they handle COVID. They deny cases occur in the plant. And like COVID there are no measures to protect us. The lines are big dozens and dozens of workers but there is no way to know if any of us were near the worker or touched the work station where he or she was working.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiQ2h0dHBzOi8vY2FyYnV6ei5jb20vbmV3cy9nbS1oYXMtYS1uZXctaHlicmlkLXRoYXQtb25seS1jb3N0cy0xNDUwMC_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,GM Has A New Hybrid That Only Costs $14500,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with ('Connection aborted.', RemoteDisconnected('Remote end closed connection without response')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiQ2h0dHBzOi8vY2FyYnV6ei5jb20vbmV3cy9nbS1oYXMtYS1uZXctaHlicmlkLXRoYXQtb25seS1jb3N0cy0xNDUwMC_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTWh0dHBzOi8vZ21hdXRob3JpdHkuY29tL2Jsb2cvMjAyMi8wOC9nbS1pcy1ub3QtYWxvbmUtaW4tZGlzY29udGludWluZy1zZWRhbnMv0gFRaHR0cHM6Ly9nbWF1dGhvcml0eS5jb20vYmxvZy8yMDIyLzA4L2dtLWlzLW5vdC1hbG9uZS1pbi1kaXNjb250aW51aW5nLXNlZGFucy9hbXAv?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,GM Is Not Alone In Discontinuing Sedans,"Automakers are constantly adjusting their lineups to suit not only broader market conditions but the changing tastes of their customers as well and that includes GM. That being said GM Authority is regularly bombarded by comments and emails from readers that complain GM has dropped nearly all of its passenger cars from its North American portfolio. The thing is GM isn’t alone in this respect.

First things first – it is absolutely true that over the past several years GM has drastically reduced the number of sedans coupes hatchbacks wagons and convertibles it offers in the North American market. In fact the only sedans that GM currently offers in North America are the Chevy Malibu Cadillac CT4 and Cadillac CT5 while the only coupes and convertibles left are the Chevy Camaro and Chevy Corvette.

So yes there is truth behind the complaints that GM has skewed its lineup towards crossovers pickup trucks and utilities. But what about the other automakers?

To answer that we compiled the following list of sedans coupes hatchbacks wagons and convertibles discontinued in North America since 2016 including GM models. Check it out right here:

Looking over the list we find GM is far from the only automaker cutting out sedans coupes hatchbacks wagons and convertibles from its North American lineup. Indeed pretty much every major automaker is doing the exact same thing including Ford Honda Hyundai Infiniti Mercedes Toyota Mazda Kia BMW Volkswagen Stellantis and others.

To complicate the issue GM is currently making a pivot to an all-electric vehicle lineup with 30 new EVs slated to launch worldwide by 2030. Critically however GM isn’t completely abandoning any and all segments beyond crossovers pickup trucks and utility vehicles even in the move to EVs.

One of the most obvious examples is the upcoming Cadillac Celestiq framed as the luxury marque’s new ultra-premium four-door sedan model stuffed to the brim with top-shelf features and cutting-edge technology. Another example (at least potentially) is the rumored all-electric Corvette sedan.

To sum up although sedans coupes hatchbacks wagons and convertibles are certainly not the segments du jour the cyclical nature of the auto industry and customer tastes in general mean these segments are definitely not gone forever. All it takes is interest from buyers as expressed in sales. It really is that simple.

It was March 2020—the beginning of the pandemic—and so he called a government help line. He was told that he might have the coronavirus and that he should stay home. But without leaving the house for a test Hernández couldn’t get proof of his illness—and without that proof he had no excuse for not coming into work. A week after he got sick he said his company fired him. (The firm cited “insufficient” job performance as the motive.)

Alone and newly jobless during lockdown Hernández who was thirty-two at the time considered his life. He was an engineer with expertise in the automotive industry so finding a new position wouldn’t be difficult. But he didn’t want just any new job. He wanted to work for a company that treated workers decently. His girlfriend who lived in the Basque region of northern Spain suggested that he consider a position within a group of worker-owned coöperatives there called Mondragon.

The Mondragon Corporation as it’s known is a voluntary association of ninety-five autonomous coöperatives that differs radically from a conventional company. Each co-op’s highest-paid executive makes at most six times the salary of its lowest-paid employee. There are no outside shareholders; instead after a temporary contract new workers who have proved themselves may become member-owners of their co-ops. A managing director acts as a kind of C.E.O. within each co-op but the members themselves vote on many vital decisions about strategy salaries and policy and the votes of all members whether they are senior management or blue-collar count equally.

When individual coöperatives do well their members share in the profits. When times are hard the coöperatives collectively support one another sharing funds and reallocating workers among themselves to preserve jobs. During the pandemic workers at many Mondragon co-ops voted to temporarily reduce their own salaries or hours until markets recovered; people who felt sick were trusted and encouraged to stay home. The treatment Hernández said he received when he was fired would be almost impossible within Mondragon since worker-owners must vote to dismiss one another and this can occur only in cases of very severe misconduct.

Worker-owned coöperatives are often considered both idealistic and inefficient; the model is seen as suitable mainly for upscale grocery stores or boutique bakeries in progressive towns. At a 2019 conference the economist Larry Summers characterized co-ops as intrinsically sleepy and short-sighted. “When you put workers in charge of firms and you give them substantial control over the firms” he said “the one thing you do not get is expansion. You get more for the people who are already there.” And yet Mondragon is not a sleepy grocery store. Its collection of co-ops employs around eighty thousand people and seventy-six per cent of those who work in manufacturing co-ops are owners. One makes bicycles at an industrial scale; others make elevators or produce huge industrial machines used in the production of jet engines rockets and wind turbines. Mondragon’s businesses include schools a large grocery chain a catering company fourteen technology R. & D. centers and a McKinsey-like consulting firm. In 2021 the network brought in more than eleven billion euros in revenue. The collective enforces five hundred and five types of patents and employs about twenty-four hundred full-time researchers. It also owns subsidiaries in countries including China Germany and Mexico and competes effectively in international markets winning contracts from firms such as General Electric and Blue Origin. The odds are good that key elements of something within a hundred feet of you—an espresso maker a gas grill a car—were made at Mondragon.

“We are a kind of mirror for conventional companies and in it they do not see a very beautiful image” Ander Etxeberria Mondragon’s director of coöperative dissemination told me as we drove between co-ops in the Basque country. A slender affable man who speaks many languages Etxeberria is essentially a professional explainer of Mondragon to its roughly two thousand annual visitors. It was a warm spring afternoon and he rolled down the windows and gestured to the passing countryside as we drove. A flock of sheep clustered on a hillside above the squat rectangular headquarters of a precision-machine-tooling co-op. We passed a bank a language-instruction school a grocery store a factory—each owned by its workers.

Mondragon’s network of co-ops many clustered along Spain’s Deba River has managed to survive nearly seventy years of capitalism’s creative destruction. Its persistence suggests that there are fairer and more sustainable ways of doing business. But whether a version of its model could be replicated outside of one beautiful region of northern Spain is an open question debated within Mondragon and beyond. The collective has a unique history and its density powers a rare feedback loop in which coöperative values shape institutions which then reinforce the same values spiralling outward to define an entire way of life. Mondragon is an inspiring and successful experiment. Will it ever be repeated?

The town of Mondragón in a green river valley surrounded by the Cantabrian mountains is home to some twenty-two thousand people. A medieval city occupies the town center with stone archways that soar over cobbled streets and a medieval Gothic church in a central square. The remains of José María Arizmendiarrieta the Catholic priest who founded the Mondragon coöperatives are buried inside.

Born in 1915 Arizmendiarrieta lost an eye in a childhood accident; mobilized during the Spanish Civil War but unable to take part in the fighting he still served as a Basque-language journalist for a publication opposed to the Nationalists led by Franco. He was arrested by Franco’s forces and spent a month in prison before being released. After the war he became a priest and was assigned by the Church to the town of Mondragón in 1941 when he was twenty-five.

He found that the area’s economy was deeply impoverished with virtually no middle class and that its society had been fractured by civil war. He mobilized citizens to launch civic and cultural initiatives including a soccer field a medical clinic and a housing complex for workers. Since the early twentieth century a locksmithing factory in Mondragón had been employing local boys who sometimes started at the age of fourteen clocked fifty-hour weeks and had few prospects without further education. Upon arrival Arizmendiarrieta began using the local Catholic Action center to educate young workers through study circles which met in a converted seventeenth-century palace. In 1943 Arizmendiarrieta created a technical school; students there worked at the factory in the morning and attended classes in the afternoon. Eventually he selected a group of promising workers who in the evenings began pursuing long-distance degrees in engineering. By 1956 five members who had finished their degrees left their factory jobs to launch a coöperative company that produced kerosene heaters. More industrial co-ops began appearing throughout the valley drawing workers from the technical school and collaborating with one another to share expertise. Thus was born the Mondragon experiment.

The growth of the co-ops followed a pattern. An obstacle would confront local workers and a new co-op would be created to overcome it. When in 1958 the Spanish Ministry of Labor excluded the new worker-owners from the national social-security system arguing that they were not eligible for workers’ benefits because they were also part-owners Arizmendiarrieta created an internal pension and health-care system that was itself organized as a coöperative; it still exists today supplying sick leave parental leave a generous pension unemployment benefits and medical insurance to Mondragon’s worker-owners. (The Spanish government has long since revised its position and provides coverage for co-op members in addition to that offered by Mondragon.) To meet the need for affordable financing Arizmendiarrieta organized a coöperative bank.

On my first afternoon in Mondragón Etxeberria and I walked into the dark interior of the church beside the central square. I could hear a choir rehearsing a hymn. Etxeberria pointed to the tomb of Arizmendiarrieta on one side of the central aisle. A stack of pamphlets lay beside it and I took one; it was part of a campaign to canonize the priest whom it described as “the apostle of coöperation.”

I stood for a while absorbing the atmosphere. (The Mondragon Corporation has no official position on the canonization campaign but Arizmendiarrieta is venerated even among the secular.) I saw that the pamphlet included a suggested prayer to Arizmendiarrieta and information on whom to contact if it were answered. I walked back out into the sun.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiP2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZ0LmNvbS9jb250ZW50LzY3OGJjMjM2LTkwMDgtNDg1Ny04OGIzLWI3Yzg3NWI3Zjk2NdIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,McKinsey Bain and BCG lift pay as talent war heats up,"Try unlimited access Only MX$100 for 4 weeks

The case could set a precedent for holding polluters accountable for harm to the planet.

THE CORDILLERA BLANCA Peru — Once this was where Saúl Luciano Lliuya came to find peace. The mountain’s pristine beauty ensured his livelihood as a guide; its steady stream of fresh water sustained his family farm. The everlasting ice that gleamed from its rugged crest spoke of a world in balance.

But on this May morning Luciano Lliuya surveyed Nevado Palcaraju with his eyes narrowed his forehead creased. The glacier was almost gone transformed by rising temperatures from solid ice into a large unstable lagoon. At any moment an avalanche or rockslide could cause the turquoise meltwater to surge over its banks hurtle down the mountainside and deluge the city of Huaraz where he and some 120000 others lived.

“Muy pensativo” Luciano Lliuya described his mood in Spanish. Overthinking. Under pressure.

For seven years Luciano Lliuya has waged a lawsuit against the German energy company RWE — part of a growing cohort of activists who have turned to the courts for climate justice as political solutions remain out of reach.

Citing scientific studies that link pollution from power plants to the retreat of Palcaraju’s glacier Luciano Lliuya argues that the energy giant should help pay for measures to prevent a catastrophic flood. The company’s lawyers counter that all of its operations were legal and that the link between greenhouse gas emissions and climate impacts is too complex for any single entity to be held responsible.

Now the court had come to Peru to collect on-the-ground evidence — a global first for any climate case.

In the next few days a cadre of German judges and technical experts would walk the streets of Huaraz and view the homes that could be inundated. They would ascend the rutted road to Palcaraju examining the glacier from the very spot where Luciano Lliuya stood.

If the judges saw this place the way he saw it if they were convinced by Luciano Lliuya’s claims it would mark a breakthrough in the burgeoning realm of climate litigation. Success in Huaraz would mean that major polluters anywhere may be liable for the increasingly disastrous consequences of greenhouse gas emissions experts say. It could pave the way for more lawsuits from developing nations that did little to cause climate change but are bearing the brunt of its impacts. It might force rich countries and giant corporations to reconsider the risks of relying on fossil fuels and empower those on the front lines of warming to seek restitution for what they have lost.

Luciano Lliuya looked again across the water where the remains of Palcaraju glacier still clung to the cliffs above the lagoon. So much depended on that precarious balance: His livelihood. His home. Possibly even the planet.

Then there was a low rumble and a puff of white billowed from the top of the glacier — an avalanche. It was minor not powerful enough to even ruffle the surface of the lake. But the worry in Luciano Lliuya’s eyes deepened.

“Vámonos” he said. “Let’s go.”

“If I imagine that the mountain is a person and it felt like it was being affected it would also go to court make these demands.” Saúl Luciano Lliuya plaintiff in lawsuit against RWE

‘A flood that destroys everything’

In the cooler climate of a bygone era the Palcaraju glacier resembled a river of ice. It flowed inexorably from the mountain’s crest gouging a bowl-shaped basin out of the rock and pushing debris into a rubble pile called a moraine.

But as the planet warms the glacier is retreating. A vast lake dubbed Palcacocha has formed in the empty basin. The moraine acts as a dam stopping the water from spilling into the valley below.

For now.

An avalanche could touch off a disaster according to a 2016 study that modeled how a glacial lake outburst flood at Laguna Palcacocha might unfold.

Rock and ice would tumble from the deteriorating glacier and weakened mountain slope falling hundreds of feet before plunging into the deepest part of the lagoon.

The impact would send a massive wave rolling toward the opposite shore. As it reached shallower waters the wave would grow taller much the way a tsunami gets bigger as it approaches a beach.

By the time it crossed the lagoon the wave from a large avalanche would loom 70 feet above the top of the moraine. Nearly 2 million cubic meters of water would go crashing down the mountainside. Soil boulders and even trees would get mixed up in the flood adding to its tremendous force. Within an hour the torrent would arrive at the outskirts of Huaraz.

Some 50000 people including Luciano Lliuya live in the high hazard zone on the banks of the Quilcay River. Here the inundation would be intense enough to demolish the small brick and adobe homes.

“We are speaking about a flood that destroys everything” said Cesar Portocarrero 75 a civil engineer from Huaraz who contributed to the 2016 study. “Not only inundates. Not only covers with water. It destroys everything in its path.”

A newly installed early warning system at the lagoon should set off sirens around the city giving people about 20 minutes to evacuate. Anyone who doesn’t escape before the deluge hits would be unlikely to survive.

Those who make their homes near the Cordillera Blanca the ice-capped “white range” that looms above Huaraz have always recognized this risk. To dwell in the shadow of Peru’s tallest mountains is to live with the possibility of disaster. The region boasts Earth’s largest concentration of tropical glaciers — high-altitude ice masses that are unpredictable at the best of times but have become increasingly fragile as the planet warms.

In 1941 a glacial lake outburst flood from Palcacocha killed an estimated 1800 people — about one third of Huaraz’s residents at the time. Survivors recall seeing trees slam into houses like battering rams blasting holes in walls of brick and stone. The path of destruction extended all the way to the coast 100 miles away.

A few years later a flood above the nearby archaeological site of Chavín de Huántar killed 500 people and demolished millennia-old artifacts. Then another outburst wiped out a newly built hydroelectric station. In 1970 an earthquake destabilized the glacier on Peru’s tallest mountain unleashing an avalanche that engulfed the entire city of Yungay. Some 20000 people were buried. Just 400 residents survived.

FROM TOP: (The Washington Post) Those who make their homes near the Cordillera Blanca the ice-capped “white range” that looms above Huaraz have always recognized the risk of living there. Huaraz is home to about 120000 people. The Nueva Florida neighborhood in Huaraz runs a high risk of flooding because of its proximity to the Quilcay River.

The crises helped push Peru’s government to establish a federal glaciology unit that would shore up the country’s most dangerous glacial lakes.

“We were the pioneers in the world” said Portocarrero a former director of the unit who helped build the security system at Laguna Palcacocha in 1973.

Portocarrero described how workers dug drainage channels to empty some of the water from the lagoon and bolstered the moraine with two 20-foot-high stone-covered dams. By creating about 25 feet of “freeboard” between the water surface and the top of the dam the measures reduced the chance of an overflow.

As decades passed without another deadly outburst disasters like the 1941 flood faded into distant memory. In 1996 during a period of “decentralization” Peru disbanded its federal glaciology unit. Its responsibilities were shifted to the regional governments though they rarely had the resources or expertise to address dangerous lakes.

At the time few in Huaraz worried about the change. They believed that Palcacocha was already under control. They thought they were safe.

“If the lake bursts it will destroy the city. It would kill many people and the economy will go down. The threat is real. It’s real.” Cesar Portocarrero civil engineer

Loss and damage

In 2009 scientists working on a new underwater map of Laguna Palcacocha made a terrifying discovery: Since the security system was first installed the lake had swelled to 34 times its former volume. It was now even bigger than it had been before the 1941 disaster.

Although the drainage system prevented the water level from rising too high the glacier’s retreat allowed the lagoon to become much longer creating potential runway for a massive wave. If a major avalanche occurred the dams would not be able to hold back the swollen lake.

Source: Landsat satellite imagery via Sentinel Hub Today there’s enough water in the lake to fill 800 Olympic-size swimming pools. An avalanche could send a massive wave hurtling toward the city of Huaraz 15 miles downstream.

Peru’s president declared a state of emergency at the lagoon. The regional government built several large plastic pipes to siphon off extra water lowering the surface level by less than 15 feet. Official “guardians” were paid to live on the mountain and monitor the lake around the clock and an early warning system was installed to enable evacuations of the communities below. A new road — rugged but navigable — allowed for more frequent checks on the growing hazard.

Luciano Lliuya was not assuaged.

His neighborhood Nueva Florida had been wrecked during the 1941 flood. Afterward officials wanted to prevent people from rebuilding there arguing it was unsafe. But they could not stop a surge of impoverished settlers — including Luciano Lliuya’s parents — who came from the countryside in search of the jobs a city could provide. Now there were more people than ever living in harm’s way many of them in informal houses constructed without regard for building codes.

Living in Huaraz allowed Luciano Lliuya to attend school and enroll in a rigorous training program to become a certified mountain guide. It meant he could earn enough to send his son to college and renovate the house his parents had constructed.

But at any moment Luciano Lliuya knew another flood could hit obliterating the life he’d built.

Luciano Lliuya was just as anxious about the slow-motion disasters of heat and drought which threatened his guiding business and the small family farm where he still cultivated corn potatoes and wheat. The shimmering ice that gave the Cordillera Blanca its name grew more unstable with each passing season. The land that had yielded an abundant harvest for his parents was becoming parched and meager.

“I am really worried” he said. “As a guide as a farmer and as a citizen.”

Portocarrero shared Luciano Lliuya’s concerns. In 2016 the engineer came out of retirement to help draft a proposal to partially drain the Palcacocha lagoon. For about $4 million he said officials could reinforce the dam lower the lake level by an additional 65 feet and redirect the water into a secure reservoir that would supply the area’s people and farms. Studies showed that the project would curb the risk of an outburst and almost halve the size of the high-hazard zone if a flood did occur.

But officials in the Ancash regional government said they didn’t have the funds for such an ambitious project. Melvin Grimaldo Rodriguez Minchola its director of natural resources and environmental management detailed the area’s many other problems: A struggling economy deteriorating roads poor and ailing citizens. Not to mention the climate-induced crises of drought forest loss and at least 50 other potentially dangerous glacial lakes in the Cordillera Blanca.

“We have just a few resources to deal with all these challenges” Rodriguez Minchola said in a recent interview at his office in Huaraz. “We are handling [the flood risk] as best we can.”

Portocarrero questioned that claim. Ancash’s gold copper and zinc mines make it one of Peru’s wealthiest regions. The government could invest in the project if it wanted he said — but corruption dysfunction and decentralization have gotten in the way.

Yet he and Rodriguez Minchola agreed on one thing: It seemed fundamentally unfair that those least responsible for the climate crisis were forced to cope with its worst impacts on their own.

Peru contributed less than 0.4 percent of the world’s greenhouse gas emissions in 2019 yet it consistently ranks among the nations at high risk from climate damages. The country’s glaciers have lost about half of their surface area in the last half century. Tens of thousands of people have been displaced by extreme rainfall amplified by warming. Rising temperatures have brought agricultural pests to ever higher elevations imperiling crops that rural communities need to survive.

And because countries like Peru didn’t become rich from burning fossil fuels over the last 150 years they have few resources to cope with the dangers they now face. They struggle to implement measures such as the Palcacocha drainage project that could save lives and livelihoods. If tragedy does occur — a drought destroys an entire year’s harvest a flood devastates a city — they are less able to recover.

At international climate talks low-income countries have sought help for adaptation and “loss and damage” — the unavoidable irreversible harms caused by climate change — even as they push major emitters to curb their pollution.

It’s been an uphill battle on all fronts. Money available through U.N.-administered funds which depend on donations is dwarfed by the scale of developing nations’ need. Wealthy countries including the United States have resisted any kind of financial commitment to assist with loss and damage worried that it would imply legal liability for climate change’s escalating toll.

Meanwhile global emissions keep rising and the impacts only grow worse.

Luciano Lliuya often wondered if those responsible for warming the planet would ever be held accountable for the consequences. The big emitters had all the wealth and power while the people suffering the most from climate disasters possessed only the moral high ground.

“Imagine the Peruvian government making demands of Germany” he said. “That would be so crazy.”

And a single Peruvian trying to demand change? That would be even more crazy he said. Practically impossible.

“We don’t care about the money that the case of Luciano Lliuya could earn. What we care most is about stopping the climate change. Because that is what causes the most damage.” Melvin Grimaldo Rodriguez Minchola director of natural resources and environmental management for the department of Ancash

‘Justice heard the mountains crying’

A group of German strangers sat in Luciano Lliuya’s kitchen eating a meal of home-cooked guinea pig and homegrown potatoes asking him to contemplate the impossible.

It was December 2014. In the wake of a lackluster U.N. climate summit in Lima activists from the environmental nonprofit Germanwatch had traveled to the Cordillera Blanca in hopes of witnessing the effects of global warming firsthand.

A colleague introduced them to Luciano Lliuya and it quickly became clear he was the kind of man they were looking for.

For several years Germanwatch policy director Christoph Bals had been contemplating filing a nuisance claim on behalf of a climate change victim — the same kind of lawsuit a homeowner might file if his neighbor’s tree fell on his house. The tactic had been tried before without much success. But an emerging field of research known as “attribution science” was helping pinpoint exactly how human greenhouse gas emissions contributed to specific climate disasters providing a whole new kind of evidence. With the right plaintiff Bals thought perhaps their case could set a precedent for using attribution studies to hold polluters accountable.

Bals was deeply impressed by Luciano Lliuya — his humility and moral clarity his commitment to protecting his home. And the attribution research linking the threat from Palcacocha to planet-warming pollution was strong.

Luciano Lliuya wasn’t so certain. A lawsuit would require years of effort and long stretches of time away from his family. It would invite the scrutiny of politicians journalists and lawyers. Was he ready for all that travel and attention? And even if he was would a German court care about the concerns of a man from half a world away?

But then Luciano Lliuya thought about the mountains he loved. If those peaks were people he reflected surely they would want to defend themselves. If they could speak they would ask the world act.

This was an opportunity to tell the mountains’ story he told himself. “To do nothing would be irresponsible.”

Finally Luciano Lliuya spoke. “Claro” he said. “Sure.”

Bals was thrilled. “We’re going to court!”

To represent Luciano Lliuya Germanwatch tapped Roda Verheyen a prominent environmental lawyer. Then the group had to choose a target for the lawsuit — an entity that had benefited from burning fossil fuels but was not paying for the consequences.

It consulted an analysis tracing the majority of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere back to 90 fossil fuel energy and cement producers dubbed “the carbon majors.” RWE was among the top investor-owned companies on the list its mines and power stations responsible for 0.47 percent of all emissions produced by people in the industrial era.

Suing RWE also meant the case would unfold in German courts. While almost all legal systems allow a homeowner to sue his neighbors if their behavior harms his property German judges have interpreted this rule especially broadly defining a “neighborhood” to extend as far as potential harm can reach.

In the context of greenhouse gas pollution Verheyen planned to argue RWE’s “neighborhood” encompassed the whole world.

In November 2015 Luciano Lliuya filed his claim with the district court of Essen home to RWE headquarters. The demand was modest: The lawsuit asked the firm to pay roughly $20000 about 0.47 percent of the cost of the Palcacocha drainage project — commensurate with the company’s contribution to global emissions.

But its true ambitions were much more sweeping Verheyen explained. If major emitters begin to fear that they will be held liable for climate damages anywhere in the world she said they may adopt more sustainable practices rather than face an onslaught of lawsuits. Similarly wealthy countries may be more willing to pay for adaptation and loss and damage if the alternative meant fighting in court.

“When you must actually take responsibility for your [past] actions” she said “you will also change what you do right now.”

The stakes for RWE and other “carbon majors” were made clear when a judge suggested that the company might settle the case out of court. The company’s lawyers rejected the proposal saying it was a matter of precedent.

Instead RWE has sought to have Luciano Lliuya’s claim dismissed.

“It is still our position individual emitters cannot be held liable for universally rooted and globally effective processes like climate change” RWE media relations manager Regina Wolter said in a statement. She pointed out that RWE has already committed to become carbon neutral by 2040 and has invested billions in renewable energy development.

Citing a report from the U.N. Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change a 2016 filing from the company also alleges that “climate change is not caused by humans alone.”

In fact the IPCC report stated that “human influence on the climate system is clear” and greenhouse gas emissions are “extremely likely to have been the dominant cause of the observed warming since the mid-20th century.” In a more recent report the panel stated “unequivocally” that humans are fueling climate change.

The district court in Essen at first sided with RWE ruling that Luciano Lliuya’s claim was invalid because he couldn’t prove that the company’s emissions had directly contributed to the threat from Laguna Palcacocha. Luciano Lliuya’s team appealed and the case came before a three-judge panel in the upper state court of Hamm.

Verheyen recalled sitting in the courtroom in November 2017 heart racing as she awaited the judges’ ruling.

The case would move forward into the evidence-collecting phase the panel decided. The next step was to determine whether Luciano Lliuya’s property was truly in danger whether that threat could be traced to greenhouse gas emissions and what fraction of planet-warming pollution RWE was responsible for.

Verheyen looked over at Luciano Lliuya who listened uncomprehending to the slew of German words. “Todo va bien todo va bien” she reassured him in Spanish. “It’s all going well.”

Only after they left the courtroom could Verheyen fully explain the significance of what had happened: In accepting Luciano Lliuya’s case the court had embraced the argument that major greenhouse gas emitters can be held liable for the consequences of global warming. Even if the evidentiary phase didn’t go as hoped a new precedent had been set one that could lead to other lawsuits from climate change victims across the globe.

Luciano Lliuya smiled.

“The lakes are the tears of the mountains” he said. “Today justice heard the mountains crying.”

“Working here I never sleep. I need to make a report every two hours. I control the siphons and monitor the water levels. If an emergency happened I would run to the radio station and I would notify the city.” Efrain Reyes lake guardian

A new precedent

The shores of Laguna Palcacocha were swarming with people — judges lawyers scientists politicians — the sounds of the wind and water drowned out by the babble of multiple languages and the buzz of a drone.

Luciano Lliuya never imagined the case would come this far. First his legal team and RWE’s couldn’t agree on experts to assess the evidence so the court had to appoint its own. Then the coronavirus pandemic prevented anyone from traveling to Peru.

Now the court was finally here and Luciano Lliuya was exhausted. Every day he bounced between hearings and interviews. The near-constant conversation left his mind weary and his throat parched. Camera crews trailed him around Huaraz while children shouted at journalists from their windows “Periodista periodista interview me!”

Germanwatch policy director Christoph Bals says he was deeply impressed by Luciano Lliuya's humility moral clarity and commitment to protecting his home.

Meanwhile his neighbors resented the attention he’d brought to Nueva Florida. Who was he they asked to call their homes unsafe?

Luciano Lliuya craved the soothing silence of having this mountaintop all to himself.

And he worried about what was to come. “How will the company react if we win?” he asked. “It’s a huge company. ... I think they may not be happy.”

RWE could still appeal a decision in Luciano Lliuya’s favor. That would mean more travel more courtrooms more interviews. Even if the company was forced to pay there was no guarantee that the enhanced security system at Palcacocha would ever get built.

But as he watched the crowd survey the landscape he knew so well another emotion bloomed in Luciano Lliuya’s chest: Pride.

“I brought all those people from abroad to show them what’s really happening here — the risk and the glacier retreat” he said. “They have the information and the evidence to understand the problem. And maybe they will change their minds.”

It would be many months before the court-appointed experts completed their assessment of the threat to Huaraz. The judges in Hamm aren’t expected to make a ruling until at least 2023.

Yet Luciano Lliuya felt his case was strong and continues to get stronger. An attribution study published in the journal Nature Geoscience in 2021 found that the Palcaraju glacier’s retreat and Laguna Palcacocha’s resulting expansion would be virtually impossible in a world without climate change. The imminent threat to Huaraz is a “direct consequence” of human-caused warming the authors wrote.

The outlook for climate litigation was also shifting. Since Luciano Lliuya first filed his claim more than 2000 other climate lawsuits have been launched against companies and governments around the world according to an analysis by the Grantham Institute for Climate Change and the Environment at Imperial College London. Of the cases that have been decided more than half led to positive outcomes for climate. Last year alone a Dutch court ruled that the oil giant Shell had to dramatically boost its climate commitments the French state was convicted of failing to curb greenhouse gases and the German Supreme Court decided that the country was constitutionally obligated to “do its part” to avoid catastrophic warming.

“These precedents build on one another” said Carol Muffett president of the Washington-based Center for International Environmental Law. “Each progressive decision brings us one step closer to accountability.”

If other climate change victims draw on this precedent to file their own lawsuits “that’s when Saúl Luciano Lliuya’s story becomes truly important” Muffett continued. “He is one man from one community in a remote part of Peru. But his story is like a billion other stories on this planet.”

Even in Huaraz it seemed that change was underway. That spring the Ancash Regional Government issued a statement in support of Luciano Lliuya’s lawsuit. His picture was splashed across the front page of the local newspaper.

Luciana Olaza La Rosa a nature-loving 16-year-old who had once taken an English class with Luciano Lliuya was astonished to see someone she knew at the center of a globally important case.

“I didn’t know people like him could do these kinds of judgments” she said. “I only thought like big companies can fight with other companies about these issues.”

If her soft-spoken former classmate could take a major corporation to court the teenager thought what could she do? Could she convince her school to reduce its emissions? Could she combat trash on the mountain biking paths where she rode every weekend? Could she make a difference in Huaraz in Peru in the world?

“It gives me I think power or something like that” Olaza La Rosa said. “It gives me the power of saying ‘You too having only 16 years you can do big things if you want.’ ”

“These landscapes have a really important meaning for us and for our family for all our history here. We want to protect these areas because it’s our home.” Luciana Olaza la Rosa 16-year-old environmental advocate

Witness

Luciano Lliuya stood at his farm amid the mountains pulling up the stalks of dried-out corn. Occasionally he lifted a stalk to his mouth peeled it with his teeth and sucked the sweet rich juice from its marrow.

The air was thick with the scents of grass and mint and manure. A creek burbled insects sang.

FROM TOP: Dogs roam a Huaraz street on May 26. Luciano Lliuya's farm includes chickens. A decorative horseshoe outside the house. Tranquility is a thing of the past for Luciano Lliuya. He pours himself a cup of tea at his home.

Then Luciano Lliuya’s phone buzzed reminding him that a camera crew was on its way.

He had come to terms with his loss of tranquility. “I believe I am like a witness” he said. “Because I see the mountains and what’s happening to them. And I share what is going on.”

What other choice was there? If the world remains on its current warming track the glaciers of the Cordillera Blanca will disappear by the end of the century.

The Jackson Hole central banking conference in the US is likely to be another venue to witness the economically unsustainable international currency system centered on the US dollar Chinese analysts noted on Friday as the market kept a close eye on the meeting to gauge upcoming Fed decisions while countries around the world increasingly look for substitutes for the failing system.Whatever the results of the meeting US monetary policy moves implemented in the remaining months of 2022 will largely be unable to boost the US real economy or steer the country away from a looming economic crisis Chinese analysts pointed out while other countries will increasingly look for a solution from China which is increasingly similar to the US in terms of economic size but offers more stability in its relations with the world.Investors will be keen on hearing and gauging how the Fed is going to deal with record high inflation in the US with more interest rate hikes while not deflating the US economy which many believe is on the verge of a recession Chinese analysts said.However the Fed's decisions will have little impact on China's monetary policy despite the recent formation of a strong dollar trend that is pushing the yuan down a weakening channel.The euro fell to a 20-year low against the US dollar this week and the yuan weakened to its lowest level in two years.Lian Ping head of the Zhixin Investment Research Institute told the Global Times that the People's Bank of China (PBC) recently made clear its determination to pursue a pro-growth track when it lowered the loan prime rate the market-based benchmark lending rate on Monday.Lian said that US rate hikes have sent the dollar on an upward track which is projected to peak in the early fourth quarter and the yuan will remain under depreciation pressure from the strengthening dollar probably briefly weakening beyond 7 yuan per dollar during the second half of the year.However the yuan will be the most stable major currency amid the dollar's general strengthening trend underpinned by China's solid economic fundamentals its sizable international payments surplus and its strong trade and investment performances.With its perceived stability the yuan will not fluctuate wildly and will likely move in the 1:6-7 range against the US dollar for most of the rest of the year Lian said.Since the start of the year under the influence of multiple factors such as the Fed's interest rate hikes and geopolitical conflicts the main trend in global currency markets has been the strengthening of the US dollar and the weakening of major non-US currencies.Against this background the yuan has depreciated against the dollar but the Chinese currency has been relatively strong compared with other currencies according to the Economic Daily on Friday.In the first half of the year the yuan depreciated by 5 percent against US dollar but it appreciated against the euro by 3 percent the pound by 5.8 percent and the yen by 12.8 percent.From 2005 when the yuan's exchange rate formation mechanism was reformed through this June the yuan's exchange rate against the US dollar had appreciated by 23.3 percent with an appreciation of 42.9 percent against the euro and 48.7 percent against the yen the newspaper reported.The State Administration of Foreign Exchange (SAFE) said on Thursday that China's foreign exchange market is generally stable with banks reporting a net foreign exchange settlement surplus in August.China's merchandise trade maintained a relatively high surplus and its actual use of foreign direct investment continued to grow the SAFE said adding that the overall net purchase of Chinese securities by foreign investors in August reflected the long-term investment value of yuan-denominated assets.The US Federal Reserve's sizable interest rate hikes have forced many countries to cope by announcing their own rate hikes amid a wave of global inflation. Many countries also face rising financial risks as hot money flows outs and back to the US.However such hikes won't be a cure for the woes of the US economy even if it means that the US can reap benefits from other countries Chinese analysts said noting that the US' abuse of the dollar's dominance is causing an increasing reaction.Li Xunlei chief economist at Zhongtai Securities told the Global Times on Friday that it's quite probable the US is sliding into a recession no matter what pace Fed officials follow in their rate decisions.""It is quite certain that a contraction will be seen in the second half of the year despite signs that US inflation may have reached a plateau in August"" Li said. ""The taming of US inflation will be a very slow process with the issues of food prices oil prices and the pandemic prevailing.""Mei Xinyu a research fellow with the Chinese Academy of International Trade and Economic Cooperation under the Ministry of Commerce told the Global Times that whatever policy the Fed chooses it's unlikely to bolster the US' real economy. Looking at the bigger picture the dollar-based international currency system is becoming increasingly inappropriate and flawed.The dollar's status as the world's currency was based on the US' once-paramount economic productivity. Yet Mei pointed out that the Fed's quantitative easing policy in recent years has fundamentally decimated the US manufacturing sector's competitiveness and it thus undercut the dollar system.The US' wanton sanctions against other countries have accelerated the fall of the US dollar-based system Mei said.The sudden tightening after years of easing along with the large role of the virtual economy in the US economy is very likely to cause a financial crisis Mei said.The world would have no choice in the face of the US' wanton irresponsibility were there another similar economy Mei said but luckily this is not the case today.Steven Barnett senior resident representative of IMF in China said on Thursday that China is already the world's largest economy in terms of purchasing power parity according to domestic news portal thepaper.cn.Globally countries are increasingly looking for alternatives to the dollar.BRICS International Forum President Purnima Anand said on Thursday that Russia and India don't need the US dollar in trade having turned to national currencies to conduct mutual settlements according to Russian news outlet rt.com.""We have implemented the mechanism of mutual settlements in rubles and rupees and there is no need for our countries to use the dollar in mutual settlements. A similar mechanism of mutual settlements in rubles and yuan is being developed by China"" Anand said.The share of the US dollar assets in the foreign exchange reserves of global central banks a sign of the dollar's supremacy dropped to 59 percent in the fourth quarter of 2020 - a 25-year low the IMF reported last May.The share further dropped to 58.88 percent in the first quarter of 2022 IMF data showed.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1ha2V1c2VvZi5jb20vY3J5cHRvY3VycmVuY2llcy13aXRoLWFsbW9zdC16ZXJvLXRyYW5zYWN0aW9uLWZlZXMv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,12 Cryptocurrencies With Almost Zero Transaction Fees,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with ('Connection aborted.', RemoteDisconnected('Remote end closed connection without response')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1ha2V1c2VvZi5jb20vY3J5cHRvY3VycmVuY2llcy13aXRoLWFsbW9zdC16ZXJvLXRyYW5zYWN0aW9uLWZlZXMv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen"

FRIDAY NIGHT:Riley Greene's bat not enough in Tigers' rally

SHAWN WINDSOR:Swift & Grossman show why one Detroit team has hope — and the other is the Tigers

Tigers lineup

1. Riley Greene CF2. Victor Reyes LF3. Javier Báez SS4. Eric Haase DH5. Willi Castro RF6. Harold Castro 1B7. Jeimer Candelario 3B8. Tucker Barnhart C9. Zack Short 2B

Game notes: There’s the old cliché about teaching your newborn to throw a baseball left-handed and never having to worry about money and folks Dallas Keuchel is living proof.

The 2015 AL Cy Young Award winner will be starting for his third franchise in 2022 alone — he previously posted a 7.88 ERA in 32 innings and eight starts for the Chicago White Sox followed by a 9.64 ERA in 18 2/3 innings for the Arizona Diamondbacks — as he makes his debut for the squad located in his namesake metro area. (Sadly Dallas still will not be starting IN Dallas; the Rangers’ Globe Life Field is approximately 18 miles from Dallas proper.) The Rangers will be paying Keuchel a prorated share of the league minimum salary … because the ChiSox are still on the hook for his full $18 million salary this season (plus a $1.5 million buyout of his 2023 option).

The bearded 34-year-old was an effective pitcher as recently as 2020 posting a 1.99 ERA over 11 starts with the ChiSox in that abbreviated season and finishing fifth in AL Cy Young voting. But his control has since petered out as he went from 2.4 walks per nine innings in 2020 to 3.3 last year (with a 5.28 ERA for Chicago) to 4.8 this season.

Then again no team walks less this season than the Tigers with an average of 2.3 walks per game so maybe this is Keuchel’s ideal matchup. Of course there are a few Tigers with solid numbers off Keuchel: Willi Castro is 4-for-7 lifetime with a walk and a triple and Eric Haase is 6-for-13 with a homer. Keuchel won’t have to face Miguel Cabrera (who DH’ed Friday night) which is good for his walk total; Miggy is just 6-for-27 (.222) in his career but has seven walks for a .382 OBP.

[ Tigers 2023 schedule: Opening Day on March 30 at Tampa Bay Rays ]

Meanwhile the Tigers will send Eduardo Rodriguez to the mound for his second start since returning to the team from a lengthy personal absence; he allowed four hits and three walks over five scoreless innings to pick up the win Sunday against the Angels. Tonight will also be his second start in Globe Life Field; he was banged for four runs over five innings by the Rangers in May 2021 though only Charlie Culberson (2-for-3) Adolis Garcia (0-for-3) Nathaniel Lowe (1-for-4) and Nick Solak (2-for-4) remain from that game’s lineup.

The Tigers and Rangers wrap up their series at 2:35 p.m. Sunday; the Tigers have Monday off to return home to face the Seattle Mariners for three games at Comerica Park while the Rangers get an off-day before resuming their Lone Star State rivalry with the Houston Astros.

The Rangers (58-67) won their second straight game their fifth in their last seven games and started a five-game homestand by getting closer to last season’s win total of 62.

Glenn Otto (6-8) who only went five innings pitched well enough to take his second victory of August. But the Rangers’ red-hot offense — coming off a 16-4 win over Colorado on Wednesday — put him in the driver’s seat from the start.

In addition Texas is now 7-4 under interim manager Tony Beasley.

But it wasn’t an easy game to win. José Leclerc staked with a three-run lead in the ninth and seeking a save walked Jeimer Candelario to lead off the inning. After striking out Akil Baddoo for the first out he gave up a two-run home run to Riley Greene who had already singled tripled and driven in two runs to shave the lead to a run.

Victor Reyes followed that with a single to put the tying run on base. Leclerc regrouped fanning Javier Báez and Harold Castro to end it.

The Rangers homered their way to a 4-0 lead after the first two innings. After Corey Seager grounded into a double play in the bottom of the first Nathaniel Lowe followed him with a solo home run to deep left field his 21st of the season putting the Rangers up 1-0.

In the bottom of the second Leody Taveras and Mark Mathias hit back-to-back singles with one out which set up third baseman Ezequiel Duran for his fourth homer of the season a three-run shot to left that gave Texas a 4-0 lead.

After the Tigers posted two runs off Otto in the top of the third the Rangers added three more runs in the bottom half. Taveras had an RBI single to score Adolis García followed by a two-run shot by Mathias his third with the Rangers since joining the organization earlier this month the Matt Bush trade. The Rangers were up 7-2.

Mathias had a three-hit game the first of his MLB career.

“The last week or so the at-bats have been good” Rangers interim manager Tony Beasley said. “We’re grinding They’re not missing mistake pitches. Nate (Lowe) has led the charge offensively but everyone has been contributing. It’s been an onslaught from top to bottom and the bottom half of our order really came through tonight. That’s how you want it to be and we’ve had that the last five six days.”

That explosion chased off Tigers starter Tyler Alexander (3-8) after three innings. The TCU product gave up eight hits seven runs (earned) and one walk. He also struck out three.

Otto staked to a multi-run lead for most of the game gave up five hits four runs and two walks. He also struck out three. He allowed two runs in the third on RBI singles by Greene and Castro.

In the fifth he allowed two runs on an RBI triple by Greene. He hit a line drive to the right-center field gap that García failed to catch on a dive. Taveras backed him up and got the ball to Semien as Baddoo scored. Semien tried to cut down Greene at third but his throw to Duran was low got away from the rookie and Greene scores. Semien was charged with a throwing error.

Taylor Hearn and Jonathan Hernández combined for three innings of scoreless relief before handing the ball to Leclerc.

García extended his hitting streak to 22 games with a slow-rolling single down the third-base line in the third inning. He tied former Rangers catcher Jim Sundberg for the seventh-longest streak in franchise history.

The Rangers continue their three-game series with the Tigers on Saturday at 6:05 p.m. at Globe Life Field. Dallas Keuchel will make his first start with the Rangers after signing a minor-league contract last month. Kohei Arihara is the scheduled starter for Sunday’s finale.

Now she wants to do so as secretary of state.,"“There’s something incredibly powerful about the spirit of a person who wakes up every day knowing there’s a big problem in front of them but believing they can find a solution and working at it” she said in a recent interview. “I’ve always had that kind of spirit where I’m going to do the thing that people think is impossible.”

Sullivan was among them. The 48-year-old Hyde Park resident said she was raised a fighter never one to back down from a challenge — or more importantly a call to serve. That tenacity has proved to be instrumental she said in her bid for secretary of state.

When Tanisha Sullivan launched her campaign to be president of Boston’s NAACP chapter in early 2016 she never expected the political chaos that would surround her less than a year later when Donald Trump’s ascension to the White House outraged civil rights advocates and spurred them to action.

In her first major speech as NAACP president before a crowd of roughly 175000 people at the Boston Women’s March in January 2017 Sullivan demanded a bold advancement of women’s rights that left no one behind. At the same event two years later she implored the audience not to forget “the intersection and the weight of this country’s most constant and persistent foe: racism.”

“Equality and justice for women of color is a nonnegotiable” she declared at the third annual march.

It is this commitment to inclusion that has fueled her career and driven her campaign to lead an office that oversees some of government’s most central civic services such as elections and access to public records.

Sullivan isn’t seeking the position for the accolades. Rather she wants to revitalize the office by boosting voter participation and education restructuring fees for small businesses and increasing the transparency and accessibility of public information.

In doing so she is looking to unseat a 27-year incumbent William Galvin who has fended off past challenges with ease. He has the advantages of 66 percent name recognition according to one recent poll and a $2 million campaign war chest that dwarfs Sullivan’s limited resources: She had just over $160000 at the start of August.

But with her campaign Sullivan aims to position herself as a transformative newcomer able to pump life into a state office she says has grown stagnant by the dated policies of a nearly three-decade-long incumbent. If elected she would become both the first woman and first person of color to serve in the third highest office in the state.

Throughout her career as a lawyer president of the Boston NAACP and former chief equity officer of Boston Public Schools Sullivan said she’s both witnessed and practiced “the power of as I describe it proactive leadership.”

“Where we are [as a country] today is a reminder that the American democracy is young and fragile” she said. “Many of the advancements that we’ve seen on the civil rights front gender equity and LGBTQ rights have happened within the last 50 years. We are not deeply rooted and that means we cannot afford to be complacent.”

The secretary of state position she explained “became for me almost a calling.”

Michael Curry a Boston business leader and former Boston NAACP president has known Sullivan for more than two decades and attributes her drive and commitment to economic equality to her mother.

“Thelma Sullivan for many years in my growing up was on the front lines of creating opportunities and awareness around Black businesses in Boston” Curry said pointing to the elder Sullivan’s creation of The Black Pages of New England a Black business directory first released in 1990 and later reimagined by her daughter. “The fruit doesn’t fall far from the tree so [Tanisha] and I became fast friends.”

Sullivan’s father Steven — who joined Boston Public Schools in 1974 to help the department safely enforce a federal desegregation order and later went on to head the John D. O’Bryant School — was just as notable an influence. Together they raised Sullivan and her younger brother in a warm and bustling home in Brockton where the siblings were “always going going going” Sullivan said.

Sundays meant church which Sullivan credits for instilling her first love of public service: As early as 7 or 8 years old she was her mother’s eager companion stocking shelves at the food pantry or setting up for the soup kitchen.

Along the way she honed a natural ability for singing first in her church’s gospel choir and eventually at Fenway Park where the then-teenager performed the national anthem at a Red Sox game after word of her vocal talents began to spread among players whose kids she babysat in high school.

As a student she transitioned swiftly from Brockton Public School’s program for academically advanced students to the private Thayer Academy in Braintree an opportunity for which her parents made financial sacrifices in order to provide her with greater academic stimulation she said. To prove a skeptical guidance counselor wrong Sullivan applied — and was accepted to — the University of Virginia and fell in love with the campus’ diversity on visiting day.

Sullivan remembers that as a college freshman in the fall of 1992 she felt truly motivated to excel for the first time and quickly gravitated toward friends with an interest in student government. She served on the first-year judiciary committee and was later elected student body vice president and with each new opportunity felt her childhood passion for service sharpening into a love of advocacy.

Sabina Ewing a college friend who served alongside Sullivan on the first-year council jokes that Sullivan came to campus “somewhat of a fully-formed little person” more mature than many of her peers.

“Certainly there’s been an evolution but Tanisha was always a leader and someone who came in with strong values that I’ve seen remain consistent even while she’s gained more experience” Ewing said.

After graduating with a degree in government in 1996 she returned home to Massachusetts and interned briefly at the State House before fulfilling a promise to her parents to attend law school at Boston College. Inspired by her mother’s legacy as a small-business owner Sullivan pursued dual law and business degrees a decision that served her well during her first summer clerkship in corporate law.

What might have seemed like flavorless paper shuffling to many fascinated Sullivan whose first exposure to venture capital left her stunned at the sheer number of resources available to those with the right connections.

“I was introduced to this idea that there are people out there who will invest in someone else’s business to help them be successful and I had watched my mom start three businesses and there was nothing like that” she said. “And I thought maybe I need to become a corporate lawyer because what I see here I know people who could benefit from that and I want to learn and bring that back.”

So began a two-decade legal career focused on the then-emerging industry of biotechnology culminating in a job as associate general counsel for Sanofi-Genzyme in Cambridge. Along the way she volunteered regularly with the Lawyers’ Committee for Civil Rights Economic Justice Project.

Most recently Sullivan helped lead a coalition of US-based companies committed to advocating for racial justice-focused public policy following the 2020 police killing of George Floyd. It was in this role while advocating for the John Lewis Voting Rights Act before Congress that Sullivan saw the potential to push voting reform forward as the next secretary of state.

Too often in critical moments of voting rights advocacy she said Galvin has been absent from the front lines.

“I’m doing all this work around voting rights in the state and I’m seeing the governor show up I’m seeing the lieutenant governor show up I’m seeing the AG show up and I’m like ‘Where is the secretary of state? Where is he?’” she said. “That’s what caught my attention.”

Galvin has aimed in debates to paint his challenger as idealistic and uninformed about the job but Sullivan counters that the office’s ability to demand social and economic equity hasn’t been maximized. If elected she said she is the one with the game plan to activate the office to its full potential.

To encourage greater voter turnout she wants to align state elections with the presidential election cycle when research indicates voter participation is at its highest. And she sees a role for the secretary of state in shaping how cryptocurrency is regulated as well as pressing the governor’s office to lower registration fees for local businesses.

The secretary of state in addition to managing elections and access to public records also oversees financial regulations and business registrations and serves as chair of the Massachusetts Historical Commission.

Last year Amherst Town Councilor Ana Devlin Gauthier brainstormed with Sullivan in the early stages of her campaign and said she was “awe-struck” at the potential of her platform to truly transform the office. What sets Sullivan apart she said is her ability to blend vision with action.

“Every time I see her speak I’m always very aware of how ready she is for this role and how ready the role is for her” she said.

Above all Sullivan believes that serving as secretary of state is about relationship-building making the office available and accessible so residents can trust that the people sitting behind every desk are working for them.

So as her campaign nears its final days and the September primary election looms near you can find Sullivan where she has long been and promises to stay: at the park church or corner store but always in community.

BEIJING — The risk of Chinese stocks delisting from U.S. exchanges has nearly halved after regulators reached an audit agreement Goldman Sachs analysts said in a report Monday.

The China Securities Regulatory Commission and U.S. Public Company Accounting Oversight Board announced Friday that both sides signed an agreement for cooperation on inspecting the audit work papers of U.S.- listed Chinese companies. China's Ministry of Finance also signed the agreement.

""This is no doubt a regulatory breakthrough"" Goldman Sachs' Kinger Lau and a team said while cautioning that much uncertainty remains.

They pointed out the PCAOB said the deal was only a first step while the Chinese side said they would provide ""assistance"" in the inspections.

One conceptual advance was to show that the wavelength of light doesn’t actually limit the size of patterns that can be imaged if we can have multiple exposures. When the desired pattern is smaller than the wavelength. The mask does not look like the pattern but must instead become discovered by solving an inverse problem. To solve inverse problems efficiently invented an algorithm for fast incremental convolution based on the concept of fractal space-filling curves. This algorithm is as fundamental as the famous FFT which allows fast convolution.

As a visiting Assistant Professor at UC Paul invented the correct equation for processing vector data with features; for example removing noise from color images containing edges. This equation is known as “Color TV” and has many applications.

Prior when Paul was at Princeton as a Research Fellow

He invented a more realistic notion of fuzzy string matching and efficient algorithms for finding such matches. Standard fuzzy matching only allows for single-character differences. But both human-generated text and biological genes evolve by large block operations as well.

Lastly Paul received his Doctorate in Mathematics from the University of Chicago & received his AB in Math & Physics from Washington University in St. Louis.

Among them was Brijesh Goel (37) a former Goldman Sachs Group Inc. vice president and banker who was arrested on July 24 for allegedly participating in an insider trading scheme with his close friend Akshay Niranjan (33). Between 2017 and 2018 Goel tipped Niranjan on at least seven deals that resulted in approximately $290000 in illegal profits according to federal prosecutors.

Goel has been charged with four counts of securities fraud and one count of obstruction of justice each carrying a maximum term of 20 years in prison. He has been charged with conspiracy to commit securities fraud and tender offer fraud as well carrying a maximum term of five years in prison. He is currently out on a $1 million bond and cannot travel beyond New York and northern California reported Bloomberg. What is the case against them that led to charges by a US government agency?

Insider trading and manipulation

While working at Goldman Sachs Goel regularly received material nonpublic information (MNPI) about corporate merger and acquisition transactions as well as potential public offerings in which his investment bank was acting as a financial adviser. Considered to be inside information MNPI remains undisclosed to the general public because its release could affect the market value or trading price of the issuer’s securities or stocks.

From February 2017 onwards Goel misappropriated confidential information from strictly internal emails and gave Niranjan who was employed at Barclays Bank Plc the names of the potential target companies. Niranjan then used that MNPI to trade call options which are financial contracts that give the option buyer the right but not obligation to buy or sell certain stocks. The indictment against the two states that these call options would become profitable if the price of a company that was targeted for acquisition increased.

These included stocks of companies like Lumos Networks Corp. Patheon N.V. PharMerica Corporation and Calgon Carbon Corporation according to the indictment. Niranjan placed the trades in a personal brokerage account held in his brother’s name. After their acquisitions were publicly announced Niranjan sold exercised or assigned the options in the account. Niranjan and Goel then divided the profits netted from the insider trading scheme.

A close friendship

Both Goel and Niranjan had been students at different campuses of the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) before they met at the University of California’s Berkeley Haas School of Business in 2012 where they completed their master’s degrees reported Bloomberg. After graduating in 2013 they both moved to New York to pursue lucrative careers in finance.

Goel joined Goldman Sachs and rose to the ranks of vice president while Niranjan did interest-rates structuring and foreign-exchange trading at Barclays bank. For a while they lived in the same luxury high-rise building in Manhattan travelled overseas together and played squash together at local clubs.

It was at the squash court that Goel and Niranjan would typically share confidential information. According to the indictment Goel would text his friend “Did you book the court” a coded way of asking if Niranjan had purchased the stocks they had discussed.

Niranjan moved to London in June 2018 and began working at a proprietary trading firm. The two continued to be friends and in August 2021 they exchanged written communications about a loan Niranjan was supposed to make to Goel. “There was no loan and in fact the payment represented profits from the trading scheme” the prosecutors stated. The next month Niranjan sent Goel $85000 via wire transfer – the proceeds from the scheme they had plotted.

The attempted cover-up

The authorities had begun to catch up with them as the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission’s (SEC) Market Abuse (MAU) Analysis and Detection detected suspicious trading patterns.

Court documents state that on May 23 2022 Goel met Niranjan in New York in person and told him that FBI agents had approached him and questioned him about insider trading. Goel reportedly told Niranjan he had deleted certain text messages between them and suggested that Niranjan follow suit.

On June 3 the two met again. Their close friendship culminated cinematically as little did Goel know that Niranjan was secretly recording the conversation as demanded by federal prosecutors perhaps to receive a lower sentence or immunity. During the meeting Goel reportedly told Niranjan that their narratives should match so there would “not be a break in the story.”

The two met again soon where Niraranjan recorded the two discussing plans to delete evidence about insider trading. The government documents reveal that Goel asked to see his friend’s text messages to him from 2017 onwards and instructed him to delete some. “F—… This we need to delete” Goel reportedly said to Niranjan about a text message containing evidence of their scheme. “Did we put on any trade?… It has to be deleted” he said. Other than the charges of security fraud Goel has also been charged with obstruction of justice for deleting the messages and asking Niranjan to destroy evidence.

Cases such as these suggest that insider trading and other kinds of white-collar crime continue to flourish in the moneyed and enticing fields of investment and banking firms. “If everyday investors think that the market is rigged at their expense in favour of insiders who abuse their positions they are not going to invest their hard-earned money in the markets” said Gurbir S Grewal Director of the SEC’s Enforcement Division after nine people in the US were charged with insider trading in separate cases on July 25.

“But as today’s actions show we stand ready to leverage all of our expertise and tools to root out misconduct and to hold bad actors accountable no matter the industry or profession. That’s what’s required to restore investor trust and confidence” he said.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZvcmJlcy5jb20vc2l0ZXMvYnJpYW5idXNoYXJkLzIwMjIvMDgvMjcvYml0Y29pbi1kcm9wcy1iZWxvdy0yMDAwMC1hbWlkLXJlY2Vzc2lvbi1mZWFycy_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Bitcoin Drops Below $20000 Amid Recession Fears,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Max restarts limit reached for url: https://www.forbes.com/sites/brianbushard/2022/08/27/bitcoin-drops-below-20000-amid-recession-fears/ on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZvcmJlcy5jb20vc2l0ZXMvYnJpYW5idXNoYXJkLzIwMjIvMDgvMjcvYml0Y29pbi1kcm9wcy1iZWxvdy0yMDAwMC1hbWlkLXJlY2Vzc2lvbi1mZWFycy_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiiwFodHRwczovL20uZWNvbm9taWN0aW1lcy5jb20vdGVjaC90ZWNobm9sb2d5L3BheXRtLWFwcG9pbnRzLWZpbmFuY2lhbC1zZXJ2aWNlcy12ZXRlcmFuLWdzLXN1bmRhcmFyYWphbi10by1pdHMtYm9hcmQvYXJ0aWNsZXNob3cvOTM4MzI5MTMuY21z0gGPAWh0dHBzOi8vbS5lY29ub21pY3RpbWVzLmNvbS90ZWNoL3RlY2hub2xvZ3kvcGF5dG0tYXBwb2ludHMtZmluYW5jaWFsLXNlcnZpY2VzLXZldGVyYW4tZ3Mtc3VuZGFyYXJhamFuLXRvLWl0cy1ib2FyZC9hbXBfYXJ0aWNsZXNob3cvOTM4MzI5MTMuY21z?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Paytm appoints financial services veteran GS Sundararajan to its board,"It seems like you're already an ETPrime member with

Williams' family was one of hundreds who made their way to the second annual Back-to-School Extravaganza. The event was hosted by local nonprofit Angel of Edgewood to help families prepare for the school year. Families also received health care and child care resources provided by community partners.

Williams who is getting two middle schoolers and a first grader ready for their first day of classes said the extra help goes a long way given the rising costs of just about everything.

“It’s very hard but we’re handling” said Williams. With fewer COVID-19 restrictions her children are excited to go back.

“They get to have a little bit more fun with their friends not wear their masks so they feel a little bit more free” she said.

Jendayi Scott-Miller the executive director of Angel of Edgewood explained that the organization primarily serves as a food pantry.

“We want to make sure that everyone is equipped before school” she said. “That’s why we always have our event the last week of August because by this time many of the families are out of their food stamp benefits and this is a long stretch to the first second and third of the month when they’re reinstated.”

The event also included special performances for families.

“We want them to let down their hair let them know that we care about them and that we’re here all year-round not just this event” Scott-Miller said. With so many families still processing grief after losing family members during the pandemic the organization wanted to give them a space to enjoy.

“The Gifted Onez is about unity and love and uplifting the community with good vibes and energy” said performer Mikayla Maxwell.

Jennie Murrell and her multigenerational family left with book bags hand sanitizer and fresh produce.

“It went really well! The kids are excited we got all that we needed” Murrell said.

By Ronni Newton

Dog Walk 2022 will begin on Wednesday Aug. 31 with the official unleashing of the whimsical and colorful display of fiberglass dogs in West Hartford.

Each dog has been painted by a local artist and the creative designs for the combination public art display and fundraiser will be unveiled at a reveal scheduled for Aug. 31 from 4:30-6 p.m. beginning in the courtyard at Blue Back Square. WTNH’s Dennis House will emcee the celebration.

The dogs will be spread out in the courtyard of Blue Back Square as well as surrounding the Noah Webster statue on South Main Street for community viewing. The dogs will remain through Oct. 31 when the walk moves indoors to Westfarms for the duration of the holiday season.

“You can feel the excitement building throughout the entire town of West Hartford. The anticipation is palpable” said Tom Hickey CEO of 2020Media the West Hartford-based media and marketing outfit that is producing what promises to be this year’s FUNdraiser. 2020Media was also sponsor of last year’s super successful WEHA Bear Fair FUNdraiser.

While the dogs are smaller than the bears and Hickey wasn’t sure they would have the same visual impact he’s had a chance to see them while the final coat of shellac is drying and said he was amazed at how “beautiful creative  and fun” they are.

“We’re counting on the entire community to join us as we unveil the one dozen beautifully painted dogs that make up this outdoor exhibit and that will be on display at Blue Back Square throughout the fall” he said. “We know that people will be stunned by the level of creativity that has gone into creating these unique animal sculptures.”

Each of the 12 dogs is sponsored by a businesses or member of the community and they have chosen a local charitable organization to benefit from the fundraising aspect of Dog Walk 2022. While there is no cost to view the dogs each pup has a sign attached to it which includes a QR code. Visitors are encouraged to donate to any (or all) of the nonprofit beneficiaries which will receive 100% of the proceeds.

Some are able to get winning aces in life while others aren’t as lucky.

Inspiring Filipina entrepreneur Hershey Hilado proves that the circumstances we’re given no matter how tragic shouldn’t dictate our lives. Her life story reenacted by Ria Atayde in Maalaala Mo Kaya “Damit” showed us how she escaped her cruel life and transformed into one of the 2016 Top 30 under 30 Influencive Entrepreneurs and 2017 Top 80 Women2Watch.

Hershey came from a family that struggled to put food on the table day by day. Her father was a humble jeepney driver while her mother was an OFW working in Hong Kong. Despite the hardships in their life Hershey and her siblings felt loved by their father. However when it comes to their mother they only felt fear and dread. Whenever she was at home she would hurt them physically and verbally nonstop.

Sadly the horror of living with their mother every day became a reality. Their father found out their mother was cheating in Hong Kong. Not being able to accept this he decided to leave their mother and their life in Iloilo for good. He tried to bring Hershey and her older sister but Hershey’s grandfather stopped him. So Hershey’s father just promised that he would come back for them.

Hershey held on to the hope that her father would return. Unfortunately after a few years her father died before he could save them from their misery. A young Hershey felt heartbroken and hopeless but she realized she had to take matters into her own hands in keeping herself and her siblings alive. Their mother who had stopped working abroad and permanently resided in the Philippines had little to no care for them. They were starving every day and being hurt by their drug-addicted mother and her comrades. At one point Hershey resorted to shoplifting clothes to take matters into her own hands. She would sell the stolen items and use the money to feed her family.

Heartbreaking sacrifices

When Hershey was 16 she and her older sister went to Manila to find jobs under their mother’s command. They were taken to a club where they would dance and essentially sell their bodies to customers for cash. Hershey wasn’t allowed to continue because she was a minor but her sister was taken in.

It was a traumatic experience for Hershey’s older sister. Hershey was determined to find a different job so that her sister wouldn’t need to go back to the club. She tried whatever menial opening she could find but being a minor hindered her from getting accepted.

She decided to buy a fake birth certificate that would change her age on paper. Using this she found a job in a department store that was enough to support their family’s basic needs and send her sister back home to Iloilo.

While Hershey was earning little by little in Manila her mother would still meddle with her life. She had set Hershey up with a wealthy Korean man and forced her to marry him against her will. If Hershey didn’t obey her her mother would hurt her siblings.

Hershey was abused by her husband and was miserable in the marriage. She eventually escaped and sought solace from an aunt on her father’s side. While living there her aunt introduced her to the internet where she could look for jobs. As she browsed Hershey discovered dating websites too. She tried it out and met an Australian man named Scott. Seeing it as an opportunity to change her and her siblings’ life she married Scott and lived with him in Australia.

Turning her life around

While Hershey’s life with Scott was relatively comfortable she still wanted to save her siblings from their mother. She looked for jobs to earn her own money without relying on her husband. She worked as a fast food crew first. Later she took language lessons and training to level up and become a security personnel in an art gallery.

Despite making her own money already Hershey realized her passion for fashion. It became her dream to open her own clothes shop. While risky she persuaded her husband to help start it.

The clothes shop slowly flourished but this also made Hershey a busy businesswoman. She forgets to cook dinner at home and tend to her husband's needs. This angered Scott making him slowly resent supporting Hershey and her business. Sometimes he’d scream at her and make her feel small despite her success.

When Hershey’s business lost sales and eventually closed Scott laughed and mocked her. Hershey couldn’t live with someone like that and decided to leave. Scott tried to stop her by beating her up but Hershey quickly defended herself and escaped.

Making a name for herself

After leaving Scott Hershey moved around a lot and lived with friends. Soon she found stability when she landed a job at a marketing firm. Although she still didn’t let go of her dream to have a fashion business.

Hershey decided to sell online the remaining clothes she had in stock. This proved to be one of the wisest decisions in her life too because a famous Hollywood beauty guru took notice of her online shop and bought one of her clothing pieces. The beauty guru had advertised the item on her social media account so her followers quickly discovered Hershey’s shop.

In no time Hershey’s shop followers increased tremendously. Her fast-growing business boomed as she began designing and producing her own products too. After a while the Australian community commended her thriving business. Other countries such as the USA and UK were also recognizing her success.

Now a highly successful entrepreneur Hershey was able to build a home in the Philippines for her siblings. She had finally taken them away from their abusive mother so they can all live happily together. Hershey was also able to expand her growing business in the country and created more employment opportunities for Filipinos.

Inspiring lessons through powerful performances

MMK “Damit” gives hope to people wishing to break the chains and achieve more in life. Direk Dado Lumibao and the rest of the team behind this episode ensured that the story would capture the pivotal moments of Hershey’s life to get the striking messages and lifelong lessons across.

Definitely Ria’s brilliant performance as Hershey was integral to the storytelling. All the struggles emotions and pain were delivered well with her acting. She knew when to shed layers and show vulnerability as well as how to exude Hershey’s powerful determination to succeed for her brother and sisters.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiamh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmlucXVpcmVyLmNvbS9lbnRlcnRhaW5tZW50L2xhZHktZ2FnYS1jaHJvbWF0aWNhLWJhbGwtdG91ci1oZXJzaGV5LXJldmlldy1zZXRsaXN0LTIwMjIwODI4Lmh0bWzSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Review: Lady Gaga brings her over-the-top Chromatica Ball tour to Hershey,"Lady Gaga performs during her Chromatica Ball Tour at Met Life Stadium in East Rutherford N.J. on August 11. She played Hershey Park Stadium in Hershey on Sunday. Read more

Lady Gaga did not come on stage dipped in a vat of bubbling chocolate nor did she dress up as a candy bar.

That’s newsworthy because of the location of the only Pennsylvania stop on the pop superstar and high-fashion performance artist’s Chromatica Ball Tour. It played to a sold-out crowd of 30000 on Sunday just down the way from Chocolatetown Road at Hersheypark Stadium in Hershey. A Hershey Entertainment spokesperson said on Monday that it was the highest-grossing concert ever at the stadium breaking the Rolling Stones’ 2005 record.

Instead of a sweet ode de chocolat Gaga began the 2-hour 10-minute show which was divided into five sections broken up by video interludes that allowed time for transformative costume changes with a more bitter taste.

The lights dimmed on a deliriously excited crowd and a Bach fugue played. Gaga appeared atop what looked like a giant slab of concrete encased in a sarcophagus dress designed by Gareth Pugh and inspired by an outfit David Bowie wore on Saturday Night Live in 1979.

She was imprisoned — symbolically at odds with herself and the world — on a stage that was intentionally lit to look drab and gray except for flames shooting into the sky. As the evening’s musical and visual journey began the brutalist architectural design of the set Gaga has said intentionally means to force “a real savage and hard look at yourself and what you’ve been through.”

Of course it was also meant to be the first act of a celebration with the Mother Monster finally getting to lead her fans out of the pandemic darkness on a tour originally meant to happen in 2020 when her dance floor-directed Chromatica album was released.

But before we go on why was this Gaga spectacular happening in Hershey rather than the fourth-largest market in the country 100 miles to the southeast?

This is not a secondary market tour. Far from it: It’s included stops in London and Paris and is on its way to Tokyo and San Francisco. And while the crowd was plenty large in Hershey (with the traffic snarls to go with it) she’s playing bigger venues elsewhere such as MetLife Stadium in North Jersey where she drew 55000.

No official word was given as to why Philadelphia is omitted but the likely culprit is tour routing in a summer in which so many acts are making up for lost time.

To play a stadium in South Philly a stadium has to be available and the Phillies were at Citizens Bank Park on Sunday. (Next weekend they’re gone and the Red Hot Chili Peppers are there.) And what about the Linc? German metal band Rammstein are there Wednesday and their humongous fire-breathing stage takes four days to set up.

Back to the show: The songs for the Chromatica Ball’s over-the-top opening sequence — with a bleach blonde Gaga slowly being freed from her outfit with dancers gyrating around her — were early big hits from the late ‘00s: “Bad Romance” “Just Dance” and “Poker Face.”

The first conveyed what’s so powerful about Gaga’s pull which could be felt throughout the open-air horseshoe-shaped stadium. The space was filled up with a mostly female audience with significant queer representation and a wide age range dotted with fashion-forward Little Monsters in sequins heels and brightly hued hair.

Gaga is the pop diva who embraces the grotesque and strange who’s not afraid to makes herself ugly to embrace her deep dark impulses and invite everybody along for the ride imperfections and all.

She can clean up nicely and sing the Great American Songbook with Tony Bennett when she chooses to but this was not the evening for that. “I want your horror I want your disease” the singer born Stefani Joanne Angelina Germanotta sang. “I want your drama the touch of your hand I want your leather-studded kiss in the sand.”

At Hershey the inclusive conviviality was enhanced by a wholesome setting with popcorn and cotton candy vendors roaming the crowd.

Gaga’s leather-studded look appeared later in a biker-chic set piece that looked like an homage to “Justify My Love”-era Madonna whose impact Gaga doesn’t try to hide.

Other notable looks included an enormous poofy gold gown designed by her sister Natali Germanotta worn during Chromatica’s “Free Woman.” And my personal favorite was the Deadlotus Couture creation described as an “erotic beetle leotard” accessorized with a horned headpiece that made her look like a futuristic pop star species of African antelope.

Gaga wore that outfit for a piano interlude which included two songs from A Star Is Born the 2018 film with Bradley Cooper that made her a movie star. The interlude allowed her to show out her powerful voice without her more-than-capable funk-pop band playing behind her and also use “Always Remember Us This Way” to frame a summer night in Hershey as a beautiful moment in time.

Along with “Born This Way” which came a little earlier in the set the solo piano section gave Gaga the chance to get intimate with the crowd and putting forth a love-yourself message of self-actualization.

“I see a lot of people who know exactly who they are” she said. “And for those that don’t you’ll figure it out.” She said that when people ask her “why I love the LGBTQ+ community so much I say ‘I’ve always watched you lead the world with love.’”

Performing in the middle of a politically divided state Gaga largely played it down the middle. “One thing I appreciate about this state is you don’t always agree” she said. “And that’s OK. The world doesn’t (expletive) agree. But I know you all love people.”

Before “Angel Down” the soft-focus ballad that was the only song performed from her 2016 country-tinged album Joanne she addressed abortion rights in the wake of the U.S. Supreme Court overturning Roe v. Wade. “This is for everyone who has to worry about their body” she said. “I know you came to the concert to have fun. But some people will die during childbirth and some people will get raped and they can’t have those kids.”

The show was fast-paced satisfyingly punchy expertly staged and action packed but still lost momentum at times. Blame the schematic five-act structure. The video interludes that divided each section were never all that long but still allowed the energy to dissipate while everyone waited to see what Gaga would do — and look like — next.

Here’s the set list from Sunday night in Hershey.

Have you heard of the song “I scream you scream we all scream for ice cream”?

Well now Singaporeans can do this for real.

For a limited time we can just scream at McDonald’s to get a free Hershey’s ice cream cone.

The fun promotion heralds the return of the fast-food chain’s Hershey’s desserts.

Scream into digital board at McDonald’s for free cone

No they’re not encouraging entitled customers to get free food by shouting at staff.

According to McDonald’s they’ll install a digital board at the soft serve booth of McDonald’s Funan from 29 to 31 Aug (Mon to Wed) 11am to 10pm.

All you have to do is scream into the digital board and reach a target decibel level and the plain vanilla cone in it will transform into a Hershey’s cone before your very eyes.

When the cone turns completely chocolate you’ll get a voucher — available while stocks last — for a free yummy Hershey’s cone.

Hershey’s ice cream desserts making a comeback

The promotion is a way to welcome McDonald’s Hershey’s ice cream desserts which are making a comeback. They were last on the menu in 2021.

Besides the regular Hershey’s cone there’s also a chocolate-covered version if you still need more chocolatey goodness to satisfy your cravings.

The Hershey’s McFlurry is also returning in three forms: Hershey’s McFlurry Hershey’s Mudpie McFlurry and Hershey’s Strawberry McFlurry.

Last but not least there’s also the range of Hershey’s sundaes which will come coated in either hot fudge or strawberry sauce.

The goodies will be available at all McDonald’s outlets at dessert kiosks in Singapore from 29 Aug (Monday) while stocks last.

Free cone from McDonald’s worth the scream

While screaming in public may seem undignified it’s worth it to get a free delight from McDonald’s.

For those who don’t want to bust their vocal cords they can always choose to purchase one of the Hershey’s desserts of course.

The continual rollout of delicious limited-edition products is one of the reasons Singapore’s McDonald’s is regarded as top-tier and we look forward to revisiting Hershey’s once again very soon.

The park board held a ribbon-cutting ceremony Friday morning for the completed first phase of the Outdoor Recreation Trail a 1.75-mile concrete and earthen path through the scenic rolling prairie.

Olivera Memovic of Bismarck heard about the opening of the trail and decided to pay a visit on her day off from work. Having already planned a trip to the International Peace Garden she took a route through Minot to walk the trail Friday morning and check out other unique community offerings.

“It’s nice to see something new” she said adding that getting outdoors on a summer day is a great opportunity as well.

“This is exciting for us” Parks Director Ron Merritt said at the ribbon-cutting. “We’ve been working on this project for a long time.”

The park district purchased the property from the State Land Trust after the 2011 flood.

“An agreement was made with the State Land Trust after we purchased it. It gave us five years to make some kind of progress on the property. We actually got that extended by a couple of years and here we are today” Merritt said.

There is a public entrance parking lot and an initial trail.

“We’re thankful for all the partners that have helped us through this. A grant from Hess Corporation helped make this happen and we have also a potential future grant for phase two coming next summer” Merritt said.

Minot Parks recently was given preliminary approval for a $210000 grant from the state’s Recreational Trail Program. The project will consist of three miles of aggregate and natural trails within the 240-acre Outdoor Recreation Area.

Merritt said grants are paying a large share of the overall cost but certain elements such as the parking lot are not grant-eligible. Grant funds are expected to cover about two-thirds the cost of Phase 2 he said.

The Hess grant will help provide for interpretive signing to include native plants birds and animals that may be spotted along the trail. Signage and amenities such as benches are still a work in progress due to supply issues.

Elly DesLauriers Minot Parks director of marketing and development said the new trail is welcoming to people of all abilities.

“Anybody can use this” she said. “That’s what I’m personally proud to see.”

Merritt said the trail will be maintained year-round for walking and cross-country skiing.

Leeds students interested in environmental and social impact intern with some of the most innovative and forward-thinking organizations. For both undergraduates pursuing the Social Responsibility and Ethics Certificate (SRE) and MBAs these internships build on their courses and on their co-curricular engagement with the Center for Ethics and Social Responsibilty (CESR) and provide valuable opportunities that advance their careers.

Every year the Center for Ethics and Social Responsibilty (CESR) at Leeds works with students who are focused on business responsibility for environmental solutions ethical leadership and postive social impact. We support students through programs that build skills and knowledge encourage networking and offer career advice. Learn about how some of our students spent their summer and how Leeds classes and experiential learning programs support their success.

Maddie Barrett (BS'23 SRE Certificate) Product Circularity Intern Seagate Technologies Seagate's Product Circularity program enables end-users and large business like OEMs and CSPs to recycle dispose of and re-new hard drives so their product life cycle can be extended.



The most challenging part was creating marketing materials and campaign materials for a competitive market. I wrote a positioning framework by conducting a SWAT analysis and orienting the program towards large B2B organizations.



My project ran through multiple organizations and I collaborated with different teams. Leeds has prepared me to function in a team overcome problems and face challenges. Consistent group work is what the business world will look like no matter where you end up.



Product marketing enables me to work on materials that can predict the success or the failure of a product. I love writing and organizing case studies solution briefs and developing relationships with partners that make all of that possible. I will be continuing with Seagate throughout my senior year and can’t wait to see what happens next! Mikah Anderson (BS'23 SRE Certificate) Circular Economy and ESG Activation intern at Hewlett Packard Enterprise This summer I created a gap analysis for my company's circular economy program. This project was inclusive of the internal circular economy programs and external opportunities for improvement from competitors. I also worked on a geo-specific materiality project to determine geographies with high feasibility of increasing sustainability solutions. The last major project I worked on was creating talking points about the company's sustainability strategy for customers investors and other stakeholders. My biggest learning was about how geographies impact and interact with the ESG strategies practices and material topics a company may be interested in. Leeds courses that improved my communication skills served me the best. There is a specific formality and vocabulary necessary in writing emails investor documents and internal documents that was required at HPE. I learned that my career goals align with having both ESG reporting and more technical environmental work. I know that I want to woek at a high level in sustainability management and my experience at HPE opened my eyes to different avenues to making that possible.



Evan Anderson (BS'Winter22) Investment Banking Summer Analyst - Consumer Group Piper Sandler

I worked on the Food & Bev industry as well as with the Agriculture Landscape group both of which were interested in sustainbility. I learned a lot in this role about professional communication and how to operate within the expectations set by a team. I also learned how to put together presentation materials from analytical and qualitative materials.

The hardest part was having to familiarize myself with a topic and then turning around to produce materials for it on a tight deadline. This taught me how to utilize my resources most efficiently and how to identify crucial information quickly.

The extracurriculars at Leeds are very helpful for creating professional networks gaining additional skills and specializing in interests. I’ve had several roles within Leeds include serving as a student club executive and am in my second year as Research Assistant at CESR. These contributed to landing the internship and to my success. I also had the support of a mentor through Leeds who helped me prepare and made introductions.

The great part about an internship is being able to confirm your interests and career goals. As a student you have to think about what you want to do in the future for a long time before you actually get there and try it out. It was good to know that I liked the job I thought I’ve wanted since the beginning of college. I also learned my work style which I believe is a HUGE part of success in a job. This experience showed me that I can have high ambitions and achieve them..

Michelle Lishnevsky (MBA'23) and Sonya Query(MBA'23) Board Fellows Naturally Boulder Board Fellows is a student-run MBA club that pairs graduate students with nonprofit partners. As Naturally Boulder's Board Fellows we worked on optimizing the organization's social media accounts including an audit of their current strategies. We presented our project to the board which allowed us to interact with them in a meaningful way to see how the board voted on our recommendations and then begin implementation. Being a Board Fellow helped us get to know people in the industry at all levels. We sat in on board meetings as non-voting members and got a look at the industry from the perspective of its leaders. One of the biggest challenges was being on Zoom and it was interesting to see how board members interacted with each other. This opportunity came through a strategic partnership between CESR and Naturally Boulder. Our classes helped prepare us to communicate effectively and present our work in a meaningful way. We will be Board Fellows for the remainder of the year.

Tyler Phillips (MBA'23) Summer Associate with General Motors Ventures GM's Corporate Venture Capital Fund My assignment was to assess the battery startup landscape from an investment perspective to aid in GM's overall EV Battery investment strategy.



I learned that even in large established companies it's possible to make a strong contribution to a team in a short amount of time. However I worked extra hard (some weekends) to make sure that I delivered real value throughout my experience.



Leeds - specifically Professors Gregg Macaluso and Chris Imamura of Supply Chain - gave me great practice building decks and presenting to a mock executive audience. I ended up presenting my research to the Chief Technology Officer at GM who took it to Mary Barra the CEO! I made sure that my presentation ""hooked them in the first 30 seconds"" as Professor Gregg would say.



My internship validated my passion for renewables specifically around e-mobility and battery electric vehicles. I am hoping to continue the work I started in the battery space with an established OEM (or new EV maker) to help inform their battery strategy.

Zachary Salinger (MBA'23) David & Lucille Packard Foundation MBA Fellow at the Climate Breakthrough Project My biggest learning this summer was that nonprofits are restricted in their ability to innovate because of funding. 80% of the time a nonprofit receives funding they can only use it for pre-designated expenses. This eliminates their ability to pivot which is needed for innovation and meaningful breakthroughs. Entrepreneurs know that the first idea is hardly ever perfect but nonprofits are being restricted.



The hardest thing about my position was wrapping my head around moonshot climate mitigation strategies. There is a disconnect between the private and public sector in how to address climate change. Creating solutions requires technological innovation and favorable policy that incentivizes entrepreneurs. In our current world fraught with energy food and supply-chain issues it is difficult to find a balance between economic feasibility and sustainability.



The first year of my MBA gave me the project management skills needed to effectively work with my colleagues. Many classes in the first year required learning how to effectively run a meeting and finish deliverables in a short period of time.



This fellowship changed my perspective on the nonprofit and climate philanthropy industry while also allowing me to see its immense complexity. It spurred an interest in the holistic ways the public and private sector can work together to tackle climate change

McKiernan Flaherty (MBA'23) Store Executive Intern Target's leadership development program My greatest takeaway this summer was how dynamic the retail industry has become. It is constantly growing and changing making every day unique. As for the most challenging part of my internship it would have to be the rotational nature as it pushed me to assess situations isolate complications and then take actions to drive results quickly before moving on to my next project.



My first year at Leeds School of Business prepared me to succeed in this role by providing me with a strong foundation in business analytics operations accounting finance strategy and marketing. Furthermore I would say my ability to deal with ambiguity build relationships and prioritize among competing deliverables enabled my projects to excel at Target. Along with these skills maintaining a growth mindset and leading with enthusiasm allowed me to flourish professionally.



At Target this summer I learned that I am capable of supporting a growing multi-billion dollar business influencing multiple levels of stakeholders and managing teams on complex projects across the enterprise. Also after this experience I have ultimately come to realize that I desire to have a multi-disciplinary career in the retail industry for a company that focuses on joy and families.

Not a subscriber? You can sign up right here.

New York CNN Business —

August is about to come to a close which means that the summer is almost over in the Northern Hemisphere. (Have fun in the sun Australia!) If that’s not enough to bum you out then this might: September which begins on Thursday is historically the worst month of the year for the stock market.

The Dow and S&P 500 fell sharply in September last year and in 2020 even though the broader market rallied in both years. That doesn’t mean stocks are doomed to finish this September in the red of course. Stocks rallied in each of the three Septembers prior to the pandemic.

But here’s another potentially ominous sign: This is a midterm election year. The Dow has fallen in 11 out of the last 18 pre-midterm Septembers going back to 1950 according to data from The Stock Trader’s Almanac.

So don’t count on past performance to dictate future results. At the end of the day investors should focus on fundamentals instead of dates on the calendar. Earnings the economy and Federal Reserve interest rate policy will matter far more to stock performance than what month it is.

Still there’s reason to be nervous.

The Fed’s next meeting about rate hikes is on September 21. Several key economic reports are on tap that will give investors more clues about the health of the job market and whether inflation pressures are abating. Congress will be back in session just after Labor Day as well.

“There is no question that there are a number of geopolitical concerns and economic data that could lead to volatility. Investors should be prepared for that” said Josh Emanuel chief investment officer of Wilshire.

Traders should keep a close eye on the Fed and the economy he added and the good news is that there are signs that the job market remains healthy and that inflation is finally starting to cool.

If that trend persists Emanuel said “a soft landing could be a plausible scenario” meaning that the Fed won’t cause a recession by hiking rates too aggressively.

The stock market had a miserable first half of the year which could mean that the recent rebound (July’s sharp rally and a flat albeit choppy August) may continue.

“The historical concerns about September and October are less relevant this year. There are forces in play that are more significant” said Alex Chaloff co-head of investment strategy at Bernstein Private Wealth Management. “There are a number of potential catalysts for a fall rally.”

Chaloff said that if the slowdown in inflation continues “the market will cheer that significantly” and the Fed might be more likely to raise interest rates next month by just a half percentage point instead of three-quarters of a point. That could be “critical in establishing momentum for a rally” Chaloff added.

Chaloff also thinks that a soft landing is possible for the economy or in a worst case a “mild recession.” Investors don’t need to be too worried about a sharp economic downturn because “strength in consumer and corporate spending will be more than enough to carry us through” he said.

So as long as the economy keeps chugging along and inflation fears move further into the rear view mirror the market just might avoid a big September swoon.

Or an October crash. Don’t get us started on 1929. Or 1987. Or 2008…

All eyes on the jobs report

Worries about an imminent recession subsided after the stronger-than-expected-jobs report for July. The government reported that 528000 jobs were added far more than expected.

August jobs numbers are due out on Friday. Economists expect a slowdown in hiring but nothing that’s likely to lead to louder recession alarm bells.

Economists are forecasting an increase of 285000 jobs to August payrolls according to Reuters and that the unemployment rate will remain flat at 3.5%. If those estimates are met the Fed (and the markets!) will likely be happy.

“The July jobs report was so unabashedly strong so it’s hard to imagine the Fed will be worrying about the August numbers. The labor market speaks to the underlying strength of the economy” said Jake Remley senior portfolio manager at Income Research + Management.

Investors will also be keeping a close watch on the wage growth numbers in the jobs report. Any signs of a slowdown in wages could be viewed favorably by investors as more evidence that inflation pressures are cooling.

Economists are forecasting a slight increase from July with wages expected to rise 5.3% over the previous 12 months…up slightly from June’s 5.2% growth rate.

A small uptick in wage growth probably won’t set off alarm bells. But neither the Fed nor investors will want to see wages skyrocketing. That might be good news for consumers in the short run but it would not be welcome in the long haul.

As Fed chair Jerome Powell put it in Friday’s speech at Jackson Hole “a failure to restore price stability would mean far greater pain” for the economy.

Sify Technologies CEO Kamal Nath said that the company is expanding its data centre footprint and partnered with Hewlett Packard Enterprise for implementing its Greenlake technology to provide cost efficiency as well as predictability in the cost of cloud computing requirements of business organisations.

Nath said that the company is seeing huge opportunities in the adoption of the hybrid cloud business.

""Hybrid cloud promotes our data centre business network business. It promotes all our business. We are already at a run rate of Rs 3000 crore. We are eyeing Rs 3500 crore (this fiscal)"" Nath said on the sidelines of the CIO and Leader Conference here.

The company had revenue of Rs 2702.6 crore in 2021-22.

In the first quarter ended June 30 2022 the company's revenue grew 19.5 per cent to Rs 770.9 crore from Rs 645.1 crore in the June 2021 quarter.

Sify recorded a 56 per cent growth in its data centre services business at Rs 261.6 crore in April-June 2022 compared to the same period of the last year. The digital services business contributed Rs 203.8 crore and the network services business Rs 305.5 crore.

""We are continuously investing. We are expanding our data centre footprint. We are augmenting our data centre infrastructure. We have enhanced the Cloudinfinit platform in partnership with HPE Greenlake which is targeted towards creating complimentary cloud platforms.

""Here we are not competing but complimenting hyperscale clouds because we believe everything should not move on to hyperscale clouds. It is projected that the hybrid cloud model will emerge as the preferred model"" Nath said.

The cost of hyperscale cloud platforms is higher therefore companies use mixed cloud models to optimise their expense on technology.

Nath said that with the HPE partnership Sify will be able to provide private public and hybrid cloud services on a common platform.

""At present network services contribute around 40 per cent of the company's total revenue while the rest comes from data centre and digital services. At an ideal stage we want each of the segments to contribute one-third to the total business"" Nath said.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiqwFodHRwczovL2xlbW9ud2lyZS5jb20vMjAyMi8wOC8yNy9oZXdsZXR0LXBhY2thcmQtZW50ZXJwcmlzZS1oNmc0M2F1LWhwZS0xLTIwLXRiLWhhcmQtZHJpdmUtMi01LWludGVybmFsLXNhcy02Z2Itcy1zYXMtMTAwMDBycG0tZGlzdHJpYnV0b3JzLWludmVudG9yeS1hcy1vZi1hdWd1c3QtMjctMjAyMi_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,"Hewlett Packard Enterprise - H6G43AU - HPE 1.20 TB Hard Drive - 2.5"" Internal - SAS (6Gb/s SAS) - 10000rpm ...","Due to unprecedented supply chain shortages and disruptions businesses are often left scrambling to find the necessary supplies to continue daily operations.

Home stretch: Bermuda Housing Corporation workers have the end in sight at the Bermudiana Resort in Warwick (Photograph by Jonathan Bell)

Bermuda’s next hotel overlooking South Shore in Warwick is now slated to open on June 1 instead of March according to the Minister of Public Works.

However Lieutenant-Colonel David Burch said that work under the direction of the Bermuda Housing Corporation to repurpose the failed housing development as a high-end hotel was progressing “like gangbusters”.

Colonel Burch added that the island had been beaten this summer by competitors to the south in being the region’s first to acquire a resort in the Tapestry Collection by Hilton.

“Hilton were here last week and have kept in regular contact with us” he said.

“They have just opened a Tapestry in Kingston Jamaica which is the first in the Caribbean area. We were hoping to be first. But we’ll take second.”

Home stretch: Bermuda Housing Corporation workers have the end in sight at the Bermudiana Resort in Warwick (Photograph by Jonathan Bell)

Work at the Bermudiana Beach Resort on the site of the old Grand Atlantic housing complex was hit by financing holdups as well the chaos of the Covid-19 pandemic and a concurrent global tourism slump Colonel Burch said.

“We have about 40 people at work on the site and it’s coming along nicely.”

Hilton’s Tapestry Collection website still showed a November 21 2023 opening date this week for Bermudiana Beach.

But June 1 is understood to be the most recent date agreed between the BHC and representatives from the global chain.

Tapestry launched in 2017 was described by Hilton as an “independent” take on their brand.

Colonel Burch said there were two buildings at the site verging on completion that would “shortly” be unveiled as a show unit.

A source familiar with the project said furniture and doors being shipped from China had been held up by the supply-chain delays seen worldwide this year.

Much of the work involves refurbishing and altering the interior from what were once 76 condos billed originally as low-cost housing into 96 condos with 110 hotel room keys.

David Burt said early this year that March 2023 looked to be the opening date for a resort first hoped to welcome guests in July 2020.

A new design for Bermudiana Beach Resort got the green light this summer from the Department of Planning.

The site opened in 2011 as the Grand Atlantic affordable housing complex under the Progressive Labour Party Government.

But only two of its condos were sold forcing a rethink of the site.

Speaking at the 2019 ribbon-cutting ceremony for the resort Colonel Burch lamented that Grand Atlantic had been the victim of “sabotage” from environmentalists and the One Bermuda Alliance when the party was in Opposition.

The Hilton Tapestry site extols the clifftop resort’s five-minute distance from Horseshoe Bay Beach and 15-minute drive from Hamilton.

The most recent visit by Hilton officials was said to be a last check of the resort’s design with a progress check expected towards the end of this year.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiqQFodHRwczovL3d3dy5wb3N0YW5kY291cmllci5jb20vaGlsdG9uLWhlYWQvdG93bi1vZi1oaWx0b24taGVhZC1pc2xhbmQtYXNrcy1uYXRpdmUtaXNsYW5kZXItaWYtaGUtd2FudHMtdG8tc2VsbC1oaXMtaG9tZS9hcnRpY2xlX2E5ODVkZTY2LTIwMWQtMTFlZC05NjI3LTkzMWFlZjMyZGRkYy5odG1s0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Town of Hilton Head Island asks native islander if he wants to sell his home. He doesn't.,"HILTON HEAD ISLAND — On an island known for affluence Robert Singleton Jr. owns something uniquely precious. He lives on a parcel of land so appealing that even the town government has asked about buying it.

Showing a visitor around the place Singleton 48 stretched a long arm toward the dozens of banana plants that dot his yard. ""If I water them they'll grow more"" he said. A cluster of yellow fruit dangled above his head which is saying something since Singleton who played basketball for Hilton Head High School stands over 6 feet tall.

""They're sweet"" he said smiling up at the bananas. ""They're really sweet.""

From the covered patio of his stilt house where he has lived since 1997 Singleton can hardly see the tower of the Marriott SurfWatch.

If he swivels his head the other direction he looks only into a patch of coastal forest. A palm tree somewhere in the middle of it marks the end of his .38 acres of property he said. He guesses the lot is big enough for a couple of houses.

Five years ago Singleton narrowly succeeded in persuading Town Council to leave his land zoned for resort development meaning the owner could build multi-family units a bed and breakfast even a resort hotel. The possibility made his property more valuable.

But it also worried his neighbors. One of them Tamara Becker in 2017 spoke in favor of restoring residential zoning for the entire neighborhood. She went on to run unopposed for Town Council.

Bradley Circle

An example of resort-style development looms large on Singleton’s horseshoe-shaped street called Bradley Circle.

In 2014 the town briefly changed the zoning from residential to resort.

In went three 10-bedroom vacation rental townhouses 75 feet tall and at least 7000 square feet each. On a mid-August morning a woman sat on one of the balconies reading a newspaper high above the family homes that make up most of the Bradley Circle area.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMif2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1vcm9jY293b3JsZG5ld3MuY29tLzIwMjIvMDgvMzUxMDI2L25ldy1wYXJ0bmVyc2hpcC10by1idWlsZC1hZnJpY2Etcy0xc3Qtd2FsZG9yZi1hc3RvcmlhLWhvdGVsLWluLW5vcnRoZXJuLW1vcm9jY2_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,New Partnership to Build Africa's 1st Waldorf Astoria Hotel in Northern Morocco,Click allow to get notifications on every article we post.,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWRhaWx5YmVhc3QuY29tL3RoZS13b3JsZHMtbW9zdC1mYW1vdXMtYXJjaGl0ZWN0LWRlc2lnbmVkLWxhcy1uZXdlc3QtaG90ZWzSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,The World's Most Famous Architect Designed LA's Newest Hotel,"The world is full of starchitects like Tadao Ando Renzo Piano Jeanne Gang David Adjaye–even the ghost of Zaha Hadid is still going strong. But the most famous the one most likely to be found in the upper parts of lists about the greatest of all time is 93-year-old Frank Gehry.

While his buildings around the globe are renowned the Canada-born architect first broke through in his adopted home of California. Our latest selection for Room Key takes us to his latest work in his hometown the new Conrad Los Angeles.

The hotel is at the edge of downtown and part of a two-tower complex designed by Gehry called The Grand. It’s across the street from his famed Disney Concert Hall and diagonally across from The Broad art museum. The hotel building is not a frenzied deconstructivist work like the concert hall or his recent metallic Weasley-house-looking LUMA Arles but it’s still a sculptural tower of stacked rectangular boxes.

The hotel is the first on the west coast for the brand. For the unfamiliar Conrads (along with the Waldorf-Astoria Collection) are the luxury group within Hilton hotels. Thus rooms here start in the $600s and there is an extensive spa pool and gym available. But what sets this hotel apart (as well as the price point) and why there was so much anticipation for its opening is that Gehry isn’t the only megawatt star involved with it.

The inside of the hotel was overseen by Tara Bernerd whose designs are filling hotel brands like Four Seasons Belmond and Rosewood. Here she has managed to soften what could have been a cold tower. In the lobby and in the rooms floors are covered in wide plank white oak. In the lobby (which is on the 10th floor of the tower) textured Ceppo di Gre stone accents an array of wood furnishings and cladding. Don’t miss the polished lava stone bar top or the curved ceilings reflecting the hall across the street. The rooms are understated with linen walls and not only an open wardrobe but open bathrooms that thankfully seal shut with rolling doors. For those who pay close attention to health and beauty product selection the hotel’s rooms are stocked with products from the always chic Byredo.

The other megawatt star involved in the project is restaurateur José Andrés who has four spots in this hotel. One is the bar called Beaudry Room with the aforementioned lava bar top and the second is the poolside Airlight which serves handheld bites. Agua Viva is a rooftop restaurant around the corner from the pool that feels as if you’ve been transported to Miami and that includes the music. For those looking for something light (it is LA after all) you can’t go wrong with the beefsteak burger which is made with tomato instead of meat.

The signature restaurant is called San Laurel and it opens up onto a deck overlooking the Disney Concert Hall on one side and out across Dodger Stadium to the mountains beyond on the other. It’s one of those classic spaces out here that LA does really well carving a snazzy green space out of urban environments like office towers busy roads and parking lots. The food here is Spain meets California and if the almond crab soup is still on the menu when you go order it. It’s nutty and sweet and sour all at once.

“I’m just like ‘Periods yeah’” Stephens tells the PA news agency.

She spoke in New York at Her Health Advantage a panel event organised by the WTA and its title sponsor Hologic to discuss the issue of women’s health not just in sport but globally.

Since announcing a multi-year partnership with the American healthcare company in March the WTA and its players have really bought into the concept of tennis as an agent for social change.

The figures revealed by Hologic’s Global Women’s Health Index are stark – more than 60 per cent of the women surveyed said they had not seen a doctor or healthcare provider in the last year while just 12 per cent were tested for any type of cancer.

“As a tour being the biggest women’s sport it’s super important for us to have someone who believes in the same thing we believe in” says former US Open champion Stephens.

“Being able to focus more on women’s health the recovery process menstrual cycles all of those things that aren’t really studied in women’s athletes I think is important and obviously being able to be part of that as a tour – we all have some input and we all have data – I think it’s been a really good partnership.”

The subject of the impact of the menstrual cycle on female athletes has entered public discourse over the past year or two with players from tennis and other sports opening up about the effect of periods and hormonal changes on performance.

The science still has some way to go but that something so fundamental to women’s everyday lives has been overlooked for so long is a demonstration of the attitude to women’s health as a whole.

“A lot of things for women were invented by men” says Stephens. “Tampons were invented by a man. That’s so crazy to me.”

With tennis players on the road for around 40 weeks a year the WTA is bringing healthcare to them from psychologists to cancer screening.

And players are learning that an all-round approach to a healthy body and mind is key to getting the best out of themselves as athletes.

Madison Keys runner-up to Stephens at the US Open in 2017 tells PA: “As I’ve got older learning how many things can influence injuries or not being at your best on the court has made me really shift to try to take every part of my health much more into my own hands.

“Even how I need to train based on what part of my cycle I’m in and things like that those are all things I’m now learning that I wish I could have known when I was younger.

“But it’s so great we now have so many more women-based studies to try to create some kind of understanding of our own bodies and how to be in the best position that we can be on the court all of the time.

“To have that be normalised and not a taboo subject that you feel awkward talking about I think not only helps us as individuals but I think it helps speed up the process of getting more information that we can use to help us.”

Martina Navratilova received a major shock in 2010 when she was diagnosed with breast cancer having she admits allowed her screenings to lapse.

“Awareness awareness awareness” says the 18-time grand slam singles champion who made a full recovery.

“I missed four years between screenings because I just wasn’t paying enough attention.”

Navratilova is another big advocate for the Hologic partnership especially the company’s work in making healthcare accessible to hard-to-reach communities.

“What I love most of all about it is it concentrates on women only” she says. “Women are always under-served and overlooked and this company certainly doesn’t do that and I think the relationship with the WTA is just a perfect match.”",,,,,,,,,,,,
HD,Home Depot,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiR2h0dHBzOi8vZmluYW5jZS55YWhvby5jb20vbmV3cy93aHktaG9tZS1kZXBvdC1ub3QtYm9yaW5nLTAyMTc0NjkwOC5odG1s0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Why Home Depot Is Not a Boring Defensive Stock,"Home Depot (NYSE:HD) is often characterized as a defensive stock but the company is working on changing itself and adding more dynamics to the mix through a growing digital ecosystem and shakeups in its business-to-business model. I believe these changes could pay off for the company in the long-term and lead to some growth characteristics.

Earnings growth fueled by e-commerce and B2B





Online sales at Home Depot jumped by 86% to $19.30 billion in fiscal 2020. Although the numbers have since stabilized they constitute a massive piece of the overall revenue pie. To take advantage of this rapid sales growth Home Depot is expanding its order pickup and delivery options and its in-store product assortment. These initiatives are helping to attract new customers and grow Home Depot's market share.

In addition Home Depot is making strides in its efforts to become a one-stop shop for home improvement needs. In the second quarter of 2022 sales rose 6.5% year over year to $43.8 billion and net earnings jumped 8.3% to $5.2 billion. While these are respectable numbers e-commerce sales doubled during the same period increasing by a whopping 12%. Earnings per share reached $5.05 a 5% increase from the prior-year quarter.

Home Depot's focus on building out its digital ecosystem is paying off in terms of traffic and sales and this trend will likely continue in the future. Users downloaded its mobile app in record numbers during the second quarter. In addition Home Depot's website is one of the most visited home improvement websites. Home Depot's success shows that even brick-and-mortar retailers can benefit from investing in a strong digital presence.

Much of Home Depot's digital growth is now coming from its B2B Pro channel which sells to professional contractors. It is worth noting that Pro customers surpassed do-it-yourself ones in sales for the second quarter.

The company has been improving commerce and service capabilities in this area with ongoing updates that will allow them to serve these customers better. Home Depot's new capabilities on its B2B website allow associates to seamlessly modify orders if customers have questions or changes before placing an order.

Strong financials and dividends highlight Home Depot's defensive reputation

Home Depot has been around for decades but the company saw explosive growth during the beginning of the pandemic. With people stuck at home and looking for ways to occupy their time Home Depot saw a surge in sales as people undertook home improvement projects. Even as the pandemic begins to ease and people return to the office Home Depot is still seeing strong sales growth thanks to the work-from-home trend and the stronger housing market.

Story continues

Why Home Depot Is Not a Boring Defensive Stock

Home Depot has done extremely well financially over the last 10 years as it fully capitalized on a growing housing and construction industry which has rewarded investors handsomely

Its dividend certainly looks safe because it has a payout ratio of 0.43. Plus the company is producing free cash flow at a healthy rate and has the potential to further raise its payout in the future.

Why Home Depot Is Not a Boring Defensive Stock

Outlook

The company faces increased operational costs supply chain disruption and inflation. It has a positive track record of cutting costs to protect the margins but it does not appear to be enough. With supply chain issues continuing to affect operations it is natural for prices to rise but this is unlikely to impact sales in the next few months in my view. Despite the challenges faced in the U.S. and elsewhere the home improvement industry still thrives.

Home Depot is a juggernaut in the home improvement industry. The company has taken advantage of the housing and construction boom that followed the Great Recession in the past decade. Home Depot has consistently delivered strong earnings and dividend growth during this period. The share price has also benefited from the company's expansion into new markets.

To be clear I still see Home Depot mainly as a defensive stock. However with its growth initiatives I think the stock has the potential to be something more going forward.

However the plush covering lost popularity to hardwoods luxury vinyls and other innovative floor coverings in the past couple of decades. But as comfort remains paramount amid a global pandemic carpet is making a subtle comeback in key areas of the home. Providing a complement to existing flooring carpet in updated styles and installations adds definition durability and comfort to living spaces. Here are the can't-miss carpet trends to watch for in the coming year.

1. Stunning Stair Runners

With options as varied as sophisticated tweeds playful polka dots saturated hues and natural fibers stair runners have won the hearts of homeowners including more than 56000 tags on Instagram. And it's not just because staircases are prime spots to add a little personality. ""Aside from an exciting design aesthetic stair and hall runners add an extra layer of safety on those slippery hardwoods"" says Matt Lovetere co-founder and CEO of The Carpet Workroom. ""While people are spending more time at home than ever before safety and practicality have become integral parts of a designer's approach.""

2. Cozy Living Spaces

Carpet is definitely back in lounge areas according to Heather Goerzen design editor at Havenly. This includes family rooms bedrooms and any space where coziness and comfort is the primary goal. ""Think playtime and Netflix nights"" says Goerzen. ""In these spaces a cushioned touch underfoot feels not only warranted but welcomed.""

In particular Goerzen is seeing low-pile carpets with subtle textures. This contemporary style is soft without going shag and the low profile is perfect for layering with an area rug that adds color and pattern to complement the space.

3. Open-Concept Dividers

Carpet tiles are popular for fast and bold visual updates and now their transformative nature is being applied to open-concept homes. ""Carpet tile is a great option for delineating different areas within larger spaces"" says James Pope general manager of FLOR. ""One of the first uses that come to mind is using carpet tiles to create zones designating a work or school area within an open floor plan."" Carpet tiles have the flexibility to both visually designate a workspace and ensure it meets the room's needed function such as providing just enough flooring for a desk chair to roll adequately.

4. Pet-Friendly Flooring

Pandemic puppies and COVID-19 kitties have a lot of pet owners looking for little ways to make their lives easier. ""We are seeing a noticeable increase in interest and demand for home and decor products that can withstand the wear and tear of our pets"" says Charlotte Gooding division merchandise manager of soft flooring at The Home Depot.

Pets and carpet might seem like an unexpected pairing but today's flooring materials are built to withstand messes. For example The Home Depot has a line of carpets with pet-proof technology that is stain-resistant and durable while still providing the softness you expect. Homes without pets have also seen increased wear in the past year and Gooding notes these carpets are great for families with children or simply high-traffic spaces too.

5. Updated Wall-to-Wall Carpet

Lovetere notes another way carpet is finding a new fit in open-concept spaces. ""Broadloom carpet has finally caught on by manufacturing oversized materials"" he says. ""These 15-foot and 16-foot widths allow us to make near room-sized rugs as an alternative to wall-to-wall carpeting."" This design is called ""cut-to-fit"" because the carpet follows the contours of the space—curves and all—and stops before reaching the wall to reveal the flooring around the perimeter of the room. This installation lets both hard and soft flooring materials shine.

6. Inviting Neutral Colors

When it comes to carpet color light and bright neutrals remain popular. The softness of carpet provides a visual and tactile complement to the warm and inviting colors that continue to take hold in paint and home accents. Touches of metallics are being used to enhance the look too."

Half of the top 10 are also based in the state.

COLUMBIA S.C. — Forbes has released its annual list of top employers across the country - and in each state - which reveals some interesting data about South Carolina.

One of the bigger surprises for South Carolina to some might be that the top spot on the list didn't go to a company based in South Carolina. And of the top 10 half are actually companies based elsewhere in the country.

The top spot on the list went to Honeywell International which employs about 34000 people in all and has a home base in Morris Plains New Jersey. Forbes describes the company as a software-industrial company that offers solutions to aerospace and automotive products and services.

Number two however goes to a company that's a bit more familiar to South Carolinians in the Lowcountry. Roper St. Francis employs about 6000 people and while considerably smaller than the top spot has been around in the healthcare industry for a few years shy of 200 years having been founded in 1829.

However another outside company takes the third spot on the list and is actually pretty recognizable to anyone in the Southeast. Publix Super Markets has several locations in South Carolina. The Lakeland Florida-based grocery store chain employs about 230000 people company-wide.

Another Charleston-based company takes the fourth spot but has locations in other parts of the state as well. The Medical University of South Carolina (MUSC) another healthcare industry giant in South Carolina employs about 25000 people and like the previous healthcare provider on the list has been around for nearly 200 years having been founded in 1824.

A Greenville-based company Michelin Group is the fifth-best place to work according to Forbes. The automotive supplier employs 124000 people.

But a Maryland company takes number six. Mariott International employs 97000 people and is based in Bethesda. Despite being an out-of-towner it's ranked high on the Forbes list for South Carolina.

Florence-based McLeod Health however brings the list back to South Carolina companies and also continues the ongoing trend of healthcare companies in the Palmetto State being considered top employers according to Forbes. In seventh place it currently has about 8500 employees.

Number eight goes to an upstate school system. The Fort Mill School District employs 2500 people in the city of the same name.

Verizon adds another out-of-state company to the South Carolina list at ninth. The New York-based telecommunications and cable provider employs 105376 people across the country.

And 10 goes to Caterpillar the 107700-employee company known for its construction equipment. The Deerfield Illinois company rounds out South Carolina's top companies to work for.

The list continues with a total of 55 rankings for companies operating in South Carolina that have good reviewers in terms of employment.

So how did Forbes come up with the list? The company partnered with market research company Statista to compile a list for each state and the District of Columbia. Rankings came from surveys of 70000 Americans working for businesses with at least 500 employees.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiSmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxlZ2FjeS5jb20vdXMvb2JpdHVhcmllcy9uYW1lL2J5cm9uLWRvd25zLW9iaXR1YXJ5P2lkPTM2MzQ1NzQw0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Byron Downs Obituary - Washburn-McReavy Funeral Chapels - Hopkins - 2022,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.legacy.com/us/obituaries/name/byron-downs-obituary?id=36345740 on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiSmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxlZ2FjeS5jb20vdXMvb2JpdHVhcmllcy9uYW1lL2J5cm9uLWRvd25zLW9iaXR1YXJ5P2lkPTM2MzQ1NzQw0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen

Kuelo a rising union organizer who came to the United States from Congo won election as president amid criticism that the local's previous leadership had been too accommodating of Tyson Foods. The local represents employees at the company's giant meatpacking plant in Waterloo and many felt it hadn't done enough to urge Tyson to adopt safety measures in the early days of the COVID-19 pandemic when thousands of workers on the packed production lines fell ill and seven died.

But decades before the COVID-19 pandemic the Davenport-based local had a complicated and contentious history.

“Local 431 has received a vast amount of criticism"" former Local 431 President Dick Edwards once told oral historian Shelton Stromquist. ""We’ve been called whores and everything else.”

With 4250 members Local 431 is not the largest UFCW in Iowa ranking behind Local 1155 in Marshalltown (4305 members) and Local 222 in Sioux City (4690 members).

But Local 431 straddles the line with Illinois a closed-shop state where members have to pay dues. The local's JBS plant in Beardstown gives the group more firepower than most in the state. For the last 20 years Local 431 has received an average of $6.1 million in annual membership dues more than the two bigger UFCW locals combined.

As industry shifts employment wages drop

Local 431 began in 1936 as part of the Amalgamated Meat Cutters and Butcher Workmen of North America the less militant of the two major meatpacking unions. While its counterparts organized locals around big plants and went on strike frequently Local 431 organized as many businesses as possible — no matter how small.

The local didn’t push for wages as high as other labor groups did Edwards said. But as meatpackers modernized and took harder lines against unions he argued the local’s members were less likely to lose their jobs.

Local 431 leaders faced uncomfortable challenges after a series of mergers between unions seeking to offset layoffs and plant closings that cost them members. The shift began when industry veterans formed a new company IBP in 1960.

The company also known as Iowa Beef Processors installed a system that allowed managers to “de-skill” the labor of a packing plant. While individual workers at the time made several types of full meat cuts IBP sent carcasses down a production line that required workers to make simple repetitive cuts.

IBP processed meat faster than competitors did. As opposed to the old practice of sending retailers larger quarters of meat IBP cut the product into smaller portions and packaged the product ready for sale at grocery stores. The new system allowed retailers to shed their skilled butchers.

IBP executives took a hardline stance against unions while paying lower wages than competitors. The company refused to sign master agreements with unions covering multiple locations which would give labor leaders some leverage. An eight-month-long Dakota City strike included fire bombings smashed windows and the murder of the sister of a suspected company informant Western Michigan University historian Wilson Warren wrote in “Struggling with ‘Iowa’s Pride’” a history of the Ottumwa meatpackers who saw their lives upended during the shift in the industry.

In 1974 IBP co-founder Currier Holman was convicted of conspiring with a Mafia leader to pay off meat and supermarket officials brokering a labor peace agreement to get his product into the New York beef market. Roger Horowitz a University of Delaware labor historian said union leaders later caught IBP filing false injury logs with inspectors in 1985 covering up workplace dangers. The discovery led to a $2.6 million fine from the Occupational Health and Safety Administration.

IBP thrived and competitors imitated its labor methods. From 1972-80 Warren wrote about 5600 meatpackers in Iowa lost their jobs.

Union mergers bring clash of styles

Against this backdrop unions of different philosophies merged. The AMCBWA which included Local 431 merged with the United Packinghouse Workers of America in 1968. The latter more militant union had represented workers at plants in Ottumwa Fort Dodge and Waterloo.

Unlike the AMCBWA the UPWA organized single big plants. Local leaders became community cornerstones weighing in on local political races and helping desegregate businesses. Unions moved Iowa from a deeply Republican state in the 1940s to a moderate state 20 years later Warren wrote.

But the meatpackers kept losing members. The union merged again in 1979 this time with an organization representing retail clerks creating the UFCW.

Edwards the former Local 431 president said company managers at times welcomed the union as leaders tried to organize workers. He acknowledged that the group's work may have undercut more militant locals affiliated with the UPWA.

“We’ve had companies that have contacted us when they have heard that the UPWA was starting to organize them and allowed us to come right into the plant and maybe right into their lunchroom and hold a captive-audience meeting with their employees” Edwards told Stromquist in 1983. “We’ve done that. Whether it’s quite legal or not I don’t know. But we still think we’re doing a job for our people. That’s what we’re concerned about.”

Local 431 reached such an arrangement in 1976 before Hormel Food Corp. opened a pork processing factory in Ottumwa said Dan Varner a former leader with the local.

Varner said Hormel executives were wary of Ottumwa because the former UPWA local there had a reputation for militancy. The union then known as UPWA Local 1 had conducted work stoppages as much as once a week when John Morrell & Co. operated a plant in Ottumwa. The local's members also threatened non-union members with violence flooded managers’ offices with up to 100 employees to force changes in working conditions and once lifted an engineer's car off the ground when he tried to shuttle replacement workers into the plant during a strike.

To prevent the old radical workers from unionizing the new operation Varner said Hormel struck a deal with Local 431. He said the local would get easy access to dues-paying members while the company would get a union that “didn’t cause too much trouble.”

Local 431 leaders told Varner who had been a night steward at the Oscar Meyer plant in Davenport to move to Ottumwa. He was among the first 10 workers the company hired and managers gave him a relatively cushy job driving a forklift. He said they let him organize workers on company time without resistance.

Varner became the unit’s chief steward. But he slowly became radicalized.

He said Local 431 leadership didn’t respond to complaints about the company making him a target among the rank-and-file. From March to May 1984 according to Warren the company laid off about 560 employees draining the factory until members agreed to a contract that cut hourly wages from $31 to $25 in today’s dollars.

Varner said the cuts angered workers. A year later Austin Minnesota-based UFCW Local P-9 — filled with former UPWA members — went on strike against Hormel. The action split the union. UFCW International officers cautioned the workers against the strike eventually cut off their weekly strike pay and replaced the local's leaders with other members who crossed the line.

In Ottumwa Varner said most members sided with the P-9 leaders. When the company hired replacement workers in Austin P-9 members exerted pressure by picketing other unionized Hormel plants.

They asked union members at those plants to stay out of work citing clauses in their contracts with Hormel that allowed them to honor valid picket lines. Hormel executives argued that the picket lines outside Ottumwa were invalid. The local leaders sided with the company issuing a statement saying “431 is not on strike and under its contract it may not go out at this time.”

Varner said Local 431 President Louis DeFrieze urged him to talk the members out of going on strike. Varner declined joining about 500 Ottumwa members who honored the line and stayed off the job.

“Local 431 and Hormel felt that they were both going to be injured on this whole thing” Varner told the Des Moines Register in a recent interview. “Their cozy understanding agreement whatever you want to call it it fell apart on them.”

Hormel fired the Ottumwa strikers and about a year later closed the plant. Varner said DeFrieze who had become a UFCW International officer denied his request for a job at another local.

“Within the labor organization that Louis had any clout with I was blackballed” said Varner who picked up a job with the American Federation of State County and Municipal Employees. “I was not going to get any type of union position within UFCW.”

Excel a subsidiary of Cargill bought the Ottumwa facility soon after and hired workers for the equivalent of $14 an hour — about 44% less than what Hormel had paid. Local 431 tried to organize the Excel plant. Ottumwa workers refused successfully lobbying for their own charter Local 230. Ousted P-9 president Jim Guyette filed an assault charge against DeFrieze telling police DeFrieze tried to punch him when they ran into each other at a Miami labor convention.

Horowitz the University of Delaware historian said the failed actions in Austin and Ottumwa were a “devastating blow” for militant meatpackers.

“The lesson that the UFCW took from that is ‘Those meatpacking workers are a pain in the neck’” he said.

UFCW takes stance on immigrant issues

Despite the black eye Local 431 remained one of Iowa's most powerful unions.

Its resources from the Beardstown plant in Illinois allowed Local 431 to extend its reach to blue-collar workers around the state — even those who aren’t members. DeFrieze was an active board member of the local United Way in the 1980s successfully urging members to donate funds a pool of money that became especially important when five local farm implement plants closed from 1984-87 sending the unemployment rate in the Quad Cities near 9%.

After the makeup of the workforce shifted toward immigrants Local 431 tried to organize Agriprocessors a kosher meatpacking plant in Postville. The local publicly called the company out for food safety violations. Organizers worked with federal and state inspectors on investigations into child labor and minimum wage law violations.

A week before U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents raided the Postville plant in May 2008 leading to 400 arrests and mass deportations of undocumented workers to Guatemala UFCW International leaders unsuccessfully urged the federal directors to back off. They said a raid would disrupt the investigations into the company’s owners.

A year later the UFCW published a research paper advocating against immigration raids arguing that federal officials round up many legal workers and deny employees access to lawyers. The Obama administration ultimately moved away from the raids that had characterized the previous administration’s approach to immigration enforcement.

Some Local 431 leaders have defended DeFrieze’s concessionary stance toward companies at the time of the Ottumwa strife arguing that his approach helped preserve the local.

Jerry Messer who went on to serve as Local 431’s president told an oral historian that DeFrieze prevented the closing of an Oscar Meyer plant in Davenport by convincing members to take contract concessions. He added that DeFrieze kept him out of Ottumwa during the 1986 standoff trying to keep Messer’s name clean for his future as a union leader.

“The local would have survived the closing of the Oscar plant” Messer said. “But it wouldn’t be what it is today.”

Bethesda Maryland-based Host Hotels & Resorts ended 2023 with $2.9 billion of available liquidity an amount that President and CEO Jim Risoleo said gives the REIT an advantage in negotiating acquisitions once attractive hotels and resorts hit the market.

""Frankly there just aren't a lot of properties that are currently listed for sale certainly not assets that would interest Host but that's really not slowing us down at all"" Risoleo said. ""We are talking to our competitors in the industry our friends in the industry and others to try to kick deals loose that are Host-type assets.

""We are leaning on our relationships. We're leaning on our reputation on our ability to close deals all-cash and that really gives us a very meaningful competitive advantage. And we believe this is the year to to get the balance sheet to work.""

Ideally the U.S. Federal Reserve will soon announce the first of several interest rate cuts Risoleo said and that will bring sellers out of hibernation.

""It's going to also spark competition for those assets"" that will come to market he said. ""Our point of view is we have the balance sheet; we can do it all. We want to get out there and we want to get ahead of the pack. And I hope over the course of the next several months that we're going to be able to tell you that we've been a net acquirer early in 2024.""

Asked about the wave of commercial mortgage-backed securities maturing this year and next and whether that will drive hotel sales Risoleo said the wall of distress hasn't materialized.

""This year there's about $26 billion of full-service loans that will be maturing and I know that earlier in the pandemic there was a lot of talk of distress"" Risoleo said. ""Frankly we haven't seen it materialize certainly not on assets or markets that would interest us. But we'll continue to track it.

""There may be pressure as we get later into the year because one of the things that other hotel owners are going to have to deal with sooner or later is reinvesting in their portfolio.""

Host is interested in acquiring large hotels and resorts with diverse demand drivers in the group business transient and leisure segments. Risoleo added ""bigger is better for us"" and that acquiring hotels in urban markets might be on the table again.

What's Next for Maui

Host's resorts on Maui — the Hyatt Regency Maui Resort and Spa the Andaz Maui at Wailea Resort and the Fairmont Kea Lani — continue to skew the performance of the REIT's portfolio as leisure demand decreased following the wildfires in August. Yet Host's Maui properties have benefited from a steady source of group demand.

Sourav Ghosh Host's executive vice president and chief financial officer said 2023 was ""the year of group and convention hotel recovery"" adding that group room revenue increased 21% year over year and the volume of group room nights sold recovered to 95% of 2019 levels.

""It is worth noting that our group results were positively skewed by disaster and recovery bookings in Maui"" he said. ""Group room revenue exceeded 2022 by 13% in the fourth quarter driven by an increase in both rate and room nights and we estimate roughly half of that growth can be attributed to recovery and relief groups on Maui.""

article 5 Min Read Host Awaits Return of Consistent Hotel Demand in Maui None of Host Hotels & Resorts' three Maui resorts were damaged by the August wildfires but a significant number of bookings were canceled for the fourth quarter. Dan Kubacki Social

Efforts to rebuild Lahaina are ongoing and Risoleo said the west side of Maui will take more time to recover.

""In the interim we have been working with relief agencies in particular the Red Cross. We have contracted with the Red Cross for 350 rooms at the Hyatt Regency Maui through the end of May and we're hopeful that that will be extended while the recovery moves forward"" Risoleo said.

Host is also awaiting a resolution to Hawaii Gov. Josh Green's threat to ban short-term rentals if they aren't opened up as housing for displaced residents. In December Green said the state needed approximately 3000 short-term rental units set aside for Maui residents.

""March 1 is a pivotal date in our mind"" Risoleo said. ""The governor of the state of Hawaii has stated that if the owners of short-term rentals on Maui don't come to terms with allowing their units to be utilized by the displaced residents then he is considering a ban on short-term rentals. ... On the island of Maui in total there's about 30000 short-term rentals. It's quite significant and we're tracking it very closely.""

Risoleo added he hopes leisure travelers will return sooner to Host's two resorts in the Wailea area: the Andaz Maui at Wailea Resort and the Fairmont Kea Lani. Host concluded 2023 by wrapping up a renovation of the Fairmont Kea Lani's lobby and guestrooms in December.

""We're confident that over time as the consumer begins to understand the differentiation between Wailea which is a completely different submarket than the west side and Ka'anapali that will lead the cadence of business pickup"" he said.

Full-Year Outlook and Earnings Highlights

In its 2024 outlook Host Hotels & Resorts forecasts hotel revenue per available room to grow between 2.5% and 5.5% over 2023. The REIT anticipates net income between $708 million and $794 million and adjusted earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization for real estate between $1.59 billion and $1.68 billion.

For full-year 2023 Host's revenue was $5.3 billion up 8.2% over 2022 according to the REIT's earnings release.

Host's full-year net income was $752 million — which was up 17% year over year — and adjusted EBITDAre was $1.6 billion up 8.7% from 2022.

The company's portfolio achieved full-year revenue per available room of $211.71 which was up 8.1% year over year. Average daily rate was $300.66 which was 1.8% above full-year 2022. Hotel occupancy was 70.4% up 6.2% from 2022.

As of publication time Host's stock was trading at $20.48 per share up 5.2% year to date. The Nasdaq Composite Index was up 7% for the same period.

When it comes to business laptops that don’t feel like business laptops HP’s Elite Dragonfly laptops lead the way. The usual security measures are in place but these laptops aren’t afraid to stand out in a crowd.

I reviewed the third generation of the Elite Dragonfly which has morphed from a convertible 2-in-1 into a traditional clamshell laptop. It’s an incredibly well-designed and attractive little laptop that hits the sweet spot for businesspeople who want to stay classy on the road.

What businesspeople want

Before a laptop can go off and be extra it needs to take care of the basics. The Elite Dragonfly G3 does just that offering an Intel vPro CPU to support enterprise-level security and management features and HP’s Wolf Security suite to protect against malicious attacks in both hardware and software. The Elite Dragonfly G3 matches other business-oriented laptops like Lenovo’s ThinkPad and Dell’s Latitude when it comes to supporting large businesses.

With that basic threshold met what else do business users want? Well they want laptops designed for the long haul given that businesses tend to milk every dime out of their investments — which means holding onto laptops for longer than many consumers hold onto theirs. So a business laptop needs a solid build even if it sports a thin and light design.

The Elite Dragonfly G3 is constructed of magnesium and aluminum giving it both light weight and a mostly sturdy build. There’s a tiny bit of bending in the lid and some flexing in the keyboard deck but nothing egregious.

The design is also quite comfortable with rounded edges along the side of the lid and chassis that make for comfortable use not to mention an elegant look and feel. The design is minimalist but quite attractive and the chassis is available in either a Slate Blue (my review unit) or a Natural Silver color scheme. The display bezels are lined in plastic which detracts a little from the premium feel but they’re small enough to enable a nicely sized machine. The hinge opens with one hand quite the feat given the light chassis bottom and it holds the display firmly in place.

Overall the laptop provides the kind of quality aesthetic and comfortable build that any user would appreciate. The 2.19-pound weight helps considerably making the Elite Dragonfly G3 one of the lightest laptops we’ve reviewed and its 0.64-inch thickness makes it an easy laptop to slide into a bag.

Business users will also appreciate the connectivity which is extensive for such a small laptop. Wireless connectivity meets the latest standards with optional 5G WWAN support for always-connected internet.

A compelling compromise

The typical businessperson depends on running applications like Microsoft Office Slack Teams Outlook — often all at the same time. Today’s most common CPUs provide more than enough productivity performance whether we’re talking about Intel’s 12th-gen Core processors or AMD’s Ryzen 6000 chips. The only exceptions are business users who run demanding scientific engineering or creative applications like AutoCAD or Adobe’s Creative Suite — but in those cases they won’t be choosing thin and light laptops like the Elite Dragonfly G3.

It’s not a machine that’s tuned for high performance especially since its Core i7-1265U processor runs at only 15 watts. But even similar laptops with the same chip score a bit better in benchmarks. The Dell Latitude 7330 UL is the best example which outperforms the HP Elite Dragonfly G3 in Geekbench 5 and Handbrake.

Nevertheless the Elite Dragonfly G3 still receives a bump in performance using its 12th-gen Intel processor which keeps it more than fast enough to keep up with the kind of workflows it’s designed for. So while the Elite Dragonfly G3 is far from a performer it’s plenty fast for its intended use.

With competent if not impressive business performance out of the way the next question is how long does the Elite Dragonfly G3 last on a single charge of the battery? That’s incredibly important to businesspeople who are more apt to take their laptops on the road. When flying from one side of the country to the other you want a laptop that will make it all the way without worrying about whether the airliner provides the power you need.

Here the HP did much better. In fact it’s a class-leading laptop when it comes to battery life demonstrating that HP created a solid compromise between performance and longevity. There are 68 watt-hours of battery capacity tucked away inside the laptop’s diminutive chassis which is a fair amount for the 13.5-inch 3:2 WUXGA (1920 x 1280) low-power IPS display. The Elite Dragonfly G3 makes great use of its battery capacity and lower performance tuning to turn in some impressive battery life scores.

It’ll last just under 12.5 hours in light web browsing and nearly 19 hours in local video playback. For actual work you’ll get less but there’s no doubt it will last a full business day of work on a single charge — and then some.

The ThinkPad X1 Yoga Gen 7 is the only of its rivals to come close to competing with it here and it’s still a couple of hours behind.

Creature comforts and conveniences abound

HP paid great attention to creating a laptop that is incredibly comfortable to use. That includes the keyboard which has large keycaps excellent spacing and light snappy switches that make for fatigue-free typing.

It’s one of the better keyboards on a business-class machine. The touchpad is large with plenty of space on the palm rest thanks to the 3:2 display and its glass surface is smooth and precise with confident yet quiet button clicks. A touch display is optional and not included in my review unit.

HP built in some nifty privacy features starting with an electronic shutter for the webcam that’scontrolled by a key on the keyboard. There’s also user presence detection which can lock the laptop and put it to sleep when the user walks away and wake it back up when the user returns. It worked well during my testing and in fact I needed to turn off the feature to conduct my battery tests.

The display on my review unit was the low-power non-touch 13.5-inch 3:2 WUXGA+ (1920 x 1280) IPS display. I found it to be bright and colorful with plenty of contrast and my colorimeter agreed.

Colors were right at the premium average in terms of sRGB and AdobeRGB gamma and accuracy which results in a display that’s plenty colorful for productivity work and media consumption. Brightness was well above our 300-nit threshold at 398 nits and contrast was excellent at 1610:1 smashing through our preferred 1000:1. While creators want wider colors business users will find this display quite pleasant.

Two downward-firing and two upward-firing speakers provide a surprising amount of volume for such a small laptop with clear mids and highs and a touch of bass. The audio system is more than good enough for videoconferencing augmented by two-way AI-control noise reduction as well as the occasional Netflix bingeing session.

Speaking of videoconferencing the webcam is a high-resolution 5MP model with an infrared camera and HP built in several tools to make for the highest-quality video and the best experience during videoconferencing sessions. There are the usual lighting adjustment and background blur capabilities along with an Appearance Filter to smooth out the rough edges and Autoframe to allow the user to move around while still remaining centered in the video.

Finally Windows 11 Hello passwordless login is provided by both facial recognition and a fingerprint reader. Both methods worked quickly and reliably.

A top-of-its-class business laptop

The HP Elite Dragonfly G3 is a business laptop masquerading as an elegant premium consumer laptop. It has everything a business needs and everything a business user wants. It’s not the fastest laptop but it’s fast enough and its battery life is stellar. The fact that it’s incredibly thin and light is just icing on the cake.

The ThinkPad X1 Carbon Gen 10 is Lenovo’s own attempt at a more premium business laptop but it still holds onto the classic ThinkPad DNA. But the HP Dragonfly G3 has better battery life and a more modern design without the trappings of an older era of business.

The Elite Dragonfly G3 is one of the most elegant and comfortable business laptops you can buy and it’s the best example of the next generation of business laptops .

Ars Technica

The Spectre x360 didn't fall dramatically behind the competitors in our graphics benchmarks but it was still a little disappointing to see it come in last place in both tests. (Note that we don't have Vulkan numbers available for the MacBook Air). The rival Windows machines got a leg up over the Spectre x360 from the i7-1260P which has a faster max GPU speed than the chip in the Spectre (1.4 versus 1.25 GHz) and the same number of execution units (96).

Regardless of what I put it through the Spectre stayed surprisingly cool for its size. After an hour-long stress test for example the only part of the chassis that was too hot to touch comfortably was its underside although the keyboard was borderline.

HP changed the fan design for the 2022 Spectre x360 13.5-inch compared to the 2021 model and the company claims that the new model delivers up to 10 percent increased airflow and an 8 percent improvement on ""acoustic performance."" The sLCP + Slim Y Type Blade fan has 122 blades (46 percent more than last year) that are supposed to be 25 percent thinner than the blades on last year's fans.

Battery life

HP provided reviewers with the below chart to illustrate the 2-in-1's battery life claims which include an estimated nearly 14 hours of local video playback with headphones.

For comparison the Yoga 9i with OLED claims up to 14 hours of 1080p video playback and 10.5 hours with MobileMark 2018; the Swift 5 claims up to 14 hours of video playback or web browsing at 50 percent brightness; and Apple claims the MacBook Air can survive 15 hours when surfing the web over Wi-Fi or 18 hours of movie playback on the Apple TV app.

Display

HP sells the 2022 Spectre x360 13.5-inch with an option for a pixel-dense (267 pixels per inch) 3000 x 2000 OLED screen just like it did last year.

It's a vibrant screen with intense blacks. Colors looked lively overall but not oversaturated. Blues for example carried tones of purple and I saw detailed oranges and strong greens. Dark scenes in movies came through with noticeably more detail exhibiting nuanced shades and colors and adding depth to the image.

According to my measurements the display covers 132% of DCI-P3. That's in the same ballpark as the lower-resolution (2880x1800) but speedier (90 Hz) display on the Yoga 9i which covered 123.2% P3 during testing. It's also a lot more colorful than what I got from the IPS LCD display on Acer's Swift 5 (83.1% P3).

Unsurprisingly the OLED screen here is a bit dimmer than alternatives. I recorded 378 nits on my review unit which is 30.1 percent less bright than the Swift 5 and a step down from the luminance Apple claims with the MacBook Air (500 nits). But with rich vivid colors and a screen that wasn't overly reflective I was still able to use the machine outside with only minor eyestrain.

Theoretically infinite contrast makes OLED a popular HDR candidate and this year HP added a VESA DisplayHDR 400 True Black certification. This calls for at least 400 nits and a black level of 0.0005 nits max when viewing HDR content. It's the lowest tier of VESA's OLED-specific DisplayHDR performance tiers which go up to True Black 600.

When I watched a 4K HDR movie on the 2-in-1 some areas of the image like skin tones and background walls appeared more natural with HDR on and I could discern more details from darker scenes. But some colors like red and deep blues looked less vivid.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lmdpem1vY2hpbmEuY29tLzIwMjIvMDgvMjcvaHAtejMyay1nMy1tb25pdG9yLXdpdGgtaXBzLWJsYWNrLXBhbmVsLWFuZC10aHVuZGVyYm9sdC00LXBvcnQtbGF1bmNoZWQv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,HP Z32k G3 monitor with IPS Black Panel and Thunderbolt 4 port launched,"HP recently announced a bunch of new products on the HP Amplify Executive forum including the Dragonfly Folio G3 and the 34-inch All-in-One PC with a 5K display. Additionally the company also launched a separate display called the HP Z32K G3.

As evident by the name the Z32K G3 is a 32-inch 4K monitor with an IPS panel. The Z32k G3 is the first monitor to use an IPS Black Panel which is expected to produce darker blacks and more vivid colors than standard IPS panels. IPS Black Panel technology in particular should offer 35% deeper blacks than other IPS panels. It has a 2000:1 contrast ratio 400nits peak brightness and covers 98% of the DCI-P3 color gamut.

Additionally the Z32K G3 has a Thunderbolt 4 port that can deliver data and video in addition to charging a laptop at up to 100 W. Similar to that a second 4K monitor can be connected to the HP Z32k G3 without the need for a specific Thunderbolt dock.

The monitor also offers a KVM switch and an Ethernet connection and is backward compatible with traditional USB Type-C ports. A DisplayPort and two HDMI ports are also included. The pricing and release date of the monitor is still under wraps but HP claims that it will be available sometime in November.

Por: Efraín Tzuc para A dónde van los desaparecidos*

Este agosto debió empezar a operar el Centro Nacional de Identificación Humana (CNIH) una institución que tendrá la tarea de resguardar la información para la identificación de personas fallecidas en calidad de desconocidas. Sin embargo preocupa a familiares de personas desaparecidas y especialistas cómo se coordinará con el resto de instituciones forenses y si contará con presupuesto suficiente.

Con el fin de abatir la crisis forense estimada en más de 52 mil cuerpos desconocidos el gobierno del presidente Andrés Manuel López Obrador propuso la creación del CNIH adscrito a la Comisión Nacional de Búsqueda de Personas. La iniciativa fue aprobada por ambas cámaras legislativas en mayo de este año y celebrada por colectivos de búsqueda de personas organizaciones civiles y organismos internacionales.

“Esperamos que el Centro funcione que realmente se tome en cuenta y no vaya a ser un elefante blanco” dice en entrevista Virginia Garay del colectivo Guerreras en Busca de Nuestros Tesoro de Nayarit e integrante del Consejo Nacional Ciudadano un órgano independiente integrado por expertos y familias de personas desaparecidas.

Aunque en su decreto de creación la única facultad clara del Centro Nacional es el resguardo de información con fines de identificación que sería entregada a las autoridades competentes tanto el subsecretario federal de derechos humanos Alejandro Encinas como la comisionada nacional de búsqueda Karla Quintana han asegurado que esta nueva institución liderará las labores de identificación masiva es decir la que se realizaría a partir de la comparación sistemática y periódica de la mayor cantidad de datos de las personas fallecidas sin identidad con la que entregan familiares de personas desaparecidas e incluso realizaría tomas de muestras para obtener perfiles genéticos.

Con esa encomienda el Centro Nacional se suma a otras instituciones que tienen el mismo fin de identificar cuerpos anónimos aunque varíen en jurisdicción métodos y alcances como las 33 fiscalías del país el Mecanismo Extraordinario de Identificación Forense y hasta la Guardia Nacional.

Los detalles sobre cómo operaría el Centro Nacional y cómo se coordinará con estas instituciones “quedaron en el aire” dice Humberto Guerrero director del programa de derechos humanos en la organización civil Fundar.

Según el especialista la titular de la Comisión Nacional de Búsqueda aseguró que esas cuestiones se resolverían en la reglamentación del CNIH pero la CNB –de la que depende el Centro Nacional– lleva cuatro años y medio operando sin su propio reglamento.

Articulación institucional en el aire

La preocupación por la crisis forense no es nueva para las familias que buscan a sus desaparecidos y desaparecidas: desde que impulsaron la Ley General en Materia de Desapariciones –aprobada en noviembre de 2017– lograron incluir herramientas que servirían para atender esta crisis todas ellas a cargo de la Fiscalía General de la República (FGR).

La institución dirigida por Alejandro Gertz Manero ha retrasado por más de tres años la creación estas herramientas clave como el Banco Nacional de Datos Forenses (BNDF) que tendría la función de comparar periódicamente y de forma masiva los datos genéticos de los cuerpos sin identidad del país con los de familiares que buscan a personas desaparecidas para encontrar posibles coicidencias y así agilizar las identificaciones justo como ahora se pretende que haga el Centro Nacional de Identificación Humana.

El Ministerio Público de la Federación incluso enfrenta una demanda de amparo por la falta del Banco que estaría próxima a resolverse.

La FGR también tiene pendiente el Registro Nacional de Personas Fallecidas No Identificadas y No Reclamadas el Registro Nacional de Fosas Clandestinas y Fosas Comunes y el Programa Nacional de Exhumaciones e Identificación Forense. Además en peticiones de información la FGR ha respondido que se encuentra trabajando en una Base Nacional de Información Genética (BaNIG) que estaría operando hasta el próximo año.

Este podría no ser el único banco genético nacional con el que tendría que trabajar el CNIH: el año pasado la Guardia Nacional licitó un servicio de arrendamiento de perfiles genéticos de personas desaparecidas sin que a la fecha se conozca el número de perfiles con los que cuenta y la finalidad de su resguardo.

Un esfuerzo más para combatir esta emergencia es el Mecanismo Extraordinario de Identificación Forense (MEIF) un órgano multidisciplinario y con autonomía técnico-científica creado a finales de 2019 con la encomienda de realizar peritajes a cuerpos y restos humanos en calidad de desconocidos ingresados a los Servicios Médicos Forenses (Semefos) del país antes de su creación. A diferencia del CNIH aunque el MEIF inicialmente se iba a crear a partir de una Ley las instituciones federales solo accedieron a que se creara vía Acuerdo lo que implicó un menor peso legal.

En lo que sí coinciden ambas instituciones es en que tendrán que trabajar con la información que resguardan las fiscalías del país para identificar a las personas fallecidas en calidad de desconocidas.

El Grupo que coordina el MEIF fue seleccionado hace un año y para realizar su labor deben firmar convenios de colaboración con las fiscalías del país quienes tenían la facultad exclusiva del resguardo de los cuerpos.

“Todavía no funciona bien el MEIF y ya se está abriendo una nueva institución. ¿Cómo vamos a empujar esto si nos faltan los bancos (de datos) que son parte fundamental para que realmente pueda existir las identificaciones?” cuestiona la consejera Virginia Garay.

El Grupo que coordina el Mecanismo asegura que confían en que la metodología que están implementando sirva para sentar las bases de lo que llaman “un ecosistema interinstitucional en identificación humana” que incluye al nuevo CNIH.

Grace Fernández del Movimiento Nacional por Nuestros Desaparecidos de México considera que el Centro Nacional debe ser una herramienta adicional para dar respuesta a las familias de personas desaparecidas.

“Todos los días y en todos los estados hay hallazgos de fosas clandestinas. Se van incrementando la cantidad de personas que hay que identificar y entonces tienes un sistema colapsado que no tiene ni recursos ni personal ni tecnología por eso es necesario crear nuevas instancias” asegura Fernández.

El riesgo advierte Humbero Guerrero de Fundar es que no se genere una verdadera política nacional de identificación forense y solo proliferen iniciativas aisladas que generen información que no se comparta que no sea uniforme y que no ayude a la tarea de identificar con agilidad.

Las fiscalías… De nuevo

El cuello de botella apunta a las fiscalías: con la facultad exclusiva de investigar delitos y resguardar cuerpos –y los datos obtenidos de las necropsias– que perdieron la vida en situaciones violentas o a los que no se les restituyó la identidad las instituciones ministeriales se han convertido en maquinarias para enterrar cuerpos. Pese a ello en su mayoría no han estado dispuestas a abrir los archivos forenses para que otros devuelvan el nombre a quienes las fiscalías enterraron sin él.

“El Centro Nacional de Identificación Humana por más que tenga facultades establecidas en la legislación va a requerir necesariamente que existan fiscalías dispuesta a colaborar” menciona César Contreras abogado del Centro de Derechos Humanos Miguel Agustín Pro Juárez (Centro Prodh).

Soberbia egocentrismo cinismos pereza o celos institucionales y hasta posibles complicidades criminales son calificativos vertidos hacia las fiscalías como explicación de su falta de colaboración para el rezago en materia de identificación que ellas mismas han generado.

La falta de voluntad política de las fiscalías para compartir la información forense ha hecho que las familias de personas desaparecidas sientan que los esfuerzos de los últimos años para combatir la crisis forense están “en la cuerda floja” según Garay vocera del Consejo Nacional Ciudadano.

De acuerdo con Fernández del Movimiento por Nuestros Desaparecidos de México el MEIF también se ha enfrentado a la poca voluntad para compartir información de las instituciones ministeriales. Al haber sido creado mediante un acuerdo –y no como parte de una ley como el CNIH– se ha encontrado con un obstáculo previo incluso a su operación: las fiscalías no consideran obligatorio colaborar con el órgano independiente.

A la fecha el Grupo Coordinador del MEIF solo ha logrado firmar convenios con las fiscalías de San Luis Potosí y Tamaulipas.

Para el subsecretario Encinas la solución es trabajar con quien se pueda trabajar. “Se requiere de coordinación institucional. Donde no haya voluntad no vamos a perder el tiempo” asegura en entrevista.

Garantizar presupuesto

En épocas de austeridad el presupuesto del Centro Nacional es una preocupación para familiares de personas desaparecidas y especialistas.

El subsecretario Encinas aseguró el pasado 9 de agosto que el CNIH contará con recursos. Sin embargo para Grace Fernández la solvencia presupuestal continúa siendo una preocupación.

“Compromisos de palabra tenemos muchos por parte de diputados y senadores. Estaremos cobrándolos en este periodo legislativo para que le asignen los recursos necesarios al tanto al mecanismo como a los centros de identificación” advierte Fernández.

El abogado Contreras coincide en la exigencia de Fernández: la Cámara de Diputados tiene la responsabilidad de garantizar los recursos suficientes para operar en tanto fue el mismo Legislativo federal quien aprobó su creación.

“Aún no existe una partida de recurso para tener la seguridad de que va a ser un centro que va a estar trabajando desde el principio” advierte Virginia Garay.

A una petición de información realizada por Animal Político la CNB respondió que los recursos para el CNIH se tomarían de dos programas presupuestarios originalmente destinados a realizar acciones de búsqueda lo que implicaría una disminución en los esfuerzos de la Comisión para localizar a las personas desaparecidas.

Aunque las autoridades federales se ahorraron en la construcción de un edificio nuevo lo cierto es que este aún requiere ser acondicionado explica la señora Garay que fue parte de la comitiva que conoció las instalaciones recién cedidas por el gobierno de Morelos.

En palabras de la comisionada Quintana el Centro Nacional estará inaugurado cuando realice su primera identificación. Es la misma frase que hace un año utilizó para referirse al Mecanismo Extraordinario de Identificación Forense que todavía aguarda a ese simbólico comienzo. Mientras tanto la crisis de desaparición no se detiene y los cuerpos sin nombre siguen llegando a las morgues del país a la espera de ser devueltos a sus familias.

Jeanne la persona más longeva (documentada) de la historia de la humanidad fallecía con 122 años y 164 días en 1997. No se trataba exclusivamente de un logro individual y aislado sino que era la cúspide de una tendencia colectiva. Desde hace más de medio siglo el número de supercentenarios aquellos que han superado la barrera biológica de los 110 años se ha multiplicado en el mundo. Este fenómeno no responde solo al aumento de la población humana global sino que está íntimamente relacionado con el progresivo aumento de la esperanza de vida del ser humano en todo el planeta. Así se estima que en este momento existen cientos de supercentenarios pisándole los talones a Calment.

Jeanne Calment que murió en 1997 con 122 años es la persona más longeva documentada. Pero cientos de supercentenarios le pisan los talones

Hoy podría resultarnos una idea difícil de concebir pero hace apenas unos pocos siglos lo normal para cualquier persona era no llegar a los 40 años. En la actualidad sin embargo la esperanza de vida global se sitúa en torno a los 73 con grandes diferencias entre naciones (desde los 86 años de Singapur hasta los 51 de Lesoto). Este feliz y drástico cambio en la demografía humana no habría sido posible sin la ayuda de numerosos avances que fueron apareciendo a partir del siglo XIX.

Así la mortalidad por multitud de enfermedades infecciosas cayó en picado gracias a la higiene conseguida por el alcantarillado o la potabilización de las aguas. Más tarde la aparición de las vacunas supuso el principio del fin de epidemias que habían azotado a los humanos durante milenios (como la viruela) y los antibióticos evitaron que multitud de infecciones bacterianas se convirtieran en sentencias de muerte. Las mejoras en diversas facetas de la vida diaria como la alimentación las estrategias de salud pública para la prevención de diversas enfermedades o la atención sanitaria contribuyeron aún más a extender la esperanza de vida por el mundo.

La ruta hacia la longevidad

Por ahora nada indica que el aumento constante en la esperanza de vida mundial tenga un límite (aunque la pandemia de COVID-19 haya supuesto un bache en el camino) ¿pero podría tenerlo en un futuro próximo? ¿Existe una barrera biológica infranqueable que nos impida superar cierta edad? Esta pregunta se ha repetido en innumerables ocasiones entre los científicos y aún hoy sigue dando lugar a un intenso debate: no hay todavía una respuesta clara y contundente debido a los limitados datos con los que contamos. A un lado están los investigadores que defienden que existe un límite en la edad que puede alcanzar una persona (que se situaría en torno a los 120 años). En el otro se encuentran aquellos que afirman que no existe una barrera biológica concreta.

Todo lo que sabemos con certeza en este asunto es que la persona más longeva documentada vivió 122 años y 164 días y que desde 1997 nadie ha conseguido batir este récord biológico por ahora. Más allá de este dato clave la investigación de centenarios y supercentenarios nos ha dado pistas interesantes sobre qué factores son importantes en el proceso de envejecer.

Por ejemplo las mujeres cuentan con una ventaja indiscutible en el terreno de la longevidad extrema. El 80% de las personas centenarias y el 90% de las supercentenarias son mujeres. Este fenómeno no se debe solo a diferencias en estilos de vida (por ejemplo: los hombres suelen consumir más alcohol y tabaco) sino también a factores genéticos (presencia de doble cromosoma X) y hormonales (estrógenos). Más allá del sexo biológico los supercentenarios parecen tener pocos rasgos en común exceptuando dos detalles importantes: ninguno de ellos había sido obeso y la absoluta mayoría no era fumadora o fumaba muy poco.

Por otra parte las investigaciones más recientes indican que hay dos factores esenciales que tienen un gran peso a la hora de determinar nuestra potencial longevidad: los genes y los estilos de vida. Así alcanzar los 70-75 años depende en un 70% de nuestros hábitos relacionados con la salud: práctica de ejercicio físico dieta estrés calidad del sueño consumo de sustancias tóxicas... Sin embargo conforme se van cumpliendo más años el peso de los estilos de vida va siendo cada vez menor. De esta forma sobrepasar los 100 años de edad es una hazaña que pasa a depender principalmente de los genes (en un 70%). Es decir en la “lotería” de la longevidad humana hay ciertas personas que cuentan con muchas más papeletas desde el nacimiento para convertirse en centenarias o supercentenarias.

La clave está en el ADN

En cualquier caso aún queda mucho por descubrir en el terreno de la genética de las personas más ancianas pero vamos poco a poco aprendiendo más detalles. Por ejemplo parece que los individuos que poseen ciertas variantes de genes encargados de la reparación de daños del ADN están más protegidos frente a enfermedades asociadas al envejecimiento. Esto probablemente se debe a que las mutaciones en sus células se reparan de forma más efectiva retrasando los efectos del envejecimiento.

En los últimos años varios multimillonarios de Silicon Valley entre los que destacan Larry Page (cofundador de Google) Jeff Bezos (fundador de Amazon) o Peter Thiel (cofundador de Paypal) se han decidido a invertir parte de su fortuna en la investigación de la extensión de la vida humana. Estas acciones suponen un gran impulso financiero a un campo de la ciencia que ha tenido hasta hace poco escasa relevancia a pesar de que las sociedades occidentales con un envejecimiento progresivo lo miran cada vez con mayor interés.

Conseguir tratamientos que logren no solo sumar años a la vida sino también añadir vida saludable a los años sería un gran alivio para las poblaciones que en las próximas décadas sufrirán el gran impacto de las enfermedades asociadas a la edad como el alzhéimer el cáncer la artrosis los ictus e infartos la osteoporosis...

El sueño: vivir lo máximo posible

¿Qué hemos aprendido en las últimas décadas sobre la longevidad? La moraleja del conjunto de investigaciones científicas podría resumirse de la siguiente manera: Ahora sabemos mucho más sobre los complejos procesos moleculares que están detrás del envejecimiento hasta tal punto que podemos extender de forma considerable la vida de multitud de animales de laboratorio incluyendo a gusanos moscas ratones ratas... Sin embargo este éxito es por ahora esquivo en los seres humanos. ¿Por qué? Un factor clave en esta historia es la diferente biología entre dichos animales y nosotros. Algunos científicos proponen que quizás los humanos ya contamos de por sí con una esperanza de vida bastante amplia comparada con otras muchas especies y por tanto el margen de maniobra que tenemos para expandir la vida humana es pequeño. No obstante esta posible explicación es solo una pequeña parte de los múltiples obstáculos en el camino para aumentar nuestra longevidad.

La absoluta mayoría de los diferentes tratamientos que se han aplicado a modelos animales para alargar de forma extraordinaria su vida son totalmente experimentales y su aplicación en el ser humano no estaría hoy por hoy justificada para este incierto fin. Muchas son terapias muy arriesgadas con potenciales efectos adversos graves. Precisamente por eso y porque estos tratamientos no se usarían para tratar a personas que sufren enfermedades sino a individuos sanos los comités éticos no aprobarían aún el uso de casi ninguno de ellos en ensayos clínicos. Así las modificaciones genéticas para expandir los telómeros (extremos de los cromosomas) o para activar o silenciar genes específicos que han tenido mucho éxito al alargar la vida de diversos animales no son una opción por ahora en los humanos. Otras estrategias como administrar ciertos fármacos que destruyen las células envejecidas (llamados fármacos senolíticos) o que activan/inhiben ciertas rutas moleculares también cosechan muy buenos resultados en los animales de laboratorio pero aún es pronto para trasladar muchas de sus aplicaciones a los humanos por las incógnitas que las rodean. No obstante existen varias excepciones entre las que destaca la rapamicina.

La rapamicina es un fármaco muy peculiar descubierto en la isla de Pascua. Esta molécula inhibe una proteína con multitud de funciones llamada mTOR y se ha usado ampliamente en medicina como fármaco inmunosupresor para evitar el rechazo de órganos trasplantados. Además múltiples investigaciones en el laboratorio han comprobado que la administración crónica de rapamicina frena el envejecimiento y reduce el riesgo de cáncer en animales. La larga experiencia de uso clínico de este fármaco y los alentadores resultados conseguidos en varias especies animales han permitido que se apruebe su uso en ensayos clínicos a dosis bajas con el fin de frenar el envejecimiento.

Alcanzar los 75 años depende en un 70% de nuestros hábitos. Pero la hazaña de convertirse en centenario es sobre todo responsabilidad de los genes

Todavía es pronto para saber si la rapamicina es beneficiosa (los ensayos realizados cuentan con pocos participantes son de corta duración y están en fases 1 y 2) pero se trata de una de las moléculas más prometedoras en la actualidad para frenar el envejecimiento. Muchos otros compuestos como vitaminas y diferentes antioxidantes han ido fracasando en los últimos tiempos a la hora de ofrecer beneficios para la salud a corto plazo por lo que nada indica que vayan a ayudar frente al envejecimiento. Otros fármacos que también se están investigando para averiguar su efectividad clínica son la metformina (usada en medicina para tratar la diabetes) medicamentos senolíticos como el dasatinib (empleado contra el cáncer) y antioxidantes como la quercetina.

Otro detalle práctico que dificulta en gran medida conocer si una terapia es efectiva para retrasar el envejecimiento en el ser humano es precisamente nuestra larga esperanza de vida. En el laboratorio se emplean animales que suelen tener esperanzas de vida de semanas meses o escasos años por lo que es sencillo y rápido comprobar si una determinada estrategia tiene éxito en expandir su vida. En los humanos que pueden vivir más allá de 70-80 años todo se vuelve irremediablemente lento y es mucho más complicado averiguar si algo es efectivo o no para retrasar el envejecimiento. De hecho es posible que hoy contemos con medidas que podrían ser útiles para extender la vida en el ser humano pero no podemos saberlo con certeza porque no ha pasado suficiente tiempo como para confirmarlo.

Nuestra larga esperanza de vida hace difícil saber si una terapia antienvejecimiento funciona: necesitamos muchos años para comprobarlo

Una estrategia que podría quizás resultar eficaz para retrasar hasta cierto punto el envejecimiento es la restricción calórica (reducción de las calorías consumidas en comparación con una dieta normal). Gracias a una ingesta calórica limitada se ha conseguido que múltiples especies animales extiendan su vida de forma significativa. Sin embargo los beneficios a largo plazo de restringir las calorías de la dieta en humanos son un misterio por la sencilla razón de que aún no ha pasado suficiente tiempo en los ensayos clínicos que se están realizando para averiguarlo.

¿Las calorías importan?

Aunque no sabemos todavía si la restricción calórica u otras dietas restrictivas como por ejemplo el ayuno intermitente tienen alguna utilidad para frenar el envejecimiento sí se están viendo en estudios clínicos ciertos indicios de beneficios para la salud. Por ejemplo: después de reducir un 15% la ingesta calórica en individuos durante dos años se observó que el estrés oxidativo disminuía. Este dato podría resultar importante pues el estrés oxidativo está implicado en multitud de enfermedades asociadas al envejecimiento. Por otro lado también se ha visto que este tipo de dieta era efectivo a la hora de reducir el riesgo de depósitos de lípidos en los vasos sanguíneos (un proceso denominado aterosclerosis).

Así pues mientras las investigaciones con animales y los ensayos en humanos siguen su curso las opciones que tenemos a nuestra disposición para poner freno al envejecimiento o al menos envejecer con más salud no son precisamente vanguardistas pero sí ampliamente recomendadas: ejercicio físico frecuente dieta saludable limitación del estrés diario buena calidad del sueño y nada de consumo de alcohol tabaco y otras drogas. Puede que estas acciones no nos garanticen vivir más allá de los 110 años (para ello los genes tienen que estar de nuestro lado) pero sí incrementarán las posibilidades de vivir más y mejor.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiRGh0dHBzOi8vcmF6b25wdWJsaWNhLmNvbS9sYS1zZWd1cmlkYWQtY2l1ZGFkYW5hLWxhLXNlZ3VyaWRhZC1odW1hbmEv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,De la seguridad ciudadana a la seguridad humana,"Hacia la seguridad humana

El nuevo gobierno anuncia un cambio en el enfoque de seguridad tradicional: del enfoque de seguridad ciudadana que está a cargo de múltiples actores y se ha consolidado desde la década del 90 Colombia pasaría hacia otro enfoque centrado en la seguridad humana.

El enfoque de seguridad humana incidiría en la seguridad nacional. Esta está a cargo de las Fuerzas Militares y se concentra en la defensa de la integridad y la soberanía del territorio nacional.

No se sabe todavía cuál será el desarrollo conceptual de la seguridad humana bajo el nuevo gobierno menos aún cómo se plasmará este enfoque en medidas concretas de muy distinta índole. A título inicial se ha anunciado que:

El gobierno se concentrará en proteger más la vida para que las personas vivan tranquilas y sin miedo;

Se eliminará la doctrina del “enemigo interno” heredada de la Guerra Fría (en armonía con las recomendaciones del informe de la Comisión de la Verdad);

Se hará más énfasis en la prevención que en la represión del delito y

Se modernizará la Fuerza Pública entre otras medidas anunciadas.

Un proyecto ambicioso

Por lo visto el gobierno comprende la seguridad humana como un instrumento de protección integral que impulsará la llegada del Estado a los territorios excluidos.

De esta manera la “seguridad humana” orientaría los varios aspectos o elementos pertinente del Plan Nacional de Desarrollo el rediseño institucional y el modelo de gestión de la seguridad ciudadana en el plano nacional y en el subnacional.

Por lo tanto tendrán que definirse los nuevos responsables funciones y competencias; cambiarían los mecanismos de coordinación habría que actualizar el marco normativo la gestión de la información y otros muchos elementos.

Cambiarían las políticas y lo más importante se espera que lo anterior ocasione efectos positivos para las personas.

No es tema nuevo ni es partidista

La versión más conocida de la “seguridad humana· proviene del Informe de Desarrollo Humano que publicó el Programa de Naciones Unidas para el Desarrollo (PNUD) en 1994.

Este enfoque se contrapone a la visión tradicional de seguridad estado-céntrica. Engloba las preocupaciones de la gente del común y afirma que seguridad es proteger contra todo tipo de amenazas —la violencia el delito el hambre el desempleo la represión los riesgos ambientales…—. La sensación de inseguridad —entonces— resulta más de preocupaciones de la vida que del peligro de nuevas guerras.

De acuerdo con el PNUD este nuevo enfoque incluye los siguientes elementos:

La seguridad humana es una preocupación universal puesto que existen amenazas comunes (y en aumento) contra las personas —como el desempleo y la contaminación—.

La seguridad humana tiene siete componentes interdependientes seguridad alimentaria seguridad económica seguridad de salud seguridad personal seguridad ambiental seguridad de la comunidad seguridad política.

La prevención temprana es más eficaz y menos costosa que la intervención posterior para velar por la seguridad humana.

La seguridad humana pone a las personas en el centro de las políticas. Se preocupa por la forma de vivir de la gente la libertad para avanzar en su proyecto de vida el grado de acceso al mercado y a las oportunidades sociales la vida en conflicto o en paz.

Paralelo a esta conceptualización han existido diversos debates académicos y evolución teórica alrededor de las teorías del desarrollo (desarrollo humano) los estudios de paz y conflicto y la seguridad humana ampliando aún más el concepto (Thomas 1987; Buzan 1991; Tickner 1992; Baldwin 1997; De La Lama 1998; Hurrell 1998; Kornblith 2002 etc.).

Fleck has drawn plenty of headlines heading into the Sept. 1 opener between Minnesota and New Mexico State but Fleck's not feeding the controversy with retaliatory words.

Kill has been boisterous leading up to Thursday's matchup saying he's not sure if he'll shake Fleck's hand after the game. Fleck was asked about those comments during a press conference on Friday and said he's always shaken the hand of an opposing head coach.

""There's a tradition that goes 100 years ago of coaches meeting at midfield"" Fleck said. ""It has nothing to do with this but I've been a head coach [for] 10 years and I haven't not shaken one head coach's hand in my entire career.""

In the event Kill doesn't oblige Fleck showed a sense of humor.

""I may have had to go find a guy."" Fleck said.

There's a chance Fleck may have to go through the tunnels of Huntington Bank Stadium to get his handshake on Thursday night. Kill coached the Gophers for four-plus seasons but stepped down after seven games in 2015 due to complications from epilepsy.

Kill tabbed his defensive coordinator Tracy Claeys as his successor though Claeys was fired after one full season and replaced by Fleck who is 35-23 in six seasons at Minnesota. Kill believes Fleck treated his remaining staff members unfairly and trashed the culture that he built with the Gophers.

Meanwhile Kill has held several roles since his departure. He was the interim head coach at TCU after Gary Patterson was fired last fall and was then hired as the head coach at New Mexico State this offseason setting up a grudge match against Fleck and the Gophers in the season opener.

(Aug. 27 2022) — HII (NYSE: HII) America’s only builder of nuclear-powered aircraft carriers and leading provider of mission-driven defense technologies celebrated the ceremonial keel-laying of aircraft carrier Enterprise (CVN 80) at its Newport News Shipbuilding division today.

U.S. Olympic gold medalists Simone Biles and Katie Ledecky are the ship’s sponsors. Ledecky attended in person while Biles participated via video as the pair marked the important first milestone in construction of the aircraft carrier.

During the ceremony Biles and Ledecky’s initials were welded onto a steel plate that will be permanently affixed to the ship signifying the sponsors’ enduring relationship with the shipbuilders and crew.

In his remarks Under Secretary of the Navy Erik Raven stressed the significance of aircraft carriers calling upon shipbuilders to recognize the importance of what they build.

“Our aircraft carriers would not be possible without the designers and builders right here at Newport News Shipbuilding” Raven said. “Every team member here at Newport News can be certain that each cut of steel every wrench turned and every challenge encountered to build her were steps toward strengthening our naval and national greatness — especially when this ship sails the open seas to protect our nation’s interests.”

NNS President Jennifer Boykin spoke highly of the skilled shipbuilders constructing Enterprise highlighting their commitment to the Navy and our nation as the only shipyard capable of building nuclear-powered aircraft carriers.

“These hardworking women and men take 100000 tons of steel and technology and make it not only float but serve as home workplace and shield for our Navy’s sailors” Boykin told the crowd. “Shipbuilding takes discipline precision and an unrelenting drive for excellence which we can never let falter because our sailors and their families depend on us.”

Boykin also recognized all the veterans in attendance from previous U.S. Navy ships that have been named Enterprise including CV 6 and CVN 65 both built at NNS. CVN 80 will be the ninth U.S. Navy vessel to carry on the name Enterprise. The most recent CVN 65 was the first nuclear-powered aircraft carrier in history. Already 20000 pounds of steel from CVN 65 have been incorporated into modules for CVN 80. When fully constructed more than 35000 pounds of steel from CVN 65 will live on in CVN 80 ensuring the Enterprise legacy continues.

CVN 80 is the third Gerald R. Ford-class aircraft carrier. Designed to replace Nimitz-class carriers the Ford class features a new nuclear power plant a redesigned island electromagnetic catapults improved weapons movement an enhanced flight deck to support increased operational efficiency and growth margin for future technologies.

As America recognizes the 100-year legacy of aircraft carriers this year all aircraft carriers operating in the U.S. Navy fleet today were built at NNS. Enterprise is the first aircraft carrier not only designed digitally but also being built digitally using visual work instructions on laptops and tablets rather than paper drawings. Construction processes on Ford-class carriers including Enterprise are enabled by workforce learning that took place on USS Gerald R. Ford (CVN 78) and John F. Kennedy (CVN 79). Enterprise is the first of a two-carrier block buy for the Navy with work also underway at NNS on the second Doris Miller (CVN 81).

The volume and impact of data breaches have accelerated largely in 2022 which has contributed to many adverse effects for businesses. Tc highlights several updated factors that have generated great costs across 17 countries and regions and 17 industries. The report has included new related areas of analysis such as:

Extended Detection and Response (XDR).

Risk Quantification techniques.

Technologies that contribute to a zero trust security framework - Identity and Access Management (IAM) and Multifactor Authentication (MFA).

The 2022 report records the highest global cost increase incurred by data breaches over all the previous years. The average global cost of a data breach reached USD 4.35 million which is a 12.7% increase from the last year and the highest ever noted across the history of IBM reports. For the 12th year in a row the United States is the topmost country reported as the costliest with the average total cost of a data breach of USD 9.44 million. The second highest is the Middle East Region at USD 7.46 million. Germany is in fifth place with the lowest cost of 4.85 million.

The top three industries affected by the costs of data breaches listed in this report are healthcare financial and pharmaceuticals. The healthcare industry represented first place of USD 10.10 million a 9.4% increase from the previous year. The financial sector listed the second place of USD 5.97 million in costs endured with a 4.4% increase than 2021. The average total cost decreased slightly in the pharmaceutical industry of USD 5.01 million. Each of these are part of critical infrastructure sectors. As a result of the costs endured by the organizations from the data breaches a majority of 60% of organizations increased the prices of their services and products for the consumer to bear.

The top four initial attack vectors of data breaches in the 2022 report are indicated in the same order as the previous 2021 report. The most common initial attack vector reported was compromised credentials of 19% at an average cost of USD 4.50 million. Phishing attacks accounted for 16% of breaches costing USD 4.91 million. The rest of the initial attack vectors such as cloud misconfiguration of 15% and third-party software vulnerabilities of 13% were classified in order.

A positive sign is noticed of multiple cost factors decreasing the cost of data breaches in the report. For example AI platforms decreased the cost of a data breach by an average of USD 300075 from the mean cost of a data breach of USD 4.35 million. DevSecOps approaches decreased costs averaging USD 276124 and for the third factor the formation of an Incident Response (IR) team decreased the average breach costs by USD 252897. Considering AI automated security controls fully deployed automated security measures have lower costs of USD 3.15 million than measures where there is no automation security procedure involved. Instances where no AI security and automation were adopted had a higher cost of USD 6.20 million. Organizations that had fully deployed automated AI security controls detected and contained a breach two and a half months earlier on average than organizations that had no security controls deployed.

Cloud security and Remote work

Organizations that had mature cloud security procedures showed a cost decrease of more than half a million dollars over those in the early stages of securing their cloud environments. The highest maturity level in the application of cloud security practices reported a cost of USD 3.87 million while the lowest maturity level in cloud security practices where no controls are used had a higher cost of USD 4.59 million.

When remote work environments were considered as a factor causing the data breach the cost was calculated as USD 4.99 million which is more than half a million dollars higher than the global average. When it wasn`t considered as a factor causing the data breach the cost was calculated as USD 4.02 million.

New Key Cost Factors

XDR technologies

For the first time in the history of the IBM report Extended Detection and Response (XDR) technologies are analyzed. Organizations that have deployed XDR technologies experienced an average lower cost of USD 4.15 million than the organizations that haven`t deployed XDR technologies. Those non-XDR companies experienced a cost of USD 4.55 million which is above the global average cost of a data breach.

Incident Response (IR)

This year`s report also focuses on the usage of IR teams and testing of IR plans. The employment of both methods has shown a significant low cost of USD 3.26 million from the average cost of a data breach while having no IR team or IR testing mechanisms resulted in a massive cost of USD 5.92 million.

Risk quantification

Risk quantification methodologies focus on the financial impacts losses and the availability of data with data integrity. Such factors are very beneficial for CISOs risk managers and security teams for quantification of those risks into financial means. Risk quantification has saved USD 2.10 million on average which is USD 3.30 million while not using any risk quantification procedures has provoked a cost of USD 5.40 million.

Zero trust

The impact of the zero trust security framework on data breaches is analyzed for the second time since the prior year’s report. Organizations saved nearly 1 million dollars in costs by having zero trust deployed. Organizations that had a zero trust framework had an average cost of USD 4.15 million while organizations that didn`t reported a cost of USD 5.10 million.

Conclusion

Many millions of dollars were lost due to data breaches spanning across 17 different countries and 17 different industries. The report highlights that the lack of security controls and procedures is a dominant cause for all the losses created by these data breaches. The global costs have reached an all-time high which brings attention to the need for better solid considerations regarding the security of the industries and organizations.

The new key cost factors that have been analyzed in this year`s report also show good signs of reducing many of the losses. This brings us to the conclusion that the advancement of various attack vectors and the technologies that are targeted for data breaches are increasing and are becoming more complicated than ever. However the report also shows that the adoption of various technological security procedures like automated AI security DevSecOps IR teams and plans have all contributed to decreasing many of the costs.

Cornell Financial Engineering Manhattan’s 2022 Future Of Finance Conference Speaker Profile: Dr. Paul Burchard Head of R&D Goldman Sachs

Paul Burchard is a Managing Director and Head of Research & Development for Goldman Sachs.

He focuses on the conception and development of creative mathematical ideas that advance leading-edge areas of technology and finance Paul also designs and develops software to implement those ideas.

Prior to Goldman Sachs at the University of California Paul invented algorithms for the manufacture of integrated circuits with features smaller than the wavelength of light used to illuminate the lithographic masks. One conceptual advance was to show that the wavelength of light doesn’t actually limit the size of patterns that can be imaged if we can have multiple exposures. When the desired pattern is smaller than the wavelength. The mask does not look like the pattern but must instead become discovered by solving an inverse problem. To solve inverse problems efficiently invented an algorithm for fast incremental convolution based on the concept of fractal space-filling curves. This algorithm is as fundamental as the famous FFT which allows fast convolution.

As a visiting Assistant Professor at UC Paul invented the correct equation for processing vector data with features; for example removing noise from color images containing edges. This equation is known as “Color TV” and has many applications.

Prior when Paul was at Princeton as a Research Fellow

He invented a more realistic notion of fuzzy string matching and efficient algorithms for finding such matches. Standard fuzzy matching only allows for single-character differences. But both human-generated text and biological genes evolve by large block operations as well.

Lastly Paul received his Doctorate in Mathematics from the University of Chicago & received his AB in Math & Physics from Washington University in St. Louis.

Ruchir Puri is CTO and chief architect of IBM Watson an IBM Fellow and currently Chief Scientist of IBM Research. He is a Fellow of the IEEE a member of IBM Academy of Technology and IBM Master Inventor an ACM Distinguished Speaker and IEEE Distinguished Lecturer. Ruchir received Semiconductor Research Corporation‘s outstanding mentor award.

Ruchir was a visiting scientist at the Dept. of Computer Science Stanford University CA and an adjunct professor at the Dept. of Electrical Engineering Columbia University NY and was awarded John Von-Neumann Chair at Institute of Discrete Mathematics at Bonn University Germany. Furthermore Ruchir received the 2014 Asian American Engineer of the Year Award. Moreover he has delivered numerous keynotes and invited talks at major software and hardware conferences. He is an inventor of over 50 United States patents and has authored over 100 publications as well as authored a book on Analyzing Analytics.

Dr. Paul Burchard Head Of R&D Goldman Sachs & Dr. Ruchir Puri Chief Scientist IBM Research On The Future of Machine Learning",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTWh0dHBzOi8vd2FzaGluZ3Rvbm1vbnRobHkuY29tLzIwMjIvMDgvMjgvZHVhbC1lbnJvbGxtZW50LXByb2dyYW1zLWxvdy1pbmNvbWUv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,A Job and a College Degree Before You Graduate High School,"Illias Gomez thought he was doing pretty well for himself when he got a part-time job as a host at a local Olive Garden during his sophomore year in high school.

“It was my first job so I thought I was making a lot of money” Gomez recalls of the position which paid $10 an hour.

His perspective changed when—in the summer of 2021 before his senior year—he landed an internship at IBM making $21.50 an hour working on media and entertainment projects for the company. The higher wage not only more than doubled his salary but also proved life-changing for Illias and his family who reside in Mesquite Texas just outside of Dallas.

Check out the complete 2022 Washington Monthly rankings here.

For starters the job came with a $750 stipend for home office equipment. Gomez used the stipend and his salary to buy an L-shaped desk and two computers to create a home studio. The studio serves as a sanctuary where he can pursue his lifelong dream of becoming a video game developer—a dream that goes back to when he was a four-year-old playing God of War on his uncle’s PlayStation 2.

He also saved up to buy himself a car—a blue 2004 Honda Civic EX. He bought his stepdad a heat press machine for their fledgling custom T-shirt business. And he bought his mom a manicure nail table so instead of shelling out money to local nail salons she could do her nails at home as well as those of her family and friends.

At 32 hours a week the IBM internship essentially made Illias a breadwinner for his family overnight even if only for that summer.

“I never expected this early in my life to be paid that much” Gomez told me during an interview in a second-floor conference room at Emmett J. Conrad High School located in the city’s Vickery Meadow neighborhood a densely populated area that is home to many immigrants and refugees from around the world.

“That money really helped out” he said. When his mother a building code officer for the city of Dallas heard how much his salary was “she was surprised because she was like ‘You’re close to making as much as I’m making.’ ”

Gomez landed his lucrative IBM internship through a program called P-TECH which stands for Pathways in Technology Early College High School. Not only does P-TECH connect high school students to employment opportunities in promising fields it also offers them the chance to take college courses while in high school and to earn credits toward both—a concept called dual enrollment. For Gomez it meant that when he graduated this past May from Conrad High at the age of 18 he also had an associate’s degree in applied science in interactive simulation and game technology. He didn’t have to pay a dime. His mother was so inspired by Illias’s example that she decided to go back to college herself.

Dual enrollment is one of the most encouraging trends in higher education. Such programs have been shown to boost college attendance and reduce the time it takes for students to earn postsecondary degrees and vocational certificates. One of the abiding problems however is that students of color and from lower-income families tend to be underrepresented. Historically dual enrollees have typically been whiter wealthier and already high achievers academically.

What makes P-TECH different is that as a nonselective program it serves lower-income minority students many of whom weren’t doing well in school—like Gomez. The program does that in various innovative ways: by giving the high school students a new identity as college students capable of doing college work by providing them with jobs in a field they’re passionate about and by connecting them with businesses in search of an educated workforce.

The success P-TECH has shown with students like Gomez has helped it spread rapidly—from a single school in Brooklyn where it was launched in 2011 to 210 today throughout the United States (and many others in several countries from Morocco to Singapore to Australia).

But that growth pales in comparison to the potential interest. There are more than 21000 public high schools in the United States meaning that only about 1 percent of America’s high schools have the program. Even in Dallas where 18 high schools participate in P-TECH demand far outstrips supply. At Conrad High for instance there were twice as many applicants as there are spots at the school in the fall of 2022.

One limiting factor not surprisingly is cost. High schools and colleges foot the bill for administering the program and employers have to be persuaded to see the value in student interns’ work enough to come up with the money for their salaries. For the program to become available to all students a national-level investment would help tremendously.

The program’s first school known simply as P-TECH High School launched in 2011 in Brooklyn as a collaboration between IBM the New York City Department of Education and the City University of New York (CUNY). It was the brainchild of Stanley Litow then an executive at IBM who designed P-TECH as a special education project for the company. Litow says he wanted to help improve students’ lifetime earnings and to address the “skills gap”—that is the gulf between available jobs that require certain skills and the people who have the education necessary to fill those jobs.

“Those who go into the workforce with a postsecondary degree will earn $1 million more over their lives than those with only a high school diploma” Litow says using an oft-cited statistic about the value of a college degree.

There are more than 21000 public high schools in the United States and only about 1 percent of them offer the P-TECH program. A national-level investment could help spread it.

From the beginning Litow aimed to create a model that could be broadly replicated everywhere. Seeing that some similar programs had limited their own growth by restricting admissions to high-achieving students Litow decided to avoid that pitfall with P-TECH. “For that reason we resisted suggestions to restrict admissions to only the highest-achieving students and made admissions open to all” Litow told me recently. “Had that not been done its success would have been marginalized because it only worked for high achievers.”

In fall 2011 104 students dual enrolled at P-TECH High in Brooklyn and the New York City College of Technology better known as City Tech which is part of CUNY. Among those students 16 became the first to take a college course in summer 2012. They took math and computer science classes and worked toward associate’s degrees in computer systems and electromechanical engineering.

By fall 2013 there were 82 students dual enrolled and in an average of five college courses.

President Barack Obama gave P-TECH a shout-out in his 2013 State of the Union address and visited the high school later that year praising it as “a ticket into the middle class [that’s] available to everybody who’s willing to work for it.” He added “And that’s the way it should be.”

Another world leader toured Brooklyn P-TECH the following year: Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott who became the first to expand the program outside the U.S. Since then 26 nations have followed.

The discussion to implement P-TECH in the Dallas Independent School District began in 2015 on the sixth floor of a Bank of America building in the city’s downtown. It was Michael Hinojosa’s second stint as superintendent of schools in Dallas. Two high schools that had previously been in danger of being taken over by the state had found success by adopting an early college model but the district hadn’t seen fit to take up P-TECH—at least not yet.

Gathered around the table with Hinojosa were representatives from the county government the rail system the county hospital and the Dallas County Community College District. As Hinojosa recalls Joe May now chancellor emeritus of the community college district said “Hey we’ve heard of this P-TECH model and we’d like to see if you’d be interested in taking this thing to scale to put it at all your high schools.”

“And I said ‘Well sounds interesting. Absolutely let me do a little investigating’ ” Hinojosa told me. “ ‘Let me talk to my team.’ ”

Hinojosa consulted with his central office staff and had them organize a trip to New York City to learn more about the original P-TECH. Based on their research they altered the program slightly to fit Dallas students’ needs adopting a four-year model rather than the six-year plan used in New York. Six months later the Dallas school district launched eight P-TECH schools for the 2016–17 school year. It launched another 10 the following year. The school district set aside $25.5 million each year to set up the infrastructure for the program and the community college ponied up the rest through tuition waivers totaling roughly $24 million a year.

President Obama praised P-TECH in his 2013 State of the Union address as “a ticket into the middle class [that’s] available to everybody who’s willing to work for it.”

Since 2016 the program has grown from eight schools to 18. In the 2020–21 school year 5835 students were on one of 36 “career pathways” that include health sciences business administration and management information technology engineering and hospitality management.

In 2021 12th-grade Dallas P-TECH students had earned an average of roughly 56 dual credit hours apiece along with good money from a growing roster of industry partners. “It just took off” Hinojosa said. “It’s been nothing short of phenomenal.”

In order to become a success Dallas P-TECH needed to build strong ties to business. Corporate partners don’t make financial contributions to P-TECH beyond paying interns’ wages. Instead they offer mentoring and internships—or as Hinojosa likes to say some “love.” The Dallas school district started with about 25 industry partners including AT&T and Microsoft and now has close to 100 from Cisco Systems Inc. to PepsiCo/Frito-Lay. The roster includes several airlines and big banks and tech giants a list that stands out for both the sheer number of industry partners and their diversity which offers opportunities to kids with a wide range of interests.

Hinojosa told me students are landing great jobs at major U.S. companies. “American Airlines just hired 11 kids out of one high school making $58000 a year with a 401k and free flights all over America” he said. “And every one of them [is] Latino or African American.”

So what’s the case for businesses to get involved?

In 2016 Ed Magnin director of development at Magnin & Associates a Dallas-based video game developer and a Conrad High School partner joined Dallas P-TECH motivated by the chance to help prepare and shape the workforce he needed. (Dallas College officials for their part say employers routinely make suggestions about what courses will benefit new hires.)

“If we can turn out students that have skills that are in demand in industry that’s one reason for [companies] to volunteer to work with the schools” Magnin told me. “It’s also something the Chamber of Commerce can sell to companies as to why they should move here: We have good schools and our students are earning college credit while they’re still in high school.”

Beyond that Magnin said businesses like his can better afford to pay fair wages when they’re hiring entry-level workers straight out of high school. Magnin & Associates takes on two interns per semester. One such intern was Gomez who worked for Magnin as a tester finding bugs and glitches in video games before he landed the internship at IBM.

Hinojosa observes that not all jobs require a four-year degree. P-TECH gives an advantage to high school graduates who might struggle to earn an associate’s degree if they had to do it on their own as adults rather than during high school.

“These industry partners are so happy with this because now they see a ready workforce” Hinojosa said. “And now they’re thinking about ‘Do you really need a full bachelor’s degree to work at American Airlines or Accenture?’ Because these kids can do all these things that they never had any idea they could do.”

Remarkably in 2021 about a third of students who earned an associate’s degree that year in Dallas had failed their eighth-grade exam. “They shouldn’t have even been in high school” said Hinojosa who completed his last year with the district in June 2022. According to a recent study of the program such turnaround stories are typical for P-TECH students. An April 2022 evaluation by MDRC—a nonprofit nonpartisan education and social policy research organization—found that P-TECH schools in New York City were “particularly successful at helping students at risk of underperforming in high school achieve important academic milestones.”

The evaluation found that “in particular [P-TECH] increased dual enrollment for this group of students which may be significant since prior research has found that students who take college courses while in high school are more likely to both enroll in college and complete postsecondary education degrees.” MDRC plans to release a final report on P-TECH in New York including a cost study in 2023.

Statistics show that Illias Gomez has plenty of company among his fellow high schoolers who benefited from P-TECH. Of all the Dallas high school students who got two-year degrees or earned 60 dual credit hours in 2020–21 71 percent were P-TECH students.

“This past year in the pandemic 910 kids—actually 910 is 10 percent of our senior class—graduated from high school with an associate’s degree for free” Hinojosa told me. “No debt.”

Today much like Gomez not only are Dallas high school students earning college degrees along with their high school diplomas but they’re also making good money while still in high school. In summer 2021 more than 400 Dallas public high school students got internships in which they earned an average of $17.50 per hour. Collectively they earned more than $1.6 million Dallas school data shows.

“The cool thing about this is our students are saying ‘I’m earning more than my mom. I don’t know what to do with this money’ ” says Sibu McNeal director of workplace learning at Dallas ISD P-TECH and Early College Programs. “These are good problems that we’re having now.”

Other school districts are looking at these results and following suit. In May 2022 on a visit to Conrad High I met a group of education leaders from Chicago who had come to learn more about how they could implement P-TECH back in the Windy City. The group included Pedro Martinez the chief executive officer of Chicago Public Schools. Martinez told me he sees P-TECH in Dallas as a “very very strong model” and he hopes to soon pilot the program at 10 to 20 schools in Chicago. The city already has one P-TECH school Sarah E. Goode STEM Academy but Chicago’s educational leaders are thinking of greatly expanding the program. Martinez said “I think this is the future of education.”

Despite the interest from Chicago P-TECH is still a relatively rare model on the American educational landscape. Of the nation’s 15.3 million high school students only about 1.5 million are in dual enrollment programs according to researchers at Teachers College Columbia University. Less than 10 percent of those students are in P-TECH. Of those 1.5 million dual enrollment students the vast majority—particularly Black Hispanic and low-income students—do not earn anywhere near enough credits to graduate from high school with an associate’s degree the way Gomez did.

“In every state where we’ve looked at this the average number of dual enrollment credits students take before they graduate is small—usually around 6 to 9 credits or 2 to 3 courses” says Davis Jenkins a senior research scholar at the Community College Research Center at Teachers College. There aren’t reliable statistics for the average number of credits earned by P-TECH students—in part because the length of the program varies across the country—but in P-TECH’s birthplace New York City students are earning an average of 32 credits from State University of New York branches as they move from high school to college.

In fact Litow said P-TECH should have become more prevalent in Chicago years ago. It’s not for lack of trying—this won’t be the city’s first attempt at implementing the program. A district official says five early college high schools were established to “emulate” P-TECH in 2012 but Sarah E. Goode STEM Academy—a school that Time magazine praised in 2014 as “The School That Will Get You a Job”—was the only one that managed to stay true to the model.

Hinojosa told me Dallas P-TECH students are landing great jobs out of high school at companies like American Airlines making $58000 a year “and every one of them [is] Latino or African American.”

Different factors such as changes in leadership can sometimes make it difficult to bring even successful programs to scale Litow said. But more than that P-TECH could use federal support. Right now a patchwork of local school systems have adopted the model each figuring out on their own how to find funding and adapt the program to the needs of their communities. One idea Litow would like to see: Expand eligibility for Pell Grants so they cover dual enrolled students not just traditional college students. That move alone would “immediately” lead to more schools opening because it would take the tuition cost burden away from states and localities Litow said. Another similar move would be to open up federal work study grants which currently pay 70 to 75 percent of the wages that employers pay to students. That would bring in more industry partners to P-TECH programs. Another would be for the U.S. Labor Department to fund apprenticeships for more high school students.

All three of those changes would not eliminate costs for states and school districts Litow said but they would introduce a more efficient cost-sharing model that would help the program to expand. And over the long term he predicted it would save money by reducing the need for remedial courses increasing college completion and saving tax dollars by keeping graduates out of the social safety net.

During their first two years P-TECH students at Conrad High attend classes at their school that are taught by professors from the nearby Dallas College Richland Campus. Illias Gomez said one of his most memorable classes was a project development class taught by the adjunct game design professor Paul Lachowicz who taught students the ins and outs of using Unreal Engine an open 3D creation tool that people can use to make video games and movies. Gomez spent hours playing around in the engine under Lachowicz’s eye building worlds—and problem-solving skills—in the classroom.

Conrad’s upper-level students spend more and more time independently taking college courses. Gomez told me the experience taught him important lessons about time management. “No one’s telling you ‘You have to go to this class. You have to go to that class’ ” he said. “It’s like you know what time your class starts. You have to be there for your grade your attendance because even though you’re not paying for it you’re having that opportunity to have that class for free that could cost thousands of dollars as an adult.” The IBM job meanwhile was a sweet deal for reasons that transcend how much it paid. Unlike his restaurant host job or the days when he did yard work in his neighborhood to make money Gomez didn’t have to leave home.

“It was like working a real office job but from the comfort of our own home” he said. “Like it was almost a workshop. It’s like a giant workshop where we just learned different things about how it is to be a consultant as well as problem solving for a company.”

Gomez plans to take his studies in gaming beyond the next two years at the University of North Texas. He has his eyes on Southern Methodist University. There he hopes to join the Guildhall which bills itself as a “premier graduate-level video game development education program in the United States.”

Gomez has a keen sense of the role that P-TECH played in positioning him where he is today.

“P-TECH is one of those things where you look at it now and it may not be so big to you but later on it means pretty much the world because that’s when you realize that you not only saved yourself and your family a lot of money you saved yourself a lot of time” he told me. “And so it’s one of the things where there’s going to be some sacrifices but those sacrifices are what help you become the grown young adult that you will be.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiS2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxlZ2FjeS5jb20vdXMvb2JpdHVhcmllcy9uYW1lL2pvaG4tY2F0YWxkby1vYml0dWFyeT9pZD0zNjMyMjc2NNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,John Cataldo Obituary (2022) - Beacon NY - Libby Funeral and Cremation of White Plains - Beacon,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.legacy.com/us/obituaries/name/john-cataldo-obituary?id=36322764 on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiS2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxlZ2FjeS5jb20vdXMvb2JpdHVhcmllcy9uYW1lL2pvaG4tY2F0YWxkby1vYml0dWFyeT9pZD0zNjMyMjc2NNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMicGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJsZWVwaW5nY29tcHV0ZXIuY29tL25ld3Mvc2VjdXJpdHkvY2lzYS1wcmVwYXJlLW5vdy1mb3ItcXVhbnR1bS1jb21wdXRlcnMtbm90LXdoZW4taGFja2Vycy11c2UtdGhlbS_SAXRodHRwczovL3d3dy5ibGVlcGluZ2NvbXB1dGVyLmNvbS9uZXdzL3NlY3VyaXR5L2Npc2EtcHJlcGFyZS1ub3ctZm9yLXF1YW50dW0tY29tcHV0ZXJzLW5vdC13aGVuLWhhY2tlcnMtdXNlLXRoZW0vYW1wLw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,CISA: Prepare now for quantum computers not when hackers use them,"Although quantum computing is not commercially available CISA (Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency) urges organizations to prepare for the dawn of this new age which is expected to bring groundbreaking changes in cryptography and how we protect our secrets.

The agency published a paper earlier in the week calling for leaders to start preparing for the migration to stronger secret guarding systems exploring risk mitigation methods and participating in developing new standards.

Race to Quantum supremacy

Quantum computers are systems that harness quantum mechanics to perform much more powerful computations than are available today on systems that rely on binary (0 1) computations.

Experts in the field widely accept that the currently experimental quantum computers will achieve superiority over conventional systems by the end of the decade and will quickly render them obsolete with subsequent capability leaps.

This is expected to revolutionize research solve long-standing mathematical problems perform higher-level physics simulations and accelerate the development of artificial intelligence models.

The main negative implication of this quantum computing concerns the cryptography of secrets a fundamental element of information security.

Cryptographic schemes that are today considered secure will be cracked in mere seconds by quantum computers leaving persons companies and entire countries powerless against the computing supremacy of their adversaries.

“When quantum computers reach higher levels of computing power and speed they will be capable of breaking public key cryptography threatening the security of business transactions secure communications digital signatures and customer information” explains CISA.

This could threaten data in transit relating to top-secret communications banking operations military operations government meetings critical industrial processes and more.

Yesterday China's Baidu introduced “Qian Shi” an industry-level quantum supercomputer capable of achieving stable performance at 10 quantum bits of power.

Baidu also stated that it recently completed the design of a 36-qubit superconducting quantum chip with couplers which threatens to surpass the strength of the leading American quantum machine IonQ Aria which tops at 20 qubits.

Other companies in the race for quantum supremacy are Intel IBM Microsoft and Google all competing to advance the field.

Preparing for the new age

Research into quantum-secure encryption algorithms is already underway and NIST (National Institute of Standards and Technology) plans to publish official guidelines on the topic by the end of 2024.

Until then CISA recommends that all stakeholders follow the “post-quantum cryptography roadmap” which can be summarized in the following:

CEOs should increase their engagement with post-quantum standards developing organizations.

Organizations should inventory the most sensitive and critical datasets that must be secured for an extended amount of time.

Organizations should conduct an inventory of all the systems using cryptographic technologies for any function to facilitate a smooth transition in the future.

Cybersecurity officials within organizations should identify acquisition cybersecurity and data security standards that will require updating to reflect post-quantum requirements.

Organizations should identify where and for what purpose public key cryptography is being used and mark those systems as quantum vulnerable.

Prioritize one system over another for cryptographic transition based on the organization’s functions goals and needs.

Using the inventory and prioritization information organizations should develop a plan for systems transitions upon publication of the new post-quantum cryptographic standard.

“Do not wait until the quantum computers are in use by our adversaries to act. Early preparations will ensure a smooth migration to the post-quantum cryptography standard once it is available” concludes the agency."

L’Amerigo Vespucci considerata “la nave più bella del mondo” ha fatto tappa nel porto di Malta ben 11 anni dopo l’ultima volta. Il maestoso veliero della Marina Militare italiana è arrivato a Malta venerdì 26 agosto proveniente da Trapani e ha ormeggiato al Grand Harbour di La Valletta dov’è rimasta due giorni fino ad oggi quando è ripartita poco fa verso l’Italia diretta in Puglia.

A bordo ci sono 143 allievi della prima classe dell’Accademia Navale di Livorno di cui 13 stranieri provenienti dai 6 Paesi esteri: il 3 settembre a Taranto concluderanno il tirocinio pratico che ha avuto inizio i primi di luglio a Livorno dove si è svolto il loro “Battesimo del mare” lungo un tour estivo che li ha portati a Palermo Tunisi Algeri Lisbona Casablanca Cadige Trapani Malta appunto e adesso Manfredonia e infine Taranto.

Durante la sosta a Malta gli allievi hanno avuto la possibilità di visitare la città e accogliere ospiti a bordo durante le visite che hanno avuto un grande successo nella giornata di ieri conclusa poi con una serata di discoteca riservata agli allievi che hanno ballato fino a mezzanotte nell’area di poppa.

L’Amerigo Vespucci oggi guidata dal Comandante Massimiliano Siragusa è considerata la “nave più bella del mondo” per la straordinarietà delle opere d’arte che la adornano frutto dell’ingegno italiano: rappresenta un motivo d’orgoglio per gli appassionati italiani di mare e di navigazione anche perché rappresenta la Marina e dopo il tramonto illumina sempre i suoi tre alberi con la bandiera Tricolore.

Sono le lanterne volanti o mongolfiere di carta piccoli sacchetti di carta di riso con una candela a produrre il calore necessario per scaldare l’aria interna e farle volare. Originarie di alcune culture dell'estremo oriente queste lanterne sono piuttosto semplici da riconoscere. Il loro colore in genere è rossiccio e il loro movimento spesso è molto lento e piuttosto verticale anche se seguendo la direzione e la velocità dei venti può capitare di vederle sbandare all’improvviso. Queste lanterne normalmente ridiscendono altrettanto lentamente mano mano che la candela si consuma ma talvolta arrivano a terra ancora accese innescando incendi motivo per cui i regolamenti si stanno irrigidendo sul loro utilizzo.,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmlscmVzdG9kZWxjYXJsaW5vLml0L21vZGVuYS9jcm9uYWNhL3NiYXJjYS1wYXZhbmktZ3JvdXAtYXNzdW56aW9uaS1pbi12aXN0YS05NjhiZjA1ONIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,"Sbarca 'Pavani Group' ""Assunzioni in vista""","Per cogliere la continuità aziendale bisogna attendere la sera quando il prato disseminato di piante si illumina di colori che danno l’immagine di un bosco incantato. Ma è l’unico elemento che segna il passaggio di testimone tra vecchio e nuovo. Da lunedì i cancelli dello stabilimento un tempo sede della Martini Luce di Concordia riapriranno per accogliere d’ora in poi la Pavani Group società mantovana fondata da Maurizio Pavani che ne ha acquistato il marchio e la proprietà. Da mesi le ditte incaricate erano al lavoro per adeguare gli immobili del vecchio complesso industriale alle esigenze produttive della nuova proprietà. ""Il marchio Martini – ci dice Maurizio Pavani il titolare della omonima azienda che realizza da 25 anni impianti di segnalamento ferroviario e che si trasferisce dalla originaria sede nel mantovano – lo abbiamo mantenuto poiché confluisce nella parte illuminotecnica che facciamo per conto di Rete Ferroviaria Italiana con cui abbiamo iniziato approcci e presentato prodotti tuttora in corso di omologazione"".

Nel mese di agosto poi terminate le opere murarie ed impiantistiche è stata portata a compimento la migrazione di tutta la parte informatica e della strumentazione degli uffici dalla vecchia sede. Ora Pavani Group è pronta per essere ripiantata nel Modenese e per la sua rinascita che poggia soprattutto sulla partenza dei bandi previsti dal Pnrr per l’ammodernamento della mobilità su rotaia in Italia nonché sui profondi cambiamenti che hanno segnato il mondo ferroviario non più dominato da impianti elettromeccanici. Nella nuova azienda un reparto adibito a Museo mostrerà i cambiamenti intervenuti per quanto riguarda i sistemi di segnalamento ferroviario. ""Oggi – spiega Pavani - si parla di impianti digitali il cui know-how è posseduto solo dalle grandi multinazionali con le quali comunque noi lavoriamo da anni"". E’ guardando al futuro che Pavani Group ha deciso di spostare la sua sede e ampliarsi acquisendo la proprietà di questa vasta area di oltre 30.000 mq quindicimila dei quali coperti posti all’incrocio tra via per Mirandola e via Grandi in grado di soddisfare le esigenze di una impresa destinata a crescere non solo come fatturato ma anche come maestranze. ""Oggi siamo 86 – afferma Pavani – ma con le prospettive aperte dai fondi del Pnrr se chiudiamo le trattative avviate con le multinazionali partecipanti ai bandi la nostra azienda necessiterà di inserire 40-50 nuovi dipendenti. E per questo ci siamo organizzati per avere una struttura ampia dotata anche di aula magna per poter fare formazione"". L’inaugurazione sarà il 23 settembre presente il presidente della Regione Stefano Bonaccini ma il cammino verso il futuro di Pavani Group inizia domani.

ISOLA D'ELBA — Allerta meteo in corso per pioggia e temporali anche all'isola d'Elba per tutta la giornata di oggi.

Per il momento i temporali hanno lambito da lontano la costa di Portoferraio e comunque nonostante l'allerta meteo numerose persone oggi si sono ugualmente recate nelle spiagge dell'isola.

Sul gruppo Facebook Isola d’Elba info curiosità vacanze e foto e su alcuni profili sono state pubblicate varie immagini del temporale visto in lontananza.

Ecco qua sotto alcuni scatti.

In coda all'estate Alberobello ritrova il suo LiFe - Light festival che fino a domenica 4 settembre illumina alcuni dei suoi scorci più emblematici grazie alle creazioni di una serie di artisti internazionali. È la ripresa dopo il lungo fermo imposto dall'emergenza sanitaria legata alla pandemia da Covid-19 e le luci che ogni sera dal tramonto a mezzanotte (a partire dalle 21) animeranno la cittadina riconosciuta patrimonio dell'Unesco - merito dei suoi unici e inconfondibili trulli - hanno più di un significato.

Hanno valore artistico prima di tutto ma sono anche espressione di rinascita e ""segno di speranza"" come dice Luca Agnani. Proprio lui è uno dei protagonisti della manifestazione organizzata dall'associazione di promozione sociale Lightcones: è un visual designer e artista multimediale originario del Maceratese con i suoi esperimenti visuali rivisita spesso opere moderne e nella sua carriera è riuscito a dare nuova vita e prospettiva a importanti e noti palazzi in Italia e all'estero fra cui la Farnesina a Roma il Duomo di Monza l'Istituto italiano di cultura di Madrid.

Quello di Agnani ad Alberobello è un ritorno perché partecipa al Light Festival con Metamorphosis un progetto di videomapping sulla basilica dei Santi Medici già presentato nel 2019.

""È un lavoro che si attiene molto all'architettura - dice lo stesso Agnani - Ho scomposto e ricomposto colorato e usato l'architettura stessa per creare gli effetti"". Il suo intervento ha una durata di circa sette minuti e sarà ripetuto per tutta la serata in ogni sera del festival. Ha quasi il sapore di un cerchio che si chiude di un discorso che riprende lì dove era stato interrotto ed è solo uno di quelli in programma. L'edizione 2022 di LiFe non a caso si chiama 'Reloaded' e punta a richiamare ad Alberobello alcuni degli artisti che sono già stati ospiti e le cui opere hanno avuto un grande riscontro da parte del pubblico.

Le installazioni quest'anno sono quindi cinque e si sviluppano oltre che sulla facciata della basilica anche al Trullo Sovrano alla chiesa a trullo di Sant'Antonio e all'interno del nuovo edificio sorto al posto dell'ex mercato coperto di largo Martellotta ""in un percorso ideale - fanno sapere gli organizzatori - che va dal Trullo Sovrano alla chiesa di Sant'Antonio passando per il centro cittadino e il rione Monti"".

Sono varie per tematiche anche le declinazioni che gli artisti hanno dato ai loro interventi e quindi gli stessi ideatori Lightcones occupano l'esterno del Trullo Sovrano con due diversi lavori: Quintessenza e The Pantheon of rock riuscendo a tenere in sequenza filosofia e musica contemporanea. Quintessenza infatti prende le mosse da Platone dando vita a un gioco di luci e suoni: ""Platone nell'opera Timeo mentre racconta le origini e il funzionamento del cosmo formula l'ipotesi che la materia sia composta da quattro particelle aventi la forma dei primi quattro poliedri regolari - fanno sapere da LiFe - corrispondenti ai quattro elementi tradizionali (Terra Acqua Aria Fuoco) ai quali si aggiunge il concetto di Quintessenza che racchiude il quinto elemento l'Universo"".

Questo progetto si alternerà a The Pantheon of rock ""un intimo tributo"" - sempre a firma Lightcones - alla musica e ad alcuni dei suoi protagonisti ""trasformati in divinità di una cosmogonia rock in un gioco onirico e psichedelico"". Riprende lo stesso discorso interrotto e anzi va a scavare nella memoria l'installazione Van Gogh reloaded: il tema fu presentato per la prima volta nel 2015 e stavolta Lightcones propone una rielaborazione del noto dipinto Notte stellata del pittore olandese sulla chiesa di Sant'Antonio l'unica a forma di trullo.

Dalla Slovenia infine arrivano a completare il quadro di Light Festival 2022 le artiste Natalija R. Crnec e Nina Šulin: prendono posto a Casa Alberobello (ex mercato coperto di via Martellotta) e vi fanno esplodere Coexistence un'installazione che punta sulle forme organiche fluttuanti ""simili a corpi di animali avvolti da veli neri - precisano dall'organizzazione della manifestazione - recanti tracce fluorescenti che attribuiscono una forma visiva di movimento e di respiro costante che li porta alla vita nella loro essenza di base e lo spettatore riconosce in essi embrioni animali e umani"".

Anche quello di Crncec e Šulin è un ritorno ad Alberobello dopo che nell'edizione 2017 incantarono il pubblico con InParallel. Stavolta insistono sul concetto di coesistenze proponendo l'esito di un progetto nato da un lungo e paziente lavoro manuale e che promette di sedurre il visitatore e risucchiarlo seguendo la possibilità di ""delineare l'esperienza eccessiva della (co)esistenza e (co)creazione attraverso un gioco di addensamento e avvicinamento"".

It used the fastest Arc A770 for the demonstrations though it's difficult to say how the performance will stack up against the best graphics cards based on the limited performance details shown.



If you're at all familiar with Nvidia's DLSS which has been around for four years now in various incarnations the video should spark a keen sense of Deja Vu. Tom Petersen who formerly worked for Nvidia and gave some of the old DLSS presentations walks through the XeSS fundamentals. Long story short XeSS sounds very much like a mirrored version of Nvidia's DLSS except it's designed to work with Intel's deep learning XMX cores rather than Nvidia's tensor cores. The tech can also work with other GPUs however using DP4a mode which might make it an interesting alternative to AMD's FSR 2.0 upscaler.



In the demos shown by Intel XeSS looked to be working well. Of course it's difficult to say for sure when the source video is a 1080p compressed version of the actual content but we'll save detailed image quality comparisons for another time. Performance gains look to be similar to what we've seen with DLSS with over a 100% frame rate boost in some situations when using XeSS Performance mode.

How It Works

If you already know how DLSS works Intel's solution is largely the same but with some minor tweaks. XeSS is an AI accelerated resolution upscaling algorithm designed to increase frame rates in video games.



It starts with training the first step in most deep learning algorithms. The AI network takes lower resolution sample frames from a game and processes them generating what should be upscaled output images. Then the network compares the results against the desired target image and back propagates weight adjustments to try and correct any ""errors."" At first the resulting images won't look very good but the AI algorithm slowly learns from its mistakes. After thousands (or more) of training images the network eventually converges toward ideal weights that will ""magically"" generate the desired results.



Once the algorithm has been fully trained using samples from lots of different games it can in theory take any image input from any video game and upscale it almost perfectly. As with DLSS (and FSR 2.0) the XeSS algorithm also takes on the role of anti-aliasing and replaces classical solutions like temporal AA.

Again nothing so far is particularly noteworthy. DLSS and FSR 2.0 and even standard temporal AA algorithms have a lot of the same core functionality — minus the AI stuff for FSR and TAA. Games will integrate XeSS into their rendering pipeline typically after the main render and initial effects are done but before post processing effects and GUI/HUD elements are drawn. That way the UI stays sharp while the difficult task of 3D rendering gets to run at a lower resolution.



XeSS operates on Intel's Arc XMX cores but it can also run on other GPUs in a slightly different mode. DP4a instructions are basically four INT8 (8-bit integer) calculations done using a single 32-bit register what you'd typically have access to via a GPU shader core. XMX cores meanwhile natively support INT8 and can operate on 128 values at once.



That might seem very lopsided but as an example an Arc A380 has 1024 shader cores that could each do four INT8 operations at the same time. Alternatively the A380 has 128 MXM units that can each do 128 INT8 operations. That makes the MXM throughput four times faster than the DP4a throughput but apparently DP4a mode should still be sufficient for some level of XeSS goodness.



Note that DP4a appears to use a different trained network one that's perhaps less computationally intensive. How that will translate into real-world performance and image quality remains to be seen and it sounds like game developers will need to explicitly include support for both XMX and DP4a modes if they want to support non-Arc GPUs.

Intel XeSS Performance Expectations

Intel showed off a couple of gaming tests running XeSS including a development build of Shadow of the Tomb Raider and a new 3DMark benchmark specifically made for XeSS. It also showed brief clips of Arcadegeddon Redout II Ghostwire Tokyo The DioField Chronicle Chivalry II Naraka Bladepoint and Super People running with and without XeSS at the end of the video. Note that Intel has never shown XeSS running in DP4a mode which is something we still want to see.



In Shadow of the Tomb Raider running on an Arc A770 graphics card at 2560x1440 with nearly maxed out settings including ray traced shadows XeSS provided anywhere from about a 25% performance boost on the Ultra Quality setting up to a more than a 100% to frame rates at using the Performance setting. The Quality and Balanced settings go for a middle ground and improved performance by around 50% and 75% respectively.



Those gains will naturally vary by the game engine settings and base performance. The more demanding the game and the lower the framerate the more beneficial XeSS will likely be. Using the Performance mode Intel showed typical gains of anywhere from 40% to 110% at 1440p while the Balanced mode delivered improvements ranging from about 25% to as much as 75%.

3DMark will also be adding an Intel XeSS Feature Test for its Advanced edition which includes a benchmark mode as well as a Frame Inspector that allows users to look at images of the benchmark zooming in to check the visual quality differences. It looks a lot easier to use than Nvidia's ICAT utility though of course it's also limited to providing frames from a single synthetic benchmark.



Because 3DMark uses its demanding Port Royal ray tracing scene for the XeSS Feature Test performance gains can be particularly impressive. At 1440p with XeSS in performance mode the benchmark saw a 145% improvement in FPS 109% boost with Balanced mode 81% using Quality mode and 49% with Ultra Quality mode.



The Frame Inspector also showed some good results with XeSS reconstructing the image very well to the point where Intel's Tom Petersen argues the XeSS image actually looks better than native with TAA. Of course you need to take that with a grain of salt and images from a single canned sequence likely won't fully represent real-world gaming experiences.

XeSS SDK and More Than 20 Games in the Works

Intel will be providing an SDK for implementing XeSS in a game engine. The interface and requirements will be very similar to TAA implementations as well as DLSS and FSR 2.0 so it should be a relatively easy addition for any modern graphics engine.



Like TAA FSR 2.0 and DLSS XeSS needs motion vectors along with the current frame and it keeps its own collection of previous frames. These are all fed into the AI network to ultimately generate a good result. XeSS also uses camera jitter to help eliminate aliasing in the scene. (The jitter is on the sub-pixel level so it won't be directly visible to the end user.)



At present Intel has more than 20 games with XeSS planned for release in the coming months. Some of those may fall through the cracks or get delayed but it's at least a decent start for the newcomer. At the same time AMD just announced another eight games that have recently added or will soon be adding FSR 2.0 and Nvidia has well over 100 games shipping with DLSS 2.0 or later. How many game developers will be willing to add all three alternatives which would provide gamers with the choice of the best algorithm? We suspect a lot of games will only support one or two of the possible upscaling options.



XeSS will officially launch when Intel releases its Arc Alchemist GPUs worldwide at some point in the presumably near future. The Arc A380 has effectively launched at this point and Intel has now teased the A750 and A770. Hopefully we'll get to experience XeSS in both MXM and DP4a modes in the not too distant future. At present uptake remains very far behind the AMD and Nvidia competition.

Arc A380 in 50 games and 50 hours of testing.

PC Games Hardware took Intel’s only Arc Alchemist desktop GPU for a large-scale test. Rather than focusing on graphics card to graphics card comparison the GPU was tested for compatibility in 50 titles released from 1999 to 2022.

Intel has some serious issues with the games that do not use modern APIs: Vulkan or DirectX 12. While the company is working around the clock to fix as many bugs as possible and optimize their architecture for older titles the time to launch desktop GPUs is almost over.

Recently Vice Present and GM for Visual Compute Group at Intel Lisa Pearce confirmed the company will work to optimize Arc GPU performance for DX9 and DX11 APIs while DX11 should eventually work as good as DX12 in the future. This process will take time and gamers choosing Arc GPUs should either trust Intel will resolve those issues as soon as possible or just look elsewhere for GPU architecture that works. The good news is that older gamers usually do not require powerful GPUs these days so the choice is plenty.

Intel’s latest driver released on August 19 has eliminated many issues with the GPU compatibility and for its Control panel heavily criticized by reviewers. It is still not perfect and Intel is now fixing known issues and there are many.

Some games require a specific Intel driver to work (showing errors on start) but since Intel has branched its Arc Drivers those requirements are simply wrong and games work regardless. Clearly Intel has a lot of work to do with game developers directly and this will take a lot of time. Hopefully with enough resources help from the community and tech reviewers those issues will be resolved soon.

Next month Intel is more than likely to launch its Arc A7 graphics the upper mid-range series that may finally put Intel on performance charts against NVIDIA and AMD most popular GPUs. Unfortunately for Intel both companies will soon introduce new architecture which will strengthen their position even further.

The folks over at PC Games Hardware has tested the Intel Arc A380 graphics card which is great to see after hearing Intel Arc GPUs will be using a DirectX 9 to DirectX 12 emulator... as the Arc A-series desktop GPUs have no native DX9 API capabilities. This means we get Arc hardware + Arc software + GPU compatibility in 50 games as a great early look at the Arc GPUs (but not up against AMD and NVIDIA in these results).

As for the games tested the new Intel Arc A380 graphics card ran games flawlessly including Crysis Control Cyberpunk 2077 Elden Ring F1 2022 FEAR (one of my favorites) Red Dead Redemption 2 Stray The Witcher 2 and 3 and many many more. As for the games that didn't work PC Games Hardware notes that Max Payne 2 -- which runs on the older DirectX 8 API -- ""doesn't start at all"".

Doom Eternal running Vulkan through Steam would freeze at startup sometimes while Half-Life 2 running DX9 through Steam with Transparency AA for Alphatests not working while they note ""the rest is fine"". The spread of 50 games is a great mix showing that the Intel Arc GPU experience isn't as bad as it could be. It should hopefully radically improve in the weeks and months as they fly by at the same if not at a greater pace... but for now not bad at all.

But we do have to remember: this is on a particular system not all Intel Arc GPU owners will have the same specs games resolutions and APIs being used.

When it comes to display connectivity the new Intel Arc A380 is pretty awesome: 3 x DisplayPort 2.0 (yeah not DisplayPort 1.4 connectors) and 1 x HDMI 2.0b connector. Intel does provide AIB partners with the ability to add PCONs (Proton Converters) to their Arc GPUs which enables HDMI 2.1 support."

The stock market's summer fun may finally be over.

The S&P 500 is down 5.4% since August 16 closing negative for two consecutive weeks now following a 17% rally from mid-June.

Whether or not mid-August was the near-term peak or not the rally in recent months is nothing more than a bull trap according to Bill Smead the founder and CIO of Smead Capital Management.

This story is available exclusively to Business Insider subscribers. Become an Insider and start reading now.

Smead who began his career in 1980 with Drexel Burnham Lambert said in a recent commentary stocks have further downside ahead and that investors remain far too bullish in the face of a Federal Reserve fighting four-decade-high inflation.

""This bear market is designed to punish mass foolishness in everything from FAANG stocks glam tech stocks high price-to-sales up and comers meme stocks SPAC/IPOs cryptocurrencies and the list goes on"" Smead said. ""We even revived the meme trading in the recent bear market rally. Why are we sure it is a bear market rally? It was led by the same foolishness that triggered the bear market in the first place. Investors are gluttons for punishment in this cycle.""

Smead pointed to indications that investor positioning remains relatively bullish despite what has appeared to be a rise in negative sentiment since the start of the year.

The first is a chart from Bank of America showing a lack of the household equity outflows that have occurred in prior downturns. The data is through the end of the first quarter.

According to the same Bank of America note — published on August 9 this year — household equities are the biggest drivers of the market.

Smead also pointed out that household allocations to equities are near their highest levels ever above levels seen during some of the biggest market bubbles in history. Around 40% of household financial assets are currently in equities.

Household allocation to equities is highly correlated to future returns and current levels suggest negative returns for the S&P 500 over the next decade.

Smead Capital Management

High inflation and rapidly rising interest rates will continue to challenge stocks Smead said and further downside will increasingly hurt investor confidence until a higher level of capitulation sets in.

""The stock market is likely to shake out the confidence among asset allocators and cause it to match the bearishness expressed in sentiment polls before we hit a meaningful long-term bottom"" he said. ""Think back to the financial crisis bear market in 2007-2009. There were as many as four significant spikes in bearishness and only the last one marked the end of the bear market.""

For the time being investors are better off in commodities and in real estate than the broader stock market Smead said.

Smead's views in context

Stocks fell sharply on Friday after Fed Chair Jerome Powell reiterated the central bank's intention to continue to tighten policy aggressively.

The futures market and some investors have been anticipating a Fed reversal to dovish policy next year. But representatives of the central bank have said that they don't plan to cut rates shortly after raising them aggressively.

Andy Sparks the head of portfolio management research at MSCI told Insider on Friday that he believes the Fed will hold rates higher for a longer period of time before resorting to cutting rates as their credibility is on the line. BlackRock's Rick Rieder expressed a similar opinion last week.

Equity markets tend to be forward-looking discounting mechanisms. When expectations shift so do prices. With the growing consensus and acceptance that the Fed in fact won't back off of their hawkish policies stocks are likely to continue to suffer.

This is because higher interest rates eventually weigh on economic activity and corporate earnings. Signs are already starting to show that the US economy is slowing.

Smead's view that stocks have further downside is shared by a number of Wall Street institutions. Bank of America's top stock strategist Savita Subramanian recently changed her 2022 S&P 500 price target to 3600 which is another 11.5% downside. She also said at the end of 2021 that the index would deliver negative returns over the next decade excluding dividends.

Her counterpart at Morgan Stanley Mike Wilson has a target of 3900 for the index. UBS has also said it's a bad time to buy tech stocks.

RIA Advisors' CIO Lance Roberts said earlier this month that stocks are ""detached from reality"" and that valuations and earnings expectations have to come down further.

Still many top strategists have S&P 500 price targets above 4000 and most anticipate a ""soft landing"" scenario where the Fed is able to bring down inflation without sending the US economy into a recession.

The likelihood of that scenario likely depends on how quickly inflation falls from it's current year-over-year level of 8.5%. If it remains sticky the Fed has said they will have the resolve to fight it barring a broad economic downturn. While bringing down inflation is good for the long-term stability of the US economy either scenario — persistently hawkish policy or a recessionary environment — aren't great for the stock market's near-term prospects.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnVuaXZlcnNldG9kYXkuY29tLzE1NzMyNi90aGlzLWlzLXdoYXQtYS1yb2JvdGljLWV4cGxvcmVyLW1pZ2h0LXNlZS13aGVuLWl0LXJlYWNoZXMtZXVyb3Bhcy1vY2VhbnMv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,This is What a Robotic Explorer Might See When it Reaches Europa's Oceans,"For decades evidence has been mounting that beneath the icy crust of Jupiter’s moon Europa a vast ocean exists that could possibly host microbial life. As scientists prepare to send the Europa Clipper mission to orbit the Jupiter system they are trying to learn more about the subsurface ocean and the ice that encompasses the moon.



One way to study Europa is to look at similar environments here on Earth. Scientists say that conditions found under Earth’s Antarctic ice shelf provides an analog to Europa’s subsurface ocean and can help them determine how the moon’s ice shell accretes and grows.

A new study published in the journal Astrobiology looked at a unique phenomenon in the Antarctic ocean called underwater snow. This is where ice floats upwards onto the bottom of the ice shelf and attaches in fluffy-looking mounds. This helps to replenish the ice shelf. The study infers that the same phenomenon is likely true for Jupiter’s moon and may play a role in building and replenishing its exterior ice shell.

According to co-author Donald Blankenship a senior research scientist at the University of Texas at Austin studying this feature on Earth is helping scientists to understand the habitability of Europa.

“We can use Earth to evaluate Europa’s habitability measure the exchange of impurities between the ice and ocean and figure out where water is in the ice” he said in a press release. Blankenship is also the principal investigator for Europa Clipper’s ice penetrating radar instrument which will use radar to peer beneath the ice shell to see if Europa’s ocean could be hospitable to life.

Scientists hope at some point to send a submarine or a swarm of swimming robots to study Europa’s ocean in-situ.

Previous studies suggest the temperature pressure and salinity of Europa’s ocean nearest to the ice is similar to what is found beneath an ice shelf in Antarctica. The team said that knowing what kind of ice Europa’s shell is made of will also help decipher the salinity and habitability of its ocean.

“When we’re exploring Europa we’re interested in the salinity and composition of the ocean because that’s one of the things that will govern its potential habitability or even the type of life that might live there” said the study’s lead author Natalie Wolfenbarger a graduate student researcher at the University of Texas Institute for Geophysics (UTIG).

Below Europa’s thick icy crust is a massive ocean despite the moon’s great distance from the Sun. If everything else were equal the distance would put Europa well beyond our star’s habitable zone – where conditions are right for liquid water to exist on another world. However Europa’s ocean exists because of tidal heating where the moon is constantly either stretched or compressing as it orbits the massive planet Jupiter in an elliptical orbit. Additionally Europa is also being constantly tugged by fellow moons Io and Ganymede This tidal heating leads to friction within Europa’s core corresponding to heat and ultimately melting the inner ice into what is now Europa’s massive ocean.

Scientists think Europa’s ice shell is 10 to 15 miles (15 to 25 kilometers) thick floating on an ocean 40 to 100 miles (60 to 150 kilometers) deep. So even though Europa is only one-fourth the diameter of Earth scientists think its ocean may contain twice as much water as all of Earth’s oceans combined.

This reprocessed color view of Jupiter’s moon Europa was made from images taken by NASA’s Galileo spacecraft in the late 1990s.

The new study says that the underwater snow is much purer than other kinds of ice which means Europa’s ice shell could be much less salty than previously thought. That’s important for calibrating the radar instrument for Europa Clipper as salt trapped in the ice can affect what and how deep the radar will see into the ice shell. Being able to predict what the ice is made of will help scientists make sense of the data.

“This paper is opening up a whole new batch of possibilities for thinking about ocean worlds and how they work” said Steve Vance a research scientist at NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) who was not involved in the study. “It sets the stage for how we might prepare for Europa Clipper’s analysis of the ice.”

With summer temperatures hitting 34 degrees Celsius (93 Fahrenheit) ice cream is a popular and relatively inexpensive treat in Gaza home to 2.3 million people squeezed into a narrow coastal strip between Israel and Egypt.

But owners of several groceries said they had to stop selling it even as a particularly hot summer has increased demand.

“Half of the ice cream melted. What should we do with it? Losses losses” supermarket owner Fouad Awadallah told Reuters.

Gaza would normally require around 500 megawatts of power per day during the summer months of June July and August local officials said. It receives 120 megawatts from Israel while the enclave’s single power plant supplies another 60 megawatts.

The shortfall means residents have only around 11 hours of electricity per day and even that is intermittent.

At the Kazem Ice Cream shop one of the territory’s best known owner Mohammad Abu Shaban said he had to use expensive generators to keep the business going.

“I can’t switch off the generators even for a minute once the electricity goes” he said.

Saly Abu El-Haj 25 travelled 13 kilometres (8 miles) from her Nusseirat refugee camp for a taste of Kazem’s ice cream in Gaza City centre because other shops had stopped selling it.

“If you want to buy something cheaper from a supermarket you won’t find it as owners are afraid ice cream would be wasted once the electricity is off” she said.

You started your career as an accountant. How and when did you venture into stockbroking?

My venture into stockbroking happened as the natural consequence of positions I held during my career. From the financial control department of a bank I was moved to the corporate finance department to provide accounting support for detailed financial analysis of audited financial statements of all the listed companies on the Nigerian Stock Exchange to identify their financing needs upon which corporate finance proposals were generated and marketed to target companies. As an investment banker operating in the primary market as a Securities and Exchange-registered sponsored individual I related well with stockbrokers as parties to primary market offerings and listings on stock exchange. I could have written the examinations then as advised but I was focused on issuing house and advisory functions. There was a policy change by the Central Bank of Nigeria in the last quarter of 1999 which allowed merchants banks to convert to commercial banks based on complaints about the prohibitive cost of funds structure.

Intercontinental Bank was the first merchant bank to switch to commercial banking in the first quarter of 2000. The investment banking corporate finance operations under the merchant bank ceased and could not continue under a commercial banking structure and were consequently transferred to a stockbroking subsidiary called Intercontinental Securities Limited. I was seconded to the company as its first Managing Director and Chief Executive Officer. In line with regulatory requirements I had to qualify as a chartered stockbroker to effectively function in that position. I immediately registered as a student member of the Chartered Institute of Stockbrokers in 2001 took lectures and completed the qualifying examinations in two levels in record time which won me a prize in 2002.

What are your roles as the president of the Chartered Institute of Stockbrokers?

The President of the Chartered Institute of Stockbrokers serves as the Chairman of the institute’s Governing Council. The council is the central policy-making organ of the institute. My role is to serve as the chief servant coordinating the policy-making function and providing leadership inspiration and motivation to the council members management and staff of the institute in order to enable them work to their maximum capacity in a congenial atmosphere that promotes efficiency.

It is also my duty to ensure that the CIS operates in accordance with its enabling statutes and achieves its objective of setting world-class professional standards in the securities and investment space in Nigeria.

How helpful was the demutualisation of the Nigerian Stock Exchange in 2021 to the stock marketing environment?

The demutualisation of The Nigerian Stock Exchange (now NGX Exchange Group) was a major achievement not only for the exchange but the entire capital market community in Nigeria. It was a feat that was meticulously planned and painstakingly executed in a manner that protected the interests of all the key stakeholders including the dealing member firms. Having transformed from a non-profit to a full-fledged public limited liability company with subsidiaries in various areas the exchange has become more business-like in its approach taking steps to eliminate wastages and promoting ventures that enhance the value proposition for its shareholders securities dealers and investors. Infrastructure platforms such as NG Clearing is being set up and people are able to trade on the shares of NGX itself. The technology driving the NGX market is of the highest grade and the market is now better able to compete with the best in the world as an investment destination.

There were fears in some quarters that since ownership and trading rights are now separated new companies aiming to maximise profits and dividends may have little incentive to commit resources for self-regulation. How does the CIS aim to stop that from happening?

The risk of that happening is already minimised. Remember that the NGX is still under the regulation of the Securities and Exchange Commission; so having those separately structured subsidiaries is to foster good corporate governance and efficiency in service delivery. CIS works closely with the NGX as a key partner and most of the key people are our members so we are always in communication to ensure that the public interest is paramount.

One of the issues in the Nigerian Stock Exchange is the failure of companies to adhere to the principles of corporate governance. How best do you think this can be tackled?

Quoted companies are made to sign an undertaking to comply with the post-listing requirements. The requirements are largely on timely disclosure of material information that aid investment decisions devoid of information asymmetry. This is an investor protection mechanism. There is no perfect community in the area of compliance. That is why the exchange ensures that any company that contravenes the post-listing requirements pays a penalty. The exchange has consistently upheld the principles of corporate governance.

In March a bill to replace CIS with a new establishment called Chartered Institute of Securities and Investments passed the second reading stage in the House of Representatives. How did the CIS receive this development?

The development did not come to us as a surprise given the enormous groundwork and consultations that we engaged in. We at the Chartered Institute of Stockbrokers thank members of the National Assembly especially the committee on capital market for the progress achieved so far with the bill. The proposed act is for the benefit of the entire capital market not just the CIS and we have conducted far-reaching consultations to carry all relevant and key stakeholders in the market along. The provisions were meticulously couched to ensure that all key segments of the capital market benefit from the new act when it is passed into law.

The Chairman of the House of Reps committee on Capital Market opined that it would widen the scope of the existing institute. How is this so?

That is absolutely correct. CIS was established 30 years ago and people will agree that the capital market and in fact the entire Nigerian economy have changed significantly during that period. The bill is a natural evolution consistent with what has been practised in advanced economies of the world financial system and even nearer home in South Africa.

The capital market is a vehicle for improving the economy of any nation. What role is the CIS playing to see that there is no deficit in professional operators?

The capital market is indeed a significant barometer for the economy of any nation and a particularly important vehicle to achieve significant economic development. The CISIN Bill which we just touched on is one such step CIS is taking; but even before now the institute had taken several key steps to avoid any deficit in the availability of professionally trained and qualified practitioners in the Nigerian capital market. About five years ago we commenced our stand-alone certification scheme which enables interested students to focus on a particular segment of the capital market to specialise and practise in. We have also been running our Diploma in Securities and Investment programme for about a decade. More strategic initiatives and actions will be rolled out in due course.

How viable is the Nigerian economy for potential investors to invest in?

Even as things stand currently Nigeria remains one of the most viable destinations for direct and portfolio investments in Africa. We have by far the largest population. We also have by far the largest concentration of natural resources. Nigeria is a niche market. Those are the key ingredients for non-governmental business concerns to thrive and some giant multinational companies have been coming to set up shop in Nigeria in recent times. However the major challenge is how to leverage the nation’s human and material capital to grow the economy.

What is your career trajectory?

My career trajectory cuts across accounting corporate banking investment banking securities dealings and investments in a career spanning 36 years. I have worked at various financial institutions garnering experience from diverse areas of finance and banking which include the primary and secondary segments of the Nigerian capital market investment banking corporate banking treasury accounting and auditing.

I started my career at First Bank Plc (Port Harcourt Branch) as a youth corps member in 1986. On completion of the national service I started work with Idem Consultants in 1988 and moved to Summit Finance Company Limited later that same year. I made a career switch in October of the same year when I joined Coopers and Lybrand for professional training in accounting and auditing.

I qualified as a chartered accountant in May 1991 and five months later I crossed to the banking industry when I joined the then Nigerian Intercontinental Merchant Bank Limited which later transformed to become Intercontinental Bank Plc. I worked with the Intercontinental Bank Group for 17 years before exiting in 2007 to set up Chartwell Financial Services Group which I have been running for 15 years. During those years of working I was also studying. I obtained additional professional qualifications as a chartered banker chartered stockbroker and chartered tax practitioner.

You trained at Coopers and Lybrand (now Price WaterhouseCoopers). How was the experience and what were your achievements while there?

Coopers and Lybrand was a great workplace where trainees’ professional skills were developed alongside technical accountancy knowledge while studying for the professional ICAN examination those days. Practical experience was gained on audit assignments to the topmost companies in the leading sectors of the economy. Those skills acquired have proven to be a crucial component of well-rounded value added to every position I have held across different organizations I have worked with.

At various times you held different senior positions at Intercontinental Bank between 1991 to 2000— as Head Corporate Finance; Group Head Investment Banking; and Group Head Corporate Banking. Which of those positions did you consider the most taxing?

Each of those positions had their challenges in a nimble organisation such as Intercontinental Group where achievement of one’s targets and budget was key to one’s ratings and placement. By dint of arduous work and God’s grace I was able to consistently overcome the challenges and achieved targets to move on to higher levels of responsibilities.

What were your notable achievements as the CEO of Intercontinental Securities Limited?

Being seconded from the bank to manage its first subsidiary that was mandated by regulators to operate as an autonomous entity was challenging. I had to start on a clean slate with just two members of staff in 2000. It was like setting up a new business entirely but with faith courage and a solid team built under my leadership the company went on to rank in the league of the top three dealing member firms on the Nigerian Stock Exchange. It also became the most profitable subsidiary of the bank with five branches set up across Nigeria and a staff strength of over 150 people at the time of my exit in 2007.

We also sustained the investment banking mandates with primary markets transactions for several companies including the primary listing and initial public offering for Intercontinental Bank Plc.

What was the most difficult decision you took while in that office?

Managing a securities dealings and investment outfit is not a tea party as it requires taking decisions on a daily basis. And such decisions must turn out very well and minimise exposures.

The COVID-19 pandemic took a toll on the economy of the country. How well has the stock market bounced back?

I am immensely proud to affirm that the Nigerian capital market was probably the least affected operationally speaking by the coronavirus pandemic. The reason was that the market was already highly leveraged on technology before the pandemic came.

It is said that no economy can survive during a conflict. How is the insecurity situation in Nigeria affecting the stock market?

Insecurity has a significant negative effect on the capital market for several reasons. First the quoted companies would be negatively impacted with operational costs rising and profits mitigated.

The ease of doing business profile of the country has also been negatively impacted thus discouraging foreign direct investors and other interested entrepreneurs from investing or growing their businesses in the country. It is imperative that the fight against insecurity be made a top priority for the government and the citizenry.

The government placed a ban on the buying and selling of cryptocurrency. As a finance expert what do you make of that decision?

That is the rational decision for now until sovereign states and governments worldwide can have a firm regulatory grip over cryptocurrencies. Last year the Central Bank of Nigeria launched the eNaira and has been working alongside other countries to map out an effective mechanism for regulating the cryptocurrency market. It may not be a ban per se because the trades are done online but just to warn the investors that if they have complaints it will be difficult for the local financial regulators to intervene. It is a work in progress and the Securities and Exchange Commission recently released its guidelines on digital assets.

What informed your decision to start Chartwell Securities Limited?

The decision to start the company with a combined licence as an issuing house and securities dealing/brokerage firm was informed by my core competence in both segments of the capital market as well as fervent belief in the capacity of the Nigerian capital market for further development into the new areas that we have witnessed over the last decade. It is a highly sophisticated and exciting market the impact of which is evident on daily basis in the market statistics published. Having worked for 17 years in the banking sector I felt it was time to move out while the energy and drive were still there.

How do you combine running Chartwell and discharging your duties as President of CIS?

By proper organisation of my schedules and delegation of some responsibilities combining the roles of President of CIS and leadership of my company has been easy and I’m coping well.

Some people believe that there is a need for the privatisation of major sectors of the economy. Do you share that view?

Whether in Nigeria or globally there is ample evidence to show that in a free market economy enterprises that are geared towards making financial profit are best run by private entrepreneurs. In Nigeria the history of state-owned business enterprises has been copiously documented and is quite easy to access. The data points to the fact that the government’s involvement in profit-oriented enterprises has not yielded the desired result in Nigeria so privatisation is a necessity not an option. The crucial factor to consider is the equitability and fairness of the privatisation method adopted. For us in the capital market we usually canvas for public offerings because with that method the average Nigerian that is interested can easily subscribe to those shares through the stock exchange and at a price that is fairly set through the stock exchange’s rigorous and competitive pricing mechanism.

In what ways do you think the government can strengthen the stock market?

Three things come immediately to mind. First the government should support the financial literacy responsibilities of CIS by extending some grants to the institute to enhance the programme. Second the CBN and the banking system should extend liquidity to securities dealing firms for trading purposes which will help stabilise the market. The same request is made to the various pension funds in the country to invest more in the equities market as is being done in advanced economies. Third the government should have more engagements and consultations with stockbrokers during policy making budgeting and foreign relations. The benefits are mutual. The government also needs the capital market to be strong to achieve a stronger economy and faster GDP growth.

Tell us about your educational background.

I attended Loyola College Ibadan Oyo State between September 1977 and June 1982. I hold a Bachelor’s degree in Business Administration from the University of Ilorin and an MBA in Finance and Banking from the University of Lagos.

I qualified as a chartered accountant in May 1991. I later qualified as a chartered banker and chartered stockbroker while working with Intercontinental Bank and Intercontinental Securities Limited respectively. I am a fellow of the major professional institutes in Nigeria’s financial services sector including the Chartered Institute of Stockbrokers Institute of Chartered Accountants of Nigeria Chartered Institute of Bankers of Nigeria Chartered Institute of Taxation of Nigeria Institute of Credit Administration Institute of Directors.

Did your parents influence your choice of career?

Not at all. I chose what I wanted to do which was banking based on my early exposure to the banking environment as a secondary school student that frequently went to the bank to lodge daily sales proceeds of my mother’s pharmacy business in the then Standard Bank of Nigeria now First Bank of Nigeria. During my university days I also had the opportunity of doing vacation jobs in First Bank and Union Bank and that exposed me further to the banking sector and defined my career path.

What do you consider the greatest lesson life has taught you?

To have implicit trust and faith in God and to stay focused on my goals.

What do you consider to be the most memorable moment of your life?

There have been several memorable moments in my life across board such as passing examinations winning awards and professional elevations.

However one of the most memorable moments was in 2017 when as the chairman of my alumni’s set at Loyola College we gave out scholarships to 10 indigent but brilliant students to enable them progress from junior secondary school to senior secondary school and to give them a better chance in life. On the day of the award which coincided with the set’s 35th year of graduating from the school in 1982. The parents of the indigent students were in attendance and one could see the joy and relief on their faces because of the impact of our initiatives that brought smiles to their faces. It brought good feelings about what can be done to make impact in other people’s lives.

Did you at any point in your career feel like quitting?

There have been high and low points in my career over the years. As an optimist quitting was never an option. Rather I chose to face the issues headlong as they cropped up. The most challenging moment was during the global financial crisis of 2008 when I had just completed the registration requirements for Chartwell Securities Limited and started the business with a significant market portfolio. Six weeks later the global meltdown set in with a consistent decline in asset values and shareholders’ funds for the next three years till 2011 when the markets achieved some stability and a subsequent turnaround in 2014. Those were some harrowing moments in my career.

Many youths want to travel out of the country to seek greener pastures. What advice do you have for them?

Those who migrated to other countries two or three decades ago are returning home now to the same country they left. The thrust of our work at CIS is to create adequate opportunities career-wise for our youths in a manner that every young Nigerian that is intellectually endowed can access conveniently. That is the reason we have in addition to our professional exams the Diploma in Securities and Investment programme as well as the stand-alone certification scheme. These are steps we are continually taking to give our youths adequate professional opportunities at home which hopefully should discourage the urge to migrate.

How impactful was your programme at the New York Institute of Finance on your career?

United States Capital Markets 1 and 2 is the flagship programme of the prestigious New York Institute of Finance that attracts participants from all over the world to learn from the base of capitalism on which the capital market stands. The programme provided much-needed exposure to the totality of products and services in the market far beyond the level of the Nigerian market then. The knowledge and skill acquired have enabled me and my colleagues to prepare for the evolving market developments in our environment over the years. There is a need for the Federal Government and the sub-nationals to use more of the structured product offerings of the capital market to fund major projects in infrastructure delivery that will impact more on the lives of the citizens with significant multiplier effects on the economy.

How and where did you meet your wife?

I met her in Lagos while on a visit to my cousin who was her flatmate then as young graduates working and living together. We got talking over several visits thereafter and I realised that her values complimented mine in many ways so I took it on from there.

What endeared you to her?

She is well-read in her field and knowledgeable beautiful inwardly and outwardly simple in her ways a lover of God and always willing to help people.

How do you spend quality time as a couple?

We arrange vacations in getaway locations to relax reflect and project on our union. Our children are all grown up now and independent so we can afford to be alone together which is different from what it used to be in the past when the kids were still growing.

Who is your role model?

My role model (in life) is Pastor Enoch Adeoye who influenced my outlook in terms of simplicity humility quest for holiness and heavenly focus which guide my everyday decisions.

On the professional front my role model was my former boss and mentor Dr Erastus Akingbola who I believe to be one of the best managers of men and resources. He shows interest in one’s life. He also continually mentions fresh challenges for one to display one’s knowledge and skills.

What is your favourite food?

Pounded yam with vegetables is my favourite for lunch while bread with eggs my preferred option for breakfast.

How do you unwind?

I watch sports and documentaries. I also enjoy reading novels.

How do you like to dress?

My style is driven by my routine which is mostly formal Monday through to Friday as I engage in several meetings in and out of the office.

Saturday affords me the opportunity of wearing native attire and simple informal clothing.

On Sundays as a minister of the Gospel my dressing is strictly formal and informal for post-church service for social engagements.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVWh0dHBzOi8vYnV0d2h5dGhvLm5ldC8yMDIyLzA4L3Jldmlldy1yd2J5LWljZS1xdWVlbmRvbS1lcGlzb2RlLTktbXktZHJlYW0teW91ci1kcmVhbS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,RWBY: Ice Queendom Episode 9 Review,"With Ruby seeming to succumb to the Nightmare’s influence things were getting dark for the team. But there may yet be some hope to wake Weiss from her slumber. With the team separated it’ll take a lot of determination if they are to salvage a win out of their current situation in RWBY: Ice Queendom Episode 9. RWBY: Ice Queendom is an action/fantasy anime produced by Shaft.

This week’s episode opens with Ruby having a heart-to-heart talk in her dream with the real Weiss rather than the negative Weiss the team has been struggling against. I enjoyed this opening as it delivers a lot of heart and the exchange feels like it is the sort of moment that is riddled with clues that will come to reveal themselves in the coming episodes.

From this intriguing opening RWBY: Ice Queendom Episode 9 steadily picks up steam as it brings its scattered cast back up to speed with the evolving situation. This episode’s energy managed to hold onto my attention far better than previous entries. It balances conversation with action nicely and even takes a moment to deliver a fairly haunting musical number that manages to create a nice contrast in the tone of the episode without feeling like it is slowing down the episode’s pace. Admittedly the moment was the last thing I expected. But perhaps that is part of what helps it work so well.

With all the narrative elements about to collide again it feels like the story is finally going to deliver some forward momentum for this leg of its journey. While I hope this is the case I can’t help but worry there will be one more stall out before the series truly heads into its endgame.

The only spot where RWBY: Ice Queendom Episode 9 struggles is in a couple of failures on the part of its cast to connect some fairly apparent dots. While a lot is going on and some missed clues are understandable there is one major element to the situation that is so obvious there is no way the characters shouldn’t have picked up on it yet.

While much of the scenery is what we have seen before RWBY: Ice Queendom Episode 9 manages to deliver some new visual elements to its story that land wonderfully. Some surreal moments provide a much-needed break-up in the story’s familiarity and the aforementioned musical number receives much of its power from the visuals accompanying the moment.

When all is said and done RWBY: Ice Queendom Episode 9 does a good job of righting what had been a floundering narrative over the last handful of episodes. As long as future installments can continue to build off of the moment this episode sets in motion this series could deliver a final stretch as strong as its opening chapters.

Late payments totalled £22700 for the average small business with at least one overdue invoice in May representing a 6% year-on-year rise.

This amounts to 65% of their average monthly turnover new data from accounting software Intuit QuickBooks showed.

Companies are expected to pay most invoices within 30 days to their small suppliers according to the Prompt Payment Code set by a government body representing small businesses.

This is leaving them with significantly less money at a time when the cost-of-living crisis is worsening and companies are being hit with much higher bills the researchers warned.

Furthermore almost two-thirds of invoices owed to small business were overdue in May QuickBooks’ data revealed.

It comes as a growing number of small businesses called on the Government to provide urgent support to prevent them buckling under the energy crisis.

The Federation of Small Businesses (FSB) said on Friday that many small firms could be forced to shut down if they cannot pay their bills.

Energy regulator Ofgem has set the household price cap to £3549 to come into effect in October. However there is no such ceiling for most businesses which could see their energy costs go through the roof.

“Many of our members say the eye-watering energy bills could be the final nail in the coffin as they struggle to get through winter.

“We don’t have the luxury to wait until the winter and inaction from our new prime minister could spell the end for many businesses.”

A quarter of small to medium enterprises said higher energy bills will be unsustainable within 12 months YouGov said in a recent survey.

Despite the mounting pressures more than two-thirds of small businesses said they are confident in their financial stability QuickBooks added.

A Government spokesperson said: “We are determined to see late payments reduced to ensure that small businesses are given the best chance of succeeding and growing which is why we recently reformed our Prompt Payment Code to ensure best practice in payment culture.

“No government can control the global factors pushing up the price of energy but we will continue to support business throughout the UK in navigating the months ahead.

“We have already taken a number of steps to support firms including slashing fuel duty freezing alcohol duty rates on beer cider wine and spirits and reducing employer national insurance by raising the Employment Allowance.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiiQFodHRwczovL2hvc3BpdGFsaXR5LmVjb25vbWljdGltZXMuaW5kaWF0aW1lcy5jb20vbmV3cy9ob3RlbHMvd2hhdC1zdGFuZHMtb3V0LWluLXRoZS1pbmRpYW4tbWFya2V0LWlzLXRoZS1kaXZlcnNpdHktb2YtdHJhdmVsbGVycy85MzgxMjA2NNIBjQFodHRwczovL2hvc3BpdGFsaXR5LmVjb25vbWljdGltZXMuaW5kaWF0aW1lcy5jb20vYW1wL25ld3MvaG90ZWxzL3doYXQtc3RhbmRzLW91dC1pbi10aGUtaW5kaWFuLW1hcmtldC1pcy10aGUtZGl2ZXJzaXR5LW9mLXRyYXZlbGxlcnMvOTM4MTIwNjQ?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,“What stands out in the Indian market is the diversity of travellers”,"Advt

The Atmosphere Kanifushi Maldives is one of the country’s premier properties that also boasts Maldives' only completely vegetarian restaurant. ET HospitalityWorld spoke with Malaysia native Mei P Pun  the general manager of the resort about her property working in hospitality and what kind of focus she put on the Indian source market. Excerpts of the interview:What are the challenges of a woman general manager in the Maldives?Despite being in an industry that is male-dominated (certainly in senior management positions) I wouldn’t say that I have encountered any challenges that were due to my gender. While people expect women to be more empathetic and nurturing for me those are essential leadership qualities regardless of gender. Perhaps women are better in touch internally with these attributes which I feel has assisted me in not only my interactions with the team but also guests. Hospitality demands that we intuit guest requirements and be sensitive to their needs and perhaps being a woman puts me in a position to bring together structure and creativity passion and empathy with ease. My colleagues at the Atmosphere group have always been gender neutral and we have always worked in our team based on people's strengths. More than a challenge being a woman has enabled me to celebrate all aspects of what the hospitality industry offers.What makes Atmosphere Kanifushi a standout place to stay at?Being one of the first properties of the Atmosphere Groups and Resorts AKM (as we love to call it) is infused with our founder’s original vision. Today there is no island in the Maldives that can offer over a two-kilometre stretch of just white sandy beaches. This stretch has been appreciated by all our visitors making them feel they were in paradise with the merging of the horizon and the beach line as one looks out at the Indian ocean.If that was not enough another standout feature at AKM is its gastronomy. We are pickled to say that we have spent a number of hours perfecting our preparations designed for palettes from different parts of the world. Gourmands from Europe USA Russia India  Sri Lanka China Korea and more have commented on the spectacular menu options available at the resort. Of special significance has been our recent emphasis on vegetarian cuisine in line with a global shift towards vegan food. The recent visit by chef Fabrizo will be followed up with more chefs of international repute coming through our property.What is your strategy for the Indian market?What stands out in the Indian market is the diversity. Travellers from the North of India have distinct characteristics which could vary from travellers from the south or west of India. Indian families travel differently as opposed to couples or solo travellers from the country. Tier-2 cities and towns have a different approach to travel to say from the urban South Mumbai or South Delhi travellers. This makes the Indian market an exciting and interesting one for us.We always tweak our strategies according to the prevailing trends in the Indian Market. Over the years we have seen many Indian travellers like to travel stress free and would like to clear any official work before landing in Maldives. The Atmosphere Kanifushi Plan is one of the most successful stress-free plans for every traveller. Post pandemic the Indian traveller has been inclined towards a distinctive wellness experience. Atmosphere Kanifushi has a tailor-made plan for Indians to partake of distinctive wellness experiences through daily yoga practice (focusing on different elements) healing therapy sessions natural walks and an introduction to Maldivian Ancient Remedies. Not only this we have seen many travellers coming to celebrate milestones occasions and all they need is a worthwhile experience. We customise plans according to the occasion of the travel and set up a special evening with all the bells and whistles from a lantern bar with a special dinner presenting a menu by the chef himself and pairing it with infused cocktails and organic wines or a personal BBQ set up on the beach under the stars along with other customised dining experiences for family and friends. The Atmosphere Kanifushi Plan also comes with complimentary water adventures and sports another trend which many travellers have shifted to while being in the lap of Maldives.Just Veg is the first Only vegetarian restaurant in the Maldives… What benefits does that bring to Kanifushi? What is the USP of the restaurant?A complete vegetarian fine dining experience is unsurprisingly unusual for anywhere in the world which makes Just Veg unique itself. For Atmosphere Kanifushi Just Veg has served the right purpose from the Mediterranean Arabic and Indian regions along with a special menu specifically for Jain Cuisine. Many guests who are non-vegetarians would just come by to the restaurant to experience and try the exclusive menu. Even most of our Indian guests were more mentally satisfied while being served a vegetarian dish in an exclusive vegetarian outlet. We have seen that most of our guests who are vegetarians would rebook us when they are in Maldives as they would not need to worry about ordering for a part of the menu but they have a whole menu for themselves.What are your plans for 2022-23?We are currently working on our plans for 2023 and beyond but suffice to say that we are constantly making tweaks and improvements to provide our guests with exceptional stays and memories to last a lifetime.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiRWh0dHBzOi8vZXZva2UuaWUvMjAyMi8wOC8yOC9zdHlsZS9naWxsaWFuLWFuZGVyc29uLTE5OTUtZ29sZGVuLWdsb2Jlc9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Gillian Anderson's Dress Was Classed Worst Dressed Globally,"A certain not-in-anyway-comfortable trend is making a comeback recently yes everyone from Kim Kardashian to Emily Ratajkowski made the case for exposed thongs.

If you take a look back through the annals of red carpet style you will see in fact that it was Gillian Anderson who was intuit to the trend when she wore an Eduardo Lucero navy blue dress with a thong-style detail at the back to the Oscars Vanity Fair after-party in 2001.

Today's top videos

The Crown star has enjoyed a long and successful career in the spotlight and her red carpet evolution has also been incredible with her style becoming more refined through the years.

Except there is one dress that The X Files actress said was her most ‘offensive’ ever.

Rewind to the year 1995 where the British-American actress attended her very-first Golden Globes.

For the milestone red carpet moment she wore an off-the-shoulder cleavage-showcasing satin dress by Pamela Barish.

In an evocative colour palette of gold and white the floral print dress also had a thick gold sash around the waist.

Gillian opted to keep her make-up light and she wore her hair in loose curls for the red carpet. Either way she made a serious style statement.

In an interview with Entertainment Weekly in 1997 the actress said of the gaudy and glitzy look: ‘From that point on I had to start paying attention to what I wore.’

Through the years the dress has actually been named by Vogue as one of the unsung style heroes of the Golden Globes during the 90s.

In 2016 the star gave some insight into how she actually felt about her gleaming Golden Globes gown.

The Sex Education actress posted a throwback to the awards ceremony on social media with a picture of herself and her X Files co-star David Duchovny on the red carpet arm-in-arm.

She tagged the caption: ‘The Priest and the Geisha Girl From Hell: A Novel. #tbt’

In an interview with Elle Magazine in April 2020 the Emmy winner actress took a trip down memory lane and reminisced on her fashion mistakes.

During the interview the 54-year-old actress revealed that she doesn't think she's dressed in anything as ‘offensive’ since her first gold Golden Globes gown!

Talking about sartorial blunders Gillian admitted: ‘I have looked in the papers the next day and thought Well that was a mistake…’

Then talk turned to the Golden Globes moment as she explained: ‘I made a fashion choice that I cannot quite understand now…’

‘It was a gold dress slightly like a geisha style with a band around the middle. I was on the worst-dressed lists all over the world. I don't think I've worn anything quite as offensive since then.’

The award-winning actress concluded by sharing what fashion has taught her about life and the words of advice she now lives by: keeping things simple moderation is key!

This helps to reduce your risk to some extent while still giving you the greatest risk-adjusted returns. Investments in mutual funds are ideal for portfolio diversity since they offer greater long-term returns and help you build wealth. Financial advisors typically advise looking at past performance stock holdings fund manager experience sector allocations and much more. But in this section we'll focus on SBI Contra Fund - Direct Plan - Growth which based on a number of risk ratios is outperforming all other funds in its category.

SBI Contra Fund - Direct Plan - Growth

The fund was launched on July 14th 1999 and is now rated 1 by CRISIL and 5 stars by Value Research. As of June 30 2022 SBI Contra Direct Plan-Growth had assets under management (AUM) at Rs. 5291.25 crores and as of August 26 2022 the fund's NAV was Rs. 229.66. The expense ratio of the fund which is 1.25 per cent is higher than that of the majority of other funds in the same category. Since its introduction SBI Contra Direct Plan-Growth has generated returns of an average of 15.01% per year and 22.06% over the past year which indicates that every two years the fund doubled investors’ money.

The fund has produced an annualised SIP return of 24.09% during the previous five years translating to a SIP of ₹10000 invested five years ago becoming almost ₹10.89 lakh now. The fund has produced an annualised SIP return of 36.79% over the past three years which implies that a SIP of ₹10000 invested in this fund three years ago would now have grown to around ₹6.05 lakh.

How SBI Contra Fund - Direct Plan - Growth is performing best in its category?

SBI Contra Fund outperformed its counterparts including ICICI Prudential Value Discovery Fund Templeton India Value Fund IDFC Sterling Value Fund Tata Equity PE Fund and Nippon India Value Fund in the previous year with a 1-year annualised return of 21.03%. The fund outperformed its indicated counterparts in the past six months with annualised gains of 12.75 per cent. In addition to its recent performance the fund is doing well in terms of risk ratios when compared to its rivals.

A standard deviation is a ratio that indicates the risk profile or volatility of a mutual fund's returns; the lower the ratio the better the fund may perform and provide returns that are higher than the category average. SBI Contra Fund's standard deviation ratio is 20.07 which is lower than the category average of 20.94 and indicates less volatility than its competitors. India Invesco Kotak India EQ Contra Fund - Direct Plan - Growth DSP Flexi Cap Fund - Direct Plan - Growth and Contra Fund - Direct Plan - Growth all have standard deviation ratios of 21.31 21.43 and 21.07 respectively.

A beta ratio indicates a mutual fund's relative volatility against its benchmark index. The beta ratio of the SBI Contra Fund is 0.87 in comparison to the category average of 0.93 which shows that the mutual fund is relatively less volatile than its benchmark S&P BSE 500 TRI. Invesco India Contra Fund - Direct Plan - Growth has a beta ratio of 0.96 Kotak India EQ Contra Fund - Direct Plan - Growth has a beta ratio of 0.97 and DSP Flexi Cap Fund - Direct Plan - Growth has a beta ratio of 0.94 all these fund's carrying high beta ratio than SBI Contra Fund indicating how volatile they are.

The risk-adjusted relative returns of the fund are measured using the Sharpe ratio which is a measurement of an investment's return after accounting for all underlying risks. SBI Contra Fund's Sharpe ratio is 1.11 higher than the category average of 0.81 indicating that it has outperformed its peers in terms of risk-adjusted returns. For example Invesco India Contra Fund's Sharpe ratio is 0.69 Kotak India EQ Contra Fund's Sharpe ratio is 0.64 and DSP Flexi Cap Fund - Direct Plan's Sharpe ratio is 0.67.

Jensen's Alpha ratio demonstrates how a mutual fund scheme's risk-adjusted return compares to the anticipated market return projected by the Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM). The Jension's Alpha ratio for the SBI Contra Fund is 9.17 higher than the category average of 2.93 indicating that the fund has surpassed returns that were expected by the market. Its peers such as Invesco India Contra Fund has a Jensen's Alpha ratio of 0.2 Kotak India EQ Contra Fund has a Jensen's Alpha ratio of -0.59 and DSP Flexi Cap Fund - Direct Plan - Growth has a Jensen's Alpha ratio of 0.18 demonstrating how the funds with the exception of SBI Contra Fund have underperformed the market in terms of all the risk measures mentioned above.

The idea of a reversible golf course is as old at the Old Course at St. Andrews and golf architect Joel Goldstrand built a series of nine-hole reversible courses for small clubs in Minnesota Iowa and North Dakota back in the 1980s. But give Tom Doak credit for convincing a client to take a chance on an 18-hole reversible layout. “The goal is to have two very different courses over the same piece of ground so people will want to stay over to play it both ways and compare and contrast the two.” says Doak. For our 2016 Best New competition Doak wanted the entire 36 holes considered as one entry. We allowed that and it won. For subsequent rankings we’ve separated the two into conventional 18-hole candidates. The Black Course is the clockwise routing slightly shorter and ranked slightly higher than its reverse image Red Course.

The Art Vision Cheboygan group is pursuing a $500 microgrant through the program which Owen Goslin executive director of the Cheboygan Area Arts Council said would be used as a down payment for the artist Russ LaLonde.

“We have a volunteer group called Art Vision Cheboygan which is supporting the project and helping to pick the design that was created by Russ LaLonde” Goslin said. “In general I think there is a lot of interest in it because Russ is a well-known artist in Cheboygan.”

Lalonde’s concept for the mural depicts trade beads a flower the lighthouse at Gordon Turner Park and other scenes and items unique to Cheboygan. Lalonde also proposed writing ""Welcome to Cheboygan"" in both English and Anishinaabe.

Connie Rieger project leader said the total estimated cost for the mural is around $2000 although there are still grant dollars and donations to account for.

Art Vision Cheboygan officials said they hope to have the mural installed sometime next spring.

According to the Michigan Municipal League Foundation the Bridge Builders Neighborhood program provides microgrants for community projects. Voting for Bridge Builders semifinalist projects is open Aug. 22-Sept. 4. Voting is allowed once per day per person by anyone in Michigan. The statewide juries will consider vote totals along with other factors when they select this year’s grantees.

The projects are in the following communities: Bridgman Cassopolis Cheboygan Chelsea Coopersville Dearborn Heights Detroit Flint Grand Rapids Hancock Harper Woods Hastings Iron Mountain Lennon Monroe Mt. Pleasant New Haven Ortonville Rochester Hills Romeo Romulus and Traverse City.

The land for Majestic Riverview Park was donated to the city in June 2021 with the request that the property be turned into a park. The park is named after the donor Tom Chastain’s mother's family.

The mural would be the first major installment at Cheboygan’s newest park.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMimAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5hc3BlbmRhaWx5bmV3cy5jb20vbmV3cy9hc3Blbi11bmljeWNsaXN0LWxlZnQtaGlzLW1hcmstb24tZmFtZWQtaXJvbi1ob3JzZS1iaWN5Y2xlLWNsYXNzaWMvYXJ0aWNsZV8yY2Q0OWZlOC0yNWI3LTExZWQtYWNmZi0yNzczZjE0NTNlYWEuaHRtbNIBnAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5hc3BlbmRhaWx5bmV3cy5jb20vbmV3cy9hc3Blbi11bmljeWNsaXN0LWxlZnQtaGlzLW1hcmstb24tZmFtZWQtaXJvbi1ob3JzZS1iaWN5Y2xlLWNsYXNzaWMvYXJ0aWNsZV8yY2Q0OWZlOC0yNWI3LTExZWQtYWNmZi0yNzczZjE0NTNlYWEuYW1wLmh0bWw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Aspen unicyclist left his mark on famed Iron Horse Bicycle Classic,"Close Get email notifications on {{subject}} daily!

""In the next 24 months everything will be finished or under development"" said Burke Larkin of Whisinvest Realty. ""In about 36 months I think we'll pretty much be seeing the conclusion of the project.""

Whisinvest acquired the land along Interstate 49 as part of a 2012 purchase of about 368 acres of bank-owned property in Benton County Larkin said. The company is still the landowner or building owner of the entire project area he said.

The project is situated in the southern portion of Pinnacle Hills designated the uptown regional center in the comprehensive growth map which guides development decisions for the city. Regional growth centers function as hubs for commerce arts and entertainment living recreation and retail according to the map.

Pinnacle Hills is one reason why Rogers is on course for a record year in sales tax revenue according to Steve Cox senior vice president of economic development for Rogers-Lowell Chamber of Commerce.

The city posted record-setting revenue numbers almost $2.461 million for August.

The 2-square-mile area represents well over $2 billion in development over the last 15 years according to Raymond Burns president and chief executive officer of the chamber.

Pinnacle Hills which extends from Village on the Creeks to Mercy Hospital and the Pinnacle Hills Promenade to recent developments around the Walmart Arkansas Music Pavilion has added to the quality of life in Rogers and The District will continue that Burns said.

""Back in the day I used to buy cow dirt out there"" he said. ""Seeing all that come together from its humbler beginnings has been amazing.""

THE PLANS

Five buildings totaling 153415 square feet -- two retail and restaurant spaces and three offices -- are already complete.

The buildings housing Andy's Frozen Custard Juicy Tails Fuzzy's Taco Shop European Wax Center Uptown Nail Spa Mirabella's Table and Smitty's Garage at 4200 and 4204 S. J.B. Hunt Drive and 4200 S. 48th St. were the first phase of development.

The second phase included class A office buildings at 4206 4300 and 4302 S. J.B. Hunt Drive one of which is home to Whisinvest Realty.

The final phase consisting of mixed-use buildings an outdoor plaza parking decks an apartment complex and a hotel will expand the project along Pauline Whitaker and the southbound ramp onto Interstate 49 to the Razorback Greenway which borders the property's eastern boundary.

Two mixed-use buildings are scheduled next for construction and should be ready for tenants in August 2023 according to Larkin.

The city's Planning Commission approved last month plans to construct a 40539-square-foot building a 61683-square-foot building and paved parking on 7.6 acres at 4301 S. J.B. Hunt Drive.

""We're excited to be building again and we're excited to be working with some of the tenants and restaurants we're talking to"" Larkin said.

In total the five mixed-use buildings of The District's third phase will house about 62500 square feet of retail and restaurant space primarily on the first floors and a total of about 107250 square feet of office space primarily on the second floors he said.

A green space plaza will be placed in the middle of the mixed-use buildings and south of the planned hotel. The plaza will include restaurant spaces of about 3500 and 4500 square feet according to Whisinvest.

The apartment complex on the eastern side of the development will house 305 units according to Whisinvest. It will be bordered on the west by the mixed-use buildings and a parking deck on the south by another parking deck and on the east by the Razorback Greenway.

The nearby portion of the greenway runs north and south parallel to Blossom Way Creek beside the eastern edge of the property.

THE HOTEL

Mississippi-based hospitality and real estate firm LRC2 Properties will co-develop with Whisinvest a luxury lifestyle hotel in the northern area of The District.

Regional growth the corporate and family markets and the nearby Walmart AMP all helped attract the firm to invest in the Rogers property according to Luke Chamblee president of LRC2.

The 150-room 95000-square-foot hotel will be a ""destination hotel"" in Marriott's Tribute Portfolio which are more customized and styled to the character of their locations than other Marriott brands according to Chamblee.

LRC2 is in the early design process Chamblee said.

Food and beverage establishments will be in the lobby and on the rooftop he said.

Details of the project and branding will be much clearer in about a year but the name likely will be something situated to the region like The Memphian in Memphis Tenn. he said.

LRC2's portfolio includes three hotels in the Tribute Portfolio family: The Memphian in Memphis and Cotton House in Cleveland Miss. both of which are finished; and The Alamite in Tuscaloosa Ala. which is unfinished.

The firm has also developed hospitality projects such as The Graduate and Home 2 Suites in Oxford Miss.; Hotel Indigo in Hattiesburg Miss.; and Holiday Inn Express and Suites in Flowood Miss.

Tribute Portfolio is ""a growing global family of characterful independent hotels drawn together by their passion for captivating design and their drive to create vibrant social scenes for guests and locals alike"" according to Marriott. The brand includes more than 70 hotels around the world.

Kathryn who shares two children with former Bravo personality Thomas […]

The California native 37 first joined the cast of the hit Bravo series in 2018 as star Thomas Ravenel’s girlfriend but exited one year later following their August 2018 split. The former couple’s ups and downs played out in front of the cameras throughout seasons 5 and 6 and Jacobs didn’t hesitate to acknowledge the moments she felt like she made mistakes.

Jacobs’ remark about Kathryn Dennis being an “egg donor” was a comment that filled the registered nurse with regret. “Yes. I regret that” the former Bravo personality exclusively told Us Weekly emphasizing her point by nodding her head enthusiastically. Dennis 31 and Ravenel 60 share daughter Kenzie 8 and son Saint 6.

Through the years — from Laguna Beach and The Hills to the Real Housewives and beyond the claws come out when action is called. Although Lauren Conrad butted heads […]

While she and the South Carolina resident talked it out on the show Jacobs wished Bravo had aired more of the footage. “It was a long conversation like … close to 30 minutes of talking to [Dennis]” the reality star recalled explaining that it was “whittled down to a minute.”

“I had all intentions of … meeting her and apologizing which I did do but it … spiraled pretty quickly” Jacobs told Us adding that she didn’t think the more productive parts of her and Dennis’ discussion would have gotten screen time in the first place. As for her infamous party crashing scene — during which she showed up uninvited to costar Patricia Altschul’s celebration — Jacobs revealed that that was another incident she wished had played out differently.

One regret she doesn’t have however is starring on the show in the first place. “I would [do a reality series] again — if I could do it with friends” Jacobs told Us explaining that she’d be more interested in participating in a Real Housewives-esque show as opposed to how she joined Southern Charm as a love interest.

Though the mom of one — Jacobs shares 12-month-old son Grayson with husband Mike Appel — didn’t name-drop any specific pals she’d choose for a hypothetical reality show she did tell Us the only person from the Bravo cast she’d like to spend time with in person.

“I loved Whitney [Sudler-Smith]” she dished about Altschul’s son. “He is so funny.” Though Jacobs doesn’t actually believe “he’d wanna see me ‘cause obviously I don’t like his mother” — the filmmaker 54 “would be probably the only person I would ever wanna like hang out with.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMitAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5wb3N0YW5kY291cmllci5jb20vYWlrZW5zdGFuZGFyZC9uZXdzL3BlcmZvcm1hbmNlLWVxdWluZS12ZXRzLW9mZmVyaW5nLWV4cGFuZGVkLXNlcnZpY2VzLWZvci1ob3JzZXMtd2l0aC1oZWFsdGgtaXNzdWVzL2FydGljbGVfNjU2MGM3MTItMjMxNy0xMWVkLWFkMWYtNmYzYzU1NzIzNGQzLmh0bWzSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Performance Equine Vets offering expanded services for horses with health issues,"Aiken SC (29801)

The NYPD had already made its first round of arrests at Columbia’s Gaza solidarity encampment and two days earlier faculty and students had been arrested trying to set up an encampment at NYU. No one knew what would happen at Harvard. The students involved in the protest had asked me to serve as a “police liaison” which involved speaking to the officers in charge and acting as a go-between if things got heated. That day dozens of students streamed out of the dormitories around Harvard Yard joined the hundreds gathered there for a protest and set up their tents. Since then I have served “shifts” as a police liaison for the encampment. Much of what I have written below is based on my observations.

Unlike the police at so many other American universities and in so many other American cities over the past two weeks the Harvard University Police did not move in to break the encampment up. The university administration had apparently anticipated the students’ actions: the gates of Harvard Yard had been closed for several days limiting access to university ID holders. As the protesters ran into the yard it quickly became obvious that Harvard police were willing to let them set up their tents as long as they did not attempt to occupy either of the two buildings on the yard that house the administration. Harvard would follow a different path than Columbia: rather than panic and apply overwhelming force it would test the students’ commitment using administrative sanction. But for the moment the mood in the Yard was joyous. In a matter of minutes the students managed to put up a dozen tents and inflate a giant watermelon-slice-shaped balloon; they were celebrating laughing and dancing.

The encampment now includes about fifty-six tents. Most of it sits between the headquarters of the Faculty of Arts of Sciences (University Hall) and the building that houses the president’s and provost’s offices (Massachusetts Hall). It is filled with precisely the diverse range of students that the university has long claimed it wants to bring together: Muslim Christian and Jewish; white brown and Black; gay and straight; cisgender trans and nonbinary; people whose origins lie all over the world as well as those who grew up in small towns in rural America. Students joke that it is the multicultural center that Harvard has never agreed to build.

On a lamppost facing University Hall they have posted a list of demands: that Harvard disclose investments that connect the university to the occupation of Palestinian land and the war in Gaza; that it divest from those holdings and reinvest the money in academic and direct support of Palestinian communities and culture; and that it drop all disciplinary charges filed against students for their nonviolent actions in the yard. So far the university has refused to negotiate. As the days pass the students have set up a small cluster of tents on the quadrangle (Tercentenary Theater) where commencement is scheduled to occur in two and a half weeks. At the front is a canopy-style tent with a table inside. Above it sits a hand-lettered sign emblazoned with the words DEAR ADMIN. COME TO THE TABLE and an arrow pointing downward to an open seat.

On Monday morning the university’s response arrived. It took the form of an email to the current university community and all Harvard alumni stating that students involved in “perpetuating” the encampment would be placed on “involuntary leave” a status usually reserved for those judged to be imminent dangers to themselves or the community. Involuntary leave is immediate—no disciplinary process precedes it—and stays in effect unless the university revokes it.

Still the encampment remains busy for most of the day. Groups of students sit on the steps of University Hall writing papers or studying for exams. Others gather and talk in small groups on the broad walkway between the grass and University Hall. Some pass a soccer ball back and forth in a circle. There are teach-ins about the Nakba the occupation and the war in Gaza. Anyone is welcome to attend. One afternoon there was a rally with drumming chanting and dancing on the walkways. At night some students retreat to tents; others pass through the encampment and along the surrounding sidewalks picking up trash. Many people here have hardly slept in days. A filmmaker colleague described the mood to me as sumud—an Arabic word that is generally translated as “steadfastness”—used in this instance to describe the feeling of joy amid great suffering. Not in spite of the suffering but because of it.

The encampment includes several large supply tents filled with what a colleague from the medical school referred to as “nearly a ton of simple carbohydrates.” The lawn where the encampment started is bisected by walkways and each section of grass is cordoned off by a flimsy rope fence. Students and administrators alike have tacitly used these ropes—originally intended to keep pedestrians from walking on the grass—to mark the distinction between the students who are in the camp and those who are there to support or observe them.

Around the edges student marshals in yellow vests warn anyone who walks among the tents that they are risking administrative sanction and arrest. For days when university officials come around to check ID cards which they do once or twice a day those in the camp would stay inside the line and those who are just visiting would stand outside. The officials would photograph their cards and enter them into a database the university is using to track students. More recently they have it seems been checking IDs in the yard at random photographing whomever refuses to comply. At least two professors visiting their students in the Yard have been stopped and photographed in this manner.

The encampment is full of posters placards and art. A sign at one end facing a now-locked gate reads WELCOME TO THE PEOPLE’S UNIVERSITY – FOR PALESTINE. Others say LIBERATED ZONE FREE PALESTINE and CEASEFIRE. On a scrolled-out piece of fabric about fifty feet long and a yard wide the students have recorded the names and ages of 5000 of the 34000 people who have been killed by the Israeli military in Gaza since October. At the head of the encampment sits the bronze statue of John Harvard the university’s seventeenth-century benefactor and namesake atop a six-foot plinth a keffiyeh wrapped around his neck.

Over the last seven months some of these students have been defamed and slandered their names and faces posted on the pro-Israel website Canary Mission which circulates information about students and faculty critical of the Israeli government’s policies. Their inboxes have filled with hate mail. One told me that a truck bearing a huge photo of her face beneath the legend “Harvard’s Leading Antisemites” had visited her hometown. “There are only five thousand people there” she said. “Three policemen. We don’t even have a fire truck.”

For much of this time Harvard was the epicenter of the nationwide panic over “antisemitism on American college campuses.” A handful of vocal critics on campus and a number of prominent figures in the mainstream media have reframed the understandable discomfort that some Jewish and Israeli students feel when confronted with insistent public protests against the state of Israel—and some scattered and contemptible incidents of genuine antisemitism—into a misleading claim that they are in constant danger as their fellow students run wild calling for as Representative Elise Stefanik put it “the genocide of Jews.” In the face of the McCarthyite congressional investigation that effectively toppled Harvard’s president Claudine Gay in January and the well-documented revolt of megadonors who perceived its actions in the fall to be insufficiently supportive of Israel the university administration long stayed largely silent about events on campus. Their silence has allowed those misrepresentations to stand.

In addition to the threat of involuntary leave the university had already brought disciplinary cases against dozens of students. The charges are confidential but generally they focus on the encampment’s disruption of university business. By best count there are now close to sixty students both undergraduate and graduate facing discipline up to and including expulsion.

The encampment is of course intended to be disruptive. That is the purpose of civil disobedience: to call attention to the gap between the course our institutions are following and the path of justice; and to let those institutions discredit themselves with disproportionate reactions to comparatively mild challenges. As the days have gone on the tone of the campers’ protest has become more confrontational: running a Palestinian flag up the standard affixed to the front of University Hall; setting up the branch encampment in the quad where commencement will soon occur. The administration has responded with still more disciplinary charges and has in some cases declared the belongings that students have set down on the steps while they visit the encampment to be abandoned property gathered their blankets and possessions (including in one case a bag containing a student’s laptop) placed them in trash bags and piled them up to await collection.

“Free free Palestine!” a hundred students chanted one day last week arrayed in a circle around the beleaguered dean who had been sent to photograph their ID cards. I felt for him as I am sure many of the students did. But this is the way the administration has chosen to engage the students: it has met them in the realm of administrative sanction rather than recognizing the moral purpose and institutional seriousness of the issues they raise.

From time to time a middle-aged man walks through the camp wrapped in an Israeli flag. There are other visitors too. One day I saw a couple of younger more intense provocateurs show up dressed in coats and ties with American and Israeli flags. They walked through the encampment filming people’s faces. Lately I have heard (though I have not witnessed it myself) that counterprotestors come some days and sit in the middle of the encampment for a time. Sometimes they put up their own posters around the John Harvard statue and sing; occasionally they too have photographed the faces of the protesters even when the latter were kneeling in prayer.

Curious professors and other university affiliates have also passed through. Some have stood among the students and threatened to join the protest if the university calls in the police to break up the encampment as has happened elsewhere. Though the encampment is easy to avoid some seem to want to see it without themselves being seen. They hurry by as if caught in a rainstorm eyes fixed in front shoulders tensed. Some are dismayed by it. Stephen E. Sachs Antonin Scalia Professor of Law at Harvard Law School visited the camp and described it on Twitter as “a bunch of people quietly hanging out and listening to a teach-in lecture amid handmade signs glorifying violence and urging the destruction of Israel.” The self-proclaimed free-speech advocate Steven Pinker visited the camp one afternoon and later told the Harvard Crimson that it should be torn down because he considered it designed “to make campus life as unpleasant as possible.”

I was especially interested in the response of an Israeli American computer science professor named Boaz Barak who last fall co-organized a letter that harshly criticized the students in the undergraduate Palestine Solidarity Committee. This letter as I have written elsewhere seemed to me both to misconstrue a statement that the students had made in the aftermath of October 7 and to exacerbate the climate of doxing and personal vilification that followed. And so I was surprised when on Twitter he wrote of his visit to the encampment: “Sorry to disappoint but none of them have horns and no one I talked to supports Hamas. I saw students who care very deeply about what is happening and mostly want the war to stop and the hostages to return.”

Though he wrote in a Crimson op-ed the same day that he believed the encampment was a distraction from the hard work of actually achieving those goals his statement nonetheless struck me as remarkable. In addition to the moral panic about antisemitism there has been a great deal of institutional alarm at Harvard about the inability of the students to sustain the sort of conversation that Barak described. The Council on Academic Freedom a faculty organization formed in March 2023 to promote “the free and civil exchange of ideas inside and outside the classroom” has been sponsoring a series in the Crimson that invites selected faculty members to model civil disagreement for the rest of the university community by staging debates on questions like whether meritocracy or legacy status is a better principle around which to organize college admission. Over the course of the spring the university administration convened three blue-ribbon committees devoted in one way or another to promoting dialogue and civility.

Outside of all that my colleagues have written tens of thousands of words in national publications and the Crimson about “academic freedom” “civil discourse” and “institutional neutrality.” Most of them come with lists of proposed principles rules and codes almost all of which provide only a restrictive and marginal allowance for on-campus protest or at least these protests. Few propose a standard as asinine as pleasantness for suppressing dissident speech but almost all have treated the protests as a problem.

These efforts are united in the presumption that it is the protesters who need to be taught to behave not the professors and other campus leaders who accuse students critical of Israel of being “antisemitic in effect if not intent” or even (as the president of Harvard Chabad Rabbi Hirschy Zarchi put it) “below an animal…a monster.” But civil discourse and critical inquiry are not abstract concepts in the encampment. They are active principles: the pro-Palestinian students and the Israeli American professor having a conversation agreeing to disagree about some things finding common ground about others.

In the last six months Harvard’s administration has revived reinterpreted and selectively enforced Vietnam War–era rules governing campus protest. In the days before the encampment went up the undergraduate Palestine Solidarity Committee was decertified for violating a rule against cosponsoring events with unregistered student organizations including Jews 4 Palestine. Left unsaid was that the university had placed an embargo on the registration of new student organizations at the beginning of the fall semester. There was then no authorized way that J4P and the PSC could have organized events together—events that surely would have contributed to a climate of “civil discourse” and mutual understanding on the campus.

Virtually every tactic employed by the protesters in the encampment has been deployed before and tolerated at Harvard: unregistered assembly in public spaces amplified speeches even putting up tents and sleeping in the yard. In a recent example of disruptive (and arguably illegal) assembly more than a hundred students ran naked through the yard and around the encampment in Primal Scream an annual ritual celebrating the beginning of final exams. Once the words “Ceasefire Now” or “Free Palestine” are spoken however students’ on-campus gatherings become the subject of extraordinary attention concern regulation and threatened sanction. Indeed because the rules in question were effectively tightened by a new administrative “guidance” in the middle of January which interpreted the university’s Statement on Rights and Responsibilities to forbid a wide spectrum of assembly and protest there is an odd sort of circularity at work here: your protest broke the rules we just formalized to keep you from protesting.

There has been a great deal of discussion about proportional response. Most faculty who have spoken publicly hate the idea of deploying the police to break up the encampment. Even the former Harvard president Lawrence Summers said in the Crimson that he hopes the university will rely on its own disciplinary apparatus to address the encampment at least in the short run. The administration has so far resisted calls to redefine the violation of rules regulating campus decorum as a “clear and present danger” to public safety that can be resolved only by deploying the police.

The students in the encampment are of course aware of the difference between sanction imposed by deans and the deployment of riot police. (For quite a few of them it must be said a sanction that threatens their visa status or health care coverage or suddenly renders them unhoused is a good deal more serious than a trespassing charge even if enforced by university administrators rather than riot police.) Some have explained to me however that they ground their action not in the rules of the university or even in their constitutional rights to assembly and expression but in the ruling of the International Court of Justice in response to South Africa’s case against Israel. These students agree with the ICJ that some statements by Israeli government officials and some actions of the Israeli army constitute a persuasive case that there is a genocide occurring in Gaza. In their view by investing in companies that support the occupation and supply the Israeli military—and refusing to disclose what those investments are so that they might be reasonably discussed—Harvard has failed to take a stand in support of international law and against genocide and so they must.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMidGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWJsb2NrLmNvL3Bvc3QvMjkzNjQzL3doaXRlLWhvdXNlLXNldC10by1ub21pbmF0ZS1jZnRjLWNvbW1pc3Npb25lci1qb2huc29uLXRvLXRyZWFzdXJ5LXJvbGUtYmxvb21iZXJn0gF4aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cudGhlYmxvY2suY28vYW1wL3Bvc3QvMjkzNjQzL3doaXRlLWhvdXNlLXNldC10by1ub21pbmF0ZS1jZnRjLWNvbW1pc3Npb25lci1qb2huc29uLXRvLXRyZWFzdXJ5LXJvbGUtYmxvb21iZXJn?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,White House set to nominate CFTC Commissioner Johnson to Treasury role: Bloomberg,"The White House is set to nominate Commodity Futures Trading Commission's Kristin Johnson to a top position at the U.S. Treasury Department Bloomberg reported on Thursday.

It makes a huge difference.”

Homeownership is a cornerstone of the American dream promising people the opportunity to build generational wealth. Yet it increasingly feels out of reach for many first-time buyers particularly Black Hispanic and Latino people across the country.

The homeownership rate for Hispanic Americans (51 percent) and Black Americans (43 percent) is far behind the rate for white Americans (71 percent) according to the National Association of Realtors. However one recent study found that by 2040 70 percent of new first-time homebuyers will be Hispanic. This is because the Hispanic population is much younger than other racial and ethnic groups – meaning that its young people will begin forming families and purchasing homes at a much higher rate than their peers. However that doesn’t mean they won’t have to face the same structural barriers to home-ownership.

Delgado a first-generation Dominican American born and raised in Manhattan is determined to overcome those barriers. Growing up in New York City he saw the effects of systemic inequities within his community. Today he knows that owning a home can be one of the most effective ways for people to overcome those barriers. He also knows that the obstacles for prospective homeowners aren’t exclusively financial; they’re also cultural and linguistic and closely linked to one’s zip code.

Matt walks Janet through the details of her loan.

Matt walks Janet through the details of her loan.

That reality is especially clear to someone like Delgado who works with customers across the income spectrum in two starkly different neighborhoods. At the northern tip of Manhattan he works in Washington Heights a diverse neighborhood with a vibrant Dominican population. There are hilly streets lined with a mix of old row houses and larger apartment complexes bustling restaurants—and the overwhelming majority of people who live there are renters. In fact only 10.5 percent of residents in Washington Heights own their homes.

Just six miles away where Delgado works on the Upper East Side it’s a different world. The Upper East Side is one of the city’s wealthiest neighborhoods and the percentage of homeowners there is almost four times as high.

In both neighborhoods the interiors of the Chase branches look remarkably similar but the circumstances of the people Delgado meets are vastly different. Many customers in Washington Heights do not speak English as their first language. Delgado had long noticed that people were asking the same questions about homeownership. The majority of them particularly Spanish speakers were struggling to get the answers they needed.

“Imagine this” Delgado says. “You have the means to buy a home but you may be unfamiliar with the US banking system and so you need to speak to someone in Spanish. But most people in the bank you walked into speak English. Think about how frustrating that is.”

Matthew Delgado a home lending advisor at JP Morgan Chase “We're making differences here that can't be measured in dollars.”

To address this issue Delgado started hosting monthly seminars at a Chase branch in Washington Heights in both Spanish and English. When the branch closed for the evening Delgado and his team would set up folding chairs in the lobby of the bank. Then he would wheel a whiteboard to the front of the room as members of the community filed into the space. Suddenly the branch would come alive again turning into part classroom part community center. The seminars were a chance for Delgado to address people’s concerns and share information about the resources available to them in a language they understood. Attendees would walk out with a sense that home-ownership was attainable and often a much better option than renting.

“With homeownership you start building equity on day one” Delgado says. “During my seminars I almost always talk about the rule of 1500. If you’ve been renting for five years at $1500 a month by the end of that period of time you’ve given away $90000.”

Of course with homeownership there are upfront costs such as the down payment and the closing costs which often disproportionately present barriers for Black Hispanic and Latino households. According to recent data from the Federal Reserve for instance nearly 30 percent of white families received an inheritance or gift compared with about 10 percent of Black families 7 percent of Hispanic families and 18 percent of families of other races or ethnicities. Without that financial boost saving for a down payment is difficult

Increasingly financial institutions committed to closing the racial wealth gap are finding new ways to provide a leg up. The Chase home-buyer grant which offers $5000 to first-time buyers to help cover closing costs and down payments1 is currently available in low- to moderate-income communities and in neighborhoods that are predominantly Black Hispanic and Latino regardless of income. The grant is part of JPMorgan Chase’s $30 billion Racial Equity Commitment. The commitment includes $8 billion earmarked to increase homeownership among Black Hispanic and Latino families.

Matthew Delgado a home lending advisor at JP Morgan Chase “This is $5000 that you can use towards offsetting your down payment towards offsetting those closing costs. It makes a huge difference.”

“The majority of our racial equity commitment is toward lending and helping more people access and afford mortgages” says Carolina Jannicelli head of community impact at JPMorgan Chase. “It’s critical to have people like Matthew Delgado who live and work in the communities we serve providing local access to resources and information that make banking more accessible.”

HUDSON VALLEY NY — There is something enigmatically romantic about hot-air balloons.

Rather than slicing or gliding or even sailing through the sky hot-air balloons are held majestically buoyant in the air at the whims of the breeze. Translucent brightly colored billowing envelopes that both glow with flames that send them soaring skyward and at the same time catch the sunlight and shadows that chase them across the vaguely familiar landscapes below have an almost otherworldly ability to slow time. The JPMorgan Chase 31st Annual Hudson Valley Hot-Air Balloon Festival multiplies the effect with each vessel that slowly rises above earthbound limits of humankind. With 100 planned ascensions and mass balloon launches there are plenty of opportunities to be among the soaring laureates in the clouds even for those who prefer to maintain a literal tether to the ground.

On the other hand there are plenty of good reasons to keep your feet on the ground at a festival dedicated to the art of floating aloft. In this case attendees may find the grass is greenest under the soles of their own comfortable shoes. For one there is no better place to enjoy the picturesque perfection of a mass balloon watch than from a picnic blanket. For those in sturdy wicker baskets the live music on the ground will fade away as altitude is gained until only the roars of propane burners break the silence.

While enjoying a glass of champagne might be a traditional way to mark the occasion of dreamily defying gravity those in the mood for a refill (or two) are best served by remaining at the same elevation above sea level as the beer and wine tent on the festival grounds fully stocked with offerings from Sloop Brewing Company. If there weren't enough reasons to keep your eyes on the sky and your toes in the grass tempting culinary treats from Cousins Maine Lobster Donuts for Days Farmers & Chefs Restaurant and Kingsbridge Social Club will have you putting off departure plans — by lighter than air flight or any other mode of travel.

There will also be morning yoga sessions.

Evelyn Hockstein/Pool via AP

SEC Chair Gary Gensler was asked about remote work in a CNBC interview Friday.

His staff is under a voluntary remote work policy – 'that's where we are' Gensler says

Other Wall Street executives aren't so sold on remote work reports say.

As Wall Street executives continue to debate in-office work – and some pressure workers to return – the Securities and Exchange Commission boss isn't leaving remote work behind just yet.

SEC Chairman Gary Gensler told CNBC in a Zoom interview on Friday that his staff is performing well while working remotely.

Gensler acknowledged to anchor David Faber the benefits of being in the office but said his staff has a choice on where they want to work.

""We've worked with our bargaining unit with the union representatives we moved to voluntary remote. That's where we are"" Gensler said.

JPMorgan chief executive Jamie Dimon has made headlines for his views on remote work pushing back on it during a client call in August Insider's Hannah Towey reported.

He reportedly criticized the working style saying it ""slows down honesty and decision making"" the report says.

According to a New York Post report job security on Wall Street is suffering as revenues drop. In July both JPMorgan Chase and Morgan Stanley reported ""surprisingly steep profit drops"" the report says.

US financial services major JP Morgan has picked up over 1.16 million sq ft office space at Nirlon Knowledge Park in Goregaon suburb of Mumbai through a long-term lease of over 10 years with an option of extending the same by additional 10 years.This is one of the largest commercial real estate transactions concluded by any multinational company anywhere in India this year.The financial giant’s India arm JP Morgan Services India will be paying rentals of Rs 145 per sq ft a month for the leased office space taking its payout in the first year alone to nearly Rs 202 crore. The lease rentals to be paid by the company across the 10-year tenure will be over Rs 2400 crore including the rentals escalations.The agreement between JP Morgan Services India and Nirlon provides for a rental escalation of 15% every three years. The lease tenure has five years of lock-in period.JP Morgan Services India has paid Rs 151.39 crore as refundable security deposit to Nirlon while concluding the transaction.As part of the lease the company will also get exclusive access to a total 1130 car parking slots showed the documents accessed through real estate analytics firm Propstack. While JP Morgan had announced the commitment to lease this office space in 2019 the deal has been concluded and registered now.As per the lease terms JP Morgan Services India has picked up over 34 floors across three wings of one of the towers and also their basements.Singapore’s sovereign wealth fund GIC  owns a majority stake in Nirlon that controls Nirlon Knowledge Park a large-scale information technology office park. The commercial property is spread across a total construction area of 3.3 million sq ft along the Western Express highway.The lease agreement’s option of total 10-year extension includes an option of two extension terms of five years each. Extension term license fees or rentals for these extensions will be determined by both the parties at least nine months prior to the expiry of license term or the first extension term.Earlier this month Citicorp Services India part of Citigroup’s India franchise also entered into an agreement to renew its lease of over 160000 sq ft office space at Nirlon Knowledge Park.Citicorp Services has renewed the lease for the office space spread over six floors for a term of five years with a lock-in until September 2024. Citicorp Services will be paying a rental of nearly Rs 137 crore across the total tenure of the lease excluding rental escalations.ET’s email query to GIC and Nirlon remained unanswered until the time of going to press while JP Morgan declined to comment for the story.The commercial office segment which was significantly impacted by the pandemic has made a strong comeback in the last 3-4 quarters supported by strong economic growth increased hiring and a return to the office trend keeping the office sector buoyant.The Indian office market grew substantially and delivered a strong performance in the first half of 2022. Office transactions recorded at 25.3 million sq ft a 107% on-year growth indicated the potential of the market on the back of a waning pandemic and the promise of a sustained economic recovery.The IT and ITeS segments are among the prime drivers of overall leasing activity in the top cities and bulk hiring by these firms will influence demand for large quality office spaces.New large-size leases are an indication that the market is seeing a steady recovery and confidence among occupiers with regard to the organisations’ real estate requirements is inching upward."

India is a part of the pharmaceutical giant Johnson and Johnson’s (J&J) “worldwide portfolio assessment and commercial decision to transition to an all cornstarch-based baby powder portfolio.’’

In its statement the Company said that as a result of this transition talc-based Johnson’s baby powder will be discontinued globally in 2023.

The announcement earlier this month comes two years after J&J discontinued the product in the U.S. and Canada.

Child rights groups parents and doctors have been questioning the continued availability of the product here in India. Indian drug regulators have been silent on this issue; allowing wide availability and sale of this product in the country.

The Company has said that “In India there is no plan to withdraw this talc and that there will be no recall. The product is safe and will be available till manufacturing stops.’’

“Product caused ovarian cancer”

The Company’s decision to stop production comes following multiple lawsuits from women who claim that the product caused them to have ovarian cancer due to the alleged contamination of asbestos a known carcinogen.

The Company has maintained that their older (which is not corn-starch-based) product is safe.

“Our position on the safety of our cosmetic talc remains unchanged. We stand firmly behind the decades of independent scientific analysis by medical experts around the world that confirms that talc-based Johnson’s Baby Powder is safe does not contain asbestos and does not cause cancer” the Company said in its statement.

“In India the Company is late in implementing the strategy which has been adapted in the western part of the world. If a product is being discontinued for manufacturing why should it be sold and why not recall it?”questioned Dr. Suresh Kumar Panuganti lead consultant-Pediatric Critical Care Yashoda Hospitals Hyderabad.

“Inhaling talc leads to respiratory illnesses”

For decades now doctors have advised parents not to use talcum powder on babies even if it does not contain asbestos cautioning that inhaling the talc can lead to respiratory illnesses.

Dr. Syed Mustafa Hasan director and senior consultant Paediatrics and Neonatology Aakash Healthcare said that we already know the harmful effects of asbestos which has been found in their talc-based baby powder on respiratory health. Asbestos is primarily a building material commonly used in India during the 1980s often in fireproofing and insulation.

“When talc is contaminated with asbestos it is more likely to contain highly carcinogenic tremolite or anthophyllite. They are considered more carcinogenic than chrysotile the most-used type of asbestos. Prolonged breathing of asbestos increases the risk of multiple cancers including lung and colon cancer. Infants and children below the age group of 5 are five times more likely to get affected than a 30-year-old adult to develop mesothelioma a type of cancer linked to asbestos if they are exposed to it at the same time. This is because a child’s organs are more tender than an adult’s. Talcum powders are harmful for both the mother and baby’’ he explained.

In India the National Commission of Protection for Child Rights (NCPCR) had raised questions with the drug regulator over the lack of uniformity in the testing methods for detecting the presence of formaldehyde and asbestos (both identified as substances that promote the formation of cancer in humans) in J&J’s baby shampoo and talcum powder. A final decision on the matter is pending noted a senior Health Ministry official.

The Company has explained its transition to cornstarch-based baby powder stating that they continuously evaluate and optimize their portfolio to best position the business for long-term growth.

“Already sold in other countries”

“This transition will help simplify our product offerings deliver sustainable innovation and meet the needs of our consumers customers and evolving global trends’’ it maintained while admitting that the cornstarch-based Johnson’s Baby Powder was already sold in countries around the world.

Dr. Sumit Chakravarty senior consultant Neonatologist Asian Hospital explained that asbestos—a potential carcinogen—is certainly the culprit in one of the brands but the others need to check their level as well. He reiterated that in children the use of talc is not recommended as the particles can reach the lungs through the nose and cause acute respiratory illnesses sometimes severe enough to get the child admitted.

The Indian baby care products market is highly competitive with various regional and global players holding major shares and involved in their growth. The major players expanding their business are Johnson & Johnson Nestlé SA The Procter & Gamble Company Kimberly-Clark Corporation and Himalaya Global Holdings Ltd. collectively holding the majority share of the overall market said a report by Mordor Intelligence a market intelligence and advisory firm.",,,,,,,,,

For whatever reason.

Oscar Mayer is selling its first-ever “Cold Dog” a frozen pop that tastes like the brand’s hot wiener that allegedly boasts “both refreshing and smokey umami notes” of a hot dog and topped with a mustard swirl. The idea stems from an Instagram post on Oscar Mayer’s account a few months ago in which its followers originally deemed the idea “genius” in a poll.

“After the overwhelming fan excitement for our beloved Cold Dog it was a no-brainer to make this hot dog-inspired frozen pop a reality” said Anne Field an Oscar Mayer spokesperson said in a press release.

It’s not a nationwide release however. The “Cold Dog” is now on at sale for $2 at select Popbar locations in Long Beach New York City New Orleans and Alpharetta Georgia while supplies last. Popbar is a chain of gelato shops that helped Oscar Mayer make this freakish flavor.

Oscar Mayer owned by Kraft Heinz is used to making people squirm to attract attention to its packaged products. Earlier this year it sold a bologna face mask that quickly sold out on Amazon.

In 2019 Kraft wrote down the value of its Kraft and Oscar Mayer brands by $15 billion because consumers have shifted their preferences away from processed foods.

Companies including Tyson Foods Inc. and Kraft Heinz Co. have been searching for carbon dioxide as supply disruptions this summer exacerbated existing shortages threatening production of goods from cold cuts to beer.

Carbon dioxide is widely used throughout food and beverage industries including to stun animals before they are slaughtered and to chill and process meat. The gas puts the pop in soft drinks and the fizz in beer and is turned into dry ice to keep food frozen.

Supplies of carbon dioxide a byproduct of industrial processes such as ethanol and fertilizer production have been tight since early 2020 when many Americans stopped driving due to the Covid-19 pandemic slashing ethanol demand. Now shortages of the gas have grown acute in parts of the country according to carbon-dioxide suppliers and food industry officials as production disruptions coincided with strong summer demand. Maintenance shutdowns at industrial facilities that produce the gas this fall are expected to keep supplies tight.

Some major suppliers have limited deliveries to their customers gas-industry officials said touching off a race by meatpackers brewers and others to find alternatives.

“Supply is in a very fragile state"" said Scott Van Pelt vice president of sales for Roberts Oxygen Co. a Maryland-based distributor of industrial gases such as carbon dioxide. “There’s no room for error.""

Meatpacking giant Tyson has sought carbon dioxide for meat and poultry plants across the country in recent months according to correspondence viewed by The Wall Street Journal. In May Tyson said in the correspondence that it was in an emergency state and needed help closing gaps in its carbon-dioxide supplies at plants in Iowa and Nebraska. In June the company said it was in need of gas for plants in 10 U.S. locations including in Maine Alabama and Arkansas.

“We have a very big need and anything would be greatly appreciated"" Tyson said in an email to carbon-dioxide suppliers.

A Tyson spokesman said the company monitors the availability of raw materials and production inputs including food-grade carbon dioxide. “We’re also exploring new options to help address future supply-chain issues related to carbon dioxide"" he said.

Rich Gottwald chief executive of the Compressed Gas Association a trade group said carbon-dioxide suppliers are working to meet customers’ needs and that the group anticipates a return to normal in mid-to-late October.

For now Mr. Van Pelt said he is warning customers that Roberts Oxygen likely will have to limit its deliveries in coming weeks and that he is encouraging companies to find ways to use less of the gas or reduce production.

Roughly 70% of carbon dioxide produced in the U.S. is used for food and beverages Mr. Gottwald said. That includes during the production of foods from pizza to chicken breasts which often move through carbon-dioxide-filled tunnels to be frozen. That process takes a fraction of the time and space that chilling in a mechanical freezer requires.

Kraft notified retailers in August of disruptions to the company’s meat supplies citing “severely constrained"" carbon-dioxide supplies and other issues. Kraft warned retailers about a major outage of deli-fresh turkey cold cuts and spot cuts of items such as Oscar Mayer bologna.

“Without CO2 we’d lose significant shelf life on our products"" according to a communication from Kraft to retailers viewed by The Wall Street Journal. The company said it is particularly exposed because many of its plants are in the Southeast where supply issues have been most severe.

Kraft declined to comment.

Carbon-dioxide supplies typically tighten during the summer as demand for products such as beer and soda increases and high temperatures this year have intensified that demand according to Mr. Gottwald.

Supplies of the gas have been further strained this year due to processing disruptions stemming from issues at a source known as Jackson Dome Mr. Gottwald said. Jackson Dome is an underground deposit in Mississippi that holds naturally occurring carbon dioxide and is owned by Texas-based energy company Denbury Inc. He said the situation which lasted for several weeks was resolved earlier this month.

A Denbury spokesman said its customers are receiving all of the CO2 they are requesting adding “We continue to work with certain of our customers with specific needs such as food and beverage grade requirements to address processing issues that may exist in their distribution chains.""

Maintenance shutdowns at other industrial facilities that produce carbon dioxide are scheduled for September and October Mr. Gottwald said which will keep supplies tight in coming months.

Some regional carbon-dioxide suppliers say they have been fielding dozens of calls each week from food and beverage companies hunting for alternate supplies. Some of those companies included General Mills Inc. and Butterball LLC according to one supplier.

General Mills recently faced the prospect of pausing production at an Iowa plant that produces the company’s Betty Crocker baking mixes if General Mills couldn't find additional supplies the supplier said.

General Mills declined to comment.

A Butterball spokeswoman said the company has been working since 2020 to mitigate its reliance on carbon dioxide but that some critical processes still require the gas. The company has been working to secure what it needs to keep operations running with minimal disruption she said.

Regional suppliers with gas to spare say they are shipping carbon dioxide as much as three times farther than normal to meet the needs of new customers while other suppliers are sending trucks hundreds of miles farther afield to secure supplies for customers.

Vinnie Cilurzo co-owner of California-based Russian River Brewing said his carbon-dioxide supplier recently informed him that it wouldn’t be able to keep supplying him. Mr. Cilurzo said he found a new supplier just before running out but paid double his normal price for the first delivery this week.

“Without carbon dioxide there is no beer"" Mr. Cilurzo said.

But the people who can eat a lot can land themselves on the wall of fame for food challenges. I have always been envious of the people who can actually win a food challenge that is extreme.

If you or someone you know can eat pounds of food like it is going out of style be ready for this. I am sure you have heard about the popular food chain in El Paso Skinny's BBQ right?

There are some people in El Paso who can handle eating a lot of food with no problem. Of course eating a lot is not very healthy and can physically make you sick.

Well just recently Skinny's BBQ announced that they will now have a food challenge for you to try. It is called the Malo Flaco Challenge which is over 3 pounds of food.

via Skinny's BBQ Facebook via Skinny's BBQ Facebook loading...

Now this challenge seems anything but flaco and more like gordo if you ask me. I reached out to Skinny's BBQ asking if any of the staff could complete the challenge but so far no one.

But if you're a big eater and can handle and is up for a food challenge try and get your photo on the wall of fame. Plus not only that you can sport a t-shirt that gives you bragging rights about winning Skinny's BBQ food challenge.

So if you can consume 4 1/2 pounds of food then you got this in the palm of your hand. Something to keep in mind if you can't finish within the 30 minutes then you must pay for the food you tried to consume."

While I've tried many sodas flavors I've also seen many come and go (I still miss Tab Energy!). With countless brands coming and going I looked back at some of the discontinued fruit-flavored drinks you probably won't see on the shelves again. Some varieties were ill-fated like limited-edition flavors while others were discontinued due to unpopularity and low sales.

Dr Pepper Berries & Cream was a unique berry-forward flavor released in April 2006 and then later discontinued in December 2007.6254a4d1642c605c54bf1cab17d50f1e

Diet Pepsi Jazz

This soda no one really asked for came in two fruity flavors: Black Cherry and French Vanilla and Strawberries and Cream (and also Caramel Cream) when it was released in 2006. All of these flavors seem like a lot and we're not surprised they were discontinued.

Pepsi Blue

Once again Pepsi was out there with a wild fruity soda. This one was actually blue-colored and supposedly tasted like mixed berries. Blue is actually considered one of the least appetizing colors so it's not a shock this drink was only on the shelves for two years.

30 Facts About Soda That You'll Find Totally Disturbing

Mountain Dew Typhoon

With a tropic fruit punch flavor this fan voted for and endorsed Mountain Dew was a limited release and only hit store shelves between 2009 and 2011. Like other fan-favorite drinks it's inspired petitions for its re-appearance.

Dr Pepper Red Fusion

While you can find a lot of different flavor varieties from Dr Pepper now in 2002 Red Fusion became the first new flavor Dr Pepper added in its over 120-year history. The cherry-forward flavor wasn't really embraced by fans of the spicy-sweet soda and was discontinued (of course there are still some people who want it back).

Aspen Soda

Created by Pepsi in the mid-70s this ""crisp"" apple-flavored soda was meant to be an alternative to lemon-lime sodas. Clearly the market wasn't interested and Aspen quickly disappeared.

Life Savers Soda

Calling this a fruit soda might be a stretch but you're probably not surprised that the soda blended with the flavor of fruit candies–and was brown for some reason–wasn't a big hit.

Coca-Cola with Lime

Coke and lime is a pairing you see all of the time but this fruit blend didn't click with soda fans. Perhaps the flavor of the lime in soda is probably better if it's freshly squeezed.

Tab Energy

This pink energy drink under the Tab brand umbrella was marketed as ""fuel to be fabulous"" and tasted like sour berries. The only thing it really had in common with regular Tab was the pink can and it was gone from stores by 2008.

Kick

This bright lemon-lime soda was pretty clearly launched as a competitor to Mountain Dew and the marketing was heavily focused on gaming and extreme sports. It disappeared from shelves in 2002 when RC Cola was acquired by Cadbury Schweppes.

As Little Rock wakes up from the pandemic and stretches its social circles party throwers and partygoers alike will find that a number of event venues have popped up … from an iconic Quapaw Quarter home and a rustic vineyard to an old Kroger store.

With the fall social season almost upon us we decided to take a closer look at some of these relatively new party spaces dotting Pulaski County. (This list is nowhere near comprehensive. We contacted as many new-ish event centers as we could find; below is information from those whose owners or managers returned our calls before deadline.)

Here is what we learned.

A TOUCH OF QUALITY

The Selfie Lounge at A Touch of Quality Event Center 1715 Scott St. in Little Rock (Special to the Democrat-Gazette)

Felandria Jackson one of the owners of A Touch of Quality at 1715 Scott St. says the event space opened its doors in January 2017.

“We have a pretty large family and we were always looking for affordable venues — and I want to emphasize affordable” she says. “And we found that if you use hotels and certain other places they only want you to use their vendors and their food and their drinks.

“We knew that there are people who want to bring their own caterers … so that’s one of the key things that people like about us” Jackson adds. “We don’t require you to use anyone specific.”

The space has been rented for small weddings receptions parties business meetings conferences and even comedy shows.

“One of our signatures is we have a selfie lounge and every time someone comes in they are like ‘Oh I love the selfie lounge’ because of course everyone likes to take pictures.”

The venue also boasts a kitchen a dressing room for brides a buffet area and on-site tables and chairs.

CITY CENTER

Immanuel Baptist Church in Little Rock bought the former Kroger building at 315 N. Shackleford Road with the intention of housing a food pantry dental clinic and clothing closet for people in need — a City Center.

“It was a big big space — it’s over 120000 square feet — and we knew we didn’t need all that for a community center” says missions pastor Matt Hubbard. “So we also used a good chunk of it as an event center to host fundraisers or like today [the day of the interview] we’ve got the Arkansas Department of Education in for their annual convention.”

The Arkansas Baptist State Convention has a prayer gathering slated there and Immanuel has moved its City Center Conversations formerly held at the Robinson Center Performance Hall downtown to its own venue. Former pro basketball player Sidney Moncrief and his Game Changers organization have met there as have several private companies.

“There are not a lot of event venues with … top-end technology that have banquet and conference space of this size out in west Little Rock so that’s kind of why we started” he says of the building which is near the Big Rock interchange. The space accommodates 850 lecture-style seats or 500 at round tables.

“We can do multiple configurations of the large room with all 850 [seats] or just the center room for about 500 lecture-style and a couple of breakout rooms” he says.

The venue management offers vendor recommendations for catering. Alcohol isn’t allowed.

CLUB 27

Jorge Gutierrez is a mechanical engineer who in 2016 founded Club 27 primarily as a venue for tango and salsa dancing.

“Then people started asking about renting it and we kind of stumbled into that side of the business” he says.

The club is above Buenos Aires restaurant at 614 President Clinton Ave. Twice a week it is open to the public for dancing. The space is rented several times a month for a variety of private events including weddings and wedding receptions corporate gatherings holiday parties birthday parties graduation parties and a few fundraising events for nonprofit organizations.

Club 27 is a family affair — Jorge is the DJ and he also cleans the bathrooms. His wife Sarah Catherine Gutierrez is the mastermind behind the decor. Sarah Catherine is founder and chief executive officer of Aptus Financial and a paid monthly columnist for the Arkansas Democrat-Gazette.

Clients are allowed to use their own caterers but with its proximity to Buenos Aires many opt to have food served by the restaurant. Club 27 provides bar services based on the customer’s request for either a cash bar or open bar.

CYPRESS SOCIAL

Cypress Social another partnership between JTJ Restaurants and Louis Petit the other half of Petit & Keet opened at 7103 Cock of the Walk Lane in August 2020 following 16 months of renovation.

“It started out with the idea of it being sort of an event center” says Jake Keet. “But we talked with people so much who were wanting a restaurant in Maumelle and we eventually listened.” So it’s both.

Cypress Social — so named because of the reclaimed cypress used throughout — has a room across from the bar that can be closed off with frosted sliding doors to create a secluded space for a bridal party to prepare for a wedding.

That room dubbed “The Parlor” has a modern chandelier and low-intensity lighting and also works as a meeting space for groups of 20 to 30. A larger space with floor-to-ceiling windows and a deck view of the scenic pond and Cypress fountain behind the venue has room for 40 to 60 people.

“We’ve done some weddings out there; we’ve done some rehearsal dinners” Keet says. “We always execute those events with excellence with chef-driven food made from scratch.”

Weddings are typically scheduled for Sundays Keet says. The restaurant’s hours are 4-10 p.m. Monday through Saturday.

“It’s easier to rent the space on a day when the restaurant is going to be closed that evening” Keet says. “But we’ve also done several sort of brunch-style events for folks with early weddings on Saturdays and things like that.”

THE HALL

The Hall 721 W. Ninth St. opened its doors in October as a music venue and special events space. Josh Billue of Memphis is the owner.

“He loves Little Rock and saw a need for the size of The Hall” says Jeremy Hicks communication director. Hicks explains that in the music touring industry bands may start playing in venues with 500 people maximum capacity and work their way up to spaces that accommodate up to 1500 people. The Hall has standing room for 1300 people.

But The Hall is not just home to concerts.

“Our business is pretty much split in half between concerts and events” Hicks says. “Events can range from anything from weddings and receptions to gala fundraisers or corporate functions holiday parties — really anything you could need that size space for.”

The building was constructed in the 1990s and was most recently used as a copier warehouse before it became The Hall. It has “kind of an industrial chic look” but can be dressed up easily for more glamorous events he says. “What makes it unique is essentially you can have a high-energy live concert one night and the very next night you could have vendors come in and completely deck the place out for an elegant wedding. It’s just super versatile. It’s really wide open and that makes it a unique experience.”

Clients use their own caterers and The Hall provides beverage services Hicks says.

RED & BLUE

Cary Jenkins In 2018 Roby Brock and his wife Stephanie were looking for a wedding reception site for their oldest child but couldn’t find one that fit their needs. He says the spaces they saw were either “too big or too cookie-cutter.”

So the Brocks decided to create their own venue and found just the right spot at 1415 W. Seventh St. near the state Capitol. It was the right size and the rent was affordable he says. They named it Red & Blue.

Stephanie created the interior which Roby describes as “Arkansas style while a little bit contemporary.” Instead of traditional round tables Red & Blue has 10-foot farm tables. Barn doors hide the large-screen TV.

Since the Little Rock Club on the 30th floor of the Regions Bank building closed Roby says they have seen an increase in corporate luncheons. With close proximity to the Capitol the site has been the host of legislative-related events. Other events have included birthday parties rehearsal dinners wedding receptions and more.

Clients have the option of hiring their own caterer or doing the cooking themselves in the building’s kitchen. The Brocks also will recommend caterers when asked.

RUSTY TRACTOR VINEYARD

Cary Jenkins Rusty Tractor Vineyard 10 Rusty Tractor Lane off David O. Dodd Road opened in 2019.

“We focus a lot on weddings corporate events private parties that kind of thing” says Lexi Meyer event manager. “We do open to the public twice a month on Sundays typically depending on our event schedule. We post those on our Facebook and Instagram when we’re open.”

On those Sundays the vineyard does wine tastings and there are food trucks on site.

“We partner with Fassler Hall [a downtown Little Rock German-inspired beer hall and restaurant] and do a big Oktoberfest every year. Mother’s and Father’s Day we do kind of a big blowout. We’ve had a lot of introductions of new food trucks out here. We do live music” she says.

There is a bloody Mary and mimosa bar every Sunday and frozen wine cocktails are also popular.

“All of our wines are Arkansas-made and Arkansas-grown. We grow them right on site bottle on site and we sell wines on site” Meyer says. “We didn’t want to go into the food-service side of things so we work with a lot of food trucks.”

Meyer says the venue has had at least 200 events since opening three years ago. During covid surges the covered patio at the vineyard and open outdoor space made it possible for groups to meet safely.

“Something that’s unique about us is that we have a completely air-conditioned indoor space as well as a huge covered patio so we have the opportunity to do events year-round” she says. “We’re kind of like bringing Napa to Little Rock. It’s just absolutely beautiful here. The scenery really sells our venue and Sheree Meyer did a fantastic job bringing the outside [into] our indoor space.”

THE VENUE AT OAKDALE

The Venue at Oakdale 901 Kellogg Acres Road in Sherwood (Special to the Democrat-Gazette)

The Venue at Oakdale opened in April 2021 with 15000 square feet of indoor space and a capacity of 600 on the border of North Little Rock and Sherwood — 901 Kellogg Acres Road. “There was nothing in the area with kind of a more modern clean-line design” says manager Carol DePriest.

The Venue — owned by builder Brad Medlock Annie and Todd Adams and Brian and Sonja Glaze — provides patrons with tables chairs and linens and has a patio and courtyard area. Though they do not offer catering and bar services they will provide a list of suggested vendors upon rental.

“We have plans to have an outdoor ceremony space as well” DePriest says.

During covid surges the venue’s many doors were flung open for ventilation and there was room for guests to space out DePriest explains.

“Now we’re just busy” she says. “Everybody has just rescheduled and replanned and we are just booked. I would say that we have had at least 150 events since we opened and we are booking into 2024.”

The facility’s big windows let in plenty of natural light and show off the green space around the building secluded but still within 10 minutes of commercial areas.

“We have golf carts that go down and pick up our guests from our parking lot; our bridal suite and groom’s quarters have mini-fridges and lots of outlets and steamers and they are large so they can accommodate a nice size wedding party” she says.

THE VILLA MARRE

Steve Harrelson a lawyer and former state legislator bought the Villa Marre in 2019 and has been renting it for some events since then. It is his primary residence but he says he spends only a couple of nights a week there and travels the rest of the time.

Best known as the “Designing Women” house the site is frequently on tour bus routes. The exterior of the house was shown weekly in the opening of the TV sitcom that ran from 1986 to 1993.

“I think ‘Designing Women’ has some appeal to it” Harrelson says of why the house is unique. “But I think just being this peculiar type of architecture that’s not really found in Arkansas besides the 1836 Club and the administrative building at Arkansas Baptist College [which] are really the Second Empire architectural cases in Arkansas.”

Now that the country has sort of opened back up during the pandemic the house is the site for one or two events — mostly weddings and receptions — a month. Recently the house has been the site for several political events. It is located at 1321 Scott St.

Back in the day the Villa Marre was a bustling venue. It sat vacant for a couple of years and vagrants squatted in it stealing copper pipes and doing other damage. When Harrelson bought it he did extensive renovation work including painting and repairing water damage. He is in the process of renovating the kitchen so it will be more user friendly for caterers.

The Villa Marre is allegedly haunted by the ghost of Jennie Marre the wife of Angelo Marre who built the house in 1881-82. He died in 1889. She died in the house in 1904.

“I don’t know if it is Marre but there are definitely some questionable sounds from time to time” Harrelson says with a chuckle."

According to sources RWS management held a meeting on Friday night at which the company’s CEO Tan Hee Teck informed key staff of the move. MacDonald who will start from 1 September will oversee gaming operations and casino marketing across the integrated resort.

His appointment at RWS comes just 12 months after MacDonald stepped down as Corporate Senior Vice President and Chief Casino Officer at MBS operator Las Vegas Sands.

A veteran of four decades in the industry MacDonald’s career began as a dealer at Australia’s Wrest Point Casino in Hobart Tasmania before he became a regulator in Queensland.

He logged stints at Genting Crown and Jupiters Gold Coast – now The Star Gold Coast – before leaving gaming for investment banking as Managing Director and Co-Global head of Macquarie Capital.

LVS tapped MacDonald to join MBS in January 2010 where he eventually moved into a corporate role in 2012 rising to the role of Chief Casino Officer for the company globally. His duties included casino performance analysis and strategic recommendations for every Las Vegas Sands and Sands China Limited property.

Industry insiders have long said MacDonald has one of the sharpest mathematical minds in the gaming business and his influence on the industry can be felt across the planet – from Australia to Macau Las Vegas to Singapore – and in his teachings to quite literally tens of thousands of casino workers on the world’s gaming floors.

His appointment by RWS now places him in direct competition with his former employer as he looks to grow the company’s Singapore market share. According to analysts MBS has traditionally held between 55% and 60% of Singapore’s gross gaming revenues in recent years.",,,,,,,,,,,,

She is the first Comp­trol­ler at the Cus­toms and Ex­cise Di­vi­sion for quite some time that spoke di­rect­ly to the me­dia on this very trou­bling is­sue that has plagued the coun­try’s ports for sev­er­al years.

“I sent out a re­quest to the Per­ma­nent Sec­re­tary (PS) and Min­istry of Fi­nance. But re­mem­ber we don’t have peo­ple in Trinidad who can pro­vide that so it has to be out­sourced and that will be a lit­tle tricky be­cause they have to get all the specs” Mar­cial said.

“The specs have to be right and it has to be for what we want it for. So we’re work­ing on that. We did get some help from a US ad­vis­er. There’s a US ad­vis­er who is at­tached to the comp­trol­ler and they as­sist­ed us in putting to­geth­er some­thing.”

Two sep­a­rate se­nior cus­toms sources who spoke anony­mous­ly con­firmed that the Port of Port-of-Spain on­ly has ac­cess to one fixed scan­ner while the mo­bile scan­ners and fixed scan­ner at the Point Lisas Port are not op­er­a­tional.

“The mo­bile scan­ners are old and the con­tract to re­pair them with Massy is very cost­ly giv­en the age and fre­quen­cy of down­time af­ter it’s re­paired. The cost does not make eco­nom­ic sense. These mo­bile scan­ners were do­nat­ed to Trinidad by the USA quite a while now so the soft­ware has be­come ob­so­lete” one of the sources said.

There is al­so a high­ly or­gan­ised (il­le­gal) sys­tem with­in the port in­volv­ing work­ers who al­low il­le­gal items to pass through and en­ter the coun­try the source re­vealed.

That’s a high­ly or­gan­ised (il­le­gal) sys­tem with­in the port.”

The sources said that with the con­stant and ef­fi­cient use of scan­ners of­fi­cers could eas­i­ly dis­tin­guish be­tween dif­fer­ent com­modi­ties in a con­tain­er.

As an ex­am­ple they said the scan­ners would be able to iden­ti­fy a bi­cy­cle in a 40-foot con­tain­er.

In its ab­sence it makes it sig­nif­i­cant­ly eas­i­er for il­le­gal weapons and con­tra­band to pass un­no­ticed in con­tain­ers.

“We have 110 va­can­cies. I have asked for at least 100 new re­cruits…It’s still around that num­ber (60 per cent filled)” the Act­ing Comp­trol­ler said.

“What hap­pened is…I had pur­sued that (is­sue) with Fi­nance and PS and they ad­ver­tised the posts. Can­di­dates were short­list­ed. They had in­ter­views. They had ex­ams.

Ap­prox­i­mate­ly 87 per cent of mur­ders in Trinidad and To­ba­go are firearm-re­lat­ed ac­cord­ing to Trinidad and To­ba­go Po­lice Ser­vice sta­tis­tics.

At a PNM Pub­lic Meet­ing in Bel­mont last Tues­day Na­tion­al Se­cu­ri­ty Min­is­ter Fitzger­ald Hinds said the coun­try clear­ly has a prob­lem with guns.

“The SSA did a sur­vey and es­ti­mat­ed that there were 12000 il­le­gal weapons in Trinidad and To­ba­go and from the way it looks it might very well be more” he said.

He sought to as­sure those in at­ten­dance that the Gov­ern­ment has tak­en sev­er­al steps to at­tempt to pre­vent the en­trance and move­ment of il­le­gal firearms in­to and around Trinidad and To­ba­go.

This re­porter con­tact­ed Min­is­ter in the Min­istry of Fi­nance Bri­an Man­ning and the min­istry’s com­mu­ni­ca­tions team on the mat­ter in­volv­ing the scan­ners and the short­age of of­fi­cers but there was no re­sponse up to late yes­ter­day.

'Mil­lion-dol­lar in­vest­ment in scan­ners was to pro­vide added se­cu­ri­ty'

The Unit­ed States Cus­toms and Bor­der Pro­tec­tion do­nat­ed four mo­bile ve­hi­cles and car­go in­spec­tion sys­tem (VACIS) scan­ners to the T&T Gov­ern­ment in April 2018.

Two scan­ners were as­signed to the Port of Point Portin while the oth­er two were ex­pect­ed to be placed at the Port of Port-of-Spain.

It is un­cer­tain if they were.

At the un­veil­ing cer­e­mo­ny of the scan­ners at the Port of Point Lisas on April 18 2018 the event’s fea­ture speak­er Fi­nance Min­is­ter Colm Im­bert said “The Gov­ern­ment’s in­vest­ment in this ini­tia­tive is in­dica­tive of its deep com­mit­ment to bor­der se­cu­ri­ty and trade fa­cil­i­ta­tion. These mo­bile scan­ners can be used at oth­er lo­ca­tions for spe­cial op­er­a­tions. They will serve as an ef­fec­tive tool in as­sist­ing the Gov­ern­ment in pro­vid­ing added se­cu­ri­ty to the cit­i­zens of T&T.

“Cus­toms and Ex­cise of­fi­cers and guards have been trained in op­er­at­ing these mo­bile scan­ners and stand ready to car­ry out these func­tions ef­fi­cient­ly and ef­fec­tive­ly.”

Cus­toms and Ex­cise Di­vi­son falls un­der the purview of the Min­istry of Fi­nance.

The Act­ing Comp­trol­ler at the time Kathy-Ann Matthews al­so spoke high­ly of their pro­posed im­pact say­ing that “The Cus­toms and Ex­cise Di­vi­sion views the im­ple­men­ta­tion of these scan­ners as crit­i­cal and in­deed time­ly as we have seen the in­crease of il­le­gal ac­tiv­i­ty and the im­por­ta­tion of con­tra­band via the use of con­tain­ers. The mo­bile scan­ners will be very ef­fec­tive in de­tect­ing con­tra­band in­tend­ed for im­port ex­port or trans­port.”

Dur­ing his speech Im­bert lament­ed that vi­o­lent crime dri­ven by il­le­gal weapons and drugs was af­fect­ing cit­i­zens and busi­ness­es.

He re­vealed that the com­pa­ny that man­u­fac­tured the scan­ners Lei­dos Cor­po­ra­tion was con­tact­ed to over­see in­stal­la­tion main­te­nance and tech­ni­cal sup­port.

Ac­cord­ing to Im­bert the ini­tial train­ing and main­te­nance op­er­a­tions cost $16.6 mil­lion (TT) while a three-year main­te­nance and train­ing con­tract cost an­oth­er $9.9 mil­lion (TT).

That ini­tial con­tract ex­pired on Oc­to­ber 1 2020.

Ac­cord­ing to a cus­toms source the main­te­nance con­tract was giv­en to Massy.

While there are no sta­tis­tics read­i­ly avail­able for the num­ber of im­ports at the Port of Point Fortin for the year so far as of Au­gust 8 2002 there were 38693 im­ports at the Port of Port-of-Spain ac­cord­ing to the Port Au­thor­i­ty of Trinidad and To­ba­go’s web­site.

Ex­port con­tain­ers al­so not be­ing ex­am­ined

The se­nior cus­toms and ex­cise di­vi­sion source who spoke anony­mous­ly said that the vast ma­jor­i­ty of ex­port con­tain­ers are al­so not be­ing ex­am­ined by of­fi­cers.

They said there are a few large com­pa­nies (names called) that have their ex­port con­tain­ers ex­am­ined by of­fi­cers while oth­ers are part of a Vol­un­tary Com­pli­ance Pro­gram (VCP) ac­cord­ing to a doc­u­ment that the Sun­day Guardian ob­tained.

“Just look at the scrap met­al com­pounds on the high­way for ex­am­ple. Every day you pass they are pack­ing those with no of­fi­cers present” the se­nior Cus­toms and Ex­cise Di­vi­sion source said.

With the Gov­ern­ment ban­ning the ex­port of scrap met­al ex­ports on Au­gust 12 for six months (un­til Feb­ru­ary 23 2023) this means that scrap iron could still be leav­ing the coun­try il­le­gal­ly. The tem­po­rary scrap iron ban has al­so trig­gered fiery protests across the coun­try by scrap iron deal­ers who al­so staged a mo­tor­cade from San Fer­nan­do to Port-of-Spain last Wednes­day plead­ing with the Gov­ern­ment to re­verse their de­ci­sion.

In the last two years but es­pe­cial­ly with­in the last nine months the in­fra­struc­ture of the state’s util­i­ty com­pa­nies has been van­dalised by cop­per and met­al thieves.

Ac­cord­ing to Pub­lic Util­i­ties Min­is­ter Mar­vin Gon­za­les the il­le­gal trade cost the state’s util­i­ty com­pa­nies ap­prox­i­mate­ly $25 mil­lion in the last two years.

Last week Sun­day Guardian re­port­ed ex­clu­sive­ly that the il­le­gal cop­per and met­al ex­port trade in Trinidad and To­ba­go is part of an in­ter­na­tion­al crime op­er­a­tion with links to Venezuela and Chi­na.

Crim­i­nol­o­gist Dr Dau­rius Figueira said ac­cord­ing to his con­tacts those in­volved in the trade in­clude lo­cal and Venezue­lan gangs the Chi­nese mafia and well-re­sourced busi­ness­es that are ex­port­ing the il­le­gal prod­uct main­ly to Chi­na.

Dr Figueira said the trade took off in Venezuela in 2017 but the Gov­ern­ment be­gan clamp­ing down on the trade be­cause of its im­pact on state in­fra­struc­ture.

He said the trade spread from Venezuela in­to Trinidad in the last two years. His con­tacts on the ground in­formed him that the ma­te­r­i­al is com­ing in­to T&T to get ex­port­ed il­le­gal­ly to Chi­na.

Chi­na is the world’s largest con­sumer of re­fined cop­per. His claims about the lo­cal trade’s con­nec­tion to Venezue­lan and Chi­nese crim­i­nal or­gan­i­sa­tions were sup­port­ed by sources close to the trade.

The sources who spoke anony­mous­ly out of con­cern for their safe­ty told the Sun­day Guardian that the lo­cal trade is be­ing dri­ven by an ‘un­der­world fig­ure with links to peo­ple in South Amer­i­ca’.

They said that the US mul­ti-mil­lion dol­lar trade in­volves large amounts of cop­per and oth­er met­als be­ing brought across from Venezuela to Trinidad and To­ba­go.

The met­als ac­cord­ing to the sources are then picked up in Care­nage Ch­aguara­mas and Ce­dros.

They are then stored and processed in se­cret lo­ca­tions in many ar­eas in­clud­ing Point Fortin Debe and Diego Mar­tin be­fore be­ing shipped in con­tain­ers to Chi­na.

Two weeks ago Na­tion­al Se­cu­ri­ty Min­is­ter Fitzger­ald Hinds said that since 2020 218 peo­ple have been ar­rest­ed in re­la­tion to the theft of cop­per and met­als.

In 2020 he said there were 58 re­ports of theft with 30 peo­ple ar­rest­ed while in 2021 there were 87 re­ports of theft with 52 ar­rests.

How­ev­er the min­is­ter said the num­ber of re­ports and ar­rests in­creased sig­nif­i­cant­ly be­tween Jan­u­ary and Au­gust 2022 with 162 re­ports of theft and 136 ar­rests.

PSA–Out 33000 po­si­tions on 15000 hired

Ac­cord­ing to the Pres­i­den­tial Des­ig­nate of the Pub­lic Ser­vices As­so­ci­a­tion Leroy Bap­tiste–the ma­jor­i­ty union rep­re­sent­ing Cus­toms and Ex­cise Di­vi­sion of­fi­cers–the di­vi­sion is work­ing at half its ca­pac­i­ty and has been do­ing so for some time.

In fact he claimed that the en­tire pub­lic ser­vice is un­der­manned.

Out of 33000 avail­able po­si­tions in the pub­lic ser­vice the ser­vice is be­ing manned by 15000 pub­lic ser­vants he claimed.

Bap­tiste claimed the civ­il ser­vice de­part­ment agen­cies and ser­vices are be­ing de­lib­er­ate­ly starved of re­sources.

“The gen­er­al act of gov­er­nance is that they are not fill­ing va­can­cies with­in the pub­lic ser­vice and when there’s a com­men­su­rate drop in the lev­els of ser­vice they then de­monise the ser­vice as though the ser­vice is in­ef­fi­cient wher­ev­er you go” Bap­tiste said.

“The end re­sult is that you have the ser­vice un­der­manned by virtue of the lit­er­al sab­o­tag­ing of the civ­il ser­vice by the Gov­ern­ment. And you know what they do? They spread the no­tion of an in­ef­fi­cient pub­lic ser­vice as a pre­text to en­gage in re­struc­tur­ing ex­er­cis­es which again moves away the in­su­la­tion from po­lit­i­cal in­ter­fer­ence in these au­thor­i­ties whether it’s the Trinidad and To­ba­go Rev­enue Au­thor­i­ty(TTRA) the pro­posed Li­cens­ing Au­thor­i­ty a whole bunch of things they want to bring about.”

Ac­cord­ing to Bap­tiste the Gov­ern­ment in­tends to bring an end to the civ­il ser­vice by re­mov­ing per­ma­nent jobs and hir­ing peo­ple on con­tracts.

“You have no pro­tec­tion what­so­ev­er and then the politi­cian turned king; It’s at his wish and com­mand. You ei­ther work or you’re un­em­ployed. I think that’s the sad state of af­fairs here” he said.

“The next thing they do when they are starv­ing for man­pow­er they al­so don’t en­gage in the nec­es­sary in­vest­ment in things like tech­nol­o­gy and best prac­tice to im­prove the lev­el of ser­vice.

“So you cre­ate this en­vi­ron­ment where you have the pop­u­la­tion con­tin­u­ous­ly crit­i­ciz­ing the pub­lic of­fi­cers as though the pub­lic of­fi­cer is just in­ef­fi­cient. They came from Mars nah (sic) this bunch of in­ef­fi­cient peo­ple just run­ning the coun­try and there­fore you need to get rid of them.”

PM: De­spite chal­lenges Govt did not fire a sin­gle pub­lic ser­vant

At a PNM Pub­lic Meet­ing in Bel­mont on Tues­day Prime Min­is­ter Dr Kei­th Row­ley said the Gov­ern­ment’s pri­or­i­ty was to pre­serve as many jobs as pos­si­ble.

He said de­spite many chal­lenges the Gov­ern­ment did not fire a sin­gle pub­lic ser­vant dur­ing the height of the pan­dem­ic.

“Our fight was to be in a po­si­tion to pay them every month and I dare say thank God we have been able to do so. And we did that by ex­tract­ing more rev­enue from the source of our rev­enue. And we al­so said we won’t go to the IMF. If you qual­i­fy to bor­row they will lend you the mon­ey but they will lay down some terms and con­di­tions for that mon­ey. And the first term they will lay down for Trinidad and To­ba­go will be cut your pub­lic ser­vice” the Prime Min­is­ter said.

“So every pub­lic ser­vant who want to run up and down be­hind marchers and close down coun­try and shut down coun­try the biggest risk that you face is a sit­u­a­tion where the Gov­ern­ment can­not pay its bills and will have to go the lender as a last re­sort and they will say here’s $300 mil­lion but you have to cut the pub­lic ser­vice by 20 per cent 30 per cent 40 per cent.”

The Prime Min­is­ter said he un­der­stood the calls from pub­lic ser­vants for salary in­creas­es but added that any de­ci­sion tak­en by the Gov­ern­ment must be in the coun­try’s best in­ter­est.

The Gov­ern­ment is in salary ne­go­ti­a­tions with unions rep­re­sent­ing pub­lic sec­tor work­ers for the pe­ri­od 2014 to 2019.

The Gov­ern­ment has of­fered a four per cent in­crease.",,,,,,,,,,,,

It depends,"Most people believe turning off their air conditioners when they're not at home saves them money. Well researchers from the University of Colorado Boulder put that theory to the test.

The team of researchers used energy models that simulate heat transfer and AC system performance to tackle the question everyone wants the answer to: Does turning the air conditioning off when you’re not home actually save energy?

They found that it depends on the type of cooling system in your home the climate of the area in which you live and the type of construction of your home.

DON'T SWEAT THE SUMMER HEAT OR AC SERVICE BILLS. HERE'S THE DIY GUIDE TO GET YOUR UNIT READY

The researchers found that as your home heats up the process of heat transfer slows down. Eventually it reaches zero heat transfer at equilibrium when the temperature inside is the same as the temperature outside.

According to the study your AC cools less effectively in extreme heat so keeping it off during the hottest parts of the day can increase the overall efficiency of the system. These effects mean there’s not a single straightforward answer to whether you should blast the AC all day or wait until you get home from work.

Using energy modeling software created by the U.S. National Renewable Energy Laboratory for analyzing energy use in residential buildings the University of Colorado Boulder team looked at multiple test cases for energy use in a hypothetical 1200-square-foot home.

During their study the researchers considered three temperature strategy scenarios in two warm climates: Arizona and Georgia.

BROKEN AC? INDUSTRY EXPERTS SAY YOU COULD BE STUCK IN THE HEAT FOR A WHILE

One had the indoor temperature set to a constant 76 degrees Fahrenheit (24.4 degrees Celsius). A second let the temperature get to 89 degrees Fahrenheit (31.6 degrees Celsius) during an eight-hour workday – a ""setback."" The last used a temperature setback to 89 degrees Fahrenheit (31.6 degrees Celsius) for a shorter four-hour workday.

They looked at three different AC technologies: a single-stage central AC a central air source heat pump (ASHP) and mini - split heat pump units . Central AC units are typical of what most people use today.

They found that when the AC temporarily spikes to recover from the higher indoor temperatures the overall energy consumption in the setback cases is still less than when maintaining a constant temperature throughout the day.

The researchers stated that on an annual scale with a conventional central AC this could result in energy savings of up to 11%.

They also found that the central air source heat pump and mini-split heat pump were more efficient overall but yielded a lower savings from temperature setbacks.

An eight-hour setback on weekdays provided savings regardless of the system type while the benefits from a four-hour setback were less straightforward.",,,,,,,,,,,,

Security staff prompted attendees to exit which resulted in a mass exodus that left three with minor injuries.

According to a Facebook post from the Hamilton County Sheriff’s Office the disturbance was reported at 10:28 p.m. at the Ruoff Music Center in Noblesville in Section 5 of the lawn.

“Security staff responded quickly and all the subjects nearby began exiting the area on foot” the police statement continued. “The emergency action plan was initiated and followed and all gates including non-public exits were opened. Subsequently the venue patrons self-evacuated.”

Law enforcement then “deployed multiple quick response teams and swept the area” but no weapons were turned up in the search. The three individuals who reported minor injuries were transported to area hospitals.

According to the local paper there was chaos at the scene as concertgoers — many of them young people — fled in tears and a panic scaling fences and fearful about a potential shooting.

The Ruoff Music Center is an outdoor amphitheater owned and operated by Live Nation Entertainment and has a capacity of roughly 25000 people including lawn and ticketed seating. Khalifa was about 45 minutes into his show as part of the Vinyl Verse co-headlining tour with fellow rapper Logic and his set was the last of the night.

She played Hershey Park Stadium in Hershey on Sunday. Read more

Lady Gaga did not come on stage dipped in a vat of bubbling chocolate nor did she dress up as a candy bar.

That’s newsworthy because of the location of the only Pennsylvania stop on the pop superstar and high-fashion performance artist’s Chromatica Ball Tour. It played to a sold-out crowd of 30000 on Sunday just down the way from Chocolatetown Road at Hersheypark Stadium in Hershey. A Hershey Entertainment spokesperson said on Monday that it was the highest-grossing concert ever at the stadium breaking the Rolling Stones’ 2005 record.

Instead of a sweet ode de chocolat Gaga began the 2-hour 10-minute show which was divided into five sections broken up by video interludes that allowed time for transformative costume changes with a more bitter taste.

The lights dimmed on a deliriously excited crowd and a Bach fugue played. Gaga appeared atop what looked like a giant slab of concrete encased in a sarcophagus dress designed by Gareth Pugh and inspired by an outfit David Bowie wore on Saturday Night Live in 1979.

She was imprisoned — symbolically at odds with herself and the world — on a stage that was intentionally lit to look drab and gray except for flames shooting into the sky. As the evening’s musical and visual journey began the brutalist architectural design of the set Gaga has said intentionally means to force “a real savage and hard look at yourself and what you’ve been through.”

Of course it was also meant to be the first act of a celebration with the Mother Monster finally getting to lead her fans out of the pandemic darkness on a tour originally meant to happen in 2020 when her dance floor-directed Chromatica album was released.

But before we go on why was this Gaga spectacular happening in Hershey rather than the fourth-largest market in the country 100 miles to the southeast?

This is not a secondary market tour. Far from it: It’s included stops in London and Paris and is on its way to Tokyo and San Francisco. And while the crowd was plenty large in Hershey (with the traffic snarls to go with it) she’s playing bigger venues elsewhere such as MetLife Stadium in North Jersey where she drew 55000.

No official word was given as to why Philadelphia is omitted but the likely culprit is tour routing in a summer in which so many acts are making up for lost time.

To play a stadium in South Philly a stadium has to be available and the Phillies were at Citizens Bank Park on Sunday. (Next weekend they’re gone and the Red Hot Chili Peppers are there.) And what about the Linc? German metal band Rammstein are there Wednesday and their humongous fire-breathing stage takes four days to set up.

Back to the show: The songs for the Chromatica Ball’s over-the-top opening sequence — with a bleach blonde Gaga slowly being freed from her outfit with dancers gyrating around her — were early big hits from the late ‘00s: “Bad Romance” “Just Dance” and “Poker Face.”

The first conveyed what’s so powerful about Gaga’s pull which could be felt throughout the open-air horseshoe-shaped stadium. The space was filled up with a mostly female audience with significant queer representation and a wide age range dotted with fashion-forward Little Monsters in sequins heels and brightly hued hair.

Gaga is the pop diva who embraces the grotesque and strange who’s not afraid to makes herself ugly to embrace her deep dark impulses and invite everybody along for the ride imperfections and all.

She can clean up nicely and sing the Great American Songbook with Tony Bennett when she chooses to but this was not the evening for that. “I want your horror I want your disease” the singer born Stefani Joanne Angelina Germanotta sang. “I want your drama the touch of your hand I want your leather-studded kiss in the sand.”

At Hershey the inclusive conviviality was enhanced by a wholesome setting with popcorn and cotton candy vendors roaming the crowd.

Gaga’s leather-studded look appeared later in a biker-chic set piece that looked like an homage to “Justify My Love”-era Madonna whose impact Gaga doesn’t try to hide.

Other notable looks included an enormous poofy gold gown designed by her sister Natali Germanotta worn during Chromatica’s “Free Woman.” And my personal favorite was the Deadlotus Couture creation described as an “erotic beetle leotard” accessorized with a horned headpiece that made her look like a futuristic pop star species of African antelope.

Gaga wore that outfit for a piano interlude which included two songs from A Star Is Born the 2018 film with Bradley Cooper that made her a movie star. The interlude allowed her to show out her powerful voice without her more-than-capable funk-pop band playing behind her and also use “Always Remember Us This Way” to frame a summer night in Hershey as a beautiful moment in time.

Along with “Born This Way” which came a little earlier in the set the solo piano section gave Gaga the chance to get intimate with the crowd and putting forth a love-yourself message of self-actualization.

“I see a lot of people who know exactly who they are” she said. “And for those that don’t you’ll figure it out.” She said that when people ask her “why I love the LGBTQ+ community so much I say ‘I’ve always watched you lead the world with love.’”

Performing in the middle of a politically divided state Gaga largely played it down the middle. “One thing I appreciate about this state is you don’t always agree” she said. “And that’s OK. The world doesn’t (expletive) agree. But I know you all love people.”

Before “Angel Down” the soft-focus ballad that was the only song performed from her 2016 country-tinged album Joanne she addressed abortion rights in the wake of the U.S. Supreme Court overturning Roe v. Wade. “This is for everyone who has to worry about their body” she said. “I know you came to the concert to have fun. But some people will die during childbirth and some people will get raped and they can’t have those kids.”

The show was fast-paced satisfyingly punchy expertly staged and action packed but still lost momentum at times. Blame the schematic five-act structure. The video interludes that divided each section were never all that long but still allowed the energy to dissipate while everyone waited to see what Gaga would do — and look like — next.

(AP) — Rapper Wiz Khalifa cut short a concert in suburban Indianapolis as people began fleeing the outdoor venue leaving three with minor injuries following a disturbance police said.

People started exiting the Ruoff Music Center in Noblesville about 10:30 p.m. Friday after a reported disturbance on part of the amphitheater’s lawn with some of them shouting about a possible shooting The Indianapolis Star reported.

Police said in a news release early Saturday that no weapon was found following a sweep of the area at the venue about 20 miles (32 kilometers) north of Indianapolis.

The disturbance happened about 45 minutes into Wiz Khalifa’s show that was part of the Vinyl Verse co-headlining tour with fellow rapper Logic according to The Indianapolis Star. The music stopped and Wiz Khalifa and his band left the stage immediately.

Three people reported minor injuries and were taken to hospitals for treatment after concertgoers “self-evacuated” the amphitheater where all exits were opened in accordance with the venue’s emergency procedures police said.

In a parking lot outside some audience members were making cellphone calls as others wept and held each other the newspaper reported.

Live Nation the concert promotion company that owns and operates Ruoff released a statement Saturday thanking “staff and local authorities for acting quickly to support everyone in attendance.”

Police did not immediately reply to a message seeking details on the nature of the disturbance.

Until 2019 merchandise and albums were often only available through third party websites and official fan communities were hosted on Korean-language forums.

In the past three years a handful of platforms have bubbled up to deliver monetized exclusivity and the ability to message your favorite artist directly — for a price. Because even with K-pop artists' frequent updates to Instagram YouTube Twitter and Tiktok fans are still willing to pay for content from their idols. The best apps are now global one-stop shops for merchandise original video content fan-to-fan interaction and exclusive posts from the artists themselves.

The three main players are WeVerse Universe and Lysn which combined host the content of more than 100 acts across the industry. We broke down their main features pricing and pros and cons and how they compare to newer more niche apps like Phoning and Fab.





WeVerse is easy to use and offers much of its content for free. Credit: Mashable Composite; WeVerse

WeVerse

The basics: Weverse is a mobile app and website owned and operated by HYBE Entertainment the company behind BTS. It hosts exclusive free and paid content for 63 acts from HYBE (BTS TXT Seventeen) YG Entertainment (Blackpink IKON Treasure) small and independent labels (CL Sunmi Everglow Oneus) and a handful of non Korean acts (PrettyMuch Lil Huddy). As of March 2022  the app has more than 6.8 million monthly users. Given the backing and guidance of HYBE WeVerse stands to become the most robust fan community app on the market.

Features: Fans join a free community for their favorite artist where they can post comment on other fan posts and see WeVerse-exclusive photos videos and text updates from the artists themselves. A home feed combines posts from the artists you follow with suggested content from other artists to promote discovery while a notification tab lets you toggle between posts from one artist at a time. Official merchandise and fan memberships are available through the Weverse Shop and editorial content is sprinkled throughout the app via WeVerse Magazine. A live streaming feature has recently been added as a result of WeVerse's merger with live streaming platform VLive.

Pros: WeVerse is the most comprehensive and easy-to-use platform on this list encompassing merchandise original content and fan-to-fan and fan-artist interaction. And because WeVerse is a closed platform (versus say Twitter) HYBE artists especially seem to let loose a bit more showing off their personalities in posts comments and pics.

Cons: If you're a fan of a WeVerse artist you'll have to create an account and download the app at some point since much of their merchandise and content isn't available anywhere else. While there does seem to be some content curation in the home feed a lack of moderation of fan-made posts on the site has led to rampant racism and hateful language within certain fandoms. There is a fair amount of anonymity (and lack of accountability) given that users can choose a different display name in each community they belong to.

Pricing: Free to download paid content available for purchase.

Universe

Overview: WeVerse wields the significant corporate backing of HYBE while Universe leverages the resources of leading video game developer NCSoft. Universe made a big splash upon launch in January 2022 with lots of original content including a heavy investment in app-exclusive music videos and original series.

Features: Fans join communities for artists called ""planets"" for free. Artists can post text and videos in their planets but photos seem to be the main attraction on Universe. Like WeVerse Universe offers exclusive subscriptions and merchandise and hosts impressive highly produced original content. The app’s most unique element is its use of AI to read artist's posts in their voice. Fans can also pay to direct message artists who see the messages in what is essentially a large group chat and reply to the whole group but cannot reply to a fan directly.

Pros: It is really really cool to hear an artist express their thoughts in their own voice. Universe's original content is a huge draw in addition to Universe-exclusive artist posts.

Cons: Originally clunky and reliant on creepy AI-based features when it launched Universe has since scaled back to become much more streamlined. But it can still be confusing to use. The app is over-designed (for example why are communities called ""planets?"") and its currency system is so complicated that fans have created guide videos to help other fans understand it. If you're a fan of a Universe artist you'll have to create an account and download the app at some point since much of their content isn't available anywhere else.

Pricing: Free to download watch select content and see artist posts. Three kinds of currency exist within Universe: Klap (currency earned through completing tasks that can also be purchased) Love (purchased currency) and raffle tickets (also purchased). You can only pay for certain content with Love. Bundles of these currencies can be purchased on the app for anywhere from $.99 to $299.



On Bubble for JYP all content is locked behind a paywall. Credit: Mashable Composite; Dear U Co./ Bubble for JYP

Bubble

The basics: Bubble was created by SM Entertainment as a way for their artists to connect with fans. The Bubble app for SM groups is named Lysn and the company has also created an app just for JYP Entertainment artists called ""JYP Bubble."" Fans pay to gain access to an artist's bubble and view app-exclusive content from their favorite artist.

Features: Once you pay to subscribe to an artist you can view and download their photos videos and audio notes. You can also send messages to that artist but are limited to three at a time and a character count corresponding to how long you've been on the app: 30 characters for the first 49 days 50 characters after and so on. Like on Universe artists see these messages in what is essentially a large group chat and reply to the whole group but cannot reply to a fan directly. For fans the user interface looks like a personal chat between you and the artist. A live streaming feature was recently added to Bubble for JYP.

Pros: You're paying for content that won't be available anywhere else. Fans do share Bubble content to Twitter but is it both illegal and generally frowned upon by other fans.

Cons: Lysn does not produce original content facilitate fan-to-fan interaction or provide access to a store. You must pay to gain access to all artist content. As on Universe messaging with an artist is one-sided. So you may ask an artist what they had for lunch but when they write ""I had a salad earlier!"" you'll never be sure if they saw your question or are answering someone else's or just telling fans about their day. Even so some fans say they don't mind. Also the translation feature isn’t always entirely accurate which has led to some confusing albeit entertaining mishaps .

Pricing: Free to download but you'll need to buy one ($3.99) two ($6.99) or three ($9.99) tickets with each ticket granting you one month's access to a single artist's Bubble.





Phoning's Y2K-tastic home page offers free messages from New Jeans and other goodies like a virtual album decorating feature. Credit: Mashable Composite; WeVerse/ Phoning

Phoning

Overview: As part of the pre-album release roll out of HYBE's newest girl group NewJeans the company announced the group would have their own app instead of joining their label mates on WeVerse. Phoning's ‘90s-era Nokia-chic theme pairs with the look of the debut album and Gen Z's current obsession with Y2K nostalgia.

Features: The app mimics a phone and the members of NewJeans appear as ""friends"" in a contact list. Live streams appear as a ""call"" from a member which you can pick up to watch as they happen or tune in on-demand later via a call log. Members also send messages and photos to each other in a group chat for about 20 minutes every day. Fans watch the messages roll in but cannot participate or message the members directly (yet). The app also has a calendar of the group events a photo gallery a virtual try-on feature where you can dress avatars of the members in different outfits a virtual album-decorating feature and a handful of other fun freebies.

Pros: Phoning is adorable and its modern take on Y2K aesthetics feels like a fresh tangible extension of NewJeans’ music. Plus its features are free and so unique you won’t find them anywhere else.

Cons: Phoning is slow… like 1999 slow. Pages can take a while to load and the navigation isn’t always intuitive. There’s also no way to talk to other fans through the app. Notification settings can only be turned off and on and a lively 20-minute convo between the members results in hundreds of daily notifications. So you have to choose between no notifications from the app or dozens.

Pricing: Free to download and use.









You'll only be able to see the most basic info for your faves on Fab unless you want to buy a post for 10 points. Credit: Mashable Composite; NEOWIZ Lab

Fab

Overview: Fab launched in February 2022 with Loona as its inaugural artist. In March they added group NINE.i.

Features: Members of Loona are considered separate artists in the app and post separately. NINE.i post as a group. Loona members occasionally update their ""status"" which is free to view but all other posts are hidden behind a paywall.

Pros: You're paying for content that won't be available anywhere else. If you're an Orbit or NINE.i fan this is the app you need to be on.

Cons: If you're not a fan of Fab's two artists this is not the app for you. It's limited to paid artist posts only; there is no way to connect with other fans no original content and no store.

Pricing: Free to download but each post costs 10 points to view. You can purchase points (anywhere between 100 for $.99 and 2300 for $19.99) or earn single points by watching ads.

But for all its grace sophistication and dedicated design team there are undoubtedly public misconceptions surrounding the ship.

Why does it look so much like the Apollo Command Module? Why are we still flying capsule-shaped spacecraft fifty years after Apollo? How much better is Orion's computing power compared to what NASA was flying five decades ago? Well we found the right people to help us answer all these questions.Say hello to Jacquline Acuna Assembly Test Launch and Operations (ATLO) integration lead for Lockheed Martin's Orion Spacecraft and Gary Napier spokesperson for Lockheed Martin . In all the chaos and pandemonium of the few days before Artemis I launches this Monday Acuna and Napier sat down with autoevolution to answer some questions based on some of these curiosities. First and foremost why does Orion look so much like an Apollo Command Module? Especially after the last manned American spacecraft was a reusable space plane.""First of all the capsule is in fact the right shape. It's all about re-entering the atmosphere at a high velocity of over 25000 miles per hour"" explained Napier. ""The laws of physics never changed in the last 50 years. What's changed is the technological capability. The Apollo engineers got it right the first time so that's why the Orion looks the way it does. All the while It's about 30 percent larger in interior volume than during Apollo.""But this doesn't mean there's nothing in common between Orion and the Apollo Command Module. The two use heat shields made of a near identical compound known as AVCOAT a special epoxy novolac resin arranged in a honeycomb pattern that deflects as much ionizing frictional heat away from the spacecraft as possible. ""If it's material science meaning if it's worked at those high speeds before let's do it again. But we're doing it in a different way to make it much more efficient from a cost and a timing perspective"" Napier explained.Such a design language might seem strange if you've seen the now defunct Space Shuttle travel to places and do things on TV and in films it could never achieve in real life. But as Napier quickly points out it's important to remember that For all Mankind Deep Impact and Armageddon are all works of fiction. ""The Space Shuttle could not travel to the Moon period. It's just not reality. Sending capsules to the Moon and back is the right shape for an extremely high-speed re-entry like we're planning with Artemis.""It's easy to draw parallels between Orion and the Apollo Command Module. Still with these bits of information in mind it should be evident why comparing the two is ""Like comparing a Ford Model T to a Ferrari."" As Napier so eloquently puts it. Orion was a spacecraft designed not with pencils paper and slide rules but with AutoCAD technology microprocessors and an abundance of digital software that Apollo engineers only wished they had access to.""Orion is assembled with multiple 3D printed components that weren't possible to build even a short time ago that will be a vital component of reducing workloads and expediting the development process to help rockets launch into space faster"" said Acuna. So in a sense Orion is indeed using many of the same operating principles as Apollo but using technology that makes Apollo look primitive by comparison.""It's important to remember that Orion is a fully autonomous-capable spacecraft."" Explained Napier assuring that Lockheed-Martin's flagship spacecraft can handle itself just fine without help from mission control. ""If you tell it exactly what it needs to do it can execute those orders all the way to splashdown. Just like our planetary probes out at Mars Jupiter and what have you. You can't say the same about Apollo . Keep in mind Orion is capable of going to Mars.""Orion's 5x redundant flight computer system with four running in constant parallel is a major factor in why this is the case. All the better when you remember Apollo's guidance computer's power was measured in letters not bytes on account of being so puny. By Napier's own account Orion is 200000 times more powerful in its computing performance than Apollo. Not that this should shock you as your smartphone could give Apollo a thrashing.All in all Gary Napier and Jacquline Acuna explain wonderfully just how Orion is far more than Apollo on steroids. If all goes according to plans it'll be even better at its job than the spacecraft of five decades ago. After so much time without a moon program that's a welcome change if there ever was one. To some it's the realization of a lifelong dream that once seemed impossible. We can only say that with time pessimism can turn into optimism in the blink of an eye.In the end Jacquline ends the interview with a touching quote about how humbled she feels to work as a small cog in a vast machine that spans continents cultures and people from all walks of life. ""It makes me humble because so many people have donated so much time and effort on this rocket the crew module the whole program and it's so nice to be a part of something bigger.""Check back soon for more coverage live from the Kennedy Space Center for the launch of Artemis I right here on autoevolution.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMic2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmpvaW50LWZvcmNlcy5jb20vZGVmZW5jZS1lcXVpcG1lbnQtbmV3cy81NzA3MS1sb2NraGVlZC1tYXJ0aW4tYW5kLW5vcnRocm9wLWdydW1tYW4tc2lhdy1jb250cmFjdC1hd2FyZHPSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Lockheed Martin and Northrop Grumman SiAW Contract Awards,"Lockheed Martin and Northrop Grumman have each been awarded US Air Force SiAW (Stand-in Attack Weapon) Phase 1.2 contracts.

Nearly a decade ago the United States Navy embarked upon an ambitious project. To enhance the protection of naval warships from threats such as drones missiles and small attack boats -- and to simplify supply chains -- it would develop new laser weapons. More than just hi-tech hardware firing at light speed these laser cannons would run off power from a warship's engines needing no resupply of bullets and able to keep firing indefinitely so long as there was still gas in the tank.

In essence the Navy would develop a weapon with ""infinite ammo"" -- a very attractive proposition. But who will build it?

Military history

The Navy fielded its first demonstration weapon of the project in 2014 -- the unimaginatively named but cleverly acronymed Laser Weapon System or ""LaWS."" For just $0.59 per shot (plus $40 million for the raygun) LaWS could place 33 kilowatts of energy on a target -- not enough to ""kill"" a missile but enough to down a small unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) or set a small boat on fire. Over time the Navy planned to up the weapon's output to 60 kilowatts 100 kilowatts and eventually a full megawatt of power.

So how is that going?

Laser weapon progress report

Funny you should ask because just last month the U.S. Congressional Research Service (CRS) asked the same question and produced a report to answer it. According to this report Northrop Grumman (NOC 0.29%) appears to be farthest along in the development of solid state lasers (SSLs) for defense having built a 150 kilowatt Solid State Laser Technology Maturation (SSL-TM) device that successfully operated on the USS Portland (LPD 27) for more than a year before being scheduled for decommissioning next year.

A separate but related program dubbed ""Optical Dazzling Interdictor"" or ODIN is being run through the Naval Surface Warfare Center possibly with assistance from Lockheed Martin (LMT 0.10%) and is designed specifically to ""dazzle"" blind and disorient hostile unmanned aerial vehicles so that they lose the ability to navigate and crash into the sea.

A more lethal variant of ODIN the High Energy Laser with Integrated Optical dazzler and Surveillance -- HELIOS -- is definitely a Lockheed Martin project. Believed to be a 60 kW system it's twice as powerful as the first-draft LaWS and has the potential to fire at power levels as high as 150 kW.

Least developed but with perhaps the greatest potential is the Navy's High Energy Laser Counter-ASCM Program (HELCAP) program which is being designed specifically to take out incoming cruise missiles with a powerful ""300 kW+"" beam. Again the Naval Surface Warfare Center is taking the lead on developing this system with assistance from unnamed ""contractor engineers"".

In future years the Navy plans to use the research gathered from all the above systems and integrate them into a more powerful ""Surface Navy Laser Weapon System"" in two more stages with power levels that have not yet been confirmed.

The future for laser weapons -- and laser investors

That being said even roughly a decade into the effort to develop laser weapons for Navy warships it's still early innings in this project -- and it's anyone's guess which defense contractor(s) will come out on top and reap large-scale defense contracts from this program. In addition to the companies named above Kratos Defense & Security BAE Systems Boeing and Raytheon are all also on the hunt for a reliable effective laser weapon -- and all have won contracts at one time or another from the Navy or from the Army.

What is clear is that whoever ultimately ends up on top there's big money at stake for the companies that eventually will get to build military lasers for the Navy.

On the one hand CRS says that ""after procurement the costs for engagements by laser weapons are substantially lower than any comparable kinetic system with estimates ranging from"" $1.15 per shot for a 60 kW system to $9.20 per shot for a 480 kW laser. At the same time though ""the Navy estimates the [acquisition] cost of a 60 kW class laser ... will be approximately"" $100 million per unit -- about the same price as for a Lockheed Martin F-35 stealth fighter jet -- and more powerful 250 kW lasers might sell for as much as $200 million per unit.

For a defense contractor like Northrop or Lockheed it doesn't get much better than this: On the one hand they can promise the Navy cheap long-term operating costs and an improved supply chain while on the other hand they get to charge high sales costs up front. Whoever ends up winning the Navy's laser contract this is a battle worth winning.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmV1cmFzaWFudGltZXMuY29tL2RlZmVuc2VsZXNzLWFnYWluc3QtaHlwZXJzb25pYy1taXNzaWxlcy11cy1uYXZ5LXR1cm5zL9IBVGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmV1cmFzaWFudGltZXMuY29tL2RlZmVuc2VsZXNzLWFnYWluc3QtaHlwZXJzb25pYy1taXNzaWxlcy11cy1uYXZ5LXR1cm5zLw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Defenseless Against Hypersonic Missiles US Navy Turns To ‘Faster & Lethal’ DEWs To Battle China Russia – Top Admiral,"The US Navy is exploring the novel technology of Directed Energy Weapons (DEWs) against Chinese and Russian hypersonic weapons in the absence of a potent defense against these highly maneuverable missiles.

The top admiral of the US Navy Michael Gilday stated that directed energy systems are being developed as a potential countermeasure against hypersonic missiles calling the advancements made by Russia and China in hypersonic weapon technology “a significant concern.”

The development of devices that would use high-energy lasers or high-power microwaves to remove a threat is a major priority for the Navy according to Adm. Michael Gilday Chief of Naval Operations who is also the Chief of US Missile Defense Agency.

The statement comes a few days after the US Navy secured the delivery of a high-energy laser weapon called ‘HELIOS’ from defense giant Lockheed Martin. The acquisition made way for installation on warships marking a significant step forward beyond isolated testing and toward real combat.

It is widely known that hypersonic missiles are very difficult to intercept due to their incredible speed unpredictable trajectory and their ability to enter space and then re-enter the atmosphere using Hypersonic Glide Vehicle (HGV).

While the US is working towards layered anti-hypersonic missile defense it is still years away.

The US Navy currently uses the Aegis Ballistic Missile Defense System deployed on Arleigh Burke-class destroyers and Ticonderoga-class cruisers designed to intercept ballistic missiles in the post-boost phase and before re-entry. However it cannot intercept highly maneuverable Chinese and Russian hypersonic missiles.

While Russia fired a hypersonic cruise missile Kinzhal against Ukraine in March China conducted a historic hypersonic test last summer. “They’re a significant concern” Gilday said. “Russia and China are both developing those capabilities and will be fielding those capabilities shortly.”

To combat the threat posed by these hypersonic missiles in the backdrop of tensions with its adversaries the US has been exploring the possibility of using DEWs as a defense against these formidable and super-fast missiles.

The American Emphasis On DEWs

A possible method of thwarting hypersonic weapons is to deploy directed energy systems which employ lasers or microwave transmitters to damage a system or interfere with its electronics according to the US official.

In essence DEWs are weapons that destroy damage or incapacitate targets with highly focused energy including lasers microwaves or particle beams. They employ a beam of concentrated electromagnetic energy for their functioning.

They can be operated at high speeds to allow them to cause disruptive effects to facilities vehicles personnel and equipment in an efficient manner.

The fiscal 2022 National Defense Authorization Act that was passed in December 2021 granted the Missile Defense Agency the power to study and develop laser technologies for use in ballistic and hypersonic missile defense applications.

The Defense Department considers directed energy systems to be a technology area of utmost importance according to Heidi Shyu the Under Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering.

Earlier this year Shyu said that DEWs which use lasers or microwave emitters to destroy targets have finally reached the point of technological maturity where the military can field them.

In June 2022 the House Armed Service Committee panel asked the Department of Defense to submit a strategy for defeating hypersonic missile threats using asymmetric capabilities including directed energy and microwave systems among other things. Several US Defense contractors are already invested in developing DEWs.

Directed Energy Weapons Vs Hypersonic Missiles

The discourse about using DEWs to destroy hypersonic missiles has been around for a while. US Defense Contractor Northop Grumman stated that it was partnering with the US Department of Defense to explore high-wave microwave systems as a part of a layered approach to air defense.

At the time the defense contractor said “High-power microwaves have an important edge over hypersonic weapons – they’re much faster. While hypersonic weapons travel more than five times the speed of sound high-power microwaves travel at the speed of light – 300 million meters per second.”

According to Aerospace and Defense Analyst Girish Linganna “Directed energy systems use lasers or microwave emitters to eliminate a system or disrupt its electronics. They transmit a lethal force at the speed of light i.e. around 300000 kilometers per second.

Secondly the atmospheric drag and the constraining effects of gravity do not affect the beams of these weapons. Third these weapons are extremely precise. Fourth varying the intensity and type of energy delivered against targets can change the effects of DEWs.

We know that hypersonic missiles travel with a speed of Mach 5 i.e. 5 times the speed of sound. Any particle emitted by lasers or DEWs(Directed Energy Weapons) travels at the speed of light. So it is very highly possible that lasers can disable the onboard systems or outright destroy it.”

The US is in the process of developing anti-hypersonic defense systems many of which are in various phases of development. For instance the US Missile Defense Agency (MDA) is working on a Glide Phase Interceptor (GPI) to intercept the hypersonic missile and shoot it down in the middle of the flight’s most vulnerable phase.

Further the US Space Development Agency has announced two new contracts for a constellation of missile surveillance satellites. Chinese and Russian hypersonic missiles will be tracked and observed by these satellites. On July 18 L3Harris and Northrop Grumman received the contracts which have a combined value of $1.3 billion.

At the time the director of the Space Development Agency Derek Tournear had explained that there would be two layers – a Transport Layer and a Tracking Layer of satellites that send data to ground troops ready to kill the missile.

While Gilday did not give details about how the DEWs would hit the hypersonic missile the surveillance satellites would probably take on the task.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXWh0dHBzOi8vcmVkZmxhZy5vcmcuYXUvYXJ0aWNsZS9tZWxib3VybmUtdW5pdmVyc2l0eS1zdHVkZW50LXVuaW9uLXJlYWZmaXJtcy1zdXBwb3J0LXBhbGVzdGluZdIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Melbourne University student union reaffirms support for Palestine,"The University of Melbourne Student Union council for the second time voted in favour of the Boycott Divestment and Sanctions campaign against Israel and in solidarity with Palestine on 15 August.

The motion which was passed 16 votes to three was moved by Palestinian international student and activist Dana A and recognised that “the growth of the Israeli economy and land is built on the exploitation and colonisation of Palestinians” and called for the university to “divest from corporations complicit in and profit from the Israeli apartheid and that operate on illegally occupied Palestinian land”.

This follows a months-long battle between Zionists and Palestine solidarity activists over a previous pro-Palestine motion passed in April. That motion provoked a significant backlash from Zionists on campus as well as from the University administration and the Murdoch press. Threats from a Liberal Party-aligned student to launch a class action against the union resulted in the council rescinding the motion in June.

The union then hired a consultancy firm to survey the student body on the question of Palestine. A large majority—73 of 124 surveyed—believed the union should adopt a motion endorsing the Boycott Divestment and Sanctions campaign against Israel. This was an important factor in strengthening the council’s resolve.

The successful vote also followed the Israeli Apartheid Week event on campus organised by Students for Palestine. The central demand of the week was for the University of Melbourne to sever its ties with Israel. The University shrouds itself in progressive gloss—from the huge WOMENJIKA sign at one entrance to the campus (Womenjika is the Woi-wurrung word for welcome) to the array of pride and trans flags scattered throughout campus. But despite this anti-colonial posturing and pink-washing the University proudly supports Israel.

The University works hand in glove with Lockheed Martin the world’s largest weapons manufacturer and a major collaborator with Israel. According to a Lockheed Martin information webpage the value of “collaboration between Lockheed Martin and Israeli industries [from 2004 to today] is expected to exceed $4 billion”. The University of Melbourne opened up a research and development centre for Lockheed Martin in 2016 which is used to advance research in military technology and channel students into the military sector. In partnership with Lockheed Martin Melbourne University is funding the creation of drones and missiles that will be used to attack Gaza and the West Bank.

Another partnership the University maintains is with the Hebrew University of Jerusalem which offers programmes to train up future Israeli Defence Force soldiers the same people who go on to terrorise brutalise and kill Palestinians. In 2014 the Hebrew University publicly declared its support for Israel’s war on Gaza and called for donations to bolster the war effort. More than 2000 Palestinians were murdered during this eight-week onslaught. The Hebrew University administration called the cops on Palestinian students as they protested the war.

Israeli Apartheid Week activities on campus demonstrate that there is support for the Palestinian struggle and that people will not easily be intimidated by legal threats from Liberal students. Around 65 students and staff attended a speak-out in solidarity with the people of Gaza where Victorian Socialists candidate for Northern Metro Jerome Small spoke about Israel’s recent attack on the Gaza Strip. The attack killed more than 47 Palestinians among them 16 children and 360 people were injured. Just prior to launching the attack Israel ramped up its long-standing blockade of Gaza cutting off access to fuel and electricity and bringing an already strained hospital system to the brink of collapse.

Other activities included a forum on “Why you should oppose Israeli Apartheid” and an artwork on the university’s South Lawn that encouraged students to write solidarity messages on Palestinian flags.

The union’s official endorsement of the Boycott Divestment and Sanctions campaign means there is an opening for students and staff to further demonstrate their solidarity with Palestinians. Given there have been threats of further legal action continuing to unapologetically stand with the oppressed against Israel will be important."

A former Arizona police officer who shot dead a wheelchair-bound man suspected of stealing a toolbox from Walmart last year has been indicted on manslaughter charges.

Ryan Remington 32 who was fired by Tuscon Police last year was charged Wednesday by a grand jury of 'recklessly' causing the death Richard Lee Richards 61 after bodycam video caught the cop of firing nine rounds into the back and side of the suspect who was accused of stealing a toolbox from Walmart on November 30 2021.

Richards allegedly flashed a knife at a store employee when asked for a receipt for the product.

'Here's your receipt' Richard reportedly told the clerk showing the weapon.

Video shows Richards motoring across the parking lot from the Walmart in his wheelchair to a nearby Lowe's where two officers confront him briefly ordering him to stop.

'He's got a knife in his other hand' someone can be heard on the bodycam video as Richards wheels up to the entrance of the big box store.

Seconds later Remington can be seen unloading his weapon on the accused shoplifter.

He was shot outside of a Lowe's after crossing the shared parking lot with Walmart. He slumped out of his chair where an unidentified male officer handcuffed Richards while Remington and another officer Stephanie Taylor grabbed medical supplies

Rick Resch a lawyer for Richards family said that they were relieved that the officer will finally stand trial.

'It has been a long and difficult past nine months for Mr. Richards's family but they are relieved that former Officer Ryan Remington has been indicted and will face the prospect of justice for the shooting and killing of Mr. Richards' Resch said in a statement.

In Arizona manslaughter a class two felony that carries a minimum seven years in prison is defined as 'recklessly causing the death of another person.'

Remington did not testify before the grand jury to present any self-defense arguments.

'Manslaughter doesn't even fit' Remington's lawyer Mike Storie told KVOA. 'I don't want to get into legal arguments but it's a legal fiction. So I'll be very interested to read the grand jury transcript and find out what went on in that room when I was not present.'

Storie has said in the past that his client 'had no non-lethal options.'

'He did have a taser but in his mind he couldn't use it because he didn't feel he had the proper spread to deploy it with the wheelchair between him and Richards' the lawyer said.

Tucson Mayor Regina Romero lauded the charges against the former cop.

'Now that the Grand Jury has issued an indictment and Ryan Remington will face criminal charges it is a matter for the courts to adjudicate' she tweeted.

After an internal investigation following the shooting Remington a four-year veteran of the department was canned by then-police Chief Chris Magnus.

The chief said he was 'deeply disturbed and troubled' by the ex-cop's response.

'His use of deadly force in this incident is a clear violation of department policy and directly contradicts multiple aspects of our use of force and training' Magnus said.

Remington was working 'security detail' at the retail story in Midvale Park Shopping Center shortly after Thanksgiving 2021 when Richards was confronted by a Walmart employee who suspected the disabled man of shoplifting.

Richards has been confined to a wheelchair since getting hip surgery while in prison. His sister Victoria Richards told KGUN. She said that her brother had been had battled drug addiction and been in prison most of his life.

He volunteered to help fight forest fires while serving a sentence and fell off a cliff hitting his head.

'He came out with severe brain damage. He came to live with me and I taught him how to drive how to count money. Everything came back pretty quickly but it was like having a child again' she told the TV news channel last year.

She and her brother had an argument and she dropped him off at a Salvation Army center a couple of years before the shooting.

Around 9:30 p.m. a Walmart employee confronted him about the toolbox and asked him to show proof of purchase.

That's when he pulled a knife and refused to return the item according to the store employee.

Remington caught up with Richards in the parking lot and asked him to turn over the knife which he refused

Video footage taken at the time show store security following Richards across the parking lot attempting to recover the merchandise.

'If you want me to put down the knife you're going to have to shoot me' Richards reportedly told the Walmart worker.

Tucson Police were called and Officer Stephanie Taylor Remington and another unidentified male officer responded.

The former officer can be heard saying 'Do not go into the store sir.'

Taylor can also be heard yelling: 'Stop now. You need to stop.'

At that moment Remington's bodycam footage shows him pulling out his gun and begin firing his service weapon from behind until Richards slumps over and fall out of his wheelchair.

Taylor can be heard saying she's going to get something while another male officer who was not identified by the TPD begins to handcuff Richards.

Lowe's security footage shows the three officers attending to Richards' wounds but he was shortly declared dead at the scene.

After his indictment Remington has been ordered to be photographed and handcuffed at the Pima County Superior Court. He will be arraigned on the manslaughter charges on August 31.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMigQFodHRwczovL3d3dy5jaHJvbmxpbmUuY29tL3N0b3JpZXMvZWFzdGVybi13YXNoaW5ndG9uLW1hbi1hY2N1c2VkLW9mLWtpbGxpbmctaGlzLW1vdGhlci1mbGVkLWhvc3BpdGFsLTUtaG91cnMtYmVmb3JlLWF0dGFjaywyOTg5MTfSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Eastern Washington Man Accused of Killing His Mother Fled Hospital 5 Hours Before Attack | The Daily Chronicle,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: 403 for url: https://www.chronline.com/stories/eastern-washington-man-accused-of-killing-his-mother-fled-hospital-5-hours-before-attack,298917 on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMigQFodHRwczovL3d3dy5jaHJvbmxpbmUuY29tL3N0b3JpZXMvZWFzdGVybi13YXNoaW5ndG9uLW1hbi1hY2N1c2VkLW9mLWtpbGxpbmctaGlzLW1vdGhlci1mbGVkLWhvc3BpdGFsLTUtaG91cnMtYmVmb3JlLWF0dGFjaywyOTg5MTfSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXGh0dHBzOi8veW91cnN0b3J5LmNvbS9oZXJzdG9yeS8yMDIyLzA4LzEwMC1lbWVyZ2luZy13b21lbi1sZWFkZXJzLXNoeW1hbGEtc291bmRhcmkta3VwcGFzYW150gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,[100 Emerging Women Leaders] Lowe's Company's Shymala Soundari Kuppasamy's journey,"For Shymala Soundari Kuppasamy leading Lowe’s Companies in the US as its Senior Director of Ecommerce Technology Product Management is nothing short of a dream come true.





The recipient of the 2021 Women in Business Achievement Award by the Charlotte Business Journal and the Stevi Award for women in business—often been dubbed the Oscars for business. However Shyamala’s road to success has been one full of blood sweat and tears.





Born in a small village in Tamil Nadu Shyamala was the first in her family to graduate from school.

“It was a big deal to even send me to school. I don’t know how my parents believed in something different; they wanted equal education and push for both my brother and me. While several of my relatives and friends kept advising them against it I went to a school” says Shyamala in a conversation with HerStory.

Though Shyamala’s school had a thatched roof there was no ceiling to her aspirations.





“I simply fell in love with mathematics and sciences. I kept doing well in school; I also participated in several science fairs and competitions. I wanted to delve deeper and get into engineering and so I worked hard to get into an engineering college. When I looked at my class 10th scorecard I realised I was not just the class topper but the district topper” says Shyamala.





Working hard on her engineering entrance Shyamala went on to study at the College of Engineering Guindy on a full-merit scholarship. “I was the first girl to go to an engineering college and even then many relatives wondered why I needed to travel to Chennai and not study in the district nearby” she explains.

She nevertheless went to study at the College of Engineering at Guindy. It was then that Shyamala realised that the world was different than what she had experienced. “I wouldn’t call it a culture shock but it was a different and completely new experience for me. I met people from different parts of the country. I was exposed to different ideas and thought processes and that helped me open up my horizons” Shyamala adds.

She got to understand and learn about newer ideas. In college Shyamala was also introduced to the world of startups and businesses. It was during this time that she met Byju Raveendran the Co-founder and CEO ﻿BYJU'S﻿.





“Education and edtech have always been strong models for me. I began working at BYJU’S and started building the early product” says Shyamala. After some time she wanted to grow further and decided to take an executive education at Harvard Business School and began her career with Macy’s in San Francisco.





It was then that Shyamala found her niche in retail tech. However despite her credentials she still had to deal with biases.





“On many occasions I was the only woman in the room. It’s sad that the situation hasn’t improved much. We women often find ourselves being silent listeners. Over the years I realised that I am in the room for a reason; I need to bring my perspective to the table. Women need to understand that irrespective of whether they are the only woman present or not they are there in the room for a reason and they need to raise their hands and voice their opinions” adds Shyamala.





Explaining further she says





“As for biases I feel women need to call them out as and when they observe them. We need to address them so that people can acknowledge their existence. I am a migrant woman of colour and now a working mom returning to work. So the biases that people have are varied. Once the security person at my office stopped me at the entry point and said 'Only full-time employees are allowed inside.’ I was shocked! How did he assume that I am not working full-time? So I had to explain that many women look like me and are working full time in that office.”





She asks all women leaders to dream big and have the grit to pursue that.





“Also create your own path for success that is authentic to you. When I was 16 I had a prenotion of what success is or what should be done to be successful. But everyone experiences life in their unique ways. We need to own our unique experiences have our authentic stories and define success on our own terms” says Shyamala.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNiYy5jYS9uZXdzL2NhbmFkYS9ub3ZhLXNjb3RpYS9pY2UtY3JlYW0tYWNhZGlhLXJlc2VhcmNoLTEuNjU2MzEzNNIBIGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNiYy5jYS9hbXAvMS42NTYzMTM0?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Long-term care residents get protein-infused ice cream thanks to Acadia research,"Residents at a long-term care facility in Middleton N.S. who have trouble eating have a new menu item to ensure they get their essential nutrients — protein-enhanced thickened ice cream.

According to an Acadia University study more than half of people living in long-term care facilities suffer from dysphagia — difficulty swallowing usually caused by other health complications or aging.

The condition can cause nutritional deficiencies.

People with dysphagia often have specific diet plans involving pureed foods that allow them to swallow safely but many don't like the appearance of the food. Regular ice cream isn't permitted because it isn't thick enough and could pose a choking risk.

Judy Lowe a dietitian at Heart of the Valley Long Term Care Centre in Middleton said it's gratifying to provide a safe form of ice cream to residents who haven't had it in years.

""They're excited to eat the ice cream"" Lowe said. ""You can tell when someone is getting something they like to eat and the fact that they didn't leave any ice cream in the bowl spoke volumes to us.""

What is protein-enhanced thickened ice cream?

Lowe worked with researchers at Acadia University to create the ice cream.

They melted commercial vanilla ice cream and added whey protein and a thickening agent to ensure it was safe for long-term care residents to swallow. After putting the ingredients through a food processor they refroze the liquid to turn it into ice cream.

Lowe said the product is affordable and effective.

""Whey protein is the cheapest and most acceptable form of protein"" Lowe said. ""The ice cream increased protein content in their diets increased fluid in their diets and wound prevention and maintained skin integrity.""

Taylor McDowell worked on the study as part of the research component of her program at Acadia. She emphasized the importance of using adequate thickening agents to ensure safe consumption.

She based her research on meeting an international standard for texture and thickness. They used a modified corn-starch to attain the thickness that is ""the most appropriate for ice cream"" McDowell said.

What does it taste like?

Before introducing the ice cream at Heart of the Valley researchers at Acadia conducted a study. None of the 56 participants noticed a taste change between the thickened ice cream and protein-enhanced product.

Matthew McSweeney a dietetics professor at Acadia said the acceptability of the protein-enhanced ice cream is exciting.

""The study showed that we could add the protein and not change any of the sensory properties of the ice cream"" McSweeney said. ""That's exactly what Judy and Taylor were hoping for.""

Heart of The Valley is the only long-term care facility using the ice cream but the Acadia trio hopes others will be encouraged.

Share Tweet Share Whatsapp Email

Scoring goals is far and away the most entertaining and loveable aspect of the beautiful game. Watching supporters leap around in boisterous chaos while the ground of the stadium rumbles beneath their feet is a truly glorious sight to behold.

However while scoring goals is the aim of football keeping them out of the other end is the most important element of a successful side. At the risk of sounding blunt and condescendingly obvious if a team don’t concede goals they cannot lose.

The prime example of this in the 2022/23 campaign has been Preston North End. Perhaps surprisingly Ryan Lowe’s side have the best defensive record in England’s top four divisions this season so far and have yet to concede a single goal in their five league matches.

In fact goalkeeper Freddie Woodman just became the first ever goalkeeper for the historic club to keep five consecutive clean sheets in the league. Bear in mind that the Lilywhites were founded 142 years ago which makes this all the more impressive.

Furthermore Preston have perhaps worryingly bagged just one goal over these five games and while it was a ridiculously eye-watering strike without their perfect clean sheet record Lowe’s men could have found themselves down near the foot of the table.

This tactical analysis piece will be a scout report of Preston’s defensive tactics. It will be an analysis looking at why the Championship side are conceding so few goals in the league and how this intertwines with the lack of goalscoring too.

Preferred formation

During his time with Plymouth Argyle Lowe was a massive advocate for variations of a back three interchanging between a 3-4-1-2 a 3-5-2 and even a 3-4-2-1. This suited the players available to him as the Pilgrims rose up the table and performed admirably.

While at Home Park Preston were being managed by Frankie McAvoy who was with the club from March 2021 to December of the same year. The Scot was dismissed midway through the 2021/22 campaign due to excessively poor results and Lowe was placed in charge.

Throughout the campaign under both McAvoy and Lowe Preston primarily set up in the 3-4-1-2 although the Lilywhites were no stranger to its close cousins the 3-5-2 and 3-4-3. Nevertheless there was still some use for more conventional back four shapes.

Now with Lowe into his first full season in charge of the club the manager has not skewed from his love of back three systems. The only time a four-man defence has been seen at Deepdale it has been from the opposition.

This campaign the 3-4-2-1 has been the go-to for the manager. Used by Chelsea and Tottenham Hotspur in the Premier League it provides a wonderful balance to the side in the attacking and defensive phases.

Overall the 3-4-2-1 including the wider 3-4-3 has been deployed by Lowe in 43 percent of the team’s games in all competitions. The 3-5-2 is in second followed by the 3-4-1-2.

Of course out of possession this structure reverts into either a 5-2-3 or a 5-4-1 depending on how low down the pitch the defensive block is situated.

Regardless simply setting your team up in a certain formation will not prevent goals from going into the net. Let’s take a look at the exact reasons why Preston have been so astute and efficient in the defensive phases this season.

Pressing to dictate the opposition’s play

In football some teams press high up the pitch into the opponent’s defensive third in order to aggressively regain possession. Sides like Liverpool and Bayern Munich are perfect examples of this. From there these teams can cause a turnover in possession in the final third and transition rapidly to create a chance in a wonderful position.

However this is not the only form of defending in a high block. Often teams prefer to set themselves up in a certain structure but their objective when pressing is to force the opposition into a certain area of the pitch. Preston fall under this category.

When pressing high in Lowe’s 3-4-2-1 the players particularly the front three are instructed to block off access to the opposition’s single or double-pivot while angling their pressure to force the ball carrier to move the ball out wide.

This type of high-block defending requires a lot of coordination and practice on the training ground and by the looks of it Lowe has drilled his stars immensely in this phase. The players must know when to get tighter to an opponent when to hold their position when to apply a cover shadow while pressing and finally when to actually close down.

The image above is a superb representation of Preston’s high block principles working wonders. Center-forward Troy Parrott is applying pressure to Watford’s central defender angling his run to block off the passing lanes behind him.

Meanwhile right-winger Alan Browne and Preston’s nearest central midfielder are man-marking the Hornets’ double-pivot again cutting off these options.

Finally left-winger Daniel Johnson has held his position in the middle. If he goes too early a passing lane will open up through the middle. Johnson waits and waits and as soon as the pass is played he steps out to close down Watford’s right centre-back angling his pressure to prevent him from coming back inside.

In Preston’s 3-4-2-1 the front three are deployed as the first line of pressure when pushing high up the pitch. They remain narrow together cutting off access to the opponent’s deepest midfielders.

Nevertheless there are times during a game where this first defensive line is broken with a split pass and so there must be a backup plan. In these scenarios the nearest midfielder for Preston quickly steps up and aggressively closes down the ball receiver.

While Preston may not press too high in the final third overall their pressing statistics all over the pitch are impressive. The Lilywhites are boasting a lowly Passes allowed Per Defensive Action of 8.34 which is the fourth-lowest in the division.

Moreover Lowe’s side are really aggressive in their challenges. The best metric to measure this is through challenge intensity which looks at how many defensive actions are made by a team per minute of opposition possession. Preston hold the joint-fourth highest in the Championship with 7.

England’s second division is such a tactically diverse league and so Preston also need to be able to defend long balls when opponents opt to pump it long from the build-up phase rather than try to play through the press.

Challenging in the air is an area where Preston excel. One of the reasons for this is because their centre-backs are very dominant.

As shown from the previous image when the ball is kicked directly to the opposition’s strikers one of the central defenders steps out to contest the aerial ball while the remaining four defenders drop off and close together to set themselves in case the ball is flicked on to a runner in behind.

This was touched on in an analysis on the Total Football Analysis website last week when we looked at why Bolton Wanderers have significantly improved under Ian Evatt. Again the centre-back steps out to challenge while the other four defenders drop off and compact.

Preston have competed in 51.43 aerial duels per game this season in all competitions on average winning 53.3 percent. Against them their opponents have won just 38.3 percent on average proving how truly dominant Lowe’s side are during these situations.

Deeper defending

As with all great defensive sides Preston are extremely difficult to crack open when the players have consolidated into a compact shape further down the pitch in the mid-to-low block phase.

Like their principles when pressing high the Lilywhites’ tactics don’t change too much but the side are far more aggressive lower down the field as they look to regain possession.

When the opponent has possession of the ball in the central corridors the first line of pressure once again stay close to one another. The objective as ever is to prevent the centre-backs from being able to reach the pivot players.

This causes one of two things to occur. The defenders will look to play long directly to the centre-forwards in order to progress play or they will go wide and attempt to attack down the flanks.

This plays into Preston’s hands because as covered in the previous section Lowe’s centre-backs are really efficient in winning their aerial duels and because the mid-table Championship outfit want to entice the opposition to play down the sides as they can aggressively close down the ball.

When the ball is in the central areas Preston’s structure remains as a 5-2-3 but once the play is moved to the wide areas the wingers push wider and drop off forming a 5-4-1 shape.

The 5-4-1 is the perfect formation to defend the wide spaces of the pitch. The nearest winger midfielder wide centre-back and wingback can all move closer together and close inside passing lanes.

From there Preston use the touchline as an extra man limiting the directions that the ball carrier has to play in.

This can be seen from the above example. The left-winger is quickly tracking back as Luton Town have progressed the ball down the flanks into the final third. The nearest player in the double-pivot has shuttled across while the left centre-back and left wingback are also stepping over creating a defensive overload.

Furthermore another wonderful benefit of such a wide defensive formation for Preston is that the players can cover most of the width of the pitch including the back-post which can normally be exploited by crosses or switches of play when a side shifts their defensive block across to one side.

In these defensive overloads out on the wings Preston’s objective is to aggressively close down and win back the ball with numerical superiority. This was evident from the team’s defensive duels map against Luton in the side’s only victory of the league campaign thus far:

Of their 88 defensive duels Preston won 64.77 percent. 74 percent were in the wide areas including the halfspaces while 53 percent occurred in the defensive third of the pitch.

Lowe’s defensive tactics have worked wonders so far as opponents have found it incredibly difficult to break down the Lilywhites especially when sitting in a deeper defensive block.

Sustainability and its impediment on Preston’s attacking

Unfortunately while Preston’s defensive displays have been admirable the data points towards this being unsustainable. Having not conceded a single goal this season in the league the team’s xG against stands at 6.23 which is the ninth-highest in the division.

Furthermore Preston are conceding an xG of 0.118 per shot on average the eighth-highest in the Championship. The biggest issue for Lowe right now is that his side have scored just once. Although it was a truly glorious strike from Brad Potts against Luton should Preston begin conceding goals the team could be in for a slippery slide down the table.

However are Lowe’s defensive tactics hindering the team’s ability to create chances? Simply put not really but there have been certain issues evident particularly when Preston are defending in a low block for large parts of the game.

The biggest issue with low block defending for such lengthy periods of time is that rest defence structures have become so commonplace and secure in the modern game. Once teams finally win the ball lower down the pitch most opponents will quickly counterpress them which makes it highly difficult to play out of the pressure.

Furthermore as Preston win the ball back a lot on the flanks this means that it’s even tougher to break through the opposition’s pressure as there is little space to manoeuvre given the players are so close to the sideline.

As portrayed in the previous image Preston regain possession in a low block state but Luton’s aggressive counterpress forces their counterattack to break down almost instantly.

The Lilywhites are averaging 1.57 counterattacks per game in this campaign in all competitions but just 27.4 percent end in a shot on goal. Moreover not a single counterattacking goal has been scored thus far.

Conclusion

Preston’s defensive tactics aren’t the primary cause of their lack of goalscoring just a symptom of it. While the counterattacks aren’t really working the lack of quality and end product in the final third are the main reasons why the goals have dried up.

Preston’s wonderful defensive record is the only reason why Lowe’s side are not way down near the end of the table.

Something has to give. The goals need to start coming as the wall will begin to let water through eventually which could cause a devastating flood for the Deepdale club.

Now a year later some are still using the same bags — but not all.

It’s surprising how attached you can get to a bag — especially the bag that you use to carry your laptop your sweater your lunch your notebook your exercise shoes your kids’ diapers or any of the other stuff you need. Whether you’re heading to the office visiting a friend hanging in a coffee shop going on a hike or just sitting outdoors to read or work having a bag that can accommodate everything on your “gotta have this” list can help you avoid a lot of aggravation.

So here’s this year’s staff picks — some old some new. Most of the staff wrote about their backpacks but toward the end we’ve added a few different types of bags as well.

I got a large Timbuk2 messenger bag in 2015 — just in time to haul it around a CES show floor — after wearing out a few smaller options from fancier brands. (According to one company’s associate in hitherto-undiscovered ways; I am very hard on my accessories.) It’s comfortable low-profile fairly affordable and has a big main compartment with as many little sub-pockets as I could ever want. The only downsides are a) I feel sort of basic when a co-worker shows off some gorgeous Peak Design product and b) I like it so much that I feel like I must have struck an unwitting faustian bargain with a trickster god. Unfortunately it looks like Timbuk2 doesn’t offer the customization options I got anymore so maybe the catch is that I can never buy another one that feels just right. — Adi Robertson senior reporter

The Tom Binh Synapse 25 is quite expensive for a backpack (though I assume some of that cost comes from the fact that it’s made in Seattle) but I knew that it had been a good buy when I was stuck out in the rain with it all night and it kept my stuff dry. That same week I had to jump on a plane and go across the country for a week and I was able to fit all my clothes and electronics into it and use it as a single carry-on.

Since then I’ve taken it on dozens of trips and have subjected it to muddy outdoor worksites for hours on end. It’s held up to everything remarkably well and has been one of the most well-built and thoughtfully designed bags I’ve had the pleasure of using. The main compartment perfectly fits a laptop and a few packing cubes and the water bottle pocket is right in the center of the bag keeping it from weighing too heavily on one shoulder. The zippers feel great and I absolutely love the orange color I got it in as well as how tough the material feels. Overall it feels like it strikes the perfect balance: it’s tough (and light) enough for prolonged outdoor use while still being classy enough to tote your laptop and lunch to the office. — Mitchell Clark news writer

I see I’m not the only person with a Timbuk2 bag so I’ll just join the chorus to recommend my personal bag the Custom Prospect Laptop backpack. It has a good-sized laptop flap (Timbuk2 advertises a 15-inch screen fit and it’s always held my MacBook Airs comfortably) a spacious interior and a handy flap up top that lets you add a little extra space to the interior of the bag. I’ve had mine for nearly seven years even using it for my weekly grocery store runs and it’s held up like a champ throughout. Plus with this bag you can personalize it with your favorite colors or reflective material. —Jay Peters news writer

A couple of years ago I picked up the Black Diamond Creek Transit 32 for what once was my daily commute downtown. While I wish it looked a bit more professional at times — most Black Diamond equipment is built for the climbing crag not the cubicle — I’ve always appreciated it for its relative simplicity and the sheer amount of gear it can carry. The 32-liter pack takes a cue from the company’s ultra-durable haul bags and as such it’s made with a waterproof shell and ballistic nylon that can take a bit of a beating (I’ve tested this). It also features a cushioned 15-inch laptop compartment on the rear a zippered top lid and separate bottom compartment where I can stash my gym clothes running attire and — yes — a decrepit pair of climbing shoes for those times when I decide to take it bouldering outside the city limits. — Brandon Widder senior editor commerce

After months of searching and fretting over the width of straps ease of entry and general bulk of profile I finally picked up the Mission Workshop’s The Monty Advanced (now called The Monty: AP) messenger bag in brown canvas. The strap on it is big and padded enough that it won’t dig in if I’m carrying a couple of laptops a bunch of camera gear and the general odds and ends I cram in a bag and the quick release makes it easy for me to adjust the bag so it fits closer to the body on longer walks. It’s also totally waterproof a thing I accidentally tested on day two when I was caught in a deluge. But if there is a spill the lining is easy to clean — it has handled chicken curry and rum punch with more aplomb than my stomach lining. I love that it can switch between being a flap-style bag or a roll top depending on how much stuff I’ve tried to pack in. But its style definitely skews rugged.

When I need a little more professional bag I use a the Telfar Medium Tan Shopping Bag which a friend sold me on by saying it could hold a 15-inch laptop charger wallet and two bottles of wine. She was correct. — Alex Cranz managing editor

“Laptop bag” to me is any bag that fits a laptop but also gets jam-packed with too much camera equipment. The slightly unwieldy but lovely Peak Design Everyday Backpack 30L has been my main work bag for well over two years (I have the first-gen version) and it has traveled with me all over the country and beyond while holding up to abuse and looking clean in its charcoal colorway. I have at times packed it with multiple full-size camera bodies lenses and accessories along with either a 16-inch MacBook Pro (which is easily swallowed up in its laptop pocket) or a 13-inch MacBook Air that takes a cave-diving excursion into its inner depths. The structuring of this bag and the way gear is meant to slot into its three shelves and pocket walls with side-access may not be for everyone but if you want to carry a lot of camera and tech-adjacent gear it offers lots of versatility. Do yourself a favor and try to make the smaller 20L version work for your needs so when you inevitably overpack it you can save your back more than I do with the 30L. — Antonio G.

I found the Mystery Ranch Urban Assault 18 at a warehouse sale and it has since become my go-to for every occasion. It is not geared toward tech but has two laptop sleeves and three mesh pockets that fit my dongles books laptop small tripod camera and personal items with room to spare. It also makes heavy loads easy to carry for long periods with super comfortable shoulder straps and a chest strap. The best part about it though is the way it zippers down the middle. This has been great for taking out single items even if they are packed at the bottom. I thought I would never quit my Chrome backpacks but the Mystery Ranch is lighter more comfortable for long trips and the vertical zipper is now a must-have for me. — Becca Farsace senior producer

It’s okay to like a backpack with lots of pockets (and from looking at the rest of this article many of my colleagues do). Sleeves for laptops side pockets for pens mesh lining for sunglasses. Whatever. And reader I was once one of those people. But after using the Errant backpack for a little over a year I came to the conclusion that sometimes it’s possible to overthink things. I mean sure the Errant was great when I was commuting every day with exactly the same combination of laptop notebook and other work accessories. But the second I needed to carry around something else — like groceries — I found the sheer amount of extra pockets just ate away at valuable bag space.

So instead for the past two years I’ve been using the simplest backpack I could find. It has one big compartment that holds everything from my laptop to a sweater or a grocery shopping trip with one small compartment for pens and chargers. I don’t have to think about which compartment to put everything in and I don’t have to spend any time organizing anything because everything inevitably becomes a mess the second I zip the bag up. But you know what? I haven’t spent any time thinking about backpacks since buying this thing two and a half years ago. And that’s exactly the way I like it. — Jon Porter reporter

Years ago while wandering through the gift shop in a museum I was struck by a large shoulder bag made from a lovely tapestry-like material. It had a zipper running down the length of its main strap so that if you unzipped it one strap became two and the bag could be worn like a backpack. I spent a long time trying to convince myself I didn’t really need it until eventually my partner grabbed it and bought it for me — and I’ve used it constantly ever since.

The Danny K Classic Backpack isn’t “classic” by any means — as I said it is basically a shoulder bag that converts to a backpack. It’s also not quite large enough for a laptop. But it’s got loads of pockets and accommodates a lot of stuff — including my phone a charger a small tablet a folded-up rain jacket a water bottle and more. It also looks great. I’ve used mine until some of the tapestry has begun to unravel but even that sort of adds to its feel of something old-fashioned but still useful. — Barbara Krasnoff reviews editor

For obvious reasons I wasn’t going out very much in 2020. I did not need my lipstick. I did not need a notebook. I did not need my cellphone charger. I did not need a light sweater or a book or a place to tuck away a half-empty bottle of sparkling water. When I did leave my house what I needed was my phone my keys and my wallet. And honestly I didn’t even really need my whole wallet since both the grocery store and the liquor store took Apple Pay.

So I bought the Lululemon Everywhere belt bag (a nice euphemism for a fanny pack) in very practical all-purpose black. It’s smaller than other belt bags I’d looked at and also features mesh pockets on the inside — good for stashing your phone or keys so you can open the bag on the go without fear of important things falling out. There’s also a nice little outside zipper pocket on the side of the bag that faces the body which is a good spot for a transit card folded mask or vaccination record.

I’ve been using the bag regularly for two years and it’s worn well — no scratches no tears no fading and no issues with the zippers or pockets. I adjust the strap to sling it cross-body over my torso or to wear it around my waist (like a true fanny pack) depending on how dorky I’m feeling at any given time. It’s perfect for errands great for a walk and it’s even useful when traveling. (I wear mine at the airport and then tuck it away into my larger “personal item” backpack when it’s time to board the plane.)

The only problem with this bag is that it got TikTok-famous this year which I guess I should have known once I saw half the people in my neighborhood walking around with some version of my bag in various colors. If you manage to catch a restock you won’t regret it. — Sarah Jeong deputy features editor

[Note: Until the Everywhere Belt Bag is available we’ve substituted the Lululemon Athletica Wunderlust Belt Bag.]

Although not a bag per se but rather a tool for bag organization I swear by packing cubes. I wasn’t always a diehard fan of packing cubes though; I’m actually a recent convert. Having schlepped across multiple continents with a carry-on I consider myself a pretty efficient traveler so I shrugged off the need for packing cubes for years. It wasn’t until I began to regularly visit a friend every few months in New York City that I had to reevaluate.

My suitcase would explode across her apartment and I became the house guest every New Yorker hates to have. My piles of clothes simply took up too much room. Finally begrudgingly I ordered a set of packing cubes to help contain my various outfits supplies and laundry. To my surprise they not only worked but I also fell in love with them. I won’t travel without them now. I can pack more save on space and best of all I only pull out one cube as needed instead of rummaging around in an unorganized suitcase. — Kaitlin Hatton audience manager

It’s been over a decade since I had a commute and while I have a few backpacks in rotation (including an ancient Tom Bihn Brain Bag and an Evergoods Civic Panel Loader) I wouldn’t qualify either as a favorite. The Brain Bag is a bit floppy and the CPL has excellent construction but a few confounding design flaws — most since rectified. But technically the prompt for this article was “favorite way to carry your stuff around.” If a child counts as stuff then I do have a favorite: the BabyBjörn Baby Carrier One Air.

The Björn as we invariably call it (“would you like to björn the baby or shall I?”) is comfortable versatile and can haul kids either front- or rear-facing — or even on your back. Ours has survived seven years and three kids and we’ve used it everywhere from grocery stores and zoos to hikes in the woods. It’s especially clutch for travel. Passengers at Amsterdam’s Schiphol Airport earlier this month witnessed me sprinting across the terminal toward our gate with a 27-pound two-year-old on my front and a backpack on my back. We made the flight. — Nathan Edwards senior editor reviews

The 10-2 verdict came on Thursday attorneys said after a trial in a state court in Philadelphia where former mechanic Paul Gill alleged he was exposed to benzene in ExxonMobil products while working at a gas station between 1975 and 1980.

Following the trial that lasted just over a week the jury found Exxon liable for negligently failing to warn about the health risks of benzene which the Environmental Protect Agency has classified as a known carcinogen.

The entire verdict was in compensatory damages according to Gill’s attorneys.

An Exxon spokesperson called the verdict “irrational” and said the company would ask the court to reverse it and that it planned to “exhaust all available appeals.”

The 67-year-old former mechanic said in his 2020 lawsuit that he used petroleum products to clean car parts with his bare hands which exposed him to benzene through direct skin contact and inhalation.

He was diagnosed with acute myeloid leukemia a type of blood cancer in 2019.

“This verdict is important because it’s a finding that their gasoline causes cancer” said Patrick Wigle an attorney for Gill in a statement. “ExxonMobil has known for decades that benzene causes cancer yet they resisted warning the public and taking basic precautions to warn the public and limit exposure.”

Benzene is widely used in the United States in motor fuels as a solvent for resins and plastics and for other industrial purposes.

The EPA which limits the amount of benzene that is acceptable in fuels says it also can be found in emissions from burning coal and oil from car exhaust and from evaporation at gas stations among other things.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMicGh0dHBzOi8vYWJjbmV3cy5nby5jb20vUG9saXRpY3MvdmEtaW1wcm9wZXJseS1hcHByb3ZlZC0xMW0tYm9udXNlcy1zZW5pb3ItZXhlY3V0aXZlcy13YXRjaGRvZy9zdG9yeT9pZD0xMTAwODE1NjnSAXRodHRwczovL2FiY25ld3MuZ28uY29tL2FtcC9Qb2xpdGljcy92YS1pbXByb3Blcmx5LWFwcHJvdmVkLTExbS1ib251c2VzLXNlbmlvci1leGVjdXRpdmVzLXdhdGNoZG9nL3N0b3J5P2lkPTExMDA4MTU2OQ?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,VA improperly approved almost $11M in bonuses to senior executives watchdog says,"Some have challenged having to pay the money back an inspector general said.

VA improperly approved almost $11M in bonuses to senior executives watchdog says

Department of Veterans Affairs officials improperly approved nearly $11 million in bonuses to senior executives intended for other workers a department watchdog said in a new report.

The money was recently allocated by Congress and intended to be used to recruit ""critical skill"" employees but ended up in the hands of senior executives in the VA's central Washington office according to an inspector general's report posted Thursday.

The funds authorized by the Pact Act were meant to be incentives in hiring and retaining specialists needed to process billion in new benefits for veterans dealing with health issues from being exposed to burn pits. Agent Orange and other toxic hazards.

The IG report said the money was paid instead as bonuses to more than 180 senior executives last year with several taking home more than $100000.

The average bonus paid out was over $55000 the report said.

The Washington Post first reported the results of the inspector general's investigation.

The IG said the improperly approved bonuses were due in part to breakdowns in leadership and controls at multiple levels of the VA.

The IG recommended the ""Secretary of Veterans Affairs or his designee takes appropriate action to determine whether individuals involved in the decision-making process ... had any actual or apparent conflicts of interest and develop a process to ensure all decision-makers are free from conflicts when awarding future incentives.""

Solana could flip Ethereum in transaction fees within a week: Report

The Solana network could be on track to overtake the Ethereum network in transaction fees in a potentially significant development for Solana’s status as the so-called “Ethereum killer.” Moreover Solana’s total economic value of $2.8 million was near that of Ethereum’s total economic value of $3.1 million on May 7.

According to Dan Smith senior research analyst at Blockworks Solana could flip Ethereum’s transaction fees as soon as this week. However Solana’s daily transaction fees are still far from those of Ethereum. Ethereum generated over $2.75 million worth of fees in the 24 hours up to May 8 compared to Solana’s $1.49 million according to DefiLlama data.

As we told you $1.6M of that comes from Wednesday night fan screenings hence Thursday’s $5M ties with the preview cash of the franchise’s previous chapter War for the Planet of the Apes.

That preview number is above Ghostbusters: Frozen Empire ($4.7M) which saw a $45M 3-day opening and it’s under the $7.2M posted by Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny which turned in a $60.4M domestic start.

The Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes is playing in 4075 theaters on all premium screens including 40 Imax 950 PLFs 300 Dbox/4D Motion screens and 90 Screen X locations.

Rest of the week is as follows:

Fall Guy (Uni) 4002 theaters Thu $1.5M (-8% from Wed) Total $36M/Wk 1 Challengers (AMZ MGM) 3477 theaters Thu $897K (-5%) Wk $11.5M Total $33.3M/Wk 2 Star Wars – Phantom Menace (Dis) 2700 theaters Thu $347K (-19%) Wk $10.5M/Total $484.9M lifetime/Wk 1 re-release Tarot (Sony) 3104 theaters Thu $466K (+7%) Wk $8.5M/Wk 1 Godzilla x Kong (Leg/WB) 2884 theatres Thu $233K (-14%) Wk $5.7M Total $189.3M/Wk 6

EXCLUSIVE: Sources tell us that 20th Century Studios’ Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes is off to a good start with previews around $6.5M. That’s comprised of Thursday night money which began accruing at 3PM and around $1.6M from Wednesday fan shows that began at 7PM.

We’ll know tomorrow AM if it’s the best Thursday night ever for an Apes movie besting 2017’s War for the Planet of the Apes which did $5M on its preview night before a $22.1M Friday and $56.2M opening. This Wes Ball directed PG-13 sequel takes place 300 years after the events of Matt Reeves’ War for the Planet of the Apes.

Already Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes‘ Thursday has bested that of Dawn of the Planet of the Apes’ which did $4.25M before minting a $27.6M Friday and massive 3-day of $72.6M still a record domestic debut for the Apes‘ franchise.

Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes’ is 82% on Rotten Tomatoes with critics and 82% with RT audiences.

Tonight’s results are a bit of fresh air next to the $3.15M Wednesday and Thursday previews of Universal’s Fall Guy last weekend which fizzled with a $27.7M opening. While fans always populate Thursday night shows hopefully Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes at a 2 hours and 25 minutes running time can hold it together throughout the weekend.

Hands down tonight it’s the best preview cash for a Ball movie beating all of his Maze Runner titles.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNubi5jb20vMjAyNC8wNS8wOS9vcGluaW9ucy9yZWNsaW5pbmctc2VhdC1yYWdlLWFpcnBsYW5lLXBhc3NlbmdlcnMtcG9vbGUvaW5kZXguaHRtbNIBWWh0dHBzOi8vYW1wLmNubi5jb20vY25uLzIwMjQvMDUvMDkvb3BpbmlvbnMvcmVjbGluaW5nLXNlYXQtcmFnZS1haXJwbGFuZS1wYXNzZW5nZXJzLXBvb2xl?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Opinion: I’m a flight attendant. You need to get over your reclining seat rage,"Editor’s Note: Heather Poole is a flight attendant for a major US carrier and author of “Cruising Attitude: Tales of Crashpads Crew Drama and Crazy Passengers at 30000 Feet.” The views in this commentary are her own. Read more CNN Opinion.

CNN —

Last night on a flight from London to New York a passenger rang his call light and when my colleague walked over turned off the light and asked him if he needed something he simply pointed to the reclined seat in front of him.

Heather Poole courtesy Heather Poole

The flight attendant told him that his seat was also in the reclined position and then mentioned that the seat next to him — the aisle seat — was available and that he could sit there. The man said he didn’t want to move to the aisle seat because he wanted to sit by the window.

Sometimes there are no solutions to problems like this.

Another day another flight: “If you put your seat back one more time I’m going to punch you in the face” said an older woman to a teenage girl seated in front of her. The young girl’s eyes looked like they might pop out of their sockets.

While standing in the aisle pouring a can of Diet Coke into a cup of ice I told the aggrieved passenger that nobody was going to punch anyone and that if she said another word about it or did anything to anyone authorities would be called to meet the flight.

“He’s in my lap!” cried a different passenger on a different flight. This one sat in the window seat.

I looked at the woman and then at the man in front who was clearly not in her lap. He was close though about a foot away. Sorry I mouthed. I handed her a can of club soda and a cup of ice and communicated to her in words I knew she’d understand: “Unfortunately he’s allowed to be in your lap.”

Besides lack of wifi or a broken entertainment system flight attendants hear more complaints about reclined seats than anything else.

The heart of the problem is that airlines are packing too many seats too closely together into a tight space. Remember legroom? But this squeeze doesn’t give passengers the right to react in such a way that the crew feels the need to divert a flight to have a passenger removed. That’s a really big deal that usually ends up with someone in police custody.

While I dread these altercations I think some passengers need to chill out — people have the right to recline their seat. Nobody has to ask for permission to recline their seat. Some people believe passengers have to put their seats in the upright position during the meal service. This isn’t true. At least not with US carriers even though it’s a nice thing to do.

A recliner is allowed to recline and there’s nothing anyone can do about it. Heather Poole

A recliner is allowed to recline and there’s nothing anyone can do about it. If you kick the seat or threaten to punch someone in the face you’ll be the one removed from the flight — not the person who moved their seat back two inches.

Not all airlines are created equal. Yes some airlines are taking away the recline option on all seats but these are mostly low-cost carriers which should tell you something about what those passengers want: cheap flights … including seats that don’t recline. (A friend who often flies Air France on short and medium-hop routes in Europe tells me that their seats are all locked upright. “I’ve never seen anyone get worked up about it” he said.)

Airlines are desperate to cut costs. It’s rumored that American Airlines removed a single olive off of business class meal trays and saved $40000 a year. So you’d think that 150 lighter seats per flight will certainly save an airline a ton of money. Remember the recline mechanism in the seat makes it heavier which increases fuel costs for the airline. A lighter seat that doesn’t recline is also a seat that is less likely to break which saves an airline money in repairs.

Non-reclining seats are nothing new. Major carriers have always had a few seats that don’t recline. Think exit rows and the last row. While some passengers aren’t always happy to get one of these seats it never seems to be that big of a deal.

But after 28 years in the job I’ve found there’s some basic reclining etiquette that makes for a smoother flight for everyone.

A reminder: chances are the person in front of you has no idea they’ve crossed that mental barrier between you and the rest of the world. You can’t kick them or scream at them but you can politely ask if they’d mind putting their seat back up. I bet if you ask nicely they’ll do it.

If you’re a passenger who likes to recline it’s always a good idea to be mindful of the situation that we are all collectively in and do so slowly. Yanking the seat back too quickly could make a mess if the person behind you has their tray table down.

Sure everyone feels cramped in coach seats. But the bigger you are the tighter the squeeze so consider glancing back before you adjust your seat. If it’s Shaquille O’Neal behind you maybe give the guy a break.

We do see spilled drinks and from time to time broken laptops. Seasoned business passengers know what to expect and book seats with more legroom. But on coach middle seat passengers struggle to type because there’s no arm space. The table is so much smaller these days and there’s barely room for a drink. So if you think you’re going to work on your laptop and balance a cup of coffee on that table well you might need to seriously rethink your spatial judgement.

If there’s one thing I’ve learned flying the unfriendly skies it’s this: you can’t please everyone. Somebody is going to suffer somebody is going to have a miserable flight somebody will be assigned the last row or a middle seat or will have to come into contact with a child. Now I’m going to tell you what I used to tell my son when he was little every time we traveled together: there’s no crying in flying. Toughen up.

Really this isn’t a war on reclined seats. This is about space and most airlines give you the option to purchase more space. So remember that next time you’re searching for the cheapest flight."

MEXICO CITY/HOUSTON – Exports of Mexico’s newest crude are ramping up from Eni’s Mizton field as US refiners find it an apt replacement for banned Russian oil and one that complements domestic grades.

As reported by Reuters the shipments represent the first crude exports made by an oil company other than state firm Pemex in Mexico’s history.

The Mizton field is part of the Mizton-Amoca-Tecoalli cluster in the southern Gulf of Mexico. Eni estimates that the fields hold about 2.1 billion barrels of oil and gas. The Miamte FPSO which can handle up to 90000 barrels per day of output began pumping the oil in February.

Four vessels chartered by Eni Trading & Shipping have discharged at US ports since April according to the Reuters report. They have carried a total of about 2.2 million barrels of the crude to US refiners including Marathon Petroleum and PBF Energy.

A fifth Eni cargo of 525000 barrels of Mizton on Aframax tanker Nippon Princess is scheduled to reach the US East coast soon reportedly purchased by PBF Energy.

Mizton crude is similar in quality to other US Gulf grades used by coastal refiners and a good replacement of Russia’s flagship Urals crude according to analysis in the Reuters report.

MEXICO CITY/HOUSTON – Exports of Mexico’s newest crude are ramping up from Eni’s Mizton field as US refiners find it an apt replacement for banned Russian oil and one that complements domestic grades.

As reported by Reuters the shipments represent the first crude exports made by an oil company other than state firm Pemex in Mexico’s history.

The Mizton field is part of the Mizton-Amoca-Tecoalli cluster in the southern Gulf of Mexico. Eni estimates that the fields hold about 2.1 billion barrels of oil and gas. The Miamte FPSO which can handle up to 90000 barrels per day of output began pumping the oil in February.

Four vessels chartered by Eni Trading & Shipping have discharged at US ports since April according to the Reuters report. They have carried a total of about 2.2 million barrels of the crude to US refiners including Marathon Petroleum and PBF Energy.

A fifth Eni cargo of 525000 barrels of Mizton on Aframax tanker Nippon Princess is scheduled to reach the US East coast soon reportedly purchased by PBF Energy.

Mizton crude is similar in quality to other US Gulf grades used by coastal refiners and a good replacement of Russia’s flagship Urals crude according to analysis in the Reuters report.

Russian oil which accounted for about 3% of total US crude imports last year was banned in April as part of American sanctions on Russia in the wake of its invasion of Ukraine.

LAPLACE — The potential for growth in the community is dependent upon the growth of the public school system according to members of the newly formed St. John the Baptist Parish Education Foundation.

Led by a seven-member board comprised of elected officials and community leaders the Education Foundation has a goal to grow success and support quality education by generating and distributing resources to enrich maintain and expand programs for excellence in education. This will be achieved by raising funds from businesses individuals and civic organizations

The Education Foundation was incorporated in November 2021 and meetings began in February 2022. As the nonprofit gets off of the ground the two initial goals are providing scholarships for students and teachers.

In Spring 2022 the Education Foundation awarded scholarships to six high school students – three from East St. John and three from West St. John. Each student received $10000 to support higher education expenses for a grand total of $60000. As of August 2022 all six of these students are enrolled in college.

The $60000 investment in scholarships was part of an initial $350000 donated by Marathon Petroleum Company to start the foundation. From the initial donation the Education Foundation planned to use $60000 to get teachers certified. However with 77 non-certified teachers willing to participate in the program and a cost of approximately $5000 per person the expense proved to be much greater.

Earlier this month Marathon announced a second $350000 grant for the Education Foundation which effectively pays for all non-certified teachers to participate in the certification program.

According to board member Tammy Houston the certification program also promotes teacher retention in St. John the Baptist Parish schools. Each teacher participating in the program has committed to remain within the school system for at least five years.

Houston has a vision to raise test scores and morale within local schools.

“This foundation started with a vision. We want to bring education back to the grandeur of old when we had school systems that we were proud of and we produced kids that were productive. Kids enjoyed learning and going to school. We want to bring the fun back as well as the academic portion” Houston said. “The consensus is that if we don’t have a good school system we are not going to bring businesses and families here. We actually have families who leave because they want a free education in another system where they don’t have to pay for a private education.”

Moving into the 2022-23 school year Education Foundation president Debbie Schum wants to raise awareness of the opportunities available. Only 12 students applied for the 2022 scholarship a number Schum would like to see increase this year.

According to Schum other goals the Education Foundation is working toward include recognizing staff for exemplary service offering small grants to teachers and inspiring parents to participate in the school system.

The St. John the Baptist Parish Education Foundation is modeled after a successful organization in Texas which offers incentives for high achievement for schools teachers and scholars.

“I think we have to build the community’s trust in our schools” Schum said. “That’s something we haven’t achieved yet. I think it’s important that we have a very diverse group of board members that unite all avenues.”

Schum and Sherry DeFrancesch the secretary/treasurer of the Education Foundation both serve on the St. John Parish School Board while Houston serves on the Parish Council. Other board members include Louisiana State Senator Ed Price Sheriff Mike Tregre Virgie Johnson of the St. John Parish Library Board of Control and Iman Montgomery of Marathon Petroleum. While not a board member Assessor Lucien Gauff was also instrumental in the formation of the Foundation.

The Education Foundation’s first community meet and greet held this week at the Lloyd B. Johnson Law Enforcement Training Center in LaPlace saw participation from numerous business leaders and elected officials.

“The people in this room could solve a lot of problems in St. John Parish” Sheriff Tregre said. “I know as sheriff there is no way we are going to arrest ourselves out of our problems. We’ve got a good parish. What’s frustrating is that I know we can be better than what we are and that’s why I’m part of this foundation.”

Senator Price said he is proud to be part of a board that seems to be moving in the right direction.

“We want our kids to go to college but also part of our vision is what we are doing with teachers and providing scholarships to get them certified” Price said. “We need businesses parents everybody to be involved in this.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMidWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxvYnNlcnZhdGV1ci5jb20vMjAyMi8wOC8yNy9yaXZlci1wYXJpc2hlcy1jb21tdW5pdHktY29sbGVnZS1mb3VuZGF0aW9uLWFubm91bmNlcy0yMDIyLTIwMjMtc2Nob2xhcnNoaXBzL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,River Parishes Community College Foundation announces 2022-2023 Scholarships - L'Observateur,"River Parishes Community College Foundation announces 2022-2023 Scholarships Published 12:03 am Saturday August 27 2022

MAR,Marriott International,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZGh0dHBzOi8vZm9ydHVuZS5jb20vMjAyMi8wOC8yOS9jaGluYS1nZW4tei1saWUtZmxhdC1idXktdXMtYnJhbmRzLW1hcnJpb3R0LW1hcmtldGluZy1zYWxlcy1zdHJhdGVneS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,How US brands are reaching China's Gen Z which 'lies flat' buys local,"Last year Marriott International tasked Arnold Ma with creating a marketing campaign for the Shanghai opening of Moxy a hip modern offshoot of the U.S. hotel giant geared toward younger guests.

In Marriott Moxy hotels in the U.S. the front desk doubles as a bar and lobby furniture bear slogans like “Pizza is my spirit animal.” Marriott knew it had to localize Moxy to appeal to China’s Gen Z. It hired Ma CEO of China-focused digital marketer Qumin to sell the brand—energetic and lively—to China’s young consumers who are known for being skeptical of foreign influence and for “lying flat” to escape the rat race of China’s economy by doing as little as possible.

The project was a study in contradictions but it was up to Ma’s Qumin team to make it work.

They started by conducting a sort of unofficial ethnography of China’s Gen Z and found that members had an “innate confidence” in their own abilities and a desire to create. So Qumin enlisted a group of underground Gen Z artists with cult followings to paint the hotel’s interior and craft cocktails for the launch of China’s first Moxy hotel in Shanghai’s Hongqiao district. Local graffiti artists tagged the walls with robots and abstract images. A DJ played house music. There was a pit of pink and purple plastic balls and pillows specially designed for the opening plastered with pictures of guitars and red floating lips.

An accompanying campaign on Douyin China’s TikTok called “Where Brave Starts” featured influencers who’d made Moxy-themed videos and inspired followers to make thousands of videos of their own. “We kind of had this pyramid effect where we got creators to make pieces for the hotel which then could be turned into content” says Ma.

The “Make Moxy Yours” campaign generated “a phenomenal 420 million views and 5.98 million likes” on Chinese social media channels says Jennie Toh vice president of brand marketing for Marriott Asia Pacific. After the launch of the Shanghai Hongqiao location in June 2021 Marriott opened a second Moxy hotel in Shanghai and four others throughout the mainland. More locations are “in the pipeline” Toh says.

Occupancy figures rose 500% at Moxy’s flagship Shanghai location in the weeks after the campaign. Marriott declined to say if that success continued this year amid tight COVID restrictions but executives claim that the company’s business in China remains strong. “Many of [Marriott’s or its partners’] hotels are benefiting from increased volumes of domestic travel [in China] albeit some pauses when certain markets go into lockdown” Marriott CEO Anthony Capuano said on an earnings call earlier this month.

Marriott loved the marketing campaign’s results even if its leaders didn’t fully comprehend how Ma generated them. “[A Marriott executive] was like ‘Man I don’t understand what’s happening in any of these videos’” Ma says.

Foreign executives don’t have to see eye to eye with China’s Gen Z to recognize their power. China’s 270 million Gen Zers make up 19% of the nation’s total population a share that is set to grow to 27% by 2025 according to Chinese digital marketing agency Alarice. The spending power of China’s Gen Z is set to quadruple to $2.4 trillion from now until 2035 according to China Renaissance. But the quirks of Gen Z—their distaste for overwork and preference for local goods—defy generational shifts of the past. Western brands that want to remain relevant in the market of 1.4 billion have to rethink their China strategies and learn a new set of rules to crack China’s Gen Z code.

The disconnect

China’s Gen Z is not just indecipherable to foreign executives. Older generations of Chinese also struggle to understand a cohort that has grown up in a world of relative affluence and WeChat.

China’s Gen Z population was born between the years of 1997 and 2012 just as the country transformed from a plodding backwater into a global powerhouse. During that time China’s economy expanded by a factor of eight growing from the world’s seventh largest economy to second place. When the first Gen Zers were born in 1997 China’s economy was just starting to boom and the country had a per capita GDP of $781. By 2007 when Gen Zers turned 10 China’s per capita GDP had more than tripled to $2694. Gen Zers have only known China as an economic superpower a trait distinguishing them from their elders whose working years coincided with China’s rise.

“It’s the biggest gap between any generation and another probably anywhere in history” says Ma.

Smartphones have worsened the disconnect says Allison Malmsten marketing director at Daxue Consulting. China’s Gen Zers are defined by their digital lives. “In the West they’re kind of testing the waters with integrating social media and e-commerce” she says. “But in China they’ve already been doing this for a couple of years now…That means your social media time is more integrated with your shopping time which is more integrated with showing off what you are buying which is more integrated with hobbies.”

The gulf between Gen Z and older generations fuels movements like “lying flat” and “involution”—a term that refers to the opposite of evolution and encourages people to become stagnant. Older generations were willing to log long hours to grow China’s GDP. Gen Z is struggling to see the payoff; China is already a top economy and the rewards for their hard work have diminished.

This generation has grown up in a “super high-pressured environment” where the intense competition of trying to get into the right middle school or high school is followed by an equally intense scramble to find the right job or spouse says Zak Dychtwald CEO of consultancy Young China Group. But the rat race doesn’t pay the way it used to. In June China’s youth unemployment rate hit an all-time high of 19.3%. Buying a house is increasingly out of reach. In 2020 average housing prices in Chinese cities were nearly 13.7 times the average annual income nearly double the ratio of the U.S. “There has been a feeling of helplessness that no matter how hard [Gen Zers] work or compete that the things that they want in life are out of reach” says Dychtwald.

Lying flat and involution are not just online fodder experts say; symptoms of passive resistance are popping up across Chinese society. Some white-collar workers are quitting high-stress jobs and moving to the countryside. Experts also attribute China’s falling birth rates at least partly to a desire among Chinese women to avoid the governmental and societal pressures to have children.

Disaffected consumers promoting a “slacking culture” don’t make for easy marketing targets says Ashley Dudarenok founder of Alarice. But brands that do business in China are trying to reach them—with mixed results.

Last year a Russian man named Vladislav Ivanov who goes by the stage name Lelush became a national star and a symbol of the lying flat movement after participating in a Chinese singing competition reality show. After Lelush signed up for the show he purposely tried to lose and get himself voted off by deliberately singing poorly and pleading with viewers to not vote for him. Despite Lelush’s attempts to get kicked off he made it through 10 episodes barely missing out on a spot in the show’s finale.

Fashion brands Prada Gucci and Fendi have all since featured Lelush in ad campaigns in China. Extra chewing gum owned by American firm Wrigley featured Lelush in a commercial in which he chews gum while uninterestedly commuting to work going to the office and working out at the gym. These brands are playing into the lying flat “slacking culture” says Dudarenok.

Guochao or nationalistic buying

Ma argues that the “lying flat” narrative about China’s Gen Z may be “blown out of proportion.” With the Marriott campaign he found that Gen Zers were not necessarily apathetic; they just wanted to identify their passion and find a way to pursue it.

He says the hardest part of the Marriott assignment was selling young Chinese on a foreign brand. “Before Western brands were always seen as superior. That’s not the case anymore” he says.

Indeed guochao or nationalistic buying is rising in China amid a widening rift between the U.S. and Beijing; it’s especially popular among Gen Z consumers. Since 2011 the number of people who said they would buy a Chinese brand over a foreign one increased from 15% to 85% according to a 2020 McKinsey survey of 5000 people across 15 Chinese cities. And much of that rise is thanks to Gen Z. A Tencent survey recently showed that 45% of Chinese consumers born after 1995 often bought products that had guochao or nationalistic elements in them compared with 38% of consumers born in the 1990s and 27% born in the 1980s.

In March 2021 some young consumers burned Nike shoes to protest the company’s stance on forced labor in China’s contentious Xinjiang region. This month social media users threatened to boycott Snickers candy bars after a Snickers ad shown outside mainland China referred to Taiwan as a country. The Snickers backlash occurred shortly after U.S. Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi’s visit to Taiwan inflamed tensions. Snickers’ U.S. parent Mars Wrigley issued an apology on Aug. 5 declaring that Taiwan “is an inseparable part of Chinese territory.”

“China’s Gen Z is ‘woke’ in their own way” says Malmsten. “What is considered forward-thinking among Chinese Gen Z is being very critical of foreign influence.”

Foreign brands can’t ignore the guochao trend and lose out to patriotic competitors. Instead companies based overseas are collaborating more with local brands and institutions.

“Guochao is all about authenticity and nationalism…the only way for foreign brands to do it well is to borrow authenticity and borrow nationalism through local partners” says Ma. He cited Oreo‘s collaboration with Beijing’s Palace Museum a historical museum housed inside the Forbidden City as a successful partnership.

In 2019 Oreo and the Palace Museum created an imperial-themed line of Oreo cookies with flavors like green-tea cake red-bean cake and lychee-rose cake—the latter of which was a nod to the favorite snack of Qing Dynasty emperor Kangxi. Oreo claimed it had sold 760000 boxes of the new cookies online on the first day of their release and attracted 260000 new followers to its flagship store on Alibaba’s Tmall platform.

Other brands have clumsily played into Chinese patriotism sparking backlash from consumers who can easily spot guochao imposters.

American chocolate maker Dove launched its own Forbidden City–themed box of chocolates for Chinese Lunar New Year in 2020. But internet users complained that the boxes barely featured elements from Chinese history and were just a ploy to capitalize on guochao.

“Collaborations that are viewed as superficial or that embrace improper cultural components endanger the brand’s reputation” says Dudarenok.

Ultimately Dychtwald says foreign brands must approach the Chinese market with humility.

“You have to create products that appeal to [China’s Gen Z] market specifically which means having an intimate understanding of what they want” he says. “Global brands are investing in market intelligence for that but they’re not always empowering the local Chinese team to actually develop the strategy.”

The days of coasting on brand recognition alone are long gone Ma says.

“You can’t rely on the fact that you are a heritage foreign brand” says Ma. “That just seems really cocky these days…People don’t care where you come from. People care about what you’re doing right now.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiPmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmludmVzdG9wZWRpYS5jb20vdGVybXMvaC9ob3Jpem9udGFsaW50ZWdyYXRpb24uYXNw0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,What Is Horizontal Integration? Definition and Examples,"What Is Horizontal Integration?

Horizontal integration is the acquisition of a business operating at the same level of the value chain in the same industry—that is they make or offer similar goods or services. This is in contrast to vertical integration where firms expand into upstream or downstream activities which are at different stages of production.

Key Takeaways Horizontal integration is a business strategy in which one company grows its operations at the same level in an industry.

Horizontal integrations help companies grow in size and revenue expand into new markets diversify product offerings and reduce competition.

Disadvantages of horizontal integration include regulatory scrutiny the reduction of choices for consumers less internal flexibility and the potential to destroy value rather than create it.

A company can horizontally integrate by merging with another company acquiring another company or internally expanding its operations.

A contrasting approach to horizontal integration is vertical integration in which a company acquires a firm operating in the same industry but at a different stage of the production process.



Understanding Horizontal Integration

Horizontal integration is a competitive strategy that can create economies of scale increase market power over distributors and suppliers improve product differentiation and help businesses expand their market or enter new markets. By merging two businesses may be able to produce more revenue than they would have been able to do independently.

However when horizontal mergers succeed it is often at the expense of consumers especially if the merger reduces competition. For this reason horizontal mergers are heavily scrutinized by regulators to see if they violate antitrust laws.

Indeed the real motive behind a lot of horizontal mergers is that companies want to reduce competition—either from potential new entrants established rivals or firms offering substitute or alternative goods.

These are three of the five competitive forces that shape every industry as identified in Porter’s Five Forces model. The other two forces the power of suppliers and of customers drive vertical integration.

Types of Horizontal Integration

There are three primary forms of horizontal integration: mergers acquisitions and internal expansions.

Merger

When two companies merge two separate entities create a new joint organization. The brand of one of those two companies is usually retained though the composition of operations and personnel is shared between both of the former individual companies. In addition the product line of both companies is often similar and equally competitive in the market.

In a merger both companies are striving to become a larger presence in their existing market. Most mergers are of similar firms where integration of the two companies may be seamless due to the similarities between what the two former companies used to do.

Acquisition

Similar to a merger an acquisition occurs when one company outright takes over the operations of another company. Though the two companies technically join together one company remains in control. The acquiring company's staff executives and operations often remain in place while the acquired company's resources are integrated as management sees fit.

Companies often pursue acquisitions in an attempt to get something specific. For example Microsoft specifically wanted to enhance its presence in the video game market. Therefore it acquired Activision Blizzard in January 2022. This example of an acquisition shows an often deliberate strategy for a specific sector in which a company wants to achieve a very specific goal.

Internal Expansion

Companies can also embark on horizontal integration by making more conscious allocations of internal capital. Through internal expansion a company simply chooses to strategically change course and apply more resources in a different way. For example a restaurant can expand to offer catering companies or a beverage manufacturer may branch off to make food products.

In these examples a company continues to operate how it use to. However instead of committing capital to acquire an external company or transition with a merging firm it decides to deploy those resources in-house to train staff buy equipment make capital investments and grow a new branch of operations on its own.

The M&A market was as hot as ever in 2021. According to McKinsey the total value of larger deals (valued greater than $25 million) for the year peaked at $5.9 trillion up 37% from 2020.

Advantages and Disadvantages of Horizontal Integration

Advantages

Companies engage in horizontal integration to benefit from synergies. There may be economies of scale or cost synergies in marketing; research and development (R&D); production; and distribution. Or there may be economies of scale which make the simultaneous manufacturing of different products more cost-effective than manufacturing them on their own.

Procter & Gamble’s 2005 acquisition of Gillette is a good example of a horizontal merger that realized economies of scope. Because both companies produced hundreds of hygiene-related products from razors to toothpaste the merger reduced the marketing and product development costs per product.

Synergies can also be realized by combining products or markets. Horizontal integration is often driven by marketing imperatives. Diversifying product offerings may provide cross-selling opportunities and increase each business’ market. A retail business that sells clothes may decide to also offer accessories or it might merge with a similar business in another country to gain a foothold there and avoid having to build a distribution network from scratch.

Disadvantages

Like any merger horizontal integration does not always yield the synergies and added value that was expected. It can even result in negative synergies which reduce the overall value of the business if the larger firm becomes too unwieldy and inflexible to manage or if the merged firms experience problems caused by vastly different leadership styles and company cultures.

There are regulatory issues as well. If horizontal mergers within the same industry concentrate market share among a small number of companies it creates an oligopoly. If one company ends up with a dominant market share it has a monopoly. If a merger threatens competitors or seems to drastically restrict the market and reduce consumer choices it could attract the attention of the Federal Trade Commission.

Horizontal Integration Advantages May result in efficiencies economies of scale or synergies not otherwise possible

May reduce company risk through product and market diversification

May increase profitability through new cross-selling opportunities

May result in decreased costs due to better processes and greater expertise Disadvantages May reduce value or synergy if merger is not performed successfully

May expose inflexibilities that won't be resolved by the merger

May result in a clash of management styles with multiple leadership teams coming together

May result in regulatory issues if a dominant market share is formed

Horizontal Integration vs. Vertical Integration

Both horizontal integration and vertical integration are the practice of a company expanding its current operations. However each process aims to have a different strategic outcome. Horizontal integration occurs when a company aims to remain within its current part of the supply chain. The company often wants to enhance its existing product or get a larger share of the market.

Vertical integration is the strategy of expanding across the supply to get better at processes the company is currently not involved in. For example a manufacturer may acquire a raw materials distributor to have better control over the quantity pricing or timing of when it gets raw goods. The company is expanding from its current position in the manufacturing process and performing a backward vertical integration.

Vertical integration is often undertaken to have better control over a long process while horizontal integration is more suitable for a company wanting to become more niche for something specific. Horizontal integration often entails similar companies coming together while vertical integration often entails different companies related to a similar product coming together.

The ultimate goal of vertical integration is to become independent of suppliers and control more aspects of the supply chain. On the other hand horizontal integration strives to eliminate competitors grow in market size and create economies of scale.

Examples of Horizontal Integration

Many mergers that hit news headlines are examples of horizontal integration. If a company acquires or merges with another company and both firms are in a very similar industry it is most likely an example of horizontal integration. Specific examples include:

What Is the Difference Between Horizontal Integration and Vertical Integration? Horizontal integration is the strategy of acquiring other companies that reside along a similar area of the supply chain. For example a manufacturer may acquiring a competing manufacturing firm to better enhance its process labor force and equipment. Vertical integration occurs when a company acquires a company outside of their current position along the supply chain. For example a manufacturer may acquire a retail company so that the manufacturer can not only control the process of making the good but also selling the good as well.

What Is the Main Advantage of Horizontal Integration? The main advantage of horizontal integration is the strategically focused decision to penetrate a specific section of a supply chain. Horizontal integration allows a company to potentially acquire a competitor gain greater insight into the market expand its product line or create economies of scale. Horizontal integration is a way for a company to simply do better at what it was doing before.

Why Is Horizontal Integration Important? Horizontal integration is important because it allows a company to grow expand diversify and gather a larger market presence. Horizontal integration further enhances a company's current position in the market and instead of transitioning to widely different aspects of the supply chain it allows a company to become more competitive in the space it was already operating in.

The Bottom Line

Companies looking to grow in size increase revenue expand to new product lines and diversify operations may consider pursuing horizontal integration. Horizontal integration occurs when similar companies merge in the same stage of a supply chain merge. As opposed to a vertical integration which helps a company shift to earlier or later in the supply chain horizontal integration further solidifies a company's current position along a manufacturing process.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiP2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRyYXZlbGFuZGxlaXN1cmUuY29tL2hvdGVsLXBvb2xzLWluLWZsb3JpZGEtNjUwMzcyOdIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,11 Best Hotel Pools in Florida With Vintage Diving Boards Underwater Windows and Thrilling Waterslides,"Beach or pool?

When building wealth through the stock market one of the most straightforward strategies is buying excellent companies and holding them for the long haul. When looking for top-notch stocks you want to find stellar businesses with positive catalysts that can drive growth in the future.

One industry often overlooked by investors is insurance brokers. Insurance brokers are in a good position to profit by helping customers find insurance policies that fit their risk tolerance. Two insurance brokers with excellent future growth prospects are Marsh & McLennan (MMC 0.35%) and Goosehead Insurance (GSHD -1.07%).

1. Marsh & McLennan Companies

Marsh & McLennan advises companies on risk strategy and workplace issues. The company helps companies manage risk and connects them with insurers that help mitigate those risks. Risk and insurance services make up 60% of Marsh & McLennan's total revenue with consulting services making up the rest.

What makes Marsh & McLennan special is that it is a trusted advisor to companies looking to navigate risk and other issues like employee compensation retirement plans and the adoption of greener business practices. This constant demand helps the insurance broker's earnings grow consistently. In the last decade Marsh & McLennan's revenue has grown at a 6% compound annual growth rate (CAGR) while its net income has grown at a 13% CAGR.

Marsh & McLennan also has a few tailwinds benefiting its business today. For one rising insurance prices have benefited the business. That's because Marsh & McLennan earns a commission on its customers' premiums paid to the insurers it connects them to. According to the Marsh Global Insurance Market Index insurance prices increased 9% from last year and insurance prices have increased for 19 quarters in a row.

The company has also benefited from strong demand for its services in an uncertain economic environment. In recent years companies have had to deal with supply chain issues inflationary pressures volatility in capital markets and a transition to greener energy sources. Dan Glaser CEO of Marsh & McLennan told investors that ""when the world is unsettled demand for our services rises.""

Marsh & McLennan is well positioned to succeed through any market cycle so the prospect of a recession doesn't concern the company too much. According to Glaser the company has grown its earnings per share (EPS) during every recessionary period since 1962 making it an excellent stock to buy and hold.

2. Goosehead Insurance

Goosehead Insurance is an agency that sells insurance policies through its corporate headquarters and its franchisees. The company has invested heavily in technology to aggressively onboard franchisees which it sees as its path to explosive long-term growth. Since 2019 its corporate-channel premiums have grown at a 31% CAGR while its franchise premiums have grown at a 52% CAGR.

The company sees the franchise channel as its golden ticket for long-term earnings because of the revenue-sharing structure. During the initial franchise agreement which lasts about ten years Goosehead earns royalties of 20% from its franchisee. Goosehead's royalties then jump to 50% when a franchisee renews their contract.

Goosehead's franchise count is up 25% in the second quarter compared to last year bringing its total franchisees to 1344. The company has seen excellent growth this year on the top line with total revenue up 36% to over $94 million. Operating expenses ticked up too mainly from employee compensation payments and general and administrative costs. As a result Goosehead has a net loss of nearly $2 million after posting a net profit of $1 million through six months last year.

It's important to remember that Goosehead incurs higher expenses for newer franchisees as they onboard and train employees on the business. However in the long run franchise fees can be pretty lucrative for Goosehead which is why I think the stock can be an excellent holding for the long haul.",,,,,,,,,,,,

The Competition Commission (Comco) lifts the provisional measures taken against Mastercard as part of its investigation into ATM systems.

In 2021 Comco had opened an investigation by taking provisional measures against Mastercard for a possible obstruction of the National Cash Scheme (NCS) of SIX said a press release on Thursday. Due to Mastercard’s appeal the provisional measures had not yet entered into force. In the meantime circumstances have changed in the market which is why the competition watchdog has decided to lift its provisional measures.

They immediately wanted to offer banks the possibility of issuing Mastercard debit cards capable of technically processing NCS transactions without waiting for the end of the ongoing investigation. The NCS system could have been affixed to the cards without being activated in addition to the Mastercard system. Since the card-issuing banks did not make use of this possibility SIX postponed the entry of the NCS system into the market until the end of the investigation. Provisional measures are therefore no longer necessary.

When it comes to investing greats Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.A 1.00%) (BRK.B 0.79%) CEO Warren Buffett deserves to be in a class of his own. Since becoming CEO in 1965 he's overseen the creation of nearly $650 billion in value for his shareholders (himself included) and delivered a better than 3600000% total return on his company's Class A shares (BRK.A).

Although no investor is infallible Warren Buffett's incredible track record speaks for itself. It's why everyone from Wall Street professionals to everyday investors waits on the edge of their seats to find out what the Oracle of Omaha has been buying selling and holding.

While Buffett utilizes a number of strategies to make his shareholders richer including a love of cyclical businesses and dividend stocks it's his use of time as an ally that's arguably been his biggest key to success -- and it can be your golden ticket too.

What follows are four Warren Buffett stocks that have the brand power and innovative capacity to turn an initial investment of $300000 into $1 million by 2030.

Amazon

The first Buffett stock with the ability to generate a 233% return for patient shareholders over the coming eight years is FAANG stock Amazon (AMZN -1.07%). Even though Amazon sports one of the largest market caps on Wall Street a $4.5 trillion valuation by the end of the decade is perfectly reasonable given the company's expected growth in operating cash flow.

When virtually anyone hears the Amazon name they instantly think of its industry-leading online marketplace. According to estimates from eMarketer Amazon is on track to bring in about $0.40 of every $1 in online retail spending in the U.S. this year.

However this primary revenue driver for Amazon isn't what'll send its operating cash flow ascending to the heavens throughout the 2020s. Rather it's the company's considerably higher-margin sales channels such as subscriptions advertising and cloud infrastructure services which could more than triple its operating cash flow by mid-decade.

For instance the popularity of Amazon's online marketplace has helped the company sign up more than 200 million people worldwide to Prime. In exchange for giving Prime members cheaper and faster shipping options and access to proprietary streaming content Amazon nets at minimum $28 billion in high-margin added revenue each year. Not only are Prime members more likely to remain within the Amazon ecosystem of products and services when making purchases but this tens of billions in added cash flow allows Amazon to reinvest in innovative projects.

Speaking of high-growth innovation Amazon Web Services (AWS) is the global leader in cloud-service market share. During the first quarter AWS accounted for an estimated 33% of worldwide cloud-service revenue according to a report from Canalys. Cloud growth is still in the early innings and more importantly it generates substantially juicier margins than online retail sales. As AWS grows into a larger percentage of Amazon's net sales it'll have a disproportionately larger positive impact on the company's operating cash flow.

After consistently being valued at a median of 30 times year-end cash flow throughout the 2010s a share of Amazon can now be scooped up for less than 10 times Wall Street's estimated cash flow for 2025.

General Motors

The second Warren Buffett stock with the brand power and innovation to turn a $300000 investment into a cool $1 million by the turn of the decade is Detroit-based automaker General Motors (GM -0.33%).

Auto stocks are facing a veritable mountain of headwinds at the moment. They're contending with general parts and semiconductor chip-supply shortages which have caused certain production lines to be pared back or shut down for short periods. Additionally historically high inflation is causing companies to choose between eating higher expenses or increasing new vehicle prices which could sap demand. The cherry on top is that rapidly rising interest rates may also price prospective buyers who finance their purchases out of the market.

Yet in spite of these short-term challenges General Motors is in great shape to sustainably grow its top and bottom line throughout much of the decade. That's because the long-awaited growth catalyst for legacy automakers has arrived: the electrification of vehicles.

Through the end of 2025 GM plans to allocate $35 billion for electric vehicles (EVs) autonomous vehicles and batteries. The stated goal by the end of 2025 per CEO Mary Barra is to release 30 new EVs globally have more than 1 million EVs being produced annually in North America and have two fully dedicated battery plants online by the end of 2023.

The company's initial focus will be on trucks (e.g. Chevy Silverado EV) and SUVs. Larger vehicles are typically less fuel-efficient than smaller vehicles which makes them a logical target with fuel prices recently hitting all-time highs. It also doesn't hurt that larger vehicle produce higher margins than sedans.

Investors should be aware that General Motors has a sizable presence in China the world's largest auto market. After selling 2.9 million vehicles (mostly internal combustion engine) in China in 2020 and 2021 it's clear GM has an established brand and the tools necessary to become a global force in the rapidly growing EV industry.

Visa and Mastercard

The third and fourth Warren Buffett stocks that can turn respective $300000 initial investments into $1 million by 2030 are payment processors Visa (V 0.79%) and Mastercard (MA 0.33%). If you've wondering why I'm discussing both companies together it's because their operating models and catalysts throughout the decade are virtually identical.

On a year-to-date basis both Visa and Mastercard have been given the cold-shoulder treatment by Wall Street. That's because financial stocks are cyclical and therefore prone to weakness when the U.S. and/or global economy shrinks. U.S. gross domestic product has shrunk in each of the first two quarters of 2022 which signals the potential for consumers and businesses to pare back their spending... at least in the short run.

However there are two sides to being a cyclical company. Although recessions are an inevitable part of the economic cycle they typically don't last very long. On the other hand periods of expansion are almost always measured in years. The takeaway is that Visa and Mastercard benefit from expansions lasting significantly longer than contractions or recessions. Investors simply have to be patient to take advantage of these long-winded periods of expansion.

Visa and Mastercard are also the respective No.'s 1 and 2 in market share in the U.S. based on credit card network purchase volume. The U.S. is the largest market for consumption in the world and according to 2020 filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission Visa and Mastercard controlled 54% and 23% of respective credit card network purchase volume.

What's more neither Visa nor Mastercard are lenders. By strictly sticking to the payment processing side of the equation both companies excuse themselves from the potential to be hurt by rising loan delinquencies and/or charge-offs when recessions strike. Not having to set aside capital to cover potential loan losses is a big reason why both companies bounce back from recessions faster than other financial stocks.

Lastly the expansion runway for both companies is still enormous. With most global transactions being conducted with cash there's plenty of opportunity for organic or acquisitive expansion into underbanked regions of the world.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiW2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFzaWFmaW5hbmNpYWwuY29tL3J1c3NpYW5zLWdldHRpbmctY2FzaC1mcm9tLWZpbm5pc2gtYXRtcy12aWEtY2hpbmVzZS1jYXJkcy15bGXSAV9odHRwczovL3d3dy5hc2lhZmluYW5jaWFsLmNvbS9ydXNzaWFucy1nZXR0aW5nLWNhc2gtZnJvbS1maW5uaXNoLWF0bXMtdmlhLWNoaW5lc2UtY2FyZHMteWxlL2FtcA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Russians Getting Cash from Finnish ATMs via Chinese Cards – YLE,"Russian tourists have been using Chinese credit cards to withdraw cash from automatic teller machines in Finland since Covid border restrictions eased on July 1

The amount of money being withdrawn from automatic teller machines (ATMs) in parts of Finland has jumped in recent weeks thanks to a surge of Russian tourists who have been crossing the border since it “reopened” on July 1 (when arrivals no longer need to have Covid vaccine documentation) to withdraw money via Chinese cards according to a report by YLE News.

With Western credit card companies such as Visa and MasterCard refusing to issue cards to Russians since sanctions were imposed six months ago Russian visitors have been using cards such as China’s UnionPay to get cash the report said adding that ATMs have to be refilled three to four times a week now when they only needed to be refilled once a week prior to the war in Ukraine.

The manager of a local ATM company said the extra business had only added to their costs as they are paid for the number of withdrawals not the amount of revenue withdrawn it said.

However there have also been benefits for some Finns – cheaper fuel for those able to cross the border into Russia according to a separate report by YLE which said “the average price per litre in Finland is up to three times higher than that in Russia”.

Pay for a Hawaiian upgrade

WALLACE COTTON/THE POINTS GUY

Hawaiian Airlines employs a ""Bid Up"" system where eligible travelers can bid to upgrade to first or business class on a Hawaiian Airlines flight. Passengers traveling in main cabin basic — Hawaiian's version of basic economy — are ineligible for the Bid Up system.

Eligible passengers can enter their confirmation number into the Bid Up page on Hawaiian's website to make a bid. You can enter a different bid for each segment but you'll need to bid for all passengers on your itinerary. If you're comfortable splitting up your party and only upgrading some travelers on your itinerary you'll need separate reservations. Hawaiian Airlines will notify you between 48 and 24 hours before departure if you've been cleared off the Hawaiian upgrade list to a first or business class seat.

Meanwhile if you want to secure an upgrade to extra comfort or preferred seats you can pay to reserve these seats. The cost will be between $5 and $49 for ""neighbor island"" flights and between $9 and $399 for other flights.

The Hawaiian Airlines® World Elite Mastercard® doesn't offer any discounts or benefits related to Hawaiian upgrades. But you can still utilize many other credit card travel credits to cover upgrade fees.

For example the Chase Sapphire Reserve offers a $300 annual travel credit and The Platinum Card® from American Express offers an airline fee credit up to $200 per calendar year in statement credits (although you'd need to enroll and select Hawaiian Airlines as your airline of choice before making your purchase).

Redeem miles for a Hawaiian upgrade

ZACH GRIFF/THE POINTS GUY

HawaiianMiles members can also redeem miles for first or business class upgrades based on availability.

For ""neighbor island"" Hawaiian flights the range of miles required to upgrade to first class is between 7500 and 15000. Meanwhile the cost to upgrade Hawaiian flights to North America or other international destinations will range between 25000 and 90000 miles depending on the destination.

Pualani Platinum and Gold members as well as HawaiianMiles credit card holders may see discounted upgrade offers for certain flights in their accounts. Unfortunately you can't redeem miles to upgrade to Hawaiian's preferred or extra comfort seats.

Bottom line

There are several ways to score an upgrade to Hawaiian first class. Intra-island flights are shorter so upgrading may not be worth the price (in cash or miles). However upgrading on longer flights may provide excellent value.

If you're a Hawaii resident or travel there frequently elite status in the HawaiianMiles program may score you some free upgrades to Hawaiian first class or business class. And Hawaiian is one of the few airlines flying to and from the mainland U.S. that employs a bidding system for upgrades."

You can explore the rest of the series here.

For the World Cup in Qatar the Iranian national team has been placed in Group B alongside England Wales and the US.

Though many would hold that politics and sport shouldn’t mix in an ideal world the reality is that in Iran football has been intensely politicized for the past 40 years – and Tehran has had strained relations with both Britain and the US throughout that time. Like it or not Group B’s are likely to be the most intensely politicized set of matches in the entire tournament at least from Iranian commentators’ point of view.

Months after the victory of the Islamic Revolution a group of students and fanatical supporters of Ayatollah Khomeini stormed the American Embassy in Tehran and took some 56 of its diplomatic staff hostage for 444 days. The episode deepened tensions with the US – and economic sanctions on Iran – and pushed the normalization of relations off the table for decades to come.

Tussles between Tehran and Washington have been well-publicized down the years since then. Less well known is that on November 5 of that same year a similar group of armed militants broke into the British embassy compound and escorted staff in the area and their families to the house of the chargé d'affaires. The group withdrew after about five hours but the exchange alarmed UK officials and created a high degree of unease.

In both its foreign policy stances and its media and educational output the Islamic Republic has cast the US as the “enemy” and the antithesis of its own principles but also Britain as the conniving untrustworthy “Old Fox”. Both and other countries Tehran collectively casts as “the West” are positioned as diametrically opposed and an active threat to Iran and its sovereignty.

Individual incidents have made relations with the UK all the harder since then. In 1989 for instance an ageing Ruhollah Khomeini called on “all brave Muslims” to attempt to murder the British author Salman Rushdie over the content of his book The Satanic Verse. This led both countries to temporarily suspend diplomatic contact.

Then in 1994 the Islamic Republic formally recognized the Irish Republican Army. Tehran Municipality renamed Winston Churchill Street next to the British Embassy to Bobby Sands Street after the convicted IRA member Bobby Sands. This too prompted London to recall some of its embassy employees.

In 2011 in the most explosive provocation yet a group of members of the state-backed paramilitary Basij broke into the British Embassy tearing down the Union Jack flag and seizing documents. At the same time in an attack on the garden of the British Embassy in Tehran’s Gholhak district six British diplomatic staff were taken hostage and released after a few hours after police intervention. Three British officers were injured in the fray.

For his part in his address on the matter Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei described the building as “that evil embassy” only saying in mitigation: “The feelings of the youth were correct but entering the embassy was not.” Then-speaker of parliament Ali Larijani said the attackers’ anger was “a symbol of public opinion in the country”.

After these incidents the UK Foreign Office expelled all Iranian diplomatic staff from Britain and began withdrawing its own personnel from Iran. The following summer a temporary British Interests Section was opened at the Swedish Embassy instead. Normal relations did not resume until 2014.

A key figure who took part in the garden assault was a man named Ali Foroughi: a relative of Gholam-Ali Haddad-Adel the Supreme Leader’s son’s father-in-law and currently the head of the IRIB’s TV3. This happens to be the channel that will be broadcasting World Cup matches in October.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMid2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRhem4uY29tL2VuLVVTL25ld3Mvc29jY2VyL3dvcmxkLWN1cC0yMDIyLWhvdy1tYW55LXRlYW1zLXF1YWxpZnktZnJvbS1lYWNoLWdyb3VwLzFqZnRxY3FqdmFnNWgxMGF4ZDA2ODVnbW9n0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,World Cup 2022: How many teams qualify from each group?,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with ('Connection aborted.', ConnectionResetError(10054, 'An existing connection was forcibly closed by the remote host', None, 10054, None)) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMid2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRhem4uY29tL2VuLVVTL25ld3Mvc29jY2VyL3dvcmxkLWN1cC0yMDIyLWhvdy1tYW55LXRlYW1zLXF1YWxpZnktZnJvbS1lYWNoLWdyb3VwLzFqZnRxY3FqdmFnNWgxMGF4ZDA2ODVnbW9n0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMifmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmVzcG5jcmljaW5mby5jb20vc2VyaWVzL21lbi1zLXQyMC1hc2lhLWN1cC0yMDIyLTEzMjcyMzcvaW5kaWEtdnMtcGFraXN0YW4tMm5kLW1hdGNoLWdyb3VwLWEtMTMyNzI3MC9mdWxsLXNjb3JlY2FyZNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,IND vs PAK Cricket Scorecard 2nd Match Group A at Dubai August 28 2022,"2.4 to Babar Azam  short ball top edges to short fine leg who takes the catch!

While the extent of McCormick’s ties to his “home state” are cloudy his ties to another state—the “deep state”—seem far more clear.

Despite his claims to the MAGA movement McCormick is steeped in the nexus of government intelligence and big business that Donald Trump and his acolytes ambiguously refer to as “the deep state.”

Those connections range from colleagues to boards to corporate investments with additional ties to notorious surveillance systems and an internal monitoring project at McCormick’s firm—the legendary hedge fund Bridgewater Associates—that was directly modeled after the Chinese Communist Party’s autocratic surveillance state.

And in the mind of Trump who is McCormick’s most crucial political ally some of those ties would be about as problematic as a MAGA Republican can get—such as for instance former FBI Director James Comey.

Comey it turns out accepted a senior role at Bridgewater the year after McCormick signed on as the fund’s president. As general counsel Comey oversaw an internal security program whose invasive and sometimes demeaning methods of surveillance and interrogation earned him a reputation as Bridgewater’s “in-house inquisitor.”

Aside from Comey the most prominent of McCormick’s “deep state” affiliations is his recent three-year run as a paid trustee of the secretive government-backed investment group In-Q-Tel—quite literally the Central Intelligence Agency’s very own venture capital firm.

McCormick’s role at In-Q-Tel appears on his candidate financial disclosures where he listed the entity’s name as “IQT.” Tax filings from In-Q-Tel which is registered with the Internal Revenue Service as a nonprofit show that McCormick joined as a trustee in March 2018 and left in 2022 as he pursued his first Senate campaign. He collected an annual $35000 salary logging five hours of work a week according to the tax records and his election bid has since seen hundreds of thousands of dollars in support from executives tied to IQT and its investments.

For McCormick his deep state connections embody the larger political contradictions he’s already been forced to reconcile as a corporate Republican seeking office in the quasi-populist era of Trump.

That tortured balancing act failed two years ago. In the 2022 GOP primary in Pennsylvania the lifelong moderate failed to land Trump’s endorsement—losing that honor and subsequently the GOP primary to Mehmet Oz.

While McCormick got the coveted Trump endorsement this year—though there weren’t any other viable Republicans running in the primary—the dissonance is starker than ever.

Today the MAGA wing of the Republican Party finds itself fully enthralled with conspiracy theories about the intelligence community which Trump and his allies have for years cast as public enemy No. 1. Trump is vowing retribution as a key 2024 campaign plank.

Given that McCormick’s challenge to Sen. Bob Casey (D-PA) will be one of the most contentious races of the 2024 cycle the hedge funder turned true MAGA believer may have to work harder than expected to scrub his deep establishment ties in order to appeal to his new base.

A former colleague of McCormick’s at Bridgewater told The Daily Beast that McCormick was “an honorable man” a “stand-up guy” and an “independent” and “brilliant leader.” But the colleague also put his finger on the Trump issue calling it a “sad reality” that McCormick will have to cave to the whims of the former president.

“He knows that if he wins he won’t get to do what he thinks is right” the person said. “He has his own money and he won’t be so susceptible to outside pressures financially. But he’s still going to have to kiss the ring and that’s unfortunate.”

McCormick’s campaign did not respond to detailed questions for this article.

It’s not clear if Trump knew about McCormick’s work with the U.S. intelligence community including the CIA and Comey. But as it turns out the deep state overlaps in myriad ways with McCormick’s 13-year tenure as a top executive at Bridgewater.

In 2010—the year after McCormick left George W. Bush’s Treasury Department to sign on as Bridgewater’s president—Bridgewater hired Comey who would later come to embody the darkest of Trump’s paranoiac accusations about federal agents.

Bridgewater brought Comey on officially as head of security and general counsel. In practice however Comey’s role more closely resembled that of an “in-house inquisitor” over the first iteration of the firm’s oppressive internal employee monitoring program which would later come to be called “The Politburo.”

Before he led the FBI unleashed a bombshell on Hillary Clinton in the 2016 campaign and got fired by Trump Comey reportedly raked in $7 million per year at Bridgewater. His task was to keep employees in line with the goals of what firm founder Ray Dalio called “radical transparency.” Those efforts included constant surveillance—including recorded meetings and videotaped internal “trials” of employees—with Dalio telling Bridgewater staff that Comey was “like a godfather adjudicating it all.”

The taped meetings were “just the tip of the surveillance ecosystem” at Bridgewater Vanity Fair reported in its profile of Comey’s time with the firm.

“A slew of ex FBI agents staffed the security team. Not only did cameras cover seemingly every inch of the property but they seemed to be watched in real time. Staffers who left their desks even briefly would return to sticky notes left on their computer monitors admonishing them for failing to put up a screen saver” Vanity Fair reported.

Comey would go through employee cellphone and computer records and was apparently so intrusive that he embarrassed one executive into resigning.

But when Comey’s security posse only turned up “little evidence of actual offending behavior to snuff out they created their own” according to Vanity Fair.

In one instance the report said Comey left an executive’s binder clearly labeled and unattended in Bridgewater offices. He then watched as surveillance cameras captured a low-ranking employee discovering the binder and going through it. Comey put the employee on trial and fired him with the approval of Dalio.

Comey however eventually found himself repelled by Dalio’s extremes resigning after two years. (This month Comey happens to be publishing a murder mystery novel that takes place inside a fictionalized version of Bridgewater.)

Dalio however only ramped things up implementing more and more intrusive policies to fully enact his “radical transparency” dogma.

That program it turns out was literally modeled on the Chinese Communist Party’s social surveillance program which Dalio openly admired. He even named the project after the CCP’s own “Politburo” and compared it favorably to “Big Brother” in a 60 Minutes interview.

China of course is another area where McCormick is against the prevailing GOP winds as Bridgewater’s internal culture “reflects aspects of Chinese political ideology” and invested heavily in the region—after McCormick took over as co-CEO in 2017 the fund’s Chinese investments skyrocketed.

The “Politburo” staffed up with officials from the National Security Agency and the CIA. But Bridgewater workers found it “intimidating” and “humiliating” and so intrusive that in 2017 one whistleblower filed a human rights complaint with the state of Connecticut where the fund is headquartered which was covered at the time in The New York Times.

As detailed in a recent book about Dalio titled The Fund the Politburo essentially pitted its employees against each other assigning roles like “auditors” and “overseers” and recording practically every moment of activity—all in pursuit of Dalio’s core “radical transparency” philosophy.

While the system repelled many employees—including Comey and one-time CEO Jon Rubinstein who both left after disagreements with Dalio—McCormick stayed aboard got a promotion and publicly defended Dalio’s “radical transparency.”

Rubinstein quit after a “firing squad” meeting that McCormick personally sat in on according to the book where Rubinstein made the case that Dalio’s increasingly authoritarian policies were creating a “climate of fear.” When McCormick one of a handful of senior executives in the room was personally asked if he agreed with Rubinstein’s take he said he did not according to the book.

McCormick has subsequently defended Dalio. In 2020 when McCormick was asked if he took issue with a fundamental contradiction at the core of the monitoring program—“radical transparency” within the company but kept secret from outside scrutiny—he replied that he “doesn’t think it’s inconsistent at all.”

“Ray has always said this: Radical transparency is not total transparency. There are certain things that we’re not transparent about and consciously so. Personnel and salary discussions for example” McCormick said.

Shortly after rising to co-CEO McCormick joined the board at IQT.

The venture capital nonprofit which former CIA Director George Tenet founded in 1999 has funneled hundreds of millions of dollars in public funds to hundreds of technology firms and startups some of which are still secret.

Today IQT oversees more than $1 billion in assets and even has its own special-purpose acquisition company. Though the group keeps a low profile IQT maintains a close relationship with government intelligence and security divisions and runs “almost all investment decisions” by the CIA.

Many IQT investments seek to cultivate the private development of surveillance technology that could one day benefit the intelligence community and some of them overlap with both Bridgewater and McCormick.

One of those companies is Palantir a tech firm closely tied to right-wing financier Peter Thiel whose sprawling government work has made it a lightning rod for civil rights controversy—and whose fate was “rescued” by IQT’s investment.

Bridgewater itself helped fund Palantir and incorporated Palantir technology to advance its own investments as well as to help monitor Bridgewater employees in the fund’s pursuit of Dalio’s “radical transparency.”

Palantir executives have contributed thousands of dollars to McCormick’s 2024 campaign.

Additionally one of IQT’s current trustees Howard Fox who also served on the board with McCormick has put serious money—more than $150000—behind McCormick’s candidacy in both 2022 and this cycle.

The same is true of other McCormick supporters like the CEO of Tenable an IQT-backed tech firm which announced its public stock offering shortly after McCormick joined the board.

And while it’s true that McCormick brings his own money to the table that hasn’t stopped Bridgewater donors from chipping in. In all Bridgewater employees mostly executives have contributed about $100000 to McCormick’s political aspirations with current president Kyle Delaney throwing $50000 to a 2022 super PAC backing his old colleague.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiigFodHRwczovL3d3dy5wb3N0LWdhemV0dGUuY29tL3Nwb3J0cy9zdGVlbGVycy8yMDI0LzA1LzEwL25mbC1kcmFmdC1uZXdzLW1hc29uLW1jY29ybWljay1zb3V0aC1kYWtvdGEtc3RhdGUtbWF0dC16aW1tZXIvc3Rvcmllcy8yMDI0MDUxMDAwMDHSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Will Mason McCormick contribute to the Steelers' OL in 2024?,,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNic25ld3MuY29tL3BpdHRzYnVyZ2gvbmV3cy9jYXNleS1nb2VzLWFmdGVyLW1jY29ybWljay1vbi1jb25uZWN0aWN1dC1yZXNpZGVuY3kv0gFgaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuY2JzbmV3cy5jb20vYW1wL3BpdHRzYnVyZ2gvbmV3cy9jYXNleS1nb2VzLWFmdGVyLW1jY29ybWljay1vbi1jb25uZWN0aWN1dC1yZXNpZGVuY3kv?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Sen. Bob Casey goes after Dave McCormick on Connecticut residency,"PITTSBURGH (KDKA) — The race between Sen. Bob Casey and his Republican challenger former hedge fund CEO Dave McCormick is expected to be one of the most hotly contested elections in the nation.

Casey's name is synonymous with Pennsylvania especially Scranton. But it didn't take Casey long to label McCormick a Connecticut Yankee for living outside the state for many years.

""He hasn't told the truth about where he lives"" Casey said. ""He lives in Connecticut. He hasn't been truthful about that. So you have an out-of-state candidate who's being supported by out-of-state billionaires.""

KDKA-TV's Jon Delano: ""Where do you live?""

McCormick: ""I live in Pennsylvania. I live in Pittsburgh.""

Just before his run for U.S. Senate in 2022 McCormick who is divorced and remarried sold his home in Connecticut bought a home in Pittsburgh's Squirrel Hill and rented another home in Connecticut.

""My youngest daughter lives with her mother in Connecticut so I periodically go back to Connecticut to see my daughter. Being a good dad is even more important than being a good senator"" McCormick said.

McCormick grew up in Bloomsburg where his father was president of Bloomsburg University. But he also lived outside the state working first for the Bush administration and then as president and CEO of Bridgewater Associates a Connecticut-based multi-billion dollar hedge fund from 2009 to 2022.

McCormick sees the Connecticut residency issue as a distraction from Casey's record.

""When you have the results that Bob Casey has with inflation border crime the war on oil and gas the world falling apart what do you do? Well you try to make it about something that is unrelated in your opponent"" McCormick said.

But Casey says McCormick's long out-of-state residency coupled with his work for a hedge fund associated with multi-millionaires demonstrates who he will represent in the Senate.

""He hadn't voted in Pennsylvania in about 16 years. So I think that's going to be an issue. But I think ultimately it's going to be about whose side you are on"" Casey said.

Casey sees himself as representing hard-working middle-class Pennsylvanians while McCormick argues that Casey has failed to deliver any results.

McCormick criticizes Casey for supporting President Biden's infrastructure bill CHIPS and Science Act the Inflation Reduction Act and other bills.

""Bob Casey has been a 98% vote for Joe Biden"" McCormick said.

Casey sees himself as a soft-spoken doer who gets things done for this part of Pennsylvania.

""The bridge investment alone is about a quarter of a billion dollars just for bridges"" Casey said. ""But there's investments for K-12 education investments for communities all across the board whether it was in the infrastructure bill the American Rescue legislation or otherwise. So we've been able to get resources to communities to try to lift them up but we still have work to do so I want to keep delivering.""

The two candidates disagree on other issues as well like abortion. Casey who is personally pro-life supports the Women's Health Protection Act to codify abortion rights nationwide while McCormick opposes abortion with limited exceptions and opposes all federal legislation on the subject.

""Our states should decide"" McCormick said. ""Pennsylvania should decide as it has. My belief is that we shouldn't have bans. We shouldn't have national legislation.""

Casey says McCormick's work at the hedge fund to promote China will be another issue.

""When China cheats Pennsylvania loses jobs. So he's helped to fuel that rise of China and I think that's going to be a major issue in the campaign"" Casey said.

Delano: ""So you're suggesting he's soft on China?""

Casey: ""I don't think there's any question about it compared to what I've been doing.""

""I've been in business"" McCormick said. ""Yes my business did 2% of its business in China. I know what it's like to negotiate against the Chinese in the government and in business. There is no one better equipped to deal with the challenge of China than me.""

These are just a few of many issues on which Casey and McCormick disagree. Given the millions both campaigns will spend expect to hear a lot more in the months ahead.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMifmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNiYy5jYS9uZXdzL2NhbmFkYS9sb25kb24vc29tZWJvZHktd2lsbC1kaWUtaWYtZm9ybWVyLW1jY29ybWljay1zLWZhY3RvcnktaXNuLXQtdG9ybi1kb3duLW5laWdoYm91cnMtc2F5LTEuNzE5OTI4OdIBIGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNiYy5jYS9hbXAvMS43MTk5Mjg5?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,'Somebody will die' if former McCormick's factory isn't torn down neighbours say,"The owners of the former McCormick's candy factory on Dundas Street have been ordered by city bylaw officials to restore security fencing around the crumbling building but business owners near the property say much more needs to be done to deal with what they call a dangerous eyesore.

A work order was posted on three parts of the fence surrounding some of the property stating that a property inspection done May 8 found contraventions of a city bylaw that requires owners to ensure that vacant buildings are secured against unauthorized entry and to protect the building from the risk of ""fire accident or other danger.""

When a CBC News reporter visited the site on Thursday there were at least eight places where the fence had been torn down partially or completely allowing anyone to walk onto the property.

Windows doors and duct openings were recently covered with plywood Inglis said but that's also usually torn down within days.

Two young teens had to be rescued from the roof of the building on Sunday night London Fire said. There was a fire in the building and the teens who were exploring inside made their way to the roof while they waited for help said Platoon Chief Kirk Loveland. An aerial ladder was used to communicate with the youth and tell them to stay put until firefighters came to the roof to escort them out of the building he said. The teens weren't hurt and were taken away by police.

A similar incident happened on Thursday afternoon. A teen was stuck in the building and police requested the aerial truck again so they could communicate with the young person and escort them out of the building.

Seeing young people in the building is a frequent occurrence Inglis said. ""I feel the city is playing with the devil. Every time an emergency service is called to the building it seems to be more severe. If you don't do something with this building somebody is going to get hurt.""

The recent rescue was just one of the latest incidents where emergency crews were called to the building said Lou Fatibene who owns neighbouring Dundas Automotive.

""I'm surprised nobody's been killed over there yet"" Fatibene said. ""We've had cars broken into the whole area has been vandalized. We're picking up garbage every day.""

The owners of the property Sierra Construction based in Woodstock did not reply to emails and phone calls asking for comment. They have until May 12 to comply with the city's work order.

The company bought the property for $1. In 2021 McCormick Villages Inc. owned and run by Sierra Construction submitted a plan for a subdivision for the factory site comprising of five hectares. In October 2022 city council approved the development which included repurposing the former factory into a mixed-use mid-rise building as well as townhouses a long-term care facility and a seniors apartment building on the property.

But Sierra Construction wasn't happy with council's decision to limit the apartment building height to five-storeys and to make a multi-use path on the property publicly-accessible among other issues. The Ontario Land Tribunal will consider that appeal in June.

It's been frustrating watching the building and property fall further and further into disrepair said Ward 4 Coun. Susan Stevenson. ""It's becoming a huge safety concern and a lot of people are worried that there will be a tragedy there let alone the disturbance to the neighbourhood that's happening as well"" she said.

On Day 1 of Steelers rookie minicamp at the UPMC Rooney Sports Complex on the South Side McCormick worked primarily at right guard a position he barely played while with the Jackrabbits.

Though it remains to be seen if that’s his spot moving forward McCormick is ready for anything when it comes to the Steelers and whatever his role may be.

“I’m ready for whatever they throw at me” McCormick said to reporters on Day 1 of rookie minicamp according to video via Aaron Becker on Twitter. “I just wanna help the organization in any way that I can.”

That’s largely been McCormick’s mindset since the Steelers drafted him in the fourth round at No. 119 overall.

Though he was primarily a left guard in college McCormick worked out for the Steelers as a center prior to the draft. Now he is getting work at right guard initially in the Black and Gold.

Having 3378 snaps at left guard seems like it would make for a difficult transition for McCormick to flip sides but that isn’t the case.

“At South Dakota State they prepared me for everything” McCormick said. “They wanted us to be as versatile as possible and I think that’s something that can help all of us at this level.”

It’s certainly going to help McCormick early on.

When the Steelers drafted him it made some sense that he could be the longtime answer at left or right guard with Isaac Seumalo turning 31 and James Daniels entering the final year of his contract as well as backup interior offensive lineman Nate Herbig entering the final year of his contract too.

McCormick’s versatility whether it’s at left guard center or right guard will be key. That should set him up for success long-term and will give Steelers offensive line coach Pat Meyer the ability to simply get the best five linemen on the field at once regardless of true position."
MCD,McDonald's,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYWh0dHBzOi8vdGhlc3Bpbm9mZi5jby5uei9rYWkvMjctMDgtMjAyMi9oZWFyLW1lLW91dC10aGUtZmlsZXQtby1maXNoLWlzLXRoZS1iZXN0LW1jZG9uYWxkcy1idXJnZXLSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Hear me out: The Filet-O-Fish is the best McDonald's burger,"How Reweti Kohere’s childhood nightmare became his go-to order.

When I was young my dad’s favourite McDonald’s burger was a Filet-O-Fish. I’d screw up my face as he unwrapped the seafood blue wrapper a Happy Meal kid put off by the fishiness of someone else’s fast food preference. There was nothing better than my McNuggets cheeseburger fries and small Coca-Cola. It was all the fuel I needed for the playground.

I ditched the Happy Meal as I got older but remained faithful to the McNuggets and cheeseburger (mainly the single patty though sometimes double and for a time in 2016 even triple). The order did what McDonald’s is designed to do comforting me with its utter uniformity and predictability. I knew what I was getting myself into.

I took a leap of faith recently ditching the cheeseburger and recklessly ordering as my dad did all those years ago. With the once disturbing Filet-O-Fish burger box before me I took a bite – and just like that my McNuggets days were over.

The Filet-O-Fish is rooted in inclusivity. Invented by Cincinnati Ohio franchise owner Lou Groen in 1962 the burger was his answer to falling hamburger sales on Fridays due to his restaurant being situated in a predominantly Roman Catholic neighbourhood. Many of his customers would abstain from eating meat (which the Catholic church defines as the flesh of warm-blooded animals) every Friday so a fish burger could shore up lost sales. By the mid-60s the Filet-O-Fish was added to menus across the US.

Since then the burger has become popular with Jewish and Muslim communities too as its ingredients are more consistent with their dietary laws and practices. And the wider fanfare is real – in 1996 the Filet-O-Fish was replaced in the US by the Fish Filet Deluxe burger in a quest by McDonald’s to add a sophisticated note to its options. But the blowback was so overwhelming that the original burger was gradually returned to the menu. People don’t like when a tried-and-true is messed with.

Nutritionally the Filet-O-Fish is healthier than most other fast food burger staples – by comparison a McDonald’s Quarter Pounder has five times more saturated fat nearly three times more sugar and double the salt. Taste-wise the Filet-O-Fish’s subtlety befits its fancy French-sounding name. It doesn’t ooze fat like a freshly made triple cheeseburger. It doesn’t rely on the sweetness of ketchup or American mustard to amp up the flavour nor the scaffolding of lettuce tomatoes pickles or onions.

The New Zealand version’s hoki fish patty perfectly crumbed isn’t as fishy as you’d expect; in fact the tender flesh is sweet. The rich and tangy tartare sauce flecked with pickle relish gives a zingy kick and the (controversial) half-slice of bright orange American cheese completes the burger’s umami-ness all of which is housed in a pillowy steamed bun. The burger is greater than the sum of its parts.

When I was young my tastebuds just couldn’t comprehend what I know now – that the Filet-O-Fish is McDonald’s best burger. Now I can enjoy one with my dad too.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiigFodHRwczovL3d3dy5uZXdzLWdhemV0dGUuY29tL2J1c2luZXNzL3Jlc3RhdXJhbnRzL2p1c3QtYXNraW4tbmV3LW93bmVyLWZvci1jLXUtbWNkb25hbGRzL2FydGljbGVfZWU2ZjI5MDAtZmUxYi01Y2JkLWE1NGQtN2QyY2VmZjAzMTJmLmh0bWzSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Just Askin' | New owner for C-U McDonald's? | Restaurants | news-gazette.com,"Champaign IL (61820)

""My first job. And still the same great burger"" Bezos tweeted along with a photo of himself at a table devouring the meal. ""Happy Sunday!""

Bezos started working at McDonald’s flipping burgers when he was 16 to get a summer job.

MCDONALD'S TO LOSE ONE BOARD MEMBER ADD THREE OTHERS

""I was a grill man and never worked the cash registers"" Bezos is quoted as saying in Cody Teets book ""Golden Opportunity: Remarkable Careers That Began at McDonald’s."" ""The most challenging thing was keeping everything going at the right pace during a rush. The manager at my McDonald’s was excellent. He had a lot of teenagers working for him and he kept us focused even while we had fun.""

Now more than 40 years later Bezos – who is among the top five richest people in the world – has bigger concerns than a rush at McDonald’s.

Recently the billionaire’s 417-foot multimillion-dollar megayacht irked local residents after he offered to pay to take apart and reassemble a historic bridge that the yacht needed to pass to get out of Rotterdam.

Luckily McDonald’s offers more affordable alternatives including one that rivals the ever popular frozen drinks known as Frappuccinos. They call their version the Frappe.

The only problem with the Frappe is that the options are a bit limited when it comes to flavor. is While Starbucks offers a much wider range of concoctions the standard varieties here in the at McDonald’s simply include caramel and mocha. Now though Frappe-lovers located in Japan will be happy to hear that the fast food chain is rolling out some seriously scrumptious new flavors.

Uji Matcha Frappe

McDonald’s Japan broke the news about these new flavors last Wednesday August 17 via their Twitter account. The first addition is the Uji Matcha Frappe which you guessed it is a matcha-flavored variety of the popular frozen drink. Of course it’s also topped with whipped cream. Yum!

While Starbuck’s the smallest Frappuccino size at Starbucks will cost you $4.99 customers can get this blended beverage at McDonald’s in a medium size for 540 yen—that’s $3.33—or in a large for 500 yen ($3.70). Not a bad deal at all!

Hojicha Frappe

The next new Frappe flavor is one you may not have heard of: Hojicha. Similar to matcha this is another tea powder. However it has a more golden hue than the green matcha and it offers a sweet smoky taste with a bit of a cocoa flavor. We want to get to Japan to try it ASAP! This drink will cost you 490 yen or $3.63 for a medium.

But wait there’s more! McDonald’s Japan rolled out one more new menu item: A Hojicha macaron which comes in a 170 yen or $1.26.

If you happen to be vacationing in Japan as summer winds down get your hands on these new items as soon as you can! They officially hit restaurants this Wednesday August 24. Our fingers are crossed they’ll make their way to the U.S. soon.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMic2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRleGVydG8uY29tL2VudGVydGFpbm1lbnQvdGlrdG9rZXItc2xhbXMtbWNkb25hbGRzLW1hbmFnZXItYWZ0ZXIta2lja2luZy1oaW0tb3V0LWZvci1sb2l0ZXJpbmctMTkxNjI0Ni_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,TikToker slams McDonalds manager after kicking him out for “loitering”,"A TikTok creator has sparked a debate after a video showing him being kicked out of a McDonald’s for “loitering” went viral on the platform.

TikTok has become the hub for many creators to share their experiences working or visiting some of the world’s biggest fast food restaurants.

One of the most frequently featured is global brand McDonald’s. Customers have described their bizarre experiences at the famous restaurant whereas employees have gone viral for sharing their behind-the-scenes secrets.

However a TikToker wasn’t best pleased with their experience visiting McDonald’s as he was forcibly removed from one branch after being accused of loitering by a manager despite buying a drink.

TikToker outraged by “rude” McDonald’s staff

Filming from his van creator Brandon Gross claimed that a McDonald’s store called the cops on him after they claimed he was “loitering.”

He then posted his first video showing him arguing with a McDonald’s employee who had been instructed by her managed to ask him to leave as he was working away on his laptop.

Gross explained how he had been sitting in the store for 20 minutes when he was asked to buy something or leave so went and got himself a drink. However he was approached yet again by members of staff claiming he was loitering and asked him to leave.

He then followed it up with a second video which featured his argument with another employee who claimed he was taking up space for other customers despite there being multiple empty tables around the room.

The video which has 1.1 million views as of writing also featured Gross’ exchange with the police officers who were investigating the report and were surprised as to why they’d been called out.

Although there were many viewers who agreed that Gross had done nothing wrong others wondered: “Why were you sitting there so long without ordering in the first place?” Yet another claimed that he “bought a drink” so was therefore “a customer.”

A phone call with the store manager appeared to clear things up for Gross. He added that she apologized for the behavior of her staff and that she even paid for Wi-Fi in the building to encourage people to work in the store."

Findings from the Extravascular implantable cardioverter defibrillator (EV ICD) pivotal study were presented as late-breaking science at the European Society of Cardiology (ESC) congress (26 – 29 August Barcelona Spain) and simultaneously published in the New England Journal of Medicine. Worldwide the EV ICD system is investigational and not yet approved for sale or distribution.

The Medtronic EV ICD system is designed to treat fast heart rhythms that can lead to sudden cardiac arrest (SCA) while avoiding certain risks of traditional transvenous ICDs because its lead is placed outside the heart and veins under the sternum using a minimally invasive approach. Placing the lead in this location is designed to help avoid long-term complications that may be associated with leads in the heart and veins such as vessel occlusion and risks for blood infections.

The lead is connected to a device that is implanted in the left mid-axillary region. Clinical trial participants received the same therapies provided by traditional ICDs including defibrillation anti-tachycardia pacing (ATP) and back-up pacing therapies with this single implanted device that is similar in size shape and longevity to traditional ICDs.

“We are very encouraged by the high defibrillation effectiveness and strong safety profile of the EV ICD system seen in the study as we look to deliver less-invasive treatment options for patients at risk of sudden cardiac arrest” said Ian Crozier (Christchurch Hospital Christchurch New Zealand) who presented the results at ESC Congress 2022. “These results demonstrate the potential for this novel technology to be used as a safe successful approach for patients with life-threatening arrhythmias.”

In the study the device’s effectiveness in delivering defibrillation therapy at implant was 98.7% (298 of 302 patients) surpassing the prespecified performance goal of 88%.

Further the efficacy of ATP in the EV ICD study was comparable to ATP efficacy in transvenous defibrillators. In total 33 shocks were avoided by having ATP programmed “on.”

The study also exceeded its safety endpoint: at six months 92.6% of patients (Kaplan-Meier estimate) were free from major system and/or procedure-related major complications such as hospitalization system revision or death (compared to the performance goal of 79%; p<0.001). There were no major intraprocedural complications nor any unique complications observed related to the EV ICD procedure or system (compared to transvenous and subcutaneous ICDs).

The EV ICD Pivotal study is a prospective multicentre single-arm non-randomised pre-market clinical study that assessed the safety and effectiveness of the Medtronic EV ICD system for patients at risk of sudden cardiac death. The EV ICD Pivotal study enrolled 356 patients at 46 sites in 17 countries in North America Europe the Middle East Asia Australia and New Zealand. Medtronic has received FDA approval for a Continued Access Study while the agency reviews the company’s EV ICD pre-market application.

Adjuvant treatment with Keytruda and chemotherapy—with or without radiotherapy—failed to hit the mark for disease-free survival (DFS) in newly diagnosed high-risk endometrial cancer patients who received surgery with curative intent according to an interim analysis of Merck’s late-stage KEYNOTE-B21 study. DFS refers to the length of time after a primary treatment ends that a patient survives without any signs or symptoms of their cancer.

The trial’s other primary endpoint overall survival was not formally tested because the Keytruda-chemo combo failed to reach statistical significance on the DFS metric Merck said in a Thursday release.

Merck says it’s continuing a full evaluation of the data and is working with investigators to share the results at a later date.

Endometrial cancer is the sixth most common cancer in women and the most common type of cancer in the uterus according to Merck. In the U.S. alone the company estimates roughly 67880 patients will be diagnosed with uterine body cancer this year. Merck also estimates there will be 13250 patient deaths from the disease in 2024.

“While these results were not what we had hoped we are focused on continuing to build on the established role of Keytruda in advanced endometrial carcinoma through our approved indications” Gursel Aktan M.D. Ph.D. vice president of global clinical development at Merck Research Laboratories said in a statement.

Merck will continue to test Keytruda-based combinations—plus other treatment approaches like antibody-drug conjugates (ADC)—in endometrial and other types of gynecologic cancers Aktan said.

Keytruda is already approved in patients with endometrial carcinoma that is microsatellite instability-high (MSI-H) or mismatch repair deficient (dMMR). The PD-1 inhibitor picked up that nod in 2022 following a 2017 approval that allowed the drug to cover previously treated MSI-H/dMMR tumors in patients without alternative treatment options.

Keytruda also boasts a second indication alongside Eisai-partnered Lenvima in previously treated endometrial cancer that’s not dMMR.

Over the past year Merck’s Keytruda has been sparring with GSK’s PD-1 rival Jemperli over endometrial cancer dominance in the clinic.

Last February just two months after Jemperli snagged a historic win for immunotherapy in first-line endometrial cancer Keytruda plus standard chemotherapy beat chemotherapy alone at staving off tumor progression or death in advanced or recurrent disease.

The following month at the Society of Gynecologic Oncology 2023 annual meeting both GSK and Merck provided a closer look at their meds’ late-stage performance in first-line endometrial cancer with Keytruda appearing to edge out Jemperli in MMR proficient (pMMR) patients—a key subgroup that Merck says comprises roughly two-thirds of all endometrial cancer cases.

GSK ultimately beat Merck to the finish line for a PD-1 nod in newly diagnosed disease with the company’s Jemperli in July snagging FDA clearance as an add-on to chemotherapy for patients with primary advanced or recurrent endometrial cancer but only for tumors that are mismatch repair deficient (dMMR) or microsatellite instability-high (MSI-H).

Meanwhile Merck and Eisai’s Keytruda-Lenvima combo in December missed the mark in a phase 3 study as a potential first-line treatment in certain patients with advanced or recurrent endometrial carcinoma. The oncology cocktail failed to demonstrate an improvement in overall survival and progression-free survival over a regimen of platinum-based chemotherapy missing both of its primary endpoints.

While Keytruda climbed to the top of pharma's sales charts in 2023 the drug has experienced a series of clinical ups and downs in 2024.

The PD-1 inhibitor started out the year by delivering a partial win in a phase 3 study pitting the drug against high-risk localized muscle-invasive bladder cancer and locally advanced bladder cancer. Around the same time Keytruda bolstered its case as a postsurgical treatment for resectable kidney cancer with data showing it helped slash the risk of death by 38% versus placebo post-kidney removal in patients with clear cell renal carcinoma—the most common form of kidney cancer.

The drug also posted a win in cervical cancer in March. But that same month Keytruda in combination with Lynparza failed to improve patients’ life expectancy or delay progression or death when subbed in for the chemotherapy pemetrexed during maintenance treatment of newly diagnosed metastatic nonsquamous non-small cell lunger cancer.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMidmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnJldXRlcnMuY29tL2J1c2luZXNzL2hlYWx0aGNhcmUtcGhhcm1hY2V1dGljYWxzL21lcmNrLXRyZWF0bWVudC10eXBlLXV0ZXJ1cy1jYW5jZXItZmFpbHMtdHJpYWwtMjAyNC0wNS0wOS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Merck's endometrial cancer therapy fails trial,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with ('Connection aborted.', ConnectionResetError(10054, 'An existing connection was forcibly closed by the remote host', None, 10054, None)) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMidmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnJldXRlcnMuY29tL2J1c2luZXNzL2hlYWx0aGNhcmUtcGhhcm1hY2V1dGljYWxzL21lcmNrLXRyZWF0bWVudC10eXBlLXV0ZXJ1cy1jYW5jZXItZmFpbHMtdHJpYWwtMjAyNC0wNS0wOS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMif2h0dHBzOi8vaGVhbHRoLmVjb25vbWljdGltZXMuaW5kaWF0aW1lcy5jb20vbmV3cy9waGFybWEvcGhhcm1hLWluZHVzdHJ5L21lcmNrcy1lbmRvbWV0cmlhbC1jYW5jZXItdGhlcmFweS1mYWlscy10cmlhbC8xMDk5ODI0OTbSAYMBaHR0cHM6Ly9oZWFsdGguZWNvbm9taWN0aW1lcy5pbmRpYXRpbWVzLmNvbS9hbXAvbmV3cy9waGFybWEvcGhhcm1hLWluZHVzdHJ5L21lcmNrcy1lbmRvbWV0cmlhbC1jYW5jZXItdGhlcmFweS1mYWlscy10cmlhbC8xMDk5ODI0OTY?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Merck's endometrial cancer therapy fails trial,"Join the community of 2M+ industry professionals Subscribe to our newsletter to get latest insights & analysis.

Yuval Boger: Hello Thomas and thank you for joining me today.

Thomas Ehmer: Hi Yuval pleasure.

Yuval: So who are you and what do you do?

Thomas: That’s a good question Yuval and because I know the podcast I prepared a bit. I’m a bit of a superposition and it depends really on whom you ask. So for my band I’m the keyboard player for my kids I am the dad. But I think for this podcast I’ll tell you what I’m doing in my business. I’m one of the co-founders in the Merck group Merck KGaA. We are not Merck & Co. so there are two different independent companies. We have to tell this every time. So if you listen from the US we operate under EMD Serono. Rest of world we are Merck KGaA. And some eight years ago I was looking for novel technologies. I’m still looking for novel technologies and we did found a quantum task force with the objective to check if it makes sense that our company takes care of quantum technologies. It does. Yeah and then I’m a physicist by training. I look mainly at all applications that are novel to our company and should make sense. I’m a bit of a troublemaker because I bring technologies in-house that we don’t know yet how to use or we want to use but don’t have budget and so on. So that’s what I do for a living. Eight years

Yuval: wow.

Thomas: Yes.

Yuval: Really one of the pioneers. So let’s go back eight months. What have you learned in the last eight months about quantum and quantum readiness that maybe you didn’t know before that?

Thomas: Eight months is February. What did I learn in the last eight months? So I think what is confirming is that we have a very good emerging quantum computing community. I very much like all these conferences and it’s always good to see that we independent on whom you ask it seems that we are a community who wants to work together. Yeah and I think this is as some might say we approach quantum winter. We don’t know. But I think it’s good to see that there are still some brave people who carry the flag and work together. I see also that a lot of novel quantum computing architectures make it close to the market or are close to the market. So it’s really good to see. And I mean personally I was keen to see the recent announcement from Quantinuum for example where they have for example logical qubits apparently entangled. Eight years ago we didn’t even know how to build a single qubit. Now we have logical qubits at least in some claim that they have and I trust them. So this is interesting to see. And also the quantum communication part people are really getting keen on all these quantum key distribution communication protocols and so on. So that’s yeah. There’s not a single thing. I think it’s just really exploding. That’s good to see how far we move.

Yuval: In your company what do you see as the key application for quantum? Is it drug discovery or is it more things like optimization supply chain and so on?

Thomas: It depends on whom you ask. So we are super interested in quantum applications because once they come if ever they come they might be transformative. There’s so much hope and hype on drug discovery. Personally I’m not really a big fan or believer that computational drug discovery is outperforming wet drug discovery. So that’s my personal take. I think it’s a partnership and everybody’s betting on artificial intelligence. So drug discovery is a very complex thing and computational methods. Quantum computing is an additional computational method. So I think it’s a long way. There’s a very good paper out from the colleagues from Boehringer who did investigate if quantum computing ever will work. So it looks like we need new algorithms. So that’s my take. And the other problems logistics problems this is how it started for me actually to dive into quantum computing. So some years back the D-Wave were the first ones on the market with their traveling salesperson optimization. I still think it’s a miracle that we have these annealing things. And apparently so these ultra wicked complex problems might benefit also from quantum computing. I’m a bit undecided. I mean we see the three classes simulation optimization and machine learning. And yeah for our company none of them currently is relevant from an application perspective. But if they will come to maturity likely the material sciences is also of important.

Yuval: It’s very popular these days to talk about chat GPT moment a moment where AI moved from science fiction to we got to do it now. What do you think the quantum chat GPT or the quantum GPT moment is going to look like?

Thomas: The quantum that I have no clue. So I think the GPT moment was when everybody and their sister and brother were exposed to a functionality they could never imagine which is mimicking human intelligence. Actually it does not but it’s mimicking and it’s very convincing. So I think we will see how this develops compared to quantum. I have actually no clue. I could imagine that eventually something like this communication protocols might have an impact if everybody could just plug in whatever app to have a quantum secured point to point communication without any agency being able to listen in without me knowing they listen in. So this might be eventually one of these which has mass impact because I think quantum computing per se is rather an expert-ish niche co-processor thing. So I’m not sure how to. It’s a good question. I have to ask my guys what they think.

Yuval: You mentioned community earlier. And I know you’re part of a community of several I think German companies that work together to develop quantum. Could you tell me a little bit about that? And also related to that are you worried about other pharma companies about collaborating with other pharma companies to do quantum or right now a rising tide lifts all boats?

Thomas: Yes. So the yes is to the last question. So the company you mentioned at the beginning so it’s an association called QUTAC stands for German Quantum Technology Application Consortium. We have a very cool homepage. And it’s an association of the 13 big German companies. I don’t want to mention them all because otherwise the podcast would be over. What we are doing we organize ourselves in several streams and with the focus to identify quantum technology use cases that we could work on either as developers or co-developers or application user guidance for the developers. Independent from our own let’s say business. For example we work together with automotive or pharma and reinsurers logistics companies on let’s say logistics problems. Everybody has their problems and we test out different approaches on knapsack etc. So that’s one thing. And the other thing is we share the burden to evaluate vendors potential service providers. And by being attractive enough if as a partner you manage to convince QUTAC you not only have one customer but you would have 13 customers. So that’s the main point. And also I think it’s very helpful. All of us have relatively small quantum teams. So these are big worldwide corporations. I mean BMW SAP Bühringer etc. And all have relatively small quantum teams. And it’s very comfortable for us as a team to not be alone so that we have a bit of a peers and we can share interests. Regarding the pharma guys I mean it started I think at the Q2B several years back. There was an initiative that we all say everybody claims we can speed up drug discovery or drug development or we can bring better drugs to the world by quantum computing. Who knows how this works? Nobody did. So it’s also very open very collaborative. And I think it’s rather a friend-ish approach bosonic approach that we work together instead of competition because currently it’s really pre-competitive. There’s also the Pistoia Alliance who is setting up one pharma consortium thing. There are several pharma consortiums emerging. So that’s quite open. And the third part I forgot. Now I think you answered everything here.

Yuval: When you think about QUTAC what is the issue that you’re facing right now? What is the key thing that you’re looking for a solution?

Thomas: So we have different streams. So one stream we started focusing on the logistics and the material sciences streams. It looks like currently we have reshuffled a bit. So one part of us is looking at generative components. So we’re working on quantum generative network so QGANs to check in how far they perform better than classical GANs. We have a paper out. You can make sense yourself if it’s worthwhile or not. I mean it’s early days but this is where we jointly work on because everybody is interested of course in these generative networks. The other thing is in the logistics part we work on knapsack problems to understand can quantum do better knapsack things. And there’s another stream which is composed of different people. They work mainly on material science topics so quantum chemistry using quantum computers. I don’t have too much insight in that but it’s always shared problems that we say how can you better do ground energy finding whatever. What is quantum Monte Carlo? Where does it make sense? Where does it not make sense? And the third stream I mentioned is really looking at infrastructure from different perspectives. So we are also writing there some papers with the target audience of being other quantum computing users to guide them if it makes sense to go on neutral atoms. I mean you know neutral atoms or we’re just working on an ion trap paper. And the other part is also political communication. And in principle also we wanted to do a bit of education so help grow talent for our companies. But that’s not so far progressed as we would have wanted just due to the lack of resource we have.

Yuval: You mentioned the comparison between computational chemistry or using quantum computing for computational chemistry versus wet labs. In a company like Merck how much communication is there between the people who are actually working on developing drugs and people like yourself who are dealing with future technologies?

Thomas: That’s a good question. So I think there is enough communication. There is even a common ground. There are just not enough solutions. I mean we have recently discussed the potential to do I don’t know what was this the idea to use quantum computer annealing approaches to find binding pockets in complex targets. And when I talk to our researchers who do the wet stuff or other computational stuff they said it sounds interesting. On the other hand we already have 15 methods or 20 methods and I have 15 people so I just don’t have capacity to digest this. So I think there is an appetite that it’s really tough to understand this added value given that you have new ways of thinking. So quantum algorithm is using quantum features nobody really understands what these are even the quantum guys don’t. And then I mean how to translate your existing problems in a way that you can make additional value for using quantum components or quantum core processor. That’s not easy. And unfortunately most have objectives that are not so much forward looking and have time to think what will be happening in 10 5 years because in the end you need to deliver the next target. And it’s just a bit of operational pressure. I mean it’s a bit of a dance and mainly of interest so people listening with interest but it’s just currently it’s more playful with the intent to detect good things but it’s not a threat currently if we would not look at it I think.

Yuval: Do you see a need for a company like Merck to purchase a quantum computer anytime soon in the next few years or everything is on the cloud as far as you’re concerned?

Thomas: I mean there are different answers to that. I think it depends on what you want to achieve so if we want to contribute as a material supplier for example because we have the very best isotopes and the very best gas to do nitrogen vacancy whatever stuff well so do we need a quantum computer for that? Maybe not. If we want to learn to program it there are so many solutions out in the cloud. I doubt that we need one in-house. And then there’s on the other hand the approach that the American clinics currently are doing. So every clinic who thinks they have interest in novel technologies they put a quantum computer on site which is then I think rather a symbol because if every day you pass a quantum computer eventually it triggers your way of thinking what could I do with it? So I think for this sake more as a symbol it could make sense. And I mean it looks good. The machines depending on which machines you use but I think definitely from a productive use point it doesn’t make sense this moment in time. I would not even know whom to hire to maintain and operate these things because they are very fragile and you need to calibrate all these. And then the question is also which technology do you want to have? So you would need to buy one of each flavors modalities how they’re called. I would not know what to choose. So therefore I think it’s also not from a financial investment. Maybe it’s not a good value investment because the next generation makes the other one obsolete. So it’s not that it’s getting more and more from a collector’s viewpoint that you can collect. I have the very first I don’t know a QuEra machine and then I put it somewhere. I have the very first IBM machine with 127 qubits. I think it doesn’t make sense.

Yuval: Germany is one of the countries that’s investing heavily in quantum on the national level. And do you feel some of the results of this investment or do you think it’s going to be years out?

Thomas: So personally I feel some of it because I’m also profiting from a federal funded project which I’m very grateful for because otherwise we would not do this project because it’s just too risky. And because we have this funding I can spend part of my time to think on things I would not think for. And the interesting part is that I think we heard this on several talks also on conferences that because you think on quantum algorithms you detect sometimes solutions that are completely independent from quantum that help your business nevertheless. So that’s one aspect. Do I see other… I mean Germany spends a lot of money. The UK does France does. Others do too. I can’t really say that I have seen quick returns but I see that there is a lot of attention and even a bit of understanding in the decision makers. It’s moving into a direction which is at least they want to understand what it is and it’s quite complex but I think it’s more technology friendly these days than it was in the past. Unfortunately we have the situation in the world. So I think everywhere funds are cut for fundamental research. But I mean that’s I think independent from the aim that we want to spend much money on that. I mean one thing on the other hand is what I find a bit disappointing is that we have a bit of this fragmentation in Germany. We have all the land and everybody wants to do their own valley. So we have a quantum valley in Munich we have a Saxony valley. So in Germany everybody is a bit of building their own center and everybody is in the center of their world. I’m not sure how this is in other countries. I think France is by definition different that everything goes to Paris and then you have to see what’s coming out there. But the original question is yes I think it makes sense. You slowly see. I think we’re a bit far behind. Others started earlier and have more mature startup scenes but we’re catching up.

Yuval: You spoke earlier about the quantum winter and also mentioned that you’ve been doing this for eight years. Do you think there is a risk that a company like Merck says you know what we’ve been at this for a while. Let’s shelve it and come back in three years and maybe things will be different.

Thomas: I think there is in principle the risk because we are not doing this as a profession. Everybody’s doing this as their hobby. We have a very small team under our digital just forget but we have a central function and we have a digital unit. And somewhere in this area we have a unit who is doing quantum and AI lab. And these are not many people. And they spend a very small part of the time doing what they do. And what I’m doing thanks to my boss and my boss’s boss and everything so I am doing this on top of my job. I have zero budget except the federal funding so there is not much to cut. Because otherwise it’s late in the evening we have this call after business hours. So I think many people are committed despite not having money because it’s not like in other companies where you have a really a small team and hire a few students. For us it’s relatively small. And I rather see that we are doing more than is visible to the top management. And when we did this task force people were surprised how active we are. If you’re not in the field of course you don’t see it. But then when you say we should do something about quantum computing you see that we’re relatively well networked. I think that’s… Does this answer the question?

Yuval: Absolutely. So hypothetically if you could have dinner with one of the quantum greats dead or alive who would that person be?

Thomas: I’m prepared so I’m not so… I don’t fake surprise. And it took me a long time to think. And I’m in a very lucky position that I already had lunch with some of my idols they’re alive. Therefore I go for the dead ones. And this is a tough thing. I think I would go for David Bohm or John Wheeler because I really like the way they put more into quantum which has to do with consciousness research self-perception the miracles of the observer what is the observer so the bigger picture. Currently I’m tending in my philosophical interpretation of the word a bit to the monistic view which is maybe a bit over-exaggerated. But the miracle that we have something which is self-perception and we have something which is an external world. And how come? We don’t know. And there are so many different interpretations and I think Bohm did a very good… with his implicate order he had a very good idea to think about that we need new ways of expressing ourselves if I understood this correct. And I’ve seen some rare interviews back on YouTube with him and he seems to be a very super interesting person. But he’s dead unfortunately so no chance.

Yuval: Very well. Thomas thank you so much for joining me today.

Thomas: Yeah thanks for having me. It was a pleasure.

META,Meta Platforms,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiT2h0dHBzOi8vdGhlaW50ZXJjZXB0LmNvbS8yMDIyLzA4LzI3L2ZhY2Vib29rLWluc3RhZ3JhbS1tZXRhLXJ1c3NpYS11a3JhaW5lLXdhci_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Meta Platforms Exempted Russian War Crimes From Graphic Content Takedowns,"After a series of Israeli airstrikes against the densely populated Gaza Strip earlier this month Palestinian Facebook and Instagram users protested the abrupt deletion of posts documenting the resulting death and destruction. It wasn’t the first time Palestinian users of the two giant social media platforms which are both owned by parent company Meta had complained about their posts being unduly removed. It’s become a pattern: Palestinians post sometimes graphic videos and images of Israeli attacks and Meta swiftly removes the content providing only an oblique reference to a violation of the company’s “Community Standards” or in many cases no explanation at all.

Not all the billions of users on Meta’s platforms however run into these issues when documenting the bombing of their neighborhoods.

Previously unreported policy language obtained by The Intercept shows that this year the company repeatedly instructed moderators to deviate from standard procedure and treat various graphic imagery from the Russia-Ukraine war with a light touch. Like other American internet companies Meta responded to the invasion by rapidly enacting a litany of new policy carveouts designed to broaden and protect the online speech of Ukrainians specifically allowing their graphic images of civilians killed by the Russian military to remain up on Instagram and Facebook.

No such carveouts were ever made for Palestinian victims of Israeli state violence — nor do the materials show such latitude provided for any other suffering population.

“This is deliberate censorship of human rights documentation and the Palestinian narrative.”

“This is deliberate censorship of human rights documentation and the Palestinian narrative” said Mona Shtaya an adviser with 7amleh the Arab Center for the Advancement of Social Media a civil society group that formally collaborates with Meta on speech issues. During the recent Israeli attacks on Gaza between August 5 and August 15 7amleh tallied nearly 90 deletions of content or account suspensions relating to bombings on Meta platforms noting that reports of censored content are still coming in.

Marwa Fatafta Middle East North Africa policy manager for Access Now an international digital rights group said “Their censorship works almost like clockwork — whenever violence escalates on the ground their takedown of Palestinian content soars.”

Instances of censored Palestinian content reviewed by The Intercept include the August 5 removal of a post mourning the death of Alaa Qaddoum a 5-year-old Palestinian girl killed in an Israeli missile strike as well as an Instagram video showing Gazans pulling bodies from beneath rubble. Both posts were removed with a notice claiming that the imagery “goes against our guidelines on violence or dangerous organizations” — a reference to Meta’s company policy against violent content or information related to its vast roster of banned people and groups.

Meta spokesperson Erica Sackin told The Intercept that these two posts were removed according to the Dangerous Individuals and Organizations policy pointing to the company’s policy of censoring content promoting federally designated terrorist groups. Sackin did not respond to a follow-up question about how an image of a 5-year-old girl and a man buried in rubble promoted terrorism.

Palestinians in Gaza who post about Israeli assaults said their posts don’t contain political messages or indicate any affiliation with terror groups. “I’m just posting pure news about what’s happening” said Issam Adwan a Gaza-based freelance journalist. “I’m not even using a very biased Palestinian news language: I’m describing the Israeli planes as Israeli planes I’m not saying that I’m a supporter of Hamas or things like these.”

Rights advocates told The Intercept that the exemptions made for the Russia-Ukraine war are the latest example of a double standard between Meta’s treatment of Western markets and the rest of the world — evidence of special treatment of the Ukrainian cause on Meta’s part since the beginning of the war and something that can be seen with media coverage of the war more broadly.

Though the majority of users on social platforms owned by Meta live outside the United States critics charge that the company’s censorship policies which affect billions worldwide tidily align with U.S. foreign policy interests. Rights advocates emphasized the political nature of these moderation decisions. “Meta was capable to take very strict measures to protect Ukrainians amid the Russian invasion because it had the political will” said Shtaya “but we Palestinians haven’t witnessed anything of these measures.”

By taking its cues from U.S. government policy — including cribbing U.S. counterterrorism blacklists — Meta can end up censoring entirely nonviolent statements of support or sympathy for Palestinians according to a 2021 statement by Human Rights Watch. “This is a pretty clear example of where that’s happening” Omar Shakir Human Rights Watch’s Israel and Palestine director told The Intercept of the most recent takedowns. While Human Rights Watch’s accounting of recent Gaza censorship was still ongoing Shakir said what he’d seen already indicated that Meta was once again censoring Palestinian and pro-Palestinian speech including the documentation of human rights abuses.

It’s unclear which specific facet of Meta’s byzantine global censorship system was responsible for the spate of censorship of Gaza posts in August; many posters received no meaningful information as to why their posts were deleted. The Meta spokesperson declined to provide an accounting of which other policies were used. Past takedowns of Palestinian content have cited not only the Dangerous Individuals and Organizations policy but also company prohibitions against depictions of graphic violence hate symbols and hate speech. As is the case with Meta’s other content policies the Violent and Graphic Content prohibition can at times swallow up posts that are clearly sharing the reality of global crises rather than glorifying them — something the company has taken unprecedented steps to prevent in Ukraine.

Meta’s public-facing Community Standards rulebook says: “We remove content that glorifies violence or celebrates the suffering or humiliation of others because it may create an environment that discourages participation” — noting a vague exception for “graphic content (with some limitations) to help people raise awareness about these issues.” The Violent and Graphic Content policy places a blanket ban on gruesome videos of dead bodies and restricts the viewing of similar still images to adults 18 years and older.

In an expanded internal version of the Community Standards guide obtained by The Intercept the section dealing with graphic content includes a series of policy memos directing moderators to deviate from the standard rules or bring added scrutiny to bear on specific breaking news events. A review of these breaking news exceptions shows that Meta directed moderators to make sure that graphic imagery of Ukrainian civilians killed in Russian attacks was not deleted on seven different occasions beginning at the immediate onset of the invasion. The whitelisted content includes acts of state violence akin to those routinely censored when conducted by the Israeli military including multiple specific references to airstrikes.

According to the internal material Meta began instructing its moderators to deviate from standard practices to preserve documentation of the Russian invasion the day after it began. A policy update on February 25 instructed moderators to not delete video of some of the war’s earliest civilian casualties. “This video shows the aftermath of airstrikes on the city of Uman Ukraine” the memo reads. “At 0.5 seconds innards are visible. We are making an allowance to MAD this video” — a reference to the company practice “Mark As Disturbing” or attaching a warning to an image or video rather than deleting it outright.

“It’s always been about geopolitics and profit for Meta.”

On March 5 moderators were told to “MAD Video Briefly Depicting Briefly Mutilated Persons Following Air Strikes in Chernigov”— again noting that moderators were to deviate from standard speech rules. “Though video depicting dismembered persons outside of a medical setting is prohibited by our Violent & Graphic Content policy” the memo says “the footage of the individuals is brief and appears to be in an awareness raising context posted by survivors of the rocket attack.”

The graphic violence exceptions are just a few of the many ways Meta has quickly adjusted its moderation practices to accommodate the Ukrainian resistance. At the outset of the invasion the company took the rare step of lifting speech restrictions around the Azov Battalion a neo-Nazi unit of the Ukrainian military previously banned under the company’s Dangerous Individuals and Organizations policy. In March Reuters reported that Meta temporarily permitted users to explicitly call for the death of Russian soldiers speech that would also normally violate the company’s rules.

Rights advocates emphasized that their grievance is not with added protections for Ukrainians but the absence of similar special steps to shield besieged civilians from Meta’s erratic censorship apparatus nearly everywhere else in the world.

“Human rights is not a cherry-picking exercise” said Fatafta. “It’s good they have taken such important measures for Ukraine but their failure to do so for Palestine emphasizes further their discriminatory approach to content moderation. It’s always been about geopolitics and profit for Meta.”

How exactly Meta decides which posts are celebrating gruesome wartime death and which are raising awareness of it is never explained in the company’s public overview of its speech rules or the internal material reviewed by The Intercept.

A January 2022 blog post from Meta notes that the company uses a “balancing test that weighs the public interest against the risk of harm” for content that would normally violate company rules but provides no information as to what that test actually entails or who conducts it. Whether an attempt to document atrocities or mourn a neighbor killed in an airstrike is deemed glorification or in the public interest is left to the subjective judgment calls of Meta’s overworked and sometimes traumatized content contractors tasked with making hundreds of such decisions every day.

Few would dispute that the images from Ukraine described in the Meta policy updates — documenting the Russian invasion — are newsworthy but the documents obtained by The Intercept show that Meta’s whitelisting of material sympathetic to Ukraine has extended even to graphic state propaganda.

The internal materials show that it has on multiple instances whitelisted Ukrainian state propaganda videos that highlight Russian violence against civilians including the emotionally charged “Close the Sky” film Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy presented to Congress in March. “Though the video depicting mutilated humans outside of a medical setting is prohibited by VGC policy the footage shared is in an awareness-raising context posted by the President of Ukraine” said a March 24 update distributed to moderators.

On May 13 moderators were told not to delete a video posted by the Ukrainian Defense Ministry that included graphic depictions of burnt corpses. “The video very briefly depicts an unidentified charred body lying on the floor” the update says. “Though video depicting charred or burning people is prohibited by our Violent & Graphic Content policy … the footage is brief and qualifies for a newsworthy exception as per OCP’s guidelines as it documents an on-going armed conflict.”

“Meta is replicating online some of the same power imbalances and rights abuses we see in the real world.”

The internal materials reviewed by The Intercept show no such interventions for Palestinians — no whitelisting of propaganda designed to raise sympathies for civilians or directives to use warnings instead of removing content depicting harm to civilians.

Critics pointed to the disparity to question why online speech about war crimes and human rights offenses committed against Europeans seems to warrant special protections while speech referring to abuses committed against others do not.

“Meta should respect the right for people to speak out whether in Ukraine or Palestine” said Shakir of Human Rights Watch. “By silencing many people arbitrarily and without explanation Meta is replicating online some of the same power imbalances and rights abuses we see in the real world.”

While Meta seems to side against allowing Palestinian civilians to keep graphic content online it has intervened in posting about the Israeli-Palestinian conflict to keep images live by siding with the occupying Israeli military. In one instance Meta took steps to ensure that a depiction of an attack against a member of the Israeli security forces in the occupied West Bank was kept up: “An Israeli Border Police officer was struck and lightly wounded by a Molotov cocktail during clashes with Palestinians in Hebron” an undated memo distributed to moderators reads. “We are making an exception for this particular content to Mark this video as Disturbing.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiW2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnJldXRlcnMuY29tL2xlZ2FsL21ldGFzLWZhY2Vib29rLWFncmVlcy1zZXR0bGUtZGF0YS1wcml2YWN5LWxhd3N1aXQtMjAyMi0wOC0yNi_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Meta's Facebook agrees to settle data privacy lawsuit,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with ('Connection aborted.', ConnectionResetError(10054, 'An existing connection was forcibly closed by the remote host', None, 10054, None)) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiW2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnJldXRlcnMuY29tL2xlZ2FsL21ldGFzLWZhY2Vib29rLWFncmVlcy1zZXR0bGUtZGF0YS1wcml2YWN5LWxhd3N1aXQtMjAyMi0wOC0yNi_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiigFodHRwczovL3d3dy5tYXJrZXR3YXRjaC5jb20vc3RvcnkvdGhpcy1zbWFsbC1sYXJnZWx5LXVua25vd24tYmFuZC1vZi1mYWNlYm9vay13b3JrZXJzLWlzLWluLXRoZS1taWRkbGUtb2YtYS1oZWF0ZWQtdW5pb24tZmlnaHQtMTE2NjE1NDI5OTTSAY4BaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cubWFya2V0d2F0Y2guY29tL2FtcC9zdG9yeS90aGlzLXNtYWxsLWxhcmdlbHktdW5rbm93bi1iYW5kLW9mLWZhY2Vib29rLXdvcmtlcnMtaXMtaW4tdGhlLW1pZGRsZS1vZi1hLWhlYXRlZC11bmlvbi1maWdodC0xMTY2MTU0Mjk5NA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Workers at Facebook fight to unionize,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 401 Client Error: HTTP Forbidden for url: https://www.marketwatch.com/story/this-small-largely-unknown-band-of-facebook-workers-is-in-the-middle-of-a-heated-union-fight-11661542994 on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiigFodHRwczovL3d3dy5tYXJrZXR3YXRjaC5jb20vc3RvcnkvdGhpcy1zbWFsbC1sYXJnZWx5LXVua25vd24tYmFuZC1vZi1mYWNlYm9vay13b3JrZXJzLWlzLWluLXRoZS1taWRkbGUtb2YtYS1oZWF0ZWQtdW5pb24tZmlnaHQtMTE2NjE1NDI5OTTSAY4BaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cubWFya2V0d2F0Y2guY29tL2FtcC9zdG9yeS90aGlzLXNtYWxsLWxhcmdlbHktdW5rbm93bi1iYW5kLW9mLWZhY2Vib29rLXdvcmtlcnMtaXMtaW4tdGhlLW1pZGRsZS1vZi1hLWhlYXRlZC11bmlvbi1maWdodC0xMTY2MTU0Mjk5NA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiaWh0dHBzOi8vZW5nbGlzaC5hbG1heWFkZWVuLm5ldC9uZXdzL3BvbGl0aWNzL2ZiLWRvdWJsZS1zdGFuZGFyZHM6LWlzcmFlbGktYXR0YWNrcy1jZW5zb3JlZC1ncmFwaGljLW90aGVyc9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,FB double standards: Israeli attacks censored graphic others allowed,"Internal memos reveal that Meta thought attacks on civilians in Ukraine were ""newsworthy"" while Israeli attacks were censored which led to accusations of double standards.

Palestinians believe they must practice self-censorship in order to remain on major platforms. (APA)

After the latest Israeli aggression earlier this month against the heavily populated Gaza Strip Palestinian users of Facebook and Instagram complained about the sudden removal of posts revealing the ensuing death and destruction.

Palestinian users of the two sizable social media sites which are both owned by the same parent firm Meta had previously complained about their posts being arbitrarily taken down.

It's becoming a pattern: Palestinians share sometimes graphic films and photographs of Israeli strikes then Meta quickly removes the content often with no explanation and only a passing mention of a breach of the company's ""Community Standards"".

However not all of Meta platforms' billion-plus users encounter these problems when recording the bombing of their communities.

The firm regularly ordered moderators to stray from standard practice and handle diverse graphic material from the Russia-Ukraine war with a light touch this year according to previously unreported policy language obtained by The Intercept.

Like other American internet businesses Meta swiftly implemented a slew of new policy carveouts in response to the military operation especially allowing Ukrainians to continue posting graphic photographs of the war on Facebook and Instagram.

No such exceptions were ever granted for Palestinian victims of Israeli state brutality and the sources don't indicate that any other suffering group was given a similar level of latitude.

“This is deliberate censorship of human rights documentation and the Palestinian narrative” said Mona Shtaya an advisor with 7amleh the Arab Center for the Advancement of Social Media a civil society group that formally collaborates with Meta on speech issues.

Gaza deemed not ""newsworthy""

Between August 5 and August 15 when ""Israel"" was attacking Gaza 7amleh counted approximately 90 deletions of information pertaining to bombings. It should be noted that reports of blocked content are still coming in.

""Their censorship works almost like clockwork – whenever violence on the ground escalates their takedown of Palestinian content soars"" said Marwa Fatafta Middle East North Africa policy manager for Access Now an international digital rights organization.

Examples of Palestinian content that has been censored that The Intercept has looked at include the removal on August 5 of a post lamenting the passing of Alaa Qadoum a five-year-old Palestinian girl killed by an Israeli missile strike as well as an Instagram video of Gazans recovering bodies from the rubble.

Meet Alaa Qadoum a 5-year-old brutally killed today by the Israeli occupation's shelling of the #Gaza Strip. Meet Alaa a girl yet to make it out of kindergarten. Meet Alaa a victim out of thousands of #Palestinian children murdered by the Israeli occupation.#GazaUnderAttack pic.twitter.com/PyDHHgAfgH — Al Mayadeen English (@MayadeenEnglish) August 5 2022

Both posts were deleted along with a notice stating that the imagery ""goes against our guidelines on violence or dangerous organizations"" — a reference to Meta's corporate policy against posting any content that promotes violence or information about its extensive list of prohibited individuals and organizations.

According to the Dangerous Individuals and Organizations policy these two posts were taken down Meta representative Erica Sackin told The Intercept. She was alluding to the organization's filtering of material that supported nationally sanctioned ""terrorist groups"".

Sackin did not respond to a follow-up question addressing the image of a man and a 5-year-old girl buried in debris's ""promotion of terrorism.""

Palestinian advocates speak up

Rights advocates told The Intercept that the exemptions made for the Russia-Ukraine war are the most recent instance of a double standard between Meta's treatment of Western markets and the rest of the world. This is proof of Meta's special treatment of the Ukrainian cause since the start of the war as well as something that can be seen with media coverage of the war more generally.

Meta’s public-facing Community Standards rulebook says “We remove content that glorifies violence or celebrates the suffering or humiliation of others because it may create an environment that discourages participation” — noting a vague exception for “graphic content (with some limitations) to help people raise awareness about these issues.” The Violent and Graphic Content policy places a blanket ban on gruesome videos of dead bodies and restricts the viewing of similar still images to adults 18 years and older.

The discrepancy was brought up by critics who questioned why online communication concerning crimes against humanity and war crimes done against Europeans seemed to require special protections but not speech about injustices committed against other people.

“Meta should respect the right for people to speak out whether in Ukraine or Palestine” said Shakir of Human Rights Watch. “By silencing many people arbitrarily and without explanation Meta is replicating online some of the same power imbalances and rights abuses we see in the real world.”

Meta has intervened in posts on the Israeli-Palestinian issue to keep photos live by siding with the occupying Israeli military even though it appears to be against enabling Palestinian civilians to maintain graphic content online.

In one instance Meta took steps to ensure that a depiction of an attack against a member of the Israeli security forces in the occupied West Bank was kept up: “An Israeli Border Police officer was struck and lightly wounded by a Molotov cocktail during clashes with Palestinians in Hebron (Al-Khalil)” an undated memo distributed to moderators reads. “We are making an exception for this particular content to Mark this video as Disturbing.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMifmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmlucXVpcmVyLmNvbS9idXNpbmVzcy90ZWNobm9sb2d5L2ZhY2Vib29rLW1ldGEtY2FtYnJpZGdlLWFuYWx5dGljYS1zZXR0bGVtZW50LXByaXZhY3ktdHJ1bXAtY2FtcGFpZ24tMjAyMjA4MjcuaHRtbNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Facebook parent Meta settles lawsuit in Cambridge Analytica privacy scandal,"Facebook's Meta logo sign is seen at the company headquarters in Menlo Park Calif. on Oct. 28 2021.

SAN FRANCISCO — Facebook’s corporate parent has reached a tentative settlement in a lawsuit alleging the world’s largest social network service allowed millions of its users’ personal information to be fed to Cambridge Analytica a firm that supported Donald Trump’s victorious presidential campaign in 2016.

Terms of the settlement reached by Meta Platforms the holding company for Facebook and Instagram weren't disclosed in court documents filed late Friday. The filing in San Francisco federal court requested a 60-day stay of the action while lawyers finalize the settlement. That timeline suggested further details could be disclosed by late October.

The accord was reached just a few weeks before a Sept. 20 deadline for Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg and his long-time chief operating officer Sheryl Sandberg to submit to depositions during the final phases of pre-trial evidence gathering according to court documents.

Zuckerberg who founded Facebook in 2004 as a Harvard University student could have been deposed for up to six hours. Sandberg who is stepping down as chief operating officer after a 14-year stint could have been questioned for up to five hours.

The case sprang from 2018 revelations that Cambridge Analytica a firm with ties to Trump political strategist Stephen Bannon had paid a Facebook app developer for access to the personal information of about 87 million Facebook users. That data was then used to target U.S. voters during the 2016 campaign that culminated in Trump's election as the 45th president.

The ensuring uproar led to a contrite Zuckerberg being grilled by lawmakers during a high-profile congressional hearing and spurred calls for people to delete their Facebook accounts. Even though Facebook's growth has stalled as more people connect and entertain themselves on rival services such as TikTok the social network still boasts about 2 billion users worldwide including nearly 200 million in the U.S. and Canada.

The lawsuit which had been seeking to be certified as a class action representing Facebook users had asserted the privacy breach proved Facebook is a “data broker and surveillance firm” as well as a social network."

Despite the financial success of the tour there’s been some bad luck. Originally Doja Cat was set to join The Weeknd on the North American leg but had to pull out due to throat surgery a merchandise trailer was engulfed in flames at the Las Vegas show and on the opening night of the tour a fan tragically fell to his death.

There are four remaining dates on the North American leg of the tour with shows in Glendale Arizona two shows in Inglewood California and a hometown show at Rogers Centre in Toronto Canada.

This was the MMA equivalent of the Champions League Final — the UFC champ versus the PRIDE titleholder — and the anticipation was incredible.

Relive All The Action On UFC Fight Pass!

Henderson was the better of the two early utilizing his wrestling in the clinch his control on the canvas and his ability to dictate the terms of engagement to neutralize Jackson’s striking power. But “Rampage” had some success in the first half of the second and third stung Henderson early in the fourth and closed things out by swarming the PRIDE champion.

Jackson won a unanimous decision to defend his UFC light heavyweight title and establish himself as the top light heavyweight in the world.

It was a Cirque du Sixteen experience for Savanna White at Aria on Friday night.

White’s dad Dana White presented another boffo on the Strip this one to celebrate his only daughter. The UFC president staged a splashy themed birthday fete renting out all of Jewel Nightclub for the evening.

“It was INSANE” White texted Sunday afternoon. “I’m so hungover.”

A knockout in party parlance.

As for the cost White did not furnish a specific outlay. But the party he threw for his son Aidan in 2018 exceeded $1 million. That event was also held at a fabulous Strip nightclub Drai’s at the Cromwell.

Performers through the evening included Lil Uzi Vert DaBaby Louis the Child and DJ MAKJ. The 300 invited guests were not told of the venue beforehand. Instead they were shuttled to the resort from an off-site location. Guests were invited to walk the purple carpet matching Savannah’s favorite color.

Assorted Las Vegas entertainers took up position as fans paparazzi and reporters (a few were good enough to work at a Vegas network affiliate TBH).

Social-media influencers Josh Richards and Bryce Hall made live appearances (the guys have a combined 14 million IG followers). Hall and White are shown throwing back Howler Head whiskey hence the hangover or “WhiteOver” in this case.

The birthday moment featured LED drummers costumed costumed dancers and a parade of 22 custom-designed birthday cakes.

The menu was created and catered by Aria restaurants. Available to those 300 guests were chipotle chicken soft tacos; queso fresco; watermelon cups; sliders; waffle; French fries and tater tots from the potato family; assorted sushi; macaroni and cheese; ramen noodles and rigatoni with marinara from Cub Noodle Bar; pizza seasoned and sauced chicken strips; a custom cereal gelato and float bar including cereal dipped sticks and chocolate-cereal rounds; shiitake mushrooms egg roles and pot stickers from the Blossom eatery; and spicy rigatoni Mario’s meatballs and tomato bread from Carbone.

All the event details were curated by Social Gal Events branding from Marc Friedland Inc. and talent furnished by Destinations By Design of Las Vegas.

White has been known to let it fly at Vegas previous Vegas parties. As we noted in 2018 he once hosted a circus-themed party complete with actual elephants (which ate a couple of trees and the cops were called). The UFC president also staged a pirate-themed party years ago at his former Tournament Hills at TPC Summerlin estate. That event was highlighted by a performance from the cast of the now-closed pirate show at Treasure Island.

Walk this way

Aerosmith posted its set list and those “suggestions” to add to that list for the band’s return to Dolby Live in September. Those on the list include “Back In The Saddle” “Love In an Elevator” “Dream On” “Sweet Emotion” and “Walk This Way.” Also being rehearsed are “Crazy” “Eat The Rich” “You See Me Crying” and “Janie’s Got a Gun.” Those three classics are not (yet) on the final cut and this is how you know you have a monster catalog.

Throw these names around …

Harry Styles and Bon Jovi. Why? They’re being brandied about as strong candidates to headline The MSG Sphere on the Strip. No confirmation or denial of U2’s reported plans to play multiple dates at the venue. That’s a strong start.

Styles is in a nine-show run through the end of September at Madison Square Garden. His manager Jeff Azoff is son of legendary manager Irving Azoff. The elder Azoff is Bon Jovi’s manager. His Azoff Music Entertainment company is a venture with the Madison Square Garden Company which is how this all ties together.

The MSG Sphere can use all the major headliners it can book. The 20000-capacity entertainment venue is due to open by the end of 2023. Officials have yet to formally announce any headliners.

You can get stories like this one straight to your inbox every Thursday morning by subscribing here.

A new microchip has been developed by researchers at Stanford that can quickly and accurately run a variety of AI applications directly on a device.

“Having those calculations done on the chip instead of sending information to and from the cloud could enable faster more secure cheaper and more scalable AI going into the future and give more people access to AI power” said co-senior author H.-S. Philip Wong.

The challenge

Most of today’s advanced AI systems do their processing “in the cloud” — if you ask a text-to-image AI to draw you a picture for example the request is sent to a data center for processing and the result is sent back to your smartphone or computer via the internet.

This might take anywhere from 10 seconds to a few minutes which is fine because you probably don’t need that image immediately. But what if the AI isn’t drawing pictures but monitoring your heart condition in real time using data from a fitness wearable?

“If all that information took several seconds or a minute to get processed somewhere else it’s useless.” Arun Mirchandani

When you need results in as close to real time as possible it’s better to have the AI do its processing directly on the device rather than sending data to the cloud — that approach is called “edge computing.”

“The real-time feedback loop required for things like remote monitoring of a patient’s heart and respiratory metrics is only possible with something like edge computing” Arun Mirchandani an advisor on healthcare digital transformation who wasn’t involved in the study told MIT Technology Review.

“If all that information took several seconds or a minute to get processed somewhere else it’s useless” he continued.

“The data movement issue is similar to spending eight hours in commute for a two-hour workday.” Weier Wan

Aside from faster results edge computing has the added benefit of increased privacy: If your health information never leaves your wearable you don’t have to worry about someone else intercepting it — or interfering with it — en route.

So why do we run these apps in the cloud instead of locally? The problem is that wireless devices have limited processing power and battery — to run a more advanced and energy-intensive AI program you may have to turn to huge servers in the cloud.

NeuRRAM

A Stanford-led team has now unveiled NeuRRAM a new microchip that could let us run advanced AI programs directly on our devices.

It works by eliminating one of the biggest energy sucks in microchips designed for AI applications: the transfer of data between the chip’s compute unit (where processing happens) and its memory unit (where data is stored).

“The data movement issue is similar to spending eight hours in commute for a two-hour workday” said lead researcher Weier Wan. “With our chip we are showing a technology to tackle this challenge.”

Instead of doing its AI processing in a dedicated unit NeuRRAM uses an emerging technology called “resistive random-access memory” (RRAM) to do its processing in the memory unit itself.

NeuRRAM is versatile accurate and twice as efficient as the best compute-in-memory devices.

This type of chip architecture is called “compute-in-memory” (CIM) and it’s been used in the past to make microchips more energy efficient. However that efficiency has traditionally come at the expense of processing power versatility and accuracy.

By innovating their chip’s design circuits and more the team overcame those limitations — NeuRRAM is twice as efficient as the best CIM devices supports a variety of AI applications and is as accurate as traditional chips at tasks such as letter recognition and image classification.

“Efficiency versatility and accuracy are all important aspects for broader adoption of the technology” said Wan. “But to realize them all at once is not simple. Co-optimizing the full stack from hardware to software is the key.”

“Such full-stack co-design is made possible with an international team of researchers with diverse expertise” added Wong.

Looking ahead

NeuRAMM is currently a proof-of-concept device and the team now plans to further develop it to handle more complicated AI applications.

According to Wong if the chips were mass produced their low cost small size versatility and energy efficiency could make them ideal for use in medical wearables — that could give the devices the ability to handle AI applications that are only possible with cloud computing today.

Healthcare is just one of many possible areas of disruption too — NeuRRAM and other CIM chips have “almost unlimited potential” according to Stanford’s press release.

One day these cutting-edge microchips might make VR and AR headsets sleeker with more capabilities and less latency or give search-and-rescue drones the ability to analyze footage in real time without draining their batteries as quickly.

They might even be used to help space rovers autonomously explore other planets — no need to wait minutes or hours for instructions to arrive from Earth.

He picked up most of his skills on the job – initially by working with experienced professionals and as he gained experience by attending industry seminars and workshops and gaining certifications.

When the pandemic brought construction activities to a grinding halt with a strict lockdown that lasted a few months his work came to a standstill but his learning didn’t.

Locked inside his home Thule turned to his smartphone and signed up for a digital certification course offered by Pidilite India’s leading company in specialty chemicals such as adhesives construction chemicals and sealants.

He earned the highest-level certification of a Champion Applicator for Dr. Fixit Pidilite’s waterproofing products and services brand. The certification validates the effort he put into upskilling himself and it also earns him business leads from Pidilite.

Shankar Thule a civil contractor upskills himself by logging on to Pidilite’s learning course on his smartphone.

Thule is among more than 14000 masons carpenters plumbers and civil contractors across the country who have leveraged certification courses designed by Pidilite and delivered online via Microsoft Community Training (MCT) platform.

MCT is an Azure-powered Massive Open Online Course (MOOC) platform for online learning. It enables anyone to connect to educational courses on any device connected to the internet.

When the pandemic struck one of the biggest challenges for Pidilite was how it could stay in touch with its user base and offer them help when construction sites and ancillary businesses had come to a grinding halt.

“Our sales happen when a carpenter civil contractor or plumber chooses to pick up one of our products from a construction supplies or hardware store” explains Mayur Danait the chief information officer at Pidilite Industries Ltd.

“If they don’t know how to use a product properly it affects the quality of their work which has a direct bearing on our brand reputation. So it is crucial for us to closely work with these customers to and educate them on the right product usage and application techniques.”

The pandemic necessitated Pidilite to move their training sessions which were earlier conducted face to face to an online platform.

“We were looking for a large-scale training and learning solution for the contractor and dealer community. Most of the platforms we came across are platform-centric and not community-centric” says Nishchai Nitin Nevrekar head of digital initiatives Pidilite.

After thorough market research Pidilite came across MCT and created a course on COVID-safety protocols to be followed by their end users. The positive response that the initial couple of courses received encouraged Pidilite to add more. Today there are over 25 courses on for various customers–from painters to contractors and even dealers.

Naresh D. Macha who is the training manager for Pidilite’s “small town India” division created most of these courses and says MCT solved problems of access and low bandwidth. The platform also enables learners to watch the courses at their convenience and they can revisit any course if required.

The pandemic-induced lockdown of 2020 led Pidilite to reimagine processes for employees as well. For Pidilite like thousands of organizations across the globe that embraced remote work at the beginning of the pandemic the first port of call was Microsoft Teams.

“We had seen the inherent potential in Teams to enable collaboration so we had been encouraging its usage (within Pidilite)” Danait recalls. “Of course the numbers were low earlier but they went through the roof after the lockdown was imposed.”

While the employees took to Microsoft Teams quite seamlessly for Danait the real exciting use of Teams was happening somewhere else.

As all field marketing initiatives also came to an abrupt halt the company decided to try moving its external meetings with their dealers and distributors to Teams as well.

“We did hundreds of meetings with our dealers and distributors via Teams at a time when we couldn’t meet them in person” Danait says. “We were encouraged by how this group of users whom we didn’t associate with being tech savvy earlier became quick adopters of something as sophisticated as Teams.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiNWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmluZm9xLmNvbS9uZXdzLzIwMjIvMDgvbWljcm9zb2Z0LWRldi1ib3gv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Microsoft Dev Box Now in Public Preview,"Azure recently announced the public preview of Microsoft Dev Box a workstation in the cloud targeted to developers. Integrated with Windows 365 the new service supports any developer IDE SDK or tool that runs on Windows and simplifies onboarding of new developers.

Announced in private preview at the Microsoft Build developer conference in May Microsoft Dev Box is an Azure service that provides developers with secure on-demand workstations for teams of any size. Anthony Cangialosi principal group PM of Visual Studio Core at Microsoft explains:

With Microsoft Dev Box developers can focus on writing the code only they can write instead of trying to get a working environment that can build and run the code. Dev boxes are ready-to-code and pre configured by the team with all the tools and settings developers need for their projects and tasks.

Source: https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/blog/announcing-microsoft-dev-box-preview/

Marius Sandbu cloud evangelist at Sopra Steria wrote an article on how to get started with Microsoft DevBox. He explains:

From an operations perspective it is a combination of the Windows 365 front-end portal where developers gain access to a self-service front-end to their virtual machines and the RDS components of Azure Virtual Desktop which means that it is running much of the same core components underneath.

David Rousset senior program manager at Microsoft and co-author of Babylon.js tweets:

Microsoft Dev Box will really help a lot with the onboarding of new developers in a team.

Sharing many features with Windows 365 and Azure Virtual Desktop the new service is aimed at developers providing a VDI desktop in Azure. According to the cloud provider the service supports any IDE SDK or tool that runs on Windows and developers can use it to build desktop mobile IoT and web applications. It supports building cross-platform apps using Windows Subsystem for Linux and Windows Subsystem for Android. Sandbu concludes:

So far being a preview it seems to be pretty solid and I like the way that they design the product however (...) I would like to define compute SKUs myself and not be bound to the resources that Microsoft have defined so it means that I’m bound to what Microsoft is showing in the Dev Box definition feature. GitHub CodeSpaces should also be a part of this or at least as an alternative feature.

Hibernation of a workstation is not yet available but should be added to the preview in the next few weeks. Microsoft Dev Box is available as a preview from the Azure Portal on a consumption-based compute and storage pricing model. During the public preview the first 15 hours of the Dev Box 8vCPU and 32 GB Memory SKU every month are free."

Moderna claims that Pfizer and BioNtech used the company’s patented mRNA technology in COVID-19 vaccines without Moderna’s permission.

Moderna alleges that before the pandemic they had over a decade of research on mRNA in coronaviruses with six different “mRNA candidates for infectious disease in clinical trials.” The company obtained various patents for its technology from 2011 to 2016. Then when the pandemic struck “Moderna answered the call” and quickly developed a COVID-19 vaccine based on its exiting technology.

Moderna claims that prior to the pandemic Pfizer and BioNtech had no existing mRNA vaccine technology. Yet when Pfizer and BioNtech presented vaccine candidates for testing “they decided to make the exact same chemical modification to their mRNA that Moderna scientists first developed years earlier.” In scientific terms Pfizer and BioNtech’s vaccine “uses the exact same 1-methylpseudouridine chemical modification in a lipid nanoparticle formulation as Moderna’s patented COVID-19 vaccine.”

Moderna only seeks damages for Pfizer’s sales that occurred after March 8 2022. During the pandemic Moderna voluntarily pledged not to enforce their “patents against those making vaccines intended to combat the pandemic.” The company “refrained from asserting its patents earlier so as not to distract from efforts to bring the pandemic to an end as quickly as possible.” However now that the vaccines are easily accessible to most people Moderna seeks compensation for the continued sales of Pfizer and BioNtech’s vaccine and booster shots.

Messenger RNA vaccines are the ones most used worldwide against COVID-19

US pharmaceutical company Moderna Friday sued Pfizer / BioNTech over patent ownership infringement regarding the COVID-19 RNA vaccine

Moderna is convinced that Pfizer and BioNTech's Comirnaty Covid-19 vaccine infringes on patents filed by Moderna between 2010 and 2016 covering Moderna's fundamental messenger RNA technology the company said in a statement.

The two companies were the first to manufacture coronavirus vaccines shortly after the start of the pandemic using messenger RNA technology which enables it to instruct human cells to make proteins present in the virus to accustom the immune system to recognize and neutralize it thus changing the technique used until then in the development of immunizers which were based on weakened or inactivated forms of the virus to train the body to defend itself.

Messenger RNA technology was the culmination of four decades of research that has overcome numerous hurdles. This groundbreaking technology was crucial to the development of Moderna's own messenger RNA vaccine Spikevax. Pfizer and BioNTech copied this technology without Moderna's permission to manufacture Comirnaty Moderna's statement added.

We believe that Pfizer and BioNTech unlawfully copied Moderna's inventions and they have continued to use them without permission Moderna Chief Legal Officer Shannon Thyme Klinger said in a statement.

The patent infringement lawsuits were filed in Massachusetts in the United States and in Düsseldorf in Germany. Moderna said it filed patents from 2010 to 2016 for its mRNA technology.

We are filing these lawsuits to protect the innovative mRNA technology platform that we pioneered invested billions of dollars in creating and patented during the decade preceding the COVID-19 pandemic Moderna CEO Stéphane Bancel said who also pointed out that the company was continuing to use this technology to develop treatments for influenza and HIV as well as for autoimmune and cardiovascular diseases and some rare forms of cancer.

Moderna does not want Comirnaty removed from the market but does want compensation the company said in a press release.

Pfizer denied Moderna's claims saying in a statement Friday that Comirnaty was based on BioNTech’s proprietary mRNA technology and developed by both BioNTech and Pfizer and insisted they would vigorously defend against the allegations of the lawsuit.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMihQFodHRwczovL3d3dy51c2F0b2RheS5jb20vc3RvcnkvbmV3cy9oZWFsdGgvMjAyMi8wOC8yNy9jb3ZpZC1uZXdzLW1vZGVybi1zdWVzLXBmaXplci1iaW9udGVjaC1wYXhsb3ZpZC1zdHVkeS1mYXVjaS1yZXRpcmVzLzc4ODM1MTkwMDEv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,COVID news: Modern sues Pfizer-BioNTech Paxlovid study Fauci retires,"Moderna is suing fellow vaccine developers Pfizer and German partner BioNTech for infringing on patents related to mRNA technology used in their COVID-19 vaccine the company announced Friday.

The Cambridge Massachusetts company claims Pfizer-BioNTech’s vaccine Comirnaty infringes on patents it filed between 2010 and 2016 according to a Moderna news release.

“We believe that Pfizer and BioNTech unlawfully copied Moderna’s inventions and they have continued to use them without permission” said Moderna chief legal officer Shannon Thyme Klinger.

Moderna alleges Pfizer and BioNtech copied two key features of the company’s patented technologies which they say are “critical to the success of mRNA vaccines.”

Pfizer spokeswoman Jerica Pitts said the companies were ""surprised by the litigation"" and plan to ""vigorously defend against the allegations of the lawsuit."" Their COVID-19 vaccine she said was based on BioNTech's proprietary mRNA technology.

Paxlovid showed no measurable benefit in adults 40 to 65 study says

Pfizer's COVID-19 pill Paxlovid appears to provide little or no benefit for certain adults while still reducing the risk of hospitalization and death for high-risk seniors according to a large study published Wednesday.

The results from a 109000-patient Israeli study are likely to renew questions about the U.S. government's use of Paxlovid which has become the go-to treatment for COVID-19 due to its at-home convenience. The Biden administration has spent more than $10 billion purchasing the drug and making it available at thousands of pharmacies through its test-and-treat initiative.

The researchers found that Paxlovid reduced hospitalizations among people 65 and older by roughly 75% when given shortly after infection. But people between the ages of 40 and 65 saw no measurable benefit according to the analysis of medical records.

A spokesman for Pfizer declined to comment on the results which were published in the New England Journal of Medicine.

Can we eradicate COVID? That’s a hard no according to Dr. Anthony Fauci

While Dr. Anthony Fauci who became both a reassuring and politically polarizing voice during the pandemic is retiring from public service in December he’s still got a lot to share.

In a wide-ranging interview with USA TODAY President Joe Biden's chief medical advisor and director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease says the world might be opening up again but that doesn’t mean the pandemic is behind us.

“I think that when you talk about new normal you have to focus predominantly on COVID” Fauci said. “We have the emergence of infectious diseases more often than people realize. Many of them are relatively insignificant at a global level.”

Fauci has spent his career studying emerging viruses and guiding America’s response to health crises like the HIV/AIDS epidemic in the 1980s and West Nile Virus.

“Could we actually eradicate SARS COV-2 the cause of COVID? I can tell you categorically the answer to that is going to be no” says Fauci. ""We've only eradicated from the face of the earth one significant pathogen and that's smallpox.""

Fauci says America’s best protection against COVID-19 is mass vaccination.

Pfizer says its COVID vaccines are 73% effective in children under 5

Pfizer’s COVID-19 vaccine was 73% effective in protecting children younger than 5 as omicron spread in the spring the company announced Tuesday.

Vaccinations for babies toddlers and preschoolers opened in the U.S. in June after months of delay. Health authorities authorized tot-sized vaccine doses made by Pfizer and BioNTech based on a study showing they were safe and produced high levels of virus-fighting antibodies. But there was only preliminary data on how that translated into effectiveness against symptomatic COVID-19.

The new study analyzed COVID-19 diagnoses between March and June in Pfizer’s ongoing study of the three-dose vaccine. There were 21 COVID-19 cases among the 351 tots who got dummy shots — compared to just 13 among the 794 youngsters given three vaccine doses.

The child cases primarily were caused by the BA.2 omicron version that was circulating in. Today another omicron relative BA.5 is causing most COVID-19 cases in the U.S. and much of the world.

Moderna alleges Pfizer-BioNTech without permission copied mRNA technology that Moderna had patented between 2010 and 2016 well before COVID-19 emerged

Moderna sued Pfizer and its German partner BioNTech on Friday August 26 for patent infringement in the development of the first COVID-19 vaccine approved in the United States alleging they copied technology that Moderna developed years before the pandemic.

The lawsuit which seeks undetermined monetary damages was filed in US District Court in Massachusetts. The suit also would be filed also in the Regional Court of Duesseldorf in Germany Moderna said in a news release.

“We are filing these lawsuits to protect the innovative mRNA technology platform that we pioneered invested billions of dollars in creating and patented during the decade preceding the COVID-19 pandemic” Moderna chief executive Stephane Bancel said in the news release.

Moderna on its own and the partnership of Pfizer and BioNTech SE were two of the first groups to develop a vaccine for the novel coronavirus leading to a revenue windfall.

The US Food and Drug Administration granted emergency use authorization for the COVID-19 vaccine first to Pfizer-BioNTech in December 2020 then one week later to Moderna.

Moderna’s COVID-19 vaccine – its lone commercial product – has brought in $10.4 billion in revenue this year while Pfizer’s vaccine brought in about $22 billion.

Pfizer said the company was confident in its intellectual property and would vigorously defend against the allegations.

“We are surprised by the litigation given the COVID-19 vaccine was based on BioNTech’s proprietary mRNA technology and developed by both BioNTech and Pfizer” a Pfizer spokesperson said in an emailed statement.

BioNTech called the lawsuit “unfortunate” and declared its work was original.

“We will vigorously defend against all allegations of patent infringement” the company said in a statement.

Just a decade old Moderna based in Cambridge Massachusetts had been an innovator in the messenger RNA (mRNA) vaccine technology that enabled the unprecedented speed in developing the COVID-19 vaccine.

An approval process that previously took years was completed in months thanks largely to the breakthrough in mRNA vaccines which teach human cells how to make a protein that will trigger an immune response.

BioNTech had also been working in this field when it partnered with the US pharma giant Pfizer.

Moderna alleges Pfizer-BioNTech without permission copied mRNA technology that Moderna had patented between 2010 and 2016 well before COVID-19 emerged in 2019 and exploded into global consciousness in early 2020.

Moderna said its lawsuit was not meant to stop people from getting vaccines and it repeated its pledge to never enforce its COVID-19 patents in 92 low- and middle-income countries.

But Moderna said it did expect companies such as Pfizer and BioNTech to respect its intellectual property rights and it is seeking royalty payments based on sales after March 8 2022 and excluding sales to the US government or to low-income countries.

Lengthy dispute expected

If it ultimately prevails the royalty in such cases is usually a “high single digit” percentage of sales according to Jacob Sherkow a University of Illinois College of Law professor who specializes in biotech intellectual property issues.

Wall Street analysts expect the dispute to take years.

Jorge Contreras a professor at the University of Utah College of Law said that Moderna was reversing course on its public commitment that it would not enforce the patents.

“You can’t just take it back because you’ve decided you’d like to make some more money” Contreras said.

Sherkow said Pfizer could argue that the court should hold the company to that pledge though added there were few if any legal precedents on whether it could be enforced.

Patent litigation is not uncommon in the early stages of new technology.

Pfizer and BioNTech are already facing multiple lawsuits from other companies who say the partnership’s vaccine infringes on their patents.

In Friday’s statement Moderna said Pfizer-BioNTech appropriated two types of intellectual property.

One involved an mRNA structure that Moderna says its scientists began developing in 2010 and were the first to validate in human trials in 2015.

“Pfizer and BioNTech took four different vaccine candidates into clinical testing which included options that would have steered clear of Moderna’s innovative path. Pfizer and BioNTech however ultimately decided to proceed with a vaccine that has the same exact mRNA chemical modification to its vaccine” Moderna said.

The second alleged infringement involves the coding of a full-length spike protein that Moderna says its scientists developed while creating a vaccine for the coronavirus that causes Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS).

Although the MERS vaccine never went to market its development helped Moderna rapidly roll out its COVID-19 vaccine.

Pfizer shares were down 2% in Friday afternoon trade while Moderna was off 3.3%. BioNTech’s American shares were down 3% after its German stock closed 1.6% lower. – Rappler.com"

The companies analysed included Unilever NASCON UACN Nestle International Breweries Dangote Sugar Nigerian Breweries and Cadbury.

In May 2022 the Central Bank of Nigeria raised the Monetary Policy Rate(MPR) by 150 basis points to 13 percent and later by another 100 basis points to 14 percent in July. Consequently financial institutions repriced their assets and increased their lending rates.

“FMCGs borrowing will be costlier because the monetary policy rate should be the benchmark lending rate and banks won’t lend money below 14 percent. MPR would affect their financial cost and would cause further pressure on their profitability” Ayodeji Ajilore an investment research analyst with ARM Securities said.

“MPR usually increases the cost of borrowing and could also mean FMCGs will get more finance income if they have a decent cash flow position where the interest rate is rising” he added.

The cash flow from financing activities recorded by the firms’ financial books revealed that majority repaid principals and interests in the first half of 2022.

According to a report by Cordros Securities on the Nigerian consumer goods sector some companies have implemented substantial price increases to cushion the impact of currency depreciation on margins especially food staples producers who implemented more robust price increases due to the essential nature of their products with some of those products having price inelastic demand.

The report also stated “industry players will continue to grapple with the high costs of operations consequently we expect the price hikes to spur revenue growth and support earnings in 2022 although we remain cautious about the weak demand as consumers down trade or opt for cheaper substitutes.”

BusinessDay analysis of Unilever NASCON UAC of Nigeria Nestle International Breweries Dangote Sugar Nigerian Breweries and Cadbury financial books revealed their cumulative net finance costs were N45.11 billion in the first half of this year from N30.76 billion in the half year of 2021.

The fundamental principle in investing is the higher the risk the higher the reward potential. That's what makes stocks so appealing to many people. Stocks are one of the riskier investments because there are no guaranteed returns and there's always a chance your investment goes to $0. Yet there is also unlimited return potential with stocks. Just ask investors in Monster Beverage (MNST 0.47%). A $10000 investment in the company in August 1995 would be worth over $44 million as of Aug. 23 2022.

You should never make an investment expecting that type of once-in-a-generation return but it also doesn't require that. Even $10000 invested into the S&P 500 20 years ago would be worth over $35000 today. (The S&P 500 tracks the 500 largest public U.S. companies and is often used to gauge the stock market's health.)

Investing in stocks isn't just something people do when they have extra money lying around to play with. It's something people do out of necessity to prepare for retirement. If you're young (under 40 years old for the article's sake) stocks are where your focus needs to be.

Life isn't much cheaper when you retire

The unfortunate truth is that retirement isn't cheap and it's showing no signs of getting any cheaper anytime soon (if ever). Just look at healthcare one of the biggest expenses retirees face. According to Fidelity the average retired couple age 65 in 2022 will need roughly $315000 saved for health expenses. If you're a young investor this doesn't necessarily mean it'll be that expensive by the time you retire. But considering that from 1970 to 2020 U.S. healthcare spending went from $74.1 billion to $4.1 trillion there's no reason to believe you should prepare for less.

Healthcare is just one part of the equation too.

Conventional investment wisdom tells us you should plan to have 80% of your pre-retirement annual income in retirement to maintain your current lifestyle. If we follow that rule here's how much someone should plan to have annually in retirement:

Current Annual Income Annual Income Needed in Retirement Total Needed for 20 Years $60000 $48000 $960000 $80000 $64000 $1.28 million $100000 $80000 $1.60 million $150000 $120000 $2.40 million $200000 $160000 $3.20 million

Even if we take a basic approach of ""you'll need $X each year for 20 years"" many people will need well over $1 million saved. And this is on the lower end because you should increase your annual withdrawal to keep up with inflation each year. In addition many people will live well past 20 years into retirement.

Bonds probably won't get the job done

To get to the amount you'll likely need for retirement strictly saving in a traditional savings account won't do it. Neither will bonds. Bonds may be safer investments than stocks because the returns are guaranteed (although bond issuers can default on them) but their relatively low returns make them not-so-ideal for younger investors who need to focus on growing their money.

Suppose you invested $10000 into a 30-year bond with a 4% annual coupon rate (the amount paid in yearly interest). Assuming you reinvested the bi-annual coupon payments the investment would be worth over $32800 after 30 years. Compare that to a $10000 investment into an S&P 500 index fund where the average long-term annual return is around 10%. After 30 years $10000 would be worth over $174000.

Making any money on an investment is a good thing but you also have to consider the end goal: living financially secure in retirement. This means putting bonds on the back burner for a while and focusing on stocks until you near retirement.

Adjust with age

Bonds undoubtedly have their place in investing -- just not so much when you're young. For someone younger than 40 it makes sense for your investment portfolio to be in all stocks because stocks give you the highest chance of growing your money. You're also at the age when bear markets and other down periods in the stock market won't derail your retirement plans because you will more than likely have time to recover.

As you age and near retirement you'll want to begin slowly but surely shifting your focus from growing your money to preserving what you've made and that's when bonds will serve you best. Until then enjoy the benefit of time because it's the greatest tool investors have in creating wealth.",,,,,,,,,,,,

Amid a prolonged fight against rising prices and a looming economic downturn it's a tough world right now for investors.

The Federal Reserve's hardline stance against inflation at Friday's Jackson Hole meeting sent stocks tumbling finishing off a rally that began in mid-June. Fears around heightened uncertainty and a potential recession also solidified as the Cboe Volatility Index (VIX) a traditional measure of market volatility spiked upwards.

When realizing gains is as difficult as it is right now Morgan Stanley's Vintage Values list comes as a welcome respite. The list published annually provides a selection of the firm's top equity recommendations for a one-year buy-and-hold investment horizon.

""In compiling the list our stock-selection framework blended our analysts' fundamental views with quantitative analysis"" wrote a team of analysts led by Morgan Stanley Chief Investment Officer and Chief US Equity Strategist Mike Wilson in the report published on August 24.

Last year's Vintage Values list which covered August 2021 to August 2022 outperformed the S&P 500 index by 100 basis points. Of the 50 stocks recommended this year by Morgan Stanley's North America analysts only the top 15 were included in the list.

To narrow down the selection each of the suggested stocks were extensively assessed to screen its ""macro exposure industry positioning valuation and risk-reward profile paying particular attention to the skew of the analysts' bull- and bear-case valuation estimates"" Wilson explained.

Next the stocks were cross-checked for their quantitative quality and environmental social and governance scores. To narrow down the final 15 the list was considered against Wilson's high-level equity sector allocations so that its weightings would match his current positioning which includes an overweight position in the healthcare and real estate sectors.

Morgan Stanley's top 15 stocks to buy and hold over the next 12 months

On the topline Morgan Stanley's Vintage Values list prefers high-quality stocks. With the average stock on the list trading 11% more expensive than the market on forward price-to-earnings ratios and 17% more expensive on price-to-sales ratios it may seem that the list of stocks is trading at a premium.

But according to Wilson the list is ""materially less expensive"" than the market when accounting for key cash flow-based valuation measures like the enterprise value-to-operating cash flow and also carries a more attractive free cash flow yield of 5% versus the market's 4.7%. And with relative earnings revisions for the overall market taking a nosedive Wilson pointed out that the Vintage Values list has a ""far superior"" positive revisions profile versus the S&P 500's negative 3-month smoothed revisions.

The list is more tilted towards larger firms with 63% of its stocks classified as either large- or mega-cap said Wilson. He also pointed out that the list's average market capitalization of $211 billion is significantly above the S&P 500's average of $74 billion.

60% of the names on the list were growth stocks with 7% of firms falling into the value bucket and the remaining 33% belonging to neither investing style. This is well above the S&P 500's 39% growth stock weighting and well below its 25% value weighting Wilson noted.

Finally Wilson highlighted the fact that the Vintage Values list is marginally tilted more defensively than the overall market with 33% of its stocks classified as cyclical and 27% as defensive versus the S&P 500's respective weightings of 41% and 24%.

Friday November 11 11:30pm – 12am | Duffy Square Broadway & 46th St

We were delighted to present a special evening of live performance on Times Square’s most iconic plaza Duffy Square featuring a poetry reading by Zoë Buckman and musician Dave Guy of the Roots with musical accompaniment orchestrated by Guy and soul revival drummer Homer Steinweiss. The evening culminated with a presentation of November’s Midnight Moment MENDED displayed on 90+ surrounding billboards at 11:57pm—12am.

Pink handsewn petals and chain links; vintage linens stitched into boxing gloves — the dualities of tenderness and strength become kaleidoscopic refrains in MENDED by Zoë Buckman presented nightly in November across 90+ billboards in Times Square.

Through a multidisciplinary practice that includes sculpture public installations ceramics and photography Buckman takes a decidedly feminist approach in her exploration of identity trauma grief and empowerment. Often taking on gendered violence as subject matter the artist uses materials that ride the contradictions between soft and hard feminine and masculine intimacy and aggression. The visuals of her Midnight Moment weave together imagery and motifs found throughout her work - footage of boxing gloves domestic textiles metal chains and florals. Periodically abstracted and reconfigured into mesmerizing mandalas the resulting video takes us on a journey that mirrors the swing from chaos to focused introspection that often accompanies the various stages of grief.

MENDED is an adaptation of work originally created for Loss Tapes a collaborative digital series in which Buckman has continued her exploration of the varied qualities of grief and power in the female experience. The original iteration of the work features an accompanying score by Dave Guy and Homer Steinweiss whose rich tones of horns percussion and vintage synths infuse the escalating visual sequences with the feel of a victory march.

Midnight Moment is the world’s largest longest-running digital art exhibition synchronized on over 90 electronic billboards throughout Times Square nightly from 11:57pm to midnight. This year Times Square Arts is celebrating the ten year anniversary of the Midnight Moment series with a roster of all women and femme-expansive artists until April 2023.

For instance a Rolex GMT-Master ref. 1675 would cost you $1450 in 1986 which would be $3920 when adjusting for inflation today. In 2022?

So yes by the time the new millennium had rolled around Rolex was already rolling deep in the luxury camp. At the same time Omega IWC Breitling and many other mainstream watchmakers were in the process of doubling down on in-house movement production in order to raise their prices (often quite substantially) and to attain a whole new level of ""prestige.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJubmJsb29tYmVyZy5jYS9zb3V0aC1rb3JlYS1pbnNwZWN0cy1tb3JnYW4tc3RhbmxleS1vdmVyLXNob3J0LXNhbGVzLW9uLXN0b2Nrcy0xLjE4MTE3MTfSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,South Korea Inspects Morgan Stanley Over Short Sales on Stocks,"(Bloomberg) -- Morgan Stanley’s stock short selling practices are being inspected by South Korea as part of a broader effort by the nation’s financial watchdog to clamp down on bets against equities according to a person familiar with the matter.

The Financial Supervisory Service also plans to examine Bank of America Merrill Lynch over how it conducts stock short sales said the person who asked not to be identified because they can’t comment on an ongoing probe. Morgan Stanley was picked due to the New York-based bank’s big influence in the market the person said.

A Morgan Stanley spokesperson declined to comment as did Bank of America spokesman Mark Tsang.

South Korea restricts some types of short-selling activities even after doing away with most curbs in May 2021 and allowing investors to sell borrowed shares on the Kospi 200 Index and the small-cap Kosdaq 150. Stocks on the two indexes represent almost 90% of Kospi’s market value. The nation introduced a ban in early 2020 to tame markets hit by the pandemic.

Foreign investors accounted for about 70% of short selling by trade on the benchmark Kospi in August according to Korea Exchange data. Morgan Stanley is the biggest short seller in South Korea accounting for about 18%.

FSS Governor Lee Bokhyun said in a meeting Monday that the nation will set up a team to investigate stock short selling to root out illegal and unfair trades. Since prosecutor-turned-president Yoon Suk Yeol took office earlier this year authorities have increased their calls to stamp out naked short sales a practice of selling stocks without borrowing them first and other types of illegal short selling.

In 2018 Goldman Sachs International was fined 7.5 billion won ($5.5 million) for selling 156 Korean stocks without borrowing the securities as required by law which the bank said was an error by a company employee.

The inspection was earlier reported by MoneyToday.

Here are 3 that exist on the US stock market,"In India the government is solely responsible to look after and maintain all jails in the country. But in the US the government enters into contracts with private companies that build and manage prisons privately. Since these companies are listed on the stock exchange their stocks are called 'prison stocks' and this is how these companies work.

Prison stocks are stocks of those companies that own and operate private prisons and jail detention facilities. The US government enters into contracts with these private companies to house arrested residents and immigrants. These companies own properties provide prison management facilities in their properties and even manage some government prison facilities.

How did this concept come into being? In the 1980s 750000 people were incarcerated in America and by 1997 the number rose to 17 lakh. This started when the US arrested a record number of people to stop drug crimes. But as the prison population grew so did the costs of operating them. From the 1980s to 1997 the cost of operating prisons went up from Rs 24 crore to 143 crores. Since prisons became overcrowded the government encouraged private players with the idea that private companies could build prisons faster and could also provide better facilities.

How do private prisons work? Private companies enter into contracts with the US government based on which the government pays a per bed cost to the companies for every inmate that is housed on their premises. The business model of private prison stocks includes:

Building and managing buildings

Securing government contracts

Charging a daily fee for each bed filled

The profitability of private prisons depends on the number of facilities they provide and the number of inmates they house. The more the better.

Does the US leadership influence prison stocks? Yes. The perception is that US prison stocks don't do well when the US President is a Democrat. This perception began when former US President Barack Obama announced that his government would be ending contracts with private prisons which caused prison stock prices to fall.

When the Presidential elections debates between Trump and Clinton were on prison stocks were constantly trading at low prices since many expected Clinton to win. But when Trump won the elections share prices of prison stocks zoomed.

Prison stocks then remained at a high because the Trump administration's policies profited the prison industry. Trump's policies detained thousands of immigrants and imposed hard immigration policies like family separation. (Private prisons did not hold children of the detained families but only held parents). During Trump's administration the popularity of private prisons even among the Democrats fell. There was a public backlash that led 9 banks like JP Morgan to announce divestment from the prison industry. When Joe Biden won the Presidential elections prison stocks fell again.

Even if you don't frequently use subtitles you may start after hearing this: You can change the color and font of your subtitles. But first thing's first: How do you get them to even show up? The answer depends on what type of device you're using to watch Netflix.

On your mobile phone tablet or computer once you've selected a TV show or movie on Netflix click the screen to get to the navigation menu.

If you're watching Netflix on your smart TV Blu-ray player set-top box gaming system or streaming media player you'll press the up or down arrow on your remote.

If you're watching on Apple TV depending on which generation you have you'll need to hold down the center button on your remote or swipe down on the remote.

Then at the top or bottom of the screen click on the text icon (Audio and Subtitles) to switch the subtitles on or off. This is also where you select the language. On TVs you may see language options at the bottom of the screen without having to select the icon.

Customize Your Netflix Subtitles Settings

Now customizing the subtitle appearance is a little hidden.

On a web browser once you've logged into your Netflix account go to your account settings. From the ""Profile and Parental Controls"" area select a profile. Then scroll down to ""Subtitle appearance"" and click ""Change"" to alter the color font text size and whether or not you want your subtitles in a colored box.

You can do a lot with these options like for instance this gross combination of colors and a font that's scarily close to Comic Sans.

Netflix

As you can see you've got some major freedom when it comes to personalizing your subtitle experience. They've even got a cursive font if you're feeling extra fancy.

Netflix notes that the ""Subtitle appearance"" option isn't available in some countries with these primary languages (even if your profile is set to a different language): Arabic Hebrew Japanese Korean Romanian Thai and Traditional Chinese. Also appearance options may not show up if you're watching Netflix on an older device.

“Hello sir” greets a grocery store worker giving out samples. “Would you like to try some chocolate hummus?”

“The f-ck you just say to me?” Mo asks incredulous. “Did you say chocolate hummus? “Do you know what you just did? You just insulted my grandmother. Yeah. ‘F-ck your lineage. To hell with your culture.’”

“Lo siento” says the worker completely serious. “I did not know that hummus was Mexican.”

For a comedy filled with such side-splitting scenes Mo is chock-full of drama—and for that matter trauma: Mo the character navigates the shooting a subsequent addiction to lean (a codeine-based drink) and the struggles of navigating the U.S. immigration system as an asylum seeker. The show billed as a semi-autobiographical dramedy follows Mo’s trials and tribulations in Alief the Houston suburb where his family originally from Palestine has settled down after initially living in Kuwait. Mo blurs the line between fiction and reality with much of its plot sourced directly from Amer’s life. Born in Kuwait to Palestinian parents Amer and his family fled and moved to the U.S. during the first Gulf War.

“Although it’s a comedy you’ve got to lean into the tragedy” Amer tells TIME. “You’ve got to let it breathe and can’t shy away from it. Because it is a tragic story.”

Mo feeds the grocery store worker a piece of pita dipped in his mother's homemade olive oil. Rebecca Brenneman—Netflix

The stand-up comedian and actor 41 navigates his life this way. When Amer is sad he makes sure to sit in that emotion and to feel it fully. When a situation is funny he makes it hilarious giving each emotion its due.

Amer—who co-wrote created and starred in Mo—previously filmed two comedy specials for Netflix: 2018’s Mo Amer: The Vagabond and Mo Amer: Mohammed in Texas in 2021. Both specials brim with an almost palpable anxiety an issue Amer didn’t realize he dealt with until the pandemic hit in 2020. Mo unfurls in this space the gray area of anxiety where things can be so funny—and so tragic at once.

“I feel so at home and in the pocket when I’m creating something and channeling that energy” Amer said. “And making comedy out of it is such a relief. It’s a natural relief.”

Many scenes in Mo deal with the challenges of making it forward as an immigrant and the ever-shifting concept of home. The third episode of Mo opens on a flashback: a lush hillside in Burin Palestine zooming in on a white brick house with red awnings—it is in fact Amer’s grandparents’ house. Later in the episode a lawyer lets slip to Mo that his family’s asylum claim to live in the U.S. is based on the fact that his father was tortured which deeply shakes him. The scene is based on real experiences—something Amer hasn’t shared openly until now.

While filming the scene Amer realized that he had never cried about the realization in his real life or processed the pain his father went through. It felt beyond weird he said to show a genuine breakdown on camera for the world to experience alongside him—but it also proved the healing power of art.

“There’s a lot of real things in the show you can’t write” he said. “You could sit for 10 years 20 years and you won’t think of something as good as that. It’s just not going to happen. So when it’s there for you and it’s so good already you just use it.”

Other instances though—like Mo’s addiction to lean—are pure fiction. But to Amer it never really felt like toggling between acting or not. Rather his approach revolved around feeling “in touch.”

“I have a sensitive antenna” he says. “I can feel another person’s energy really quickly. So that lends itself really well for me in acting in the show—or anything I do in front of the camera.”

In the video interview he wore a silver necklace he designed that says “Mo” in Arabic. It’s also shaped to look like a key a symbol of deep importance to Palestinians that represents the right to return to their homes. Amer hopes Mo humanizes his land and its people. The character of his mother (played by Farah Bsieso) simultaneously pines for home and puts down roots eventually starting her own olive oil business with Mo’s brother Sameer who has autism spectrum disorder (played to lovable perfection by Omar Elba.) Mo’s sister (Cherien Dabis) on the other hand has assimilated to the point of estrangement from her family marrying a Canadian and raising a son between cultures.

So I finished Mo on Netflix. This is one of the funniest most emotional most thoughtful and most nuanced shows out. Going to share some initial thoughts in a short thread 🧵



TL;DR I feel really seen and I think the community will feel the same. #MoSeriesNetflix — Danny Hajjar داني حجار (@DanielGHajjar) August 24 2022

“The bulk of it is about belonging: feeling seen as equal to the human that’s next to you” Amer said. “And I think that for so many years Palestinians—if not Arabs and Muslims—have been so faceless in entertainment.”

Amer references the documentary Reel Bad Arabs—an extension of a book of the same name by Jack Shaheen—which details the history of how Hollywood has vilified Arabs throughout the ages. For him Mo is a chance to turn the tide of representation through the lens of one authentic dysfunctional beautiful Palestinian family.

The first three titles to stream debut Sept. 1 and include Ouran High School Host Club Claymore and the first 38 episodes of Hunter X Hunter. The other titles included are Death Note Death Note: Relight 1 and Death Note: Relight 2 From Me to You From Me to You S2 Berserk Parasyte: The Maxim Nana Hajime No Ippo: The Fighting! and Monster.

The nonexclusive agreement is the latest in a series of deals between Netflix and Nippon TV. Previously the streamer launched Nippon’s Old Enough! to stream worldwide.

Netflix has aggressively pushed into the anime space in recent years signing several content agreements with Japan’s biggest entertainment companies. The company claims that half of its estimated 222 million subscribers watched some anime on its service in 2021.

During the AnimeJapan convention in Tokyo in April Netflix revealed that it would launch 40 new anime titles spanning a growing range of genres in 2022 alone."

I had been up all night finishing the cards that we would use on the desk and the anchors would use on-air for quick reference guides on each race. They all had to be perfect (they still weren’t) but I couldn’t make my colleagues look foolish quoting my bad data. Plus these were the five-inch by eight-inch little life rafts that I could hold on to as I tried to run the rapids of the many many calls we were going to have to make that night. How many Republican votes in 2004 in Ozaukee County? When did the incumbent win his first term? What did the last polls say? Didn’t her husband used to have that seat?

After four straight days and nights of data obsession and rehearsals I had to now appear to be a normal human in front of a room full of New Yorkers to whom I assume I appeared to be a sweaty bumpkin.

By the way TV networks rehearse election nights with dummy numbers. The Decision Desk makes calls based on the pretend results to simulate the workflow and pinch points of the big night. If you’re making 100 calls the hours between 9 p.m. and 11 p.m. are bound to be chaotic. Then the election night team uses the practice calls to test the graphics lighting anchor and guest positions and communications. After six cycles of working with that crew at Fox we really learned how to make it hum by the end of my time at the network. But in 2010 I was clueless.

In this Sept. 29 2006 photo former Fox News CEO Roger Ailes poses at Fox News in New York. | Jim Cooper/AP Photo

So there I was exhausted tweaking on taurine and looking around the room at people who had been with the company from the beginning. I was feeling very self-conscious. There was even one guy who dyed the temples of his hair white like Paulie Walnuts from The Sopranos. The smell of aftershave and coffee was making me queasy. But I was the only one feeling that way.

The mood was jocular and Ailes was having fun doing what he liked best in the world: busting balls. The language of Fox News in those days was definitely locker-room swagger. Men and women alike tried to match Ailes’s tough-guy energy. His top lieutenant Bill Shine carried it off perfectly. He grew up on Long Island the son of a police officer. Shine didn’t talk too much but he made the words count. And like Ailes he never missed a chance to crack on someone usually in an avuncular way. Razzing people over their teams their neighborhoods or whatever was at hand was the language of belonging on Ailes’s crew. Bill O’Reilly was the avatar for these folks: suburban New York Roman Catholic traditional values but not necessarily socially conservative — the New York Post not the New York Times.

I was definitely out of place. I had never been to New York as an adult until I started going up for Fox. I knew about as much about the TV business as a horse knows about making a saddle. It’s possible I was wearing a bow tie. As the execs went around the table offering the boss their updates I rehearsed my lines in my head. Sammon teed me up and I started racing through time zones and expected times for calls and generic ballot trends until Ailes interrupted to say “What’s your number?”

The number of course was how many seats I forecast Republicans to win that night. “Our best guess is 64 seats sir.” Ailes mouth set like a bulldog and eyes staring through the back of my head said “Dick Morris says it could be one hundred. Why is yours so low?”

I figured Ailes a smart man knew that Morris a network contributor at the time was a joke. Morris had not yet reached the comic heights in his pronouncements that he would in 2012 and beyond but the former Clinton advisor turned Republican Pollyanna was already pretty clearly making stuff up.

In 1874 after Republicans lost the whole South at the end of Reconstruction and during a financial panic and with a scandal-plagued GOP administration in the White House they lost 96 seats. Obamacare was unpopular and all but there just weren’t enough competitive seats on the post-1994 map to make such a number possible.

Morris said goofy stuff like that I assumed because it got him on TV. Sean Hannity in particular would bring Morris on to say that the red wave was a Krakatoa-sized tsunami that would change politics forever. They and some other analysts who I previously thought were more principled and smarter than Morris used the same routine for the 2012 presidential election. That time they made preposterous claims not only that Mitt Romney was obviously going to win but that it would be by a landslide. The best I could say for Romney in that cycle was that he had a path to a narrow victory by picking off a couple of Blue Wall states if he could turn things around in Ohio where he had been sucking wind all summer. But a landslide? Pish posh.

That 100-seat number in 2010 was just hype to juice ratings and Ailes had to know that. Right? He was messing with the new guy. Right?

But I wasn’t sure. I didn’t say what I thought: Morris is feasting on the carcass of journalism like a lamprey eel on a dead nurse shark. But maybe Ailes believed the hype. I instead carefully explained how I had worked with the all-stars in our then-great Brainroom to check every seat and every estimate to make sure we were on the money. Ailes left me with “You’d better hope you’re right ...” and I walked out in the herd of suits in a haze.

I had just disputed the maximum leader of Fox News and talked down Republican chances in a room full of people flying high on the thought of a ratings bonanza. I would eventually learn to say what I was thinking lampreys and all. It served you better with Ailes who in those days appreciated honest disagreement on his team. It was partly his scorpions-in-a-bottle management style but also that he genuinely seemed to think it was better to air out disagreements. Bust balls or be busted.

I sat on those House races like a mother hen all night until we were able to make the call for the 64th net pickup for Republicans sometime in the wee small hours. We hit the number right on the screws and I had delivered on my called shot in the boardroom. I rode adrenaline through a day and a night of on-air hits and then slept the whole way home on the train.

The lesson I learned was that Hannity Morris and the rest of the crew of the crimson tide were certainly engaging in wishful thinking but certainly also motivated reasoning. The story they were telling was good for ratings or the frequency of their appearances. They wanted it to be true because they wanted Republicans to win but keeping viewers keyed up about the epochal victory close at hand was an appealing incentive to exaggerate the GOP chances. It was good for them to raise expectations but it wasn’t good for the party they were rooting for.

Early in an election cycle crafty partisans want to play up their side’s chances. It helps their candidate recruitment and fundraising and may lead vulnerable incumbents on the other side to just go ahead and retire. But at the end of a cycle the preferred message whenever possible should be that the race is tight-tight-tight — every vote could be the winning vote so don’t forget to cast your ballot. Ask Hillary Clinton how overconfidence can depress turnout as marginal voters opt to stay home. It occurred to me in 2010 and was confirmed to me in 2012 that despite all that Fox’s detractors said about the network being a mouthpiece for the Republican Party the two organizations had fundamentally different aims.

Good politics is often bad TV. As much as we rightly lament the decline of the American electorate’s aspirations and expectations at least a plurality of voters still clearly prefer competency cooperation and decency. And what could be more boring than that?

As a journalist I believe that what is wrong with my vocation and the industry in which I work is harming Americans left right and center. Major players in the news business are abusing their privileges and shirking their duties and we all pay the price. The agenda at many outlets is to move away from even aspirational fairness and balance and toward shared anger and the powerful emotional connections it can create.

Unable to sell large diverse audiences to advertisers news outlets increasingly focus on developing highly habituated users. To cultivate the kind of intense readers viewers or listeners necessary to make the addiction model profitable media companies need consumers to have strong feelings. Fear resentment and anger work wonders. It helps news outlets create deep emotional connections to users not just as users of a product but as members of the same tribe.

Reporters increasingly disdain the old virtues of fairness and balance as “bothsidesism” reimagining the ancient vice of bias as something honorable. Opinion pages become more homogeneous. Story selections become more predictable. Most ominously post-journalism produces stifling groupthink inside news organizations and serious consequences for journalists who dissent.

What we think of as “bad news” can score like gangbusters if it is scary and anger-inducing. But news that is bad for your audience’s ideological in-groups is clickbait kryptonite. In such a competitive marketplace riling people up against the other side isn’t enough. You’ve also got to create a safe space for consumers to plop down and contentedly contemplate ads for beet-based nutrient powders reverse mortgages and copper underpants. If you challenge their assumptions or suggest that their avatars in the culture war are wrong or losing they may leave for competitors who offer more complete protection from harsh realities.

Despite a successful decade as politics editor at the Fox News Channel I got canned after very vocal and very online viewers — including the then-president of the United States — became furious when our Decision Desk was the first to project that Joe Biden would win the former GOP stronghold of Arizona in 2020. (A FOX News spokesperson at the time said the layoff was a part of post-election restructuring but would not comment specifically on Stirewalt’s role citing employee confidentiality.)

The call was the handwriting on the wall for Trump’s chances and it delighted Democrats almost as much as it infuriated MAGA land. Regardless of who won we were proud to have beaten the competition yet again and defended the title network promos had given us as “the best-in-class Decision Desk.”

But even in the four years since the previous presidential election Fox viewers had become even more accustomed to flattery and less willing to hear news that challenged their expectations. Me serving up green beans to viewers who had been spoon-fed ice cream sundaes for years came as a terrible shock to their systems.

When I went on-air in 2020 to defend the Decision Desk’s call that Joe Biden would win Arizona I was supremely confident. The Decision Desk team that director Arnon Mishkin had built was the best in the business. And we had better survey data than the competition thanks to our partnership with the Associated Press and the National Opinion Research Center.

The irony for Fox was that the call that so infuriated Trump and so many viewers was possible only because Rupert Murdoch had four years earlier yanked Fox out of the consortium of other networks paying for exit polls. He sure wasn’t wrong. The exit polls were bad and getting worse.

So Arnon & Company built a better mousetrap and that was even before we found out that the coronavirus pandemic would increase the share of mail-in ballots by as much as 50 percent. You can’t do an exit poll if nobody is exiting the polls so while our competitors were scrambling to put together a system to accommodate the change we had already tested our superior product in the 2018 midterms. It turned out to be a capability that the network would regret developing.

Amid the geyser of anger in the wake of the Arizona call Senator Kevin Cramer Republican of North Dakota called for my firing and accused me of a “cover-up.” Covering up what exactly? We didn’t have any ballots to count and we didn’t have any electoral votes to award. We were just some guys with a cool computer lots of polling data and a lot of nicotine gum and coffee. But if you’ve been living comfortably in the climate-controlled emotions of post-journalism when the real thing comes along it’s a shock to the system.

There are lots of books and articles that talk about how the news media is hurting select groups: Republicans or Democrats or populists or minority groups or the family or whatever suits you. But that kind of blame-casting just alienates us further replicating the core defect of the news media that critics are attacking. There is no trophy for being more harmed by our lazy alienating press.

We’re all losers in this one.

It was March 2020—the beginning of the pandemic—and so he called a government help line. He was told that he might have the coronavirus and that he should stay home. But without leaving the house for a test Hernández couldn’t get proof of his illness—and without that proof he had no excuse for not coming into work. A week after he got sick he said his company fired him. (The firm cited “insufficient” job performance as the motive.)

Alone and newly jobless during lockdown Hernández who was thirty-two at the time considered his life. He was an engineer with expertise in the automotive industry so finding a new position wouldn’t be difficult. But he didn’t want just any new job. He wanted to work for a company that treated workers decently. His girlfriend who lived in the Basque region of northern Spain suggested that he consider a position within a group of worker-owned coöperatives there called Mondragon.

The Mondragon Corporation as it’s known is a voluntary association of ninety-five autonomous coöperatives that differs radically from a conventional company. Each co-op’s highest-paid executive makes at most six times the salary of its lowest-paid employee. There are no outside shareholders; instead after a temporary contract new workers who have proved themselves may become member-owners of their co-ops. A managing director acts as a kind of C.E.O. within each co-op but the members themselves vote on many vital decisions about strategy salaries and policy and the votes of all members whether they are senior management or blue-collar count equally.

When individual coöperatives do well their members share in the profits. When times are hard the coöperatives collectively support one another sharing funds and reallocating workers among themselves to preserve jobs. During the pandemic workers at many Mondragon co-ops voted to temporarily reduce their own salaries or hours until markets recovered; people who felt sick were trusted and encouraged to stay home. The treatment Hernández said he received when he was fired would be almost impossible within Mondragon since worker-owners must vote to dismiss one another and this can occur only in cases of very severe misconduct.

Worker-owned coöperatives are often considered both idealistic and inefficient; the model is seen as suitable mainly for upscale grocery stores or boutique bakeries in progressive towns. At a 2019 conference the economist Larry Summers characterized co-ops as intrinsically sleepy and short-sighted. “When you put workers in charge of firms and you give them substantial control over the firms” he said “the one thing you do not get is expansion. You get more for the people who are already there.” And yet Mondragon is not a sleepy grocery store. Its collection of co-ops employs around eighty thousand people and seventy-six per cent of those who work in manufacturing co-ops are owners. One makes bicycles at an industrial scale; others make elevators or produce huge industrial machines used in the production of jet engines rockets and wind turbines. Mondragon’s businesses include schools a large grocery chain a catering company fourteen technology R. & D. centers and a McKinsey-like consulting firm. In 2021 the network brought in more than eleven billion euros in revenue. The collective enforces five hundred and five types of patents and employs about twenty-four hundred full-time researchers. It also owns subsidiaries in countries including China Germany and Mexico and competes effectively in international markets winning contracts from firms such as General Electric and Blue Origin. The odds are good that key elements of something within a hundred feet of you—an espresso maker a gas grill a car—were made at Mondragon.

“We are a kind of mirror for conventional companies and in it they do not see a very beautiful image” Ander Etxeberria Mondragon’s director of coöperative dissemination told me as we drove between co-ops in the Basque country. A slender affable man who speaks many languages Etxeberria is essentially a professional explainer of Mondragon to its roughly two thousand annual visitors. It was a warm spring afternoon and he rolled down the windows and gestured to the passing countryside as we drove. A flock of sheep clustered on a hillside above the squat rectangular headquarters of a precision-machine-tooling co-op. We passed a bank a language-instruction school a grocery store a factory—each owned by its workers.

Mondragon’s network of co-ops many clustered along Spain’s Deba River has managed to survive nearly seventy years of capitalism’s creative destruction. Its persistence suggests that there are fairer and more sustainable ways of doing business. But whether a version of its model could be replicated outside of one beautiful region of northern Spain is an open question debated within Mondragon and beyond. The collective has a unique history and its density powers a rare feedback loop in which coöperative values shape institutions which then reinforce the same values spiralling outward to define an entire way of life. Mondragon is an inspiring and successful experiment. Will it ever be repeated?

The town of Mondragón in a green river valley surrounded by the Cantabrian mountains is home to some twenty-two thousand people. A medieval city occupies the town center with stone archways that soar over cobbled streets and a medieval Gothic church in a central square. The remains of José María Arizmendiarrieta the Catholic priest who founded the Mondragon coöperatives are buried inside.

Born in 1915 Arizmendiarrieta lost an eye in a childhood accident; mobilized during the Spanish Civil War but unable to take part in the fighting he still served as a Basque-language journalist for a publication opposed to the Nationalists led by Franco. He was arrested by Franco’s forces and spent a month in prison before being released. After the war he became a priest and was assigned by the Church to the town of Mondragón in 1941 when he was twenty-five.

He found that the area’s economy was deeply impoverished with virtually no middle class and that its society had been fractured by civil war. He mobilized citizens to launch civic and cultural initiatives including a soccer field a medical clinic and a housing complex for workers. Since the early twentieth century a locksmithing factory in Mondragón had been employing local boys who sometimes started at the age of fourteen clocked fifty-hour weeks and had few prospects without further education. Upon arrival Arizmendiarrieta began using the local Catholic Action center to educate young workers through study circles which met in a converted seventeenth-century palace. In 1943 Arizmendiarrieta created a technical school; students there worked at the factory in the morning and attended classes in the afternoon. Eventually he selected a group of promising workers who in the evenings began pursuing long-distance degrees in engineering. By 1956 five members who had finished their degrees left their factory jobs to launch a coöperative company that produced kerosene heaters. More industrial co-ops began appearing throughout the valley drawing workers from the technical school and collaborating with one another to share expertise. Thus was born the Mondragon experiment.

The growth of the co-ops followed a pattern. An obstacle would confront local workers and a new co-op would be created to overcome it. When in 1958 the Spanish Ministry of Labor excluded the new worker-owners from the national social-security system arguing that they were not eligible for workers’ benefits because they were also part-owners Arizmendiarrieta created an internal pension and health-care system that was itself organized as a coöperative; it still exists today supplying sick leave parental leave a generous pension unemployment benefits and medical insurance to Mondragon’s worker-owners. (The Spanish government has long since revised its position and provides coverage for co-op members in addition to that offered by Mondragon.) To meet the need for affordable financing Arizmendiarrieta organized a coöperative bank.

On my first afternoon in Mondragón Etxeberria and I walked into the dark interior of the church beside the central square. I could hear a choir rehearsing a hymn. Etxeberria pointed to the tomb of Arizmendiarrieta on one side of the central aisle. A stack of pamphlets lay beside it and I took one; it was part of a campaign to canonize the priest whom it described as “the apostle of coöperation.”

I stood for a while absorbing the atmosphere. (The Mondragon Corporation has no official position on the canonization campaign but Arizmendiarrieta is venerated even among the secular.) I saw that the pamphlet included a suggested prayer to Arizmendiarrieta and information on whom to contact if it were answered. I walked back out into the sun.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiW2h0dHBzOi8vYmxlZWRpbmdjb29sLmNvbS9jb21pY3MvZXRoYW4tbS1hbGRyaWRnZXMtZ2V0cy1hLW5ldy1ncmFwaGljLW5vdmVsLXRoZS1sYWR5cy1mYXZvci_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Ethan M.

Those defences have been marshalled by mainstream media outlets with limited success. The June 29 article republished on August 15 that is at the centre of Lachlan Murdoch’s Federal Court defamation suit against Crikey. Murdoch will also have to satisfy a new serious harm test before he can bring the proceedings a change modelled on British law that is aimed at weeding out trivial claims. But the serious harm requirement was designed chiefly with low-level spats involving limited audiences – often referred to as “backyarders” – in mind. “Things like the prompt removal of defamatory content online a complete retraction or apology are the sorts of things that could mitigate or completely eradicate serious harm to reputation” Rolph said. Douglas said it was likely Murdoch would be able to overcome the serious harm threshold “given how many people have read the piece – and given Crikey’s conduct in recent days of drumming up even more views of their article”.

Crikey was accustomed to receiving legal correspondence from Murdoch when it received a missive from his solicitor John Churchill on June 30 this year – it was the fourth time he had asked for an apology over an article. That’s a relatively small number in context: Crikey has written more than 1000 articles referring to the family and more than 100 mentioning Lachlan Murdoch. While the article was removed within minutes of receiving the letter it was re-published on August 15. Will Hayward chief executive of Crikey’s publisher Private Media said the request for an apology this time was “too absurd”. Will Hayward chief executive of Private Media. “[In previous cases] we were doing the legal dance” he said. “You either do an apology pay his legal fees delete the article and beg for forgiveness or take on a billionaire.” The news outlet took a calculated risk on Monday in challenging Murdoch via an open letter in The New York Times to sue it over the article “so that we can test this important issue of freedom of public interest journalism”. It also published all previous correspondence with Murdoch’s lawyers.

“We want to defend those allegations in court” read the open letter signed by Eric Beecher chairman of Crikey’s publisher Private Media and Crikey editor-in-chief Peter Fray. Loading Hayward took exception to accusations Crikey was cynically seeking to drum up subscribers by publicising its fight. On Friday it formally launched a crowdfunding campaign to help cover its costs. “We are going to have to try and bring as many people to our side as possible or we not only suffer the legal costs in the short term but the potential extraordinary outcome at the end of all this where we might get saddled with damages and their legal costs” he said. But the media strategy may have financial consequences. While Crikey has defamation insurance that would cover damages and legal costs if it loses the case it may not be able to rely on the policy in this instance. Most insurance schemes have a clause that voids any claim if a company acts in a way that triggers an award of aggravated damages on top of the standard damages for non-economic loss (the latter are capped at present in defamation cases at $443000 a figure that is adjusted annually).

The court is empowered to award aggravated damages if it finds Crikey engaged in “improper or unjustifiable conduct” that increased the hurt to Murdoch. The news outlet’s long-time lawyer Melbourne-based MinterEllison partner Peter Bartlett had written to Murdoch’s lawyer on July 7 after the initial legal letter was received on June 30. The publisher rejected Murdoch’s claims but Bartlett said the article had been removed “as a goodwill gesture” effectively short-circuiting a lawsuit. But on August 15 Crikey changed tack and re-published the article before launching its public campaign. The moves crystallised Murdoch’s decision to sue. Sydney-based lawyer Michael Bradley managing partner at law firm Marque Lawyers and a sometime Crikey columnist took over responding to Murdoch’s lawyers on July 27. Crikey said this week the switch in lawyers for this project was “to keep the Murdoch matter separate from other legal affairs” but it also appeared to herald a change in legal strategy to Bradley’s no-holds-barred approach.

While it is not clear why Murdoch took particular umbrage to the article by Crikey’s political editor Bernard Keane in light of the proliferation of less-than-flattering articles penned about the Murdochs and Fox News worldwide it is even less clear what a Federal Court judge will make of it. It will be up to the judge to decide if the article identifies and defames Murdoch by conveying any of the meanings his lawyers allege were carried by it. If so the judge will move on to consider whether any defences have been established. Loading Tagged as analysis on Crikey’s website the article focuses chiefly on the deadly 2021 US Capitol riots and former president Donald Trump’s role in inciting the mob as part of his bid to prevent confirmation of the 2020 presidential election result. Murdoch’s lawyers including high-profile defamation silk Sue Chrysanthou SC argue the article carries a range of false and defamatory imputations including that the Fox chief executive “illegally conspired with Donald Trump to incite an armed mob to march on the Capitol [on January 6 2021] to physically prevent confirmation of the outcome of the 2020 presidential election”. Crikey does not believe it said this and has conceded in legal correspondence that there is “no evidence” Murdoch did so. The surname “Murdoch” appears once in the article in the headline which brands Trump a “confirmed unhinged traitor” and Murdoch “his unindicted co-conspirator”. Crikey has said this would be understood as a reference to Rupert.

Keane writes that Trump enjoyed the support of “the world’s most powerful media company which continues ... to peddle the lie of the stolen election and play down the insurrection Trump created”.

It was March 2020—the beginning of the pandemic—and so he called a government help line. He was told that he might have the coronavirus and that he should stay home. But without leaving the house for a test Hernández couldn’t get proof of his illness—and without that proof he had no excuse for not coming into work. A week after he got sick he said his company fired him. (The firm cited “insufficient” job performance as the motive.)

Alone and newly jobless during lockdown Hernández who was thirty-two at the time considered his life. He was an engineer with expertise in the automotive industry so finding a new position wouldn’t be difficult. But he didn’t want just any new job. He wanted to work for a company that treated workers decently. His girlfriend who lived in the Basque region of northern Spain suggested that he consider a position within a group of worker-owned coöperatives there called Mondragon.

The Mondragon Corporation as it’s known is a voluntary association of ninety-five autonomous coöperatives that differs radically from a conventional company. Each co-op’s highest-paid executive makes at most six times the salary of its lowest-paid employee. There are no outside shareholders; instead after a temporary contract new workers who have proved themselves may become member-owners of their co-ops. A managing director acts as a kind of C.E.O. within each co-op but the members themselves vote on many vital decisions about strategy salaries and policy and the votes of all members whether they are senior management or blue-collar count equally.

When individual coöperatives do well their members share in the profits. When times are hard the coöperatives collectively support one another sharing funds and reallocating workers among themselves to preserve jobs. During the pandemic workers at many Mondragon co-ops voted to temporarily reduce their own salaries or hours until markets recovered; people who felt sick were trusted and encouraged to stay home. The treatment Hernández said he received when he was fired would be almost impossible within Mondragon since worker-owners must vote to dismiss one another and this can occur only in cases of very severe misconduct.

Worker-owned coöperatives are often considered both idealistic and inefficient; the model is seen as suitable mainly for upscale grocery stores or boutique bakeries in progressive towns. At a 2019 conference the economist Larry Summers characterized co-ops as intrinsically sleepy and short-sighted. “When you put workers in charge of firms and you give them substantial control over the firms” he said “the one thing you do not get is expansion. You get more for the people who are already there.” And yet Mondragon is not a sleepy grocery store. Its collection of co-ops employs around eighty thousand people and seventy-six per cent of those who work in manufacturing co-ops are owners. One makes bicycles at an industrial scale; others make elevators or produce huge industrial machines used in the production of jet engines rockets and wind turbines. Mondragon’s businesses include schools a large grocery chain a catering company fourteen technology R. & D. centers and a McKinsey-like consulting firm. In 2021 the network brought in more than eleven billion euros in revenue. The collective enforces five hundred and five types of patents and employs about twenty-four hundred full-time researchers. It also owns subsidiaries in countries including China Germany and Mexico and competes effectively in international markets winning contracts from firms such as General Electric and Blue Origin. The odds are good that key elements of something within a hundred feet of you—an espresso maker a gas grill a car—were made at Mondragon.

“We are a kind of mirror for conventional companies and in it they do not see a very beautiful image” Ander Etxeberria Mondragon’s director of coöperative dissemination told me as we drove between co-ops in the Basque country. A slender affable man who speaks many languages Etxeberria is essentially a professional explainer of Mondragon to its roughly two thousand annual visitors. It was a warm spring afternoon and he rolled down the windows and gestured to the passing countryside as we drove. A flock of sheep clustered on a hillside above the squat rectangular headquarters of a precision-machine-tooling co-op. We passed a bank a language-instruction school a grocery store a factory—each owned by its workers.

Mondragon’s network of co-ops many clustered along Spain’s Deba River has managed to survive nearly seventy years of capitalism’s creative destruction. Its persistence suggests that there are fairer and more sustainable ways of doing business. But whether a version of its model could be replicated outside of one beautiful region of northern Spain is an open question debated within Mondragon and beyond. The collective has a unique history and its density powers a rare feedback loop in which coöperative values shape institutions which then reinforce the same values spiralling outward to define an entire way of life. Mondragon is an inspiring and successful experiment. Will it ever be repeated?

The town of Mondragón in a green river valley surrounded by the Cantabrian mountains is home to some twenty-two thousand people. A medieval city occupies the town center with stone archways that soar over cobbled streets and a medieval Gothic church in a central square. The remains of José María Arizmendiarrieta the Catholic priest who founded the Mondragon coöperatives are buried inside.

Born in 1915 Arizmendiarrieta lost an eye in a childhood accident; mobilized during the Spanish Civil War but unable to take part in the fighting he still served as a Basque-language journalist for a publication opposed to the Nationalists led by Franco. He was arrested by Franco’s forces and spent a month in prison before being released. After the war he became a priest and was assigned by the Church to the town of Mondragón in 1941 when he was twenty-five.

He found that the area’s economy was deeply impoverished with virtually no middle class and that its society had been fractured by civil war. He mobilized citizens to launch civic and cultural initiatives including a soccer field a medical clinic and a housing complex for workers. Since the early twentieth century a locksmithing factory in Mondragón had been employing local boys who sometimes started at the age of fourteen clocked fifty-hour weeks and had few prospects without further education. Upon arrival Arizmendiarrieta began using the local Catholic Action center to educate young workers through study circles which met in a converted seventeenth-century palace. In 1943 Arizmendiarrieta created a technical school; students there worked at the factory in the morning and attended classes in the afternoon. Eventually he selected a group of promising workers who in the evenings began pursuing long-distance degrees in engineering. By 1956 five members who had finished their degrees left their factory jobs to launch a coöperative company that produced kerosene heaters. More industrial co-ops began appearing throughout the valley drawing workers from the technical school and collaborating with one another to share expertise. Thus was born the Mondragon experiment.

The growth of the co-ops followed a pattern. An obstacle would confront local workers and a new co-op would be created to overcome it. When in 1958 the Spanish Ministry of Labor excluded the new worker-owners from the national social-security system arguing that they were not eligible for workers’ benefits because they were also part-owners Arizmendiarrieta created an internal pension and health-care system that was itself organized as a coöperative; it still exists today supplying sick leave parental leave a generous pension unemployment benefits and medical insurance to Mondragon’s worker-owners. (The Spanish government has long since revised its position and provides coverage for co-op members in addition to that offered by Mondragon.) To meet the need for affordable financing Arizmendiarrieta organized a coöperative bank.

On my first afternoon in Mondragón Etxeberria and I walked into the dark interior of the church beside the central square. I could hear a choir rehearsing a hymn. Etxeberria pointed to the tomb of Arizmendiarrieta on one side of the central aisle. A stack of pamphlets lay beside it and I took one; it was part of a campaign to canonize the priest whom it described as “the apostle of coöperation.”

I stood for a while absorbing the atmosphere. (The Mondragon Corporation has no official position on the canonization campaign but Arizmendiarrieta is venerated even among the secular.) I saw that the pamphlet included a suggested prayer to Arizmendiarrieta and information on whom to contact if it were answered. I walked back out into the sun.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiW2h0dHBzOi8vYmxlZWRpbmdjb29sLmNvbS9jb21pY3MvZXRoYW4tbS1hbGRyaWRnZXMtZ2V0cy1hLW5ldy1ncmFwaGljLW5vdmVsLXRoZS1sYWR5cy1mYXZvci_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Ethan M.

Those defences have been marshalled by mainstream media outlets with limited success. The June 29 article republished on August 15 that is at the centre of Lachlan Murdoch’s Federal Court defamation suit against Crikey. Murdoch will also have to satisfy a new serious harm test before he can bring the proceedings a change modelled on British law that is aimed at weeding out trivial claims. But the serious harm requirement was designed chiefly with low-level spats involving limited audiences – often referred to as “backyarders” – in mind. “Things like the prompt removal of defamatory content online a complete retraction or apology are the sorts of things that could mitigate or completely eradicate serious harm to reputation” Rolph said. Douglas said it was likely Murdoch would be able to overcome the serious harm threshold “given how many people have read the piece – and given Crikey’s conduct in recent days of drumming up even more views of their article”.

Crikey was accustomed to receiving legal correspondence from Murdoch when it received a missive from his solicitor John Churchill on June 30 this year – it was the fourth time he had asked for an apology over an article. That’s a relatively small number in context: Crikey has written more than 1000 articles referring to the family and more than 100 mentioning Lachlan Murdoch. While the article was removed within minutes of receiving the letter it was re-published on August 15. Will Hayward chief executive of Crikey’s publisher Private Media said the request for an apology this time was “too absurd”. Will Hayward chief executive of Private Media. “[In previous cases] we were doing the legal dance” he said. “You either do an apology pay his legal fees delete the article and beg for forgiveness or take on a billionaire.” The news outlet took a calculated risk on Monday in challenging Murdoch via an open letter in The New York Times to sue it over the article “so that we can test this important issue of freedom of public interest journalism”. It also published all previous correspondence with Murdoch’s lawyers.

“We want to defend those allegations in court” read the open letter signed by Eric Beecher chairman of Crikey’s publisher Private Media and Crikey editor-in-chief Peter Fray. Loading Hayward took exception to accusations Crikey was cynically seeking to drum up subscribers by publicising its fight. On Friday it formally launched a crowdfunding campaign to help cover its costs. “We are going to have to try and bring as many people to our side as possible or we not only suffer the legal costs in the short term but the potential extraordinary outcome at the end of all this where we might get saddled with damages and their legal costs” he said. But the media strategy may have financial consequences. While Crikey has defamation insurance that would cover damages and legal costs if it loses the case it may not be able to rely on the policy in this instance. Most insurance schemes have a clause that voids any claim if a company acts in a way that triggers an award of aggravated damages on top of the standard damages for non-economic loss (the latter are capped at present in defamation cases at $443000 a figure that is adjusted annually).

The court is empowered to award aggravated damages if it finds Crikey engaged in “improper or unjustifiable conduct” that increased the hurt to Murdoch. The news outlet’s long-time lawyer Melbourne-based MinterEllison partner Peter Bartlett had written to Murdoch’s lawyer on July 7 after the initial legal letter was received on June 30. The publisher rejected Murdoch’s claims but Bartlett said the article had been removed “as a goodwill gesture” effectively short-circuiting a lawsuit. But on August 15 Crikey changed tack and re-published the article before launching its public campaign. The moves crystallised Murdoch’s decision to sue. Sydney-based lawyer Michael Bradley managing partner at law firm Marque Lawyers and a sometime Crikey columnist took over responding to Murdoch’s lawyers on July 27. Crikey said this week the switch in lawyers for this project was “to keep the Murdoch matter separate from other legal affairs” but it also appeared to herald a change in legal strategy to Bradley’s no-holds-barred approach.

While it is not clear why Murdoch took particular umbrage to the article by Crikey’s political editor Bernard Keane in light of the proliferation of less-than-flattering articles penned about the Murdochs and Fox News worldwide it is even less clear what a Federal Court judge will make of it. It will be up to the judge to decide if the article identifies and defames Murdoch by conveying any of the meanings his lawyers allege were carried by it. If so the judge will move on to consider whether any defences have been established. Loading Tagged as analysis on Crikey’s website the article focuses chiefly on the deadly 2021 US Capitol riots and former president Donald Trump’s role in inciting the mob as part of his bid to prevent confirmation of the 2020 presidential election result. Murdoch’s lawyers including high-profile defamation silk Sue Chrysanthou SC argue the article carries a range of false and defamatory imputations including that the Fox chief executive “illegally conspired with Donald Trump to incite an armed mob to march on the Capitol [on January 6 2021] to physically prevent confirmation of the outcome of the 2020 presidential election”. Crikey does not believe it said this and has conceded in legal correspondence that there is “no evidence” Murdoch did so. The surname “Murdoch” appears once in the article in the headline which brands Trump a “confirmed unhinged traitor” and Murdoch “his unindicted co-conspirator”. Crikey has said this would be understood as a reference to Rupert.

Keane writes that Trump enjoyed the support of “the world’s most powerful media company which continues ... to peddle the lie of the stolen election and play down the insurrection Trump created”. Loading “The Murdochs” and “Fox News” are mentioned only once in the article’s final paragraph which reads: “Nixon was famously the ‘unindicted co-conspirator’ in Watergate.

Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer of New York who worked with the intractable Sen. Joe Manchin of West Virginia said the bill “will put the country on track to meet the climate goals we need to preserve for our planet for our children and for our grandchildren.”

It’s tempting to believe him: Many environmental advocates are reporting that the IRA while imperfect is a good start. We desperately need climate legislation and could use a win to stay optimistic about our future. Besides there are aspects of the bill to celebrate like funding to address air pollution and a tax on coal to support miners with Black Lung Disease.

But unfortunately in order to win Manchin’s approval the Inflation Reduction Act was turned into a profit-fest for fossil fuel giants like ExxonMobil and the parts of the bill that do invest in clean energy and greenhouse gas reductions are largely premised on false solutions. We cannot call something that does such grave harm a success especially when the harm will fall hardest on disadvantaged communities. The Inflation Reduction Act is a disappointing act of federal greenwashing.

Despite all of the research reporting that the first step to reducing emissions is to halt new fossil fuel development the IRA includes multiple provisions to increase fossil fuel production. Three canceled oil and gas lease sales in the Gulf of Mexico were revived by the bill and to ensure “energy security” the federal government is required to lease 62 million acres of public lands and waters to oil and gas developers before offering any solar and wind leases.

The bill also ensures that the fossil fuel industry will rake in $3.23 billion in subsidies for Carbon Capture Utilization and Storage (CCS) technologies. CCS is mostly a smoke-and-mirrors trick: The technology isn’t really there yet and it doesn’t solve the underlying problem. Ninety percent of CCS projects are used for enhanced oil recovery a process in which captured carbon is stored underground where it can be extracted again as oil. The entire idea of CCS is to slow the transition away from fossil fuels and continue the cycle of extraction.

The Inflation Reduction Act approaches clean energy with the same extractive and profiteering model beloved by the fossil fuel industry. With the discounts provided in the bill extractive industries will move onto yet more Indigenous lands and into the backyards of other disadvantaged communities to set up poisonous projects like mines and nuclear power plants.

The Indigenous Environmental Network has called the Inflation Reduction Act a trojan horse for frontline communities: While it includes a myriad of grants for disadvantaged communities recipients are forced to compete for eligibility with one another and well-funded industries and NGOs.

Indigenous human rights lawyer and Water Protector Tara Houska responded to the bill by saying “It doesn’t really work to throw money at us if we don’t have habitable places to live. If our communities are underwater or if our air is poisoned and we have pipelines and mines and all the things that are destroying our lands actively how are some investments in block grants supposed to help us?”

We cannot get out of the climate crisis using the same model that got us into this mess. Rewards for industries that prioritize their own profit and have no accountability to the local communities that their projects exist in are not the solution. We need to invest in community. If President Biden and Congressional Democrats truly wanted to help frontline communities they could have invested in public transportation instead of privatized electric vehicles supported community participation in the design and articulation of energy projects supported community-owned renewables and given communities experiencing environment injustice the legal right to recovery.

Money created the Inflation Reduction Act. Both Schumer and Manchin have received major donations from the pipeline company that benefits from their deal: NextEra Energy. And at the end of the day this bill was designed to reduce inflation — not save the planet.

We cannot allow the federal government to greenwash this economic package and call it progress. The Inflation Reduction Act will create countless sacrifice zones in the name of “green” energy already visible in places like Thacker Pass in Nevada. President Biden says that progress requires compromise but his version of a compromise involves sacrificing disadvantaged communities. You cannot call that a “start” on climate.

FAUST: Growing up in New York City graffiti was everywhere. As a young aspiring artist it was seductive. I questioned what it meant and how artists got away with it. And being the last generation before social media the only way to share my work and make a name for myself in a city of eight million people was to just get up and put it out there.

But it’s not just an art it’s a culture and I began to connect with other writers from all over the city people that have been doing it since before I was born. I treated everyone with respect and was anxious to hear their stories and learn their history. If you don’t know where you come from then you’ll never know where you’re going. I was schooled by some of the greatest to ever do it pioneers that invented the art form. After doing it for a decade I found my own voice that stood out from what everyone else was doing — but was still rooted in the foundation of the culture.

“We were risking arrest without any incentive other than having a platform for creative expression and perhaps the thrill of it all. I thought when I grew up I would need to find a “real job” but times changed and the art form has been embraced to the extent that many of us are able to thrive off of simply doing what we love.”

Was it always in your plans to try and turn your calligraphy into a career?

That was never the plan. When I started writing nobody got into graffiti to make a career out of it. It was something I was passionate about and did for myself. I think that’s the beauty of graffiti culture. It’s the most widespread artistic movement but when we were kids there were no aspirations of having a gallery show or brand collab. We were risking arrest without any incentive other than having a platform for creative expression and perhaps the thrill of it all. I thought when I grew up I would need to find a “real job” but times changed and the art form has been embraced to the extent that many of us are able to thrive off of simply doing what we love.

How would you describe your design language and how long did it take for you to develop your signature style?

I was always attracted to tags. If you’re a writer you’ve gotta have a good signature. It’s the core element of graffiti. As a teenager I would go through page after page literally copying the tags of the artists I admired to learn how to do different letters or how to use a chisel tip marker properly. And then throughout high school I would fill out thousands of stickers writing my name over and over. This is where I really put in my 10000 hours to master my craft. I would canvas the city by putting up stickers on every street corner.

I think everyone strives to have a signature style but it’s best when you arrive at it organically. Although I was also painting more elaborate pieces at the time and working on productions with multiple other writers tags always appealed most to me and it’s what I started to become recognized for.

When I first connected with my graffiti partner SURE we both had a similar approach where we were practicing a variety of tag styles. Some were more of a classic New York chisel-tip hand style and others were script or blackletter-inspired. We naturally gravitated towards each other hitting the streets together so much that our names became synonymous. For a while nearly every newspaper box in New York had our stickers on them and every doorway and mailbox had a our tags.

Around 2008 I began to look at blank walls around the city as my canvas and started exploring what it would look like to take my tag and blow it up to an architectural scale. I had never seen anything like it. For a culture that’s all about breaking rules there certainly are a lot of rules to follow and typically tags are around the same size as are throw-ups or pieces. However I envisioned taking my tag and blowing it up to fill the whole wall and that’s when I really found my own voice.

For a number of years I would only use my name enlarging it and cropping it to see how big I can go or how little I could show and still have it be recognizable. And when I felt like I got to that point of recognition I went beyond my name and started to write words that were clever poignant and site-specific. I typically didn’t sign them because I felt like when people saw that signature style they instantly knew it was me.

What do you want people to take away from your art?

So much of my work is centered around public art. I knew the names that I grew up seeing and always aspired to be that for the next generation. Also when I was a kid growing up there was a concept of “going all city” which meant having your name up in all five boroughs. But now in the age of globalization I see “going all city” as being a cultural ambassador for your city. I’ve been fortunate enough to paint murals around the world but I always feel like my style is very distinct to New York.

Whether I’m painting in New York or across the globe I try to find the right word or phrase that will resonate with the people that live there. Sometimes that takes a lot of research like getting to know the community intimately to have their sentiment reflected on the wall and other times it comes instantly. I hope when people see the work they take pride in it and feel like it speaks for them.

Who or what got you into sneakers?

I was into sneakers as long as I could remember. It’s just part of growing up in New York and every kid wanting to be fly. The person that really put me onto game was Tommy Rebel. He was a graffiti writer from Brooklyn and when I was a teenager he had his name on trucks all over the city. He was equally known for collecting Nike Polo and North Face. That was part of graffiti culture in the 90’s and he was one of the most vocal participants in the arena.

I would go to his house the Brooklyn Basement and get schooled looking at old graffiti photos and showing me his collection of kicks. In fact there’s a documentary on sneaker culture called Just For Kicks which features him throughout the film. I remember once he took me sneaker digging. The same way DJs used to go digging for records Rebel drove me out to the most dangerous neighborhoods at the time Newark New Jersey and West Philadelphia to go to mom and pop sneaker shops. He was boisterous friendly and would talk his way into their basements and storage closets mining for gold. He’d walk from back to the front with a stack of sneakers as high as he could carry and be like “I found these in the back collecting dust and taking up space I’ll give you $20 a pair?” The shop clerks would be happy just to be getting rid of the back stock.

Mind you that was long before the culture changed into what it is today where most people that go after the high heat releases are looking for an easy flip. That was never his motive. He was a true connoisseur and bought them because he loved them and to me that’s how I feel like sneaker culture should still be.

What were some of your favorite silhouettes when you were growing up?

I was a big Air Jordan 1 fan. I remember when they released four different colorways in 2001 and I tracked down all four and still have them in my collection today. And then when I first got put onto Dunk Highs I was blown away because the model was similar to the Jordan 1 but in colorways you would never find. So I had the 1999 “Goldenrods” and obsidian and white pair from 2000. I also became a big Air Max-head and had a lot of classic grails like the original Air Max 1 “Crepe” atmos x Nike Air Max 1s Air Max 97 “Kashima Antlers” all of which I dogged until the soles were worn through.

NYC is widely associated with certain footwear models like Timberland boots and Nike Air Force 1s were these city staples in your rotation?

True there’s nothing more New York than Timbs and “uptowns” but that wasn’t my style. I definitely had multiple pairs of Timbs growing up don’t get me wrong but I don’t think either were staples in my rotation quite like the other pairs that I mentioned above. You need to understand that when you’re going back 20 years before social media Hypebeast even when you could spot someone on the street from a block away you could tell if you knew them or not just from what they were wearing. Sneaker culture wasn’t like it is today where the latest release has millions of people scrambling to get it. It was very niche. One of my favorite pairs was the Parra x Air Max 1s I had picked up after it was sitting on a shelf for months after the release.

Are there any parallels that you can draw between designing a mural and designing a sneaker?

I suppose one major parallel is being conscious that it’s for a public audience as opposed to painting a canvas or something that’s more intimate. Both the mural and the sneakers are for public consumption by design and also have very rich largely underground recent history from the 70s through today.

“For me the greatest honor is following in the footsteps of Futura Stash and Haze. Growing up and seeing their collaborations with Nike gave me something to aspire to be. The sneakers they designed became grails and to me that was the pantheon.”

I know that you’ve worked with Nike before on a mural for its HQ in Beaverton but how did the idea of working on a sneaker collaboration get ideated and eventually brought to life?

When I was invited to the Nike WHQ to paint a mural on campus it was a huge honor. It had always been my dream to collaborate on a sneaker with Nike so while I was out there I asked to be connected with anyone that can help make that dream a reality. I was fortunate enough that they facilitated a sit down with Sandy Bodecker. For those who don’t know Sandy was a legend in the industry that was largely responsible for many of Nike’s original artist collaborations. He was so instrumental in Nike SB that people joke SB stands for Sandy Bodecker.

When we met he had already had throat surgery after a bout with cancer and spoke in a faint whisper. I really had to lean in to listen to each word and he emphasized how the strength of a good collaboration is not the product but the story. This is something that stuck with me and that I was very intentional about while designing my collaboration with Nike SB.

In addition to that I had met someone at Nike back in 2011 who became a close personal friend. The first time we met we said it would be a dream project to work together on a sneaker collaboration someday. At that time I was not at the place in my career where I was ready and he was not at the place in the company to push anything like that through but 10 years later it finally came to fruition and I couldn’t be more grateful. Some people say the definition of luck is persistence and timing and I’m feeling lucky.

The Nike SB Dunk High is a key piece of the brand’s history how did you manage to maintain its classic-ness while adding your own flair?

Absolutely. For me the greatest honor is following in the footsteps of Futura Stash and Haze. Growing up and seeing their collaborations with Nike gave me something to aspire to be. The sneakers they designed became grails and to me that was the pantheon. It cannot be overstated how influential those guys have been and all the doors they have opened for the culture to be what it is today.

It was the perfect canvas for my collaboration to celebrate the 20th Anniversary of Nike SB. So when the opportunity finally came about I was faced with the challenge of building upon that storied tradition while making it uniquely my own. I took a retrospective look at my body of work and tried to do justice to my childhood dream of carrying on this legacy.

I wanted to create a sneaker that reflected my own personal style. It’s pretty typical of New Yorkers to subscribe to a wardrobe of all-black everything. Although there have been countless murdered-out releases I wanted to differentiate my design through attention to detail and elevated materials.

Without the use of color rich textures became paramount to the design. I worked with the Nike SB design team to use the most premium buttery and soft tumbled leather and nubuck available. Satin lining compliments the luxurious build. No detail was overlooked from custom designing the aglets to the four sets of laces that come with each pair.

Black and gold is a common motif in my work so it was natural to use gold as the secondary color in the design. It feels regal and street at the same time. I wanted to create a pair of Dunks that could just as easily be part of someone’s everyday rotation or dressed up for a special occasion.

The artwork that’s embroidered on the sneakers is very personal to me. The origins of the Nike Dunk had to do with representing your team and I took that to heart in my design. The “Sure Faust” gold embroidery is based on an actual tag done on the street over a decade ago. SURE was my graffiti partner and best friend who passed away in 2010 serving the country in Afghanistan. This was a dream project for us since we were kids so it felt meaningful to include both of our names as they used to appear all over the city to honor his memory.

The all-over embroidered artwork on the opposite shoe reads “All That Matters” which was our crew as well as a prompt for each person to think about what matters to them. This actually started as a heel embroidery and the Nike SB design team proposed the idea of blowing up the tag to cover the whole sneaker the same way I would position my tag to fill a whole wall when I paint a mural from floor-to-ceiling and end-to-end. Although it was not an easy task for production it really translates my aesthetic onto the sneaker and the asymmetrical design of the pair felt unlike anything else I’ve ever seen before.

Why are sneakers and their stories important to you?

I grew up on sneakers and the stories that go with them. When I look back at my own collection every pair has a story and vivid memories that make them so much more valuable than just a stylish fashion accessory or any monetary value. Collaborating with Nike SB on this Dunk High I took Sandy Bodecker’s words to heart to use this opportunity to not only share my work but also pay homage to SURE his sacrifice his contributions to the culture and help keep his memory alive. I definitely want people to love the sneakers because of the design and materials and all of the attention to detail but I hope that unpacking the thought and meaning that went into the project will make people have an even greater appreciation for them.

The Nike Air Max 97 has seen quite the collection of colorful styles debut over the past few months while harkening back to shades that aided in transitioning Christian Tresser’s iconic design into the new age of lifestyle footwear. Having already enjoyed the full breadth of the color palette throughout the Summer The Swoosh has no plans of letting off the gas any time soon with the “PSI” Air Max 97.

The interior construction is identical to the “M. Frank Rudy” colorway that paid homage to the man behind the Air Max bubble with blueprint insoles showcasing sketches of the aforementioned tech. A soft white suede and mesh construction takes hold throughout the model while a medley of “Royal Blue” “Safety Orange” and “University Gold” paints the embossed overlays as the yellow hue continues atop the lacing structure and outsole. The latter presides above a matching white midsole and exposed cushioning system while the exterior Swoosh is scribbled in black alongside EST. branding. In tandem with its namesake an air pressure gauge tag in matching coloring rounds out the design in reference to Rudy’s air-infused technology.

Enjoy official images of the barometric pressure inspired silhouette while we anticipate further release details being made available within the following weeks.

Claims today are being paid at 45% of their value.

What is known about the trust’s costs revealed overhead that topped $132 million by the end of 2021. Those expenses included a $125000-a-month salary for the former trust administrator John Trotter who resigned at the end of June.

For one attorney representing Camp Fire victims the fact that attorneys charged with overseeing the trust’s administration could collect legal fees in unknown amounts from the fund raises further questions.

“It is not a set up that inspires confidence” said Los Angeles-based attorney Matthew French who represents 86 households devastated by the Camp Fire with claims before the trust.

“When you have $13.5 billion and thousands of people’s lives (on the line) why on earth would you set up in anyway whatsoever anything that would leave those beneficiaries of the trust doubting and questioning and worrying about what’s going on?”

Burns said “there is no conflict of interest.”

“The (Trust Oversight Committee) has a fiduciary duty to victims to act in their best interests” the statement continued.

The latest disclosures from the trust come on the heels of a report in the Los Angeles Times about extravagant fraud in previous large settlement funds under Trotter’s watch. As a private arbitrator hired by trial attorneys Trotter had overseen the distribution of a $66 million settlement over a diabetes medicine beginning in 2005 and a settlement totaling $120 million beginning in 2015.

In both cases Trotter failed to stop high-profile trial attorney Tom Girardi who is now under federal investigation from using funds dedicated to victims for his own benefit according to the Los Angeles Times report.

Trotter resigned from the Fire Victim Trust at the end of June citing a promise he had previously made to his family. Because of his salary which was set by the court he would have collected as much as $3 million in pay for his two-year tenure.

Court fight timeline

The court battle over how much information the trust has to make public began May 23 when Abrams filed a motion with the federal bankruptcy court in San Francisco seeking more detailed insights than the seven-line spending breakdown administrators publish in an annual report.

Abrams’ crusade for transparency earned letters of support from both the Butte and Sonoma County boards of supervisors who represent victims of the Camp Fire and the 2017 North Bay wildfires.

On Aug. 2 Montali who has final authority over the trust as the arbiter of PG&E’s bankruptcy case ordered the fund’s administrators to respond to a series of questions in three areas — its hiring of law firms its lobbying activities and the costs and benefits of lawsuits the trust is bringing against vegetation management companies former PG&E executives and business management consultants potentially liable for wildfire damages.

Though the trust’s attorneys have fought Abram’s efforts administrators issued a statement saying they were “pleased with Judge Montali’s decision.”

Two days after Montali’s order the Los Angeles Times published its report into Girardi Trotter and the inner workings of JAMS a private mediation and arbitration company Trotter helped grow to become the largest such organization in the world.

Abrams responded by filing a new motion highlighting the reporting and calling for “broader discovery” into the role of Trotter and others in the trust’s structuring and management.

Montali has ordered the trust to indicate how it will respond to Abrams’ latest motion at a Sept. 13 hearing.

French intends to file with the court in support of Abrams’ motion he told The Press Democrat Thursday. “There has just been a consistent lack of transparency with the trust.”

Following the Los Angeles Times reporting on JAMS “there is sufficient cause to warrant peeking behind the curtain a bit to make sure everything has been aboveboard.” French said. “What I would really hate is for a limited pot of money set aside for victims of wildfires to be caught up in any of that kind of controversy.”

Cathy Yanni a longtime JAMS mediator and the trust’s former administrator assumed the role of trustee on July 1. In a letter posted on the Fire Victim Trust’s website homepage Yanni emphasized her commitment to “community engagement.”

“I want the Trust to operate with even greater transparency and engage more directly with claimants counsel public officials and other stakeholders to build broader understanding of our work to help victims” she wrote.

“I intend to meet with the residents of affected communities and their leaders and be more assertive keeping everyone updated on our progress.”

The trust has distributed $4.6 billion in payments to approximately 48000 people Yanni said in a statement Friday.

“The Fire Victim Trust is here for a single purpose: to help fire victims recover from the devastation of the fires in California and move on with their lives” Yanni said. “All our work is driven by this mission and we’ve made good progress resolving claims and getting money to fire victims equitably and efficiently.”

But French said many of his clients remain destitute enough nearly four years after the November 2018 Camp Fire that they’re accepting low payments from the trust instead of holding out for actual compensation or pursuing appeals of their claim payments.

“So many of my clients are desperate for money that they don’t have the luxury to wait any longer” he said. “I have so many who are living in their cars or in tents or couch surfing.”

The documents submitted by the trust so far are only a partial response to Montali’s order which also requires providing information on any competitive bid process and public request for proposals used in hiring including of lobbyists.

The trust has until Sept. 6 to respond in full.

“What is absolutely clear is that victims deserve to know if the Trustees and certain attorneys in this case will stand behind their stated values of transparency justice and accountability” Abrams said.

Update: This story was updated on September 26 to reflect new information about the contingency contracts between the eight legal firms and the Fire Victim Trust.

Company outsider to lead family-owned ADAC Automotive

West Michigan Tier 1 automotive supplier ADAC Automotive Inc. has named a company outsider and industry veteran to replace longtime President and CEO Jim Teets.

The Cascade Township-based company announced last week that Jonathan Husby took over as president and CEO effective on Aug. 22. Teets — who has been with the company for nearly 30 years and led as CEO since 2007 — is retiring but will continue to serve on ADAC Automotive’s board of directors. The company had also appointed Jeff Dolbee as president in early 2021 though Dolbee left the company earlier this month a company representative told MiBiz.

Husby is an outside hire for the family-owned supplier of door handles and exterior mirrors who brings more than 25 years of experience in the auto industry. For nearly five years Husby has served as president and CEO of SEG Automotive North America and two years ago took on the additional role of senior vice president of sales.

Prior to joining the Novi-based SEG a global supplier of alternators and starters Husby served in various roles at Harman International TomTom and TeleAtlas. After obtaining a master’s of business administration at Wayne State University Husby started his career as a sales manager at Denso International Inc.

“Jon is a seasoned industry veteran who has a track record of skilled leadership and hands-on experience growing new and existing markets and adeptly serving a global customer base with numerous technologies and solutions” Teets said in a statement. “He is smart capable and has earned a reputation among his team and the industry as a motivator coach and mentor. We’re confident he will take ADAC to the next level while mentoring the next generation of leaders on our team.”

Husby called the job a “unique opportunity” to lead a global Tier 1 supplier “that is also a multi-generational family-owned company deeply committed to the communities and people it serves.”

Stefan Adam Morrow passed away as a result of the injuries he sustained after being struck by a vehicle in the Moyarget Road area of Ballycastle last Sunday August 21.

A funeral notice states that Mr Morrow died peacefully in hospital following an accident.

The service will take place in Murdock’s Funeral home in Coleraine at 2pm on Wednesday before the deceased is buried in Portstewart New Cemetery.

The family – including the Mr Morrow’s dad Ronnie brother Alan daughter Rebecca and partner Lesley-Anne – has asked for donations to be made to Northern Trust for use in Causeway Hospital’s Intensive Care Unit.

Friends of the car enthusiast are planning to hold their own tribute before the service.

“We are organising a meet at the field behind right price for anyone with a dirt bike quad or anything that Stefan Morrow would have liked” a pal posted on social media.

“We plan on following down through estate.

“Then make way to graveyard in cars.

“Please let us know if anyone can join.

“Give the wee man a send-off to remember.

""Two noisy bikes planed already - keep er lit and loud”

The father of one had been walking along the road with a woman when he was hit by a van which failed to stop – she sustained non-life threatening injuries.

Alan Morrow has asked mourners to wear casual clothes at the request of his heartbroken dad.

“Just to let everyone know on the day we lay Stefan to rest my father has asked for anyone that is coming to dress casual and wear bright colours as Stefan wasn’t one for suit and tie” he wrote on Facebook.

The grieving sibling has set up a memorial page urging friends to share pictures and videos of his late brother.

Lesley-Anne posted a photo of the doting dad with “his wee Princess”.

Dozens of people have posted pictures of cars and bikes that Stefan helped fix.

“Had Stefan working on these two cars more often than not” one post read.

“Big man always knew what he was at and was always a good laugh.

“Wouldn’t have had these cars sitting the way I did without the big man.”

The PSNI previously confirmed two males in their 30s have been arrested.

One has been released unconditionally and one has been released on bail pending further enquiries.

“At this time I would like to make a renewed appeal for information and ask any witnesses to come forward to police” Detective Sergeant Colhoun added.

“We are especially keen to hear from anyone who was on the Moyarget Road between 10pm and 10.20pm on Sunday 21st August and who may have dash-cam or any mobile footage of the collision which could help our investigation.”

SkyRange is the Department of Defense Test Resource Management Center’s (TRMC) unmanned high-altitude long-endurance responsive mobile flight test system.

In support of the SkyRange initiative Block 20 and 30 RQ-4B Global Hawk aircraft are being transferred to TRMC to be reconfigured into RangeHawks. The conversion will integrate advanced payloads to equip the aircraft with the capability to support the testing of hypersonic vehicles and other long-range weapons. RangeHawks provide over-the-horizon altitude endurance and flexibility which are critical for collecting telemetry and other data to monitor the vehicle during flight tests. Increasing the capacity of hypersonic vehicle testing furthers research and development necessary to remain competitive in the global landscape.

“Our RQ-4 RangeHawks will support the emerging class of hypersonic weapons and provide a combination of range endurance and payload capacity” said Jane Bishop vice president and general manager global surveillance Northrop Grumman. “These aircraft will continue their role in vital national security missions while enabling us to bring premier aircraft design modification operations and sustainment work to the Grand Forks community.”

While previous testing relied on ship-based sensors RangeHawks can perform such missions with fewer assets reducing cost and complexity. RangeHawks are equipped with sensors to demonstrate an alternative data-collection support system to test hypersonic systems and have participated in several hypersonic test events in the Pacific and elsewhere.

“SkyRange will enable the Department of Defense to accelerate our pace of testing hypersonic systems” said George Rumford acting director and principal deputy TRMC. “Northrop Grumman’s RangeHawk is ideally suited to collect data by providing persistent time-on-station positioned closer to flight path and agility to adapt to the dynamics of a testing environment – a force multiplier as we evolve critical national security capabilities.”

Northrop Grumman is also managing operations and sustainment of the RQ-4A RangeHawk prototype fleet in partnership with NASA at Armstrong Flight Research Center at Edwards Air Force Base along with integrating new payloads for the future RQ-4B RangeHawk fleet.

Northrop Grumman supports many systems critical to connecting each service across multiple domains while advancing aeronautics to help ensure defense forces stay ahead of adversaries. As a proven pioneer in autonomous systems Northrop Grumman’s current and future platforms are revolutionary in deterring and engaging adversaries on the battlefield.

Northrop Grumman is a technology company focused on global security and human discovery.

The Air Force and Northrop Grumman are integrating a cutting-edge crypto modernization and Radar Aided Targeting System (RATS) into its stealthy B-2 bomber as part of an intense wide-ranging series of upgrades to the aircraft. Once completed it will ensure that the bomber can sustain operational functionality in modern high-threat environments against technologically sophisticated adversaries.

RATS will among other things better enable the B-2 to deliver the new upgraded nuclear-capable B61 Mod 12 weapon.

The B61-12 adds a new level of precision targeting and consolidates several different kinds of attack options into a single weapon. Instead of needing separate variants of the weapon for different functions the B61-12 can undertake earth-penetrating attacks low-yield strikes high-yield attacks above-surface detonation and bunker-buster options in a single weapon.

Given its vast capabilities Air Force officials have begun referring to the upgraded B61-12 as the “All Up Round.”

“The unrivaled capabilities of the B-2 make it the only long range penetrating stealth bomber currently in the U.S. arsenal” said Shaugnessy Reynolds vice president and B-2 program manager at Northrop Grumman said in a written statement. “Committed to continued modernization of the B-2 we’re leveraging our company’s innovation in digital engineering and its decades of leadership in designing and maintaining low observable platforms to keep the B-2 Spirit mission ready.”

The B61-12 has previously been integrated and test-dropped from an Air Force B-2 bomber as part of a fleet-wide stealth bomber upgrade which includes new radar-evading board sensors faster computer processing and new weapons adaptations.

Streamlining the different nuclear bomb variants into a single weapon brings a host of advantages including the ability for weapons-carrying aircraft such as a B-52 Stratofortress or B-2 bombers to arm themselves with a greater number of bombs. For example if each individual weapon offers additional attack alternatives then pilots can tailor or choose between a wide range of strike options with fewer onboard bombs therefore carrying more of them for each mission. This would prove useful in the event that a multi-faceted or large-scale nuclear attack became necessary.

While the idea of a tactical or “limited” nuclear strike remains a subject of passionate debate Air Force thinking aligns with the idea that simply giving commanders and air crews a wider range of options strengthens the overall U.S. deterrence posture. Some further believe that it sends a clear message to potential adversaries that any use of nuclear weapons should and will be met with a massive catastrophic response and that the United States has the means to deliver it. For instance technology enabling low-yield earth-penetrating or contained “area” detonation nuclear options might dissuade a potential attacker from risking a tactical or low-yield nuclear strike.

As for Northrop’s discussion of crypto modernization a company statement says it is designed to further improve the communications security of various high-frequency transmissions.

“The B-2 may now securely utilize advanced communication devices in the future threat environment. Earlier this year Northrop Grumman conducted a successful communications flight test with modern cryptology at its Oklahoma City Weapons System Support Center site” a company statement said.

China Is Sweating,"The American aerospace and defense technology company Northrop Grumman revealed that a B-2 bomber had successfully launched a long-range cruise missile during a weapons test in 2021. The defense giant released details about the AGM-158B JASSM-ER cruise missile release which highlighted the extent of the B-2’s capability to strike any target. The B-2’s integration with the Joint Air-to-Surface Standoff Missile-Extended Range (JASSM-ER) makes its delivery of a low observable asset capable of traveling further distances that its counterparts. While the news of this successful test launch indicates the power and sophistication of America’s long-range cruise missile arsenal it also comes amidst rising tensions with the People’s Republic of China. Beijing recently carried out several ballistic-missile launches near Taiwan so perhaps the disclosure of the JASSM-ER missile test is related.

The U.S. Air Force’s B-2 Spirit bomber has remained a critical asset to America’s long-range strike capabilities over the years. First debuted in the late 1990’s the heavy bomber was designed to penetrate anti-aircraft defenses and is equipped with low observable stealth technology. 19FortyFive analyst Peter Suciu detailed several of the airframe’s capabilities in an earlier report: “(The bomber) is the only acknowledged aircraft that can carry large air-to-surface standoff weapons in a stealth configuration. In addition the B-2 can carry up to sixteen B-61 or megaton-yield B-83 nuclear gravity bombs on the rotary launchers inside its two bomb bays. The aircraft’s avionics are even hardened versus the electromagnetic pulses generated by nuclear blasts… The B-2’s low observability was derived from a combination of reduced infrared acoustic electromagnetic visual and radar signatures. These signatures make it difficult for the sophisticated defensive systems to detect track and engage the B-2.” While this airframe is set to be supplemented and ultimately replaced by the B-21 Raider the B-2 remains the mainstay of the Air Force.

Last month approximately 20% of the Air Force’s B-2 bomber 20 airframe fleet was detected at the Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF) Amberley airbase in Queensland. The War Zone published photographs depicting this important scene which emphasized how the U.S. and Australia are ramping up joint efforts to improve tactical operations in the context of the Chinese threat. During a trip to Australia in July chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Gen. Mark Milley said that the number of intercepts by Chinese aircraft and ships in the Pacific region has steadily increased adding that “The message is the Chinese military in the air and at sea have become significantly more and noticeably more aggressive in this particular region.” The presence of B-2 bombers in the Indo-Pacific serves as a deterrent to Beijing.

Northrop Grumman’s reveal that a B-2 bomber had successfully released a long-range cruise missile during a weapons test also serves as a deterrent to China’s growing military threat. The JASSM-ER missile is one of three new components being integrated to the B-2 to further advance the platform. Unlike its predecessor that has a limited range of about 250 miles the JASSM-ER can travel approximately 600 miles due to advancements in its engine and fuel capacity. This factor alone is extremely significant since it would allow a B-2 bomber to strike enemy targets from further distances. The Air Force has also prioritized installing this cruise missile on its non-stealthy aircraft including the F-15E F-16 and B-1 bombers according to Pentagon budget documents.

The same day Northrop Grumman revealed the launch of the JASSM-ER cruise missile another U.S. lawmaker arrived in Taiwan in a series of trips made by U.S. dignitaries to showcase American support for the territory which China claims as its own. According to Reuters a spokesperson for the Chinese Embassy in Washington pledged that Beijing would take unspecified “resolute countermeasures” to “U.S. provocations” over Taiwan. This exchange marks the latest hostile exchange between Washington and Beijing in recent months. The timing of Northrop Grumman’s cruise missile coincides with this uptick in tensions.

Defense giant Northrop Grumman revealed on August 25 2022 that the US Air Force tested the AGM-158B Joint Air-to-Surface Standoff Missile-Extended Range (JASSM-ER) stealthy cruise missile from a B-2 stealth bomber in December 2021.

The missile is a long-range version of the AGM-158 JASSM and the US Air Force’s B-1 bomber and F-15E fighter have already been outfitted with the variant.

The announcement comes against escalating tensions with China in the Indo-Pacific. China for one wields long-range missiles that put American military assets in the Pacific in PLA’s firing range.

It also possesses operational hypersonic missiles that can travel worldwide without being intercepted by American Air Defenses.

NEW TODAY: The US Just Revealed a Secret Airborne Test of a Long-Range Cruise Missile https://t.co/cpfHsVTPs6 pic.twitter.com/1eydXAQpo7 — Marcus Weisgerber (@MarcusReports) August 25 2022

Firing a cutting-edge stealthy cruise missile could indicate an enhanced role for the B-2 bombers. While the B-21 could be expected to join service in the next couple of years the B-2 is being modernized and upgraded which means that the Spirits will continue to fly alongside the Raider in the long haul.

According to the statement released by Northop Grumman three new cutting-edge capabilities are being added to the B-2 to further modernize the platform with the JASSM-ER being one of them.

A Radar Aided Targeting System and crypto-modernization are also being integrated into the B-2 fleet which is equipped to deliver both conventional and nuclear munitions.

As for the missile fired the JASSM-ER cruise missile from Lockheed Martin has a range that is roughly three times as long as the normal JASSM’s 370 kilometers and it is planned to be re-targetable in flight making it simpler to hit moving targets far beyond enemy lines Defense One reported.

“The JASSM-ER further enhances the B-2’s ability to hit any target anywhere. The integration of JASSM-ER enables the delivery of a low observable asset capable of traveling greater distances than its predecessor.” Northrop said in the statement.

Joint Air-to-Surface Standoff Missile-ER

Joint Air-to-Surface Standoff Missile-ER is an autonomous long-range air-to-ground and precision standoff missile designed to evade missile defenses and can fly more than 500 miles. It has excellent capability and accuracy in eliminating both stationary and mobile targets.

The JASSM-ER was initially only available for the B-1B bomber when it entered service in 2014. Other platforms have now been able to use it such as the F-15E Strike Eagle which acquired full operational capability with the new missile in 2018. The Strike Eagle for one is considered USAF’s best dogfighter.

Three AGM-158B derivatives and sub-variants are already under development to increase the operational flexibility and range of the JASSM-ER. This includes the AGM-158D a planned variant with a two-way data link to enable retargeting according to the USAF Budget request for FY2023.

The AGM-158C Long Range Anti-Ship Missile (LRASM) another AGM-158B derivative does not appear to be integrated into any current plans for the B-2. However it is worth noting that anti-ship missiles are gaining ground as the significant flashpoint are spread in the oceans. For instance it is believed that any military confrontation between the US and China will be over the seas.

Even though the B-21 is currently getting ready for its first flight which is scheduled for next year the B-2 remains a crucial instrument for the US military for carrying out highly long-range nuclear and conventional strikes in restricted areas. The Spirit could thus come in handy against America’s three major adversaries- China Russia and North Korea.

It is pertinent to note that the B-2 Bomber is already a stealth aircraft that can fly close to the enemy’s borders or even inside its territories without easily being intercepted by its radars. A stealth bomber armed with a stealth cruise missile might be able to strike assets deep inside the enemy territory.

Stealth On Stealth Combination

Despite having a relatively stealthy design the B-2s are still vulnerable to attacks from evolving opponent-integrated air defense networks particularly from potential near-peer enemies. These networks are also becoming more common. For instance China has a very sophisticated system of Anti Access/Area Denial (A2/AD) as acknowledged by USAF Pacific Commander General Kenneth Wilsbach in March this year.

This is where the stealthy cruise missiles come in. With their long-range and stealth capabilities the missiles could be fired from a range where air defenses do not intercept the strategic bomber.

Miguel Miranda a Philippines-based military analyst said “It’s always helpful to acknowledge the Big 4 adversaries of the USA in this era we live in. These are China Russia Iran and North Korea.

All these countries have mature networked air defenses and some level of anti-access weaponry; the Chinese probably have the most comprehensive arsenal today. The JASSM and the JASSM-ER are badly needed when up against these threats.”

“Regarding the B-2 Spirit and its role in launching the JASSM-ER it’s best to remember these are just tests conducted by Northrop Grumman and the US Air Force. A wide range of aircraft can carry the munition itself” he added.

It is also pertinent to note that the JASSM-ER is not only a long-range cruise missile but also hard to intercept due to its stealth feature. For a while now the US has had a capability gap concerning China and Russia as these two have operational hypersonic missiles unlike the United States which is still some time away from fielding.

EurAsian Times reached out to Abhijit Iyer Mitra a senior fellow at the Institute of Peace and Conflict Studies and a military expert to understand if the USAF was trying to level up against adversaries that possess hypersonic weapons.

He states “Hypersonic missiles may be swift but locking on and targeting becomes very difficult at that speed. This principle was proven when several western ships managed to jam Russian supersonic missiles because of the kind of weak electronic shielding that they may have.

The same could be possible with hypersonic missiles because the reaction time of the missile would be highly suspected once it emerges over the horizon how quickly it acquires the target etc.

The JASSM-ER is a subsonic (relatively slower) stealth missile meaning the entire missile flight path remains concealed from the enemy radars. So even when it emerges over the horizon its small size becomes an advantage.

When B-2 emerges over the horizon it will become visible due to its size — stealth or no stealth. However the missile would not become visible because it will still be a tiny target when it emerges over the radar. It will leave very little reaction time as the radar won’t be able to detect it till the final 2-3 kilometers when it would be too late.

That’s the main thing about stealth on stealth. So the enemy defenses might end up tracking the plane but it is possible that they don’t know where the missile is.”

Since the Air Force removed the traditional AGM-86C and D versions of the Air-Launched Cruise Missile (ALCM) which were carried by the B-52H the JASSM-significance ER has only increased.

In addition the B-2’s standoff strike capabilities will likely become more crucial over time. For its part the JASSM-ER could be expected to make it to B-21’s weaponry."

ANNE KALOSH Katy Perry wows the crowd

The singer called it a 'bucket list' trip.

Her lengthy set capped a rich christening program that laced humorous moments with emotional ones.

Knut Kloster tribute

NCL paid tribute its founder and one of the fathers of modern cruising the late Knut Kloster.

'For my father like generations before him the ocean represented opportunity ... and cruising brought people together' said his daughter Kristin Kloster Aasen to a standing ovation.

The show opened with a funny video of NCL President and CEO Harry Sommer 'helping' the crew get Norwegian Prima ready — hanging a painting (upside down) making a stateroom bed (sort of) and mixing a cocktail (to comic effect). Sommer also invited crew to the stage as the audience cheered.

Icelandic musician and 2021 Eurovision contestant Daði Freyr performed a frisky musical set. US radio personality Elvis Duran the godfather of Norwegian Bliss said a few words.

Frank Del Rio strikes an emotional chord

Frank Del Rio president and CEO of Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings struck an emotional chord.

'There's a lot to celebrate' Del Rio said as he spoke of the 'wonderful almost surreal feeling to see so many familiar faces and lots of new ones' in the audience as the cruise industry emerges from 'one of the most difficult periods we'll ever face in our lifetime.'

Everyone present faced uncertainty but had 'one thing in common: You never ever gave up' Del Rio said. 'After this experience I hope we all realize how much we need each other.'

He acknowledged travel advisors loyal guests trade media Fincantieri leaders NCLH Chairman Russell Galbut and the board Sommer and the 36000 NCLH employees.

Del Rio talked about the crew being grounded for 500 days when the company had 'no revenue and them not earning their livelihoods. Every day that would break my heart' he said.

But now 'We're back.' The fleet is in service and three new ships are coming in 2023: Norwegian Viva Oceania Cruises' Vista and Regent Seven Seas Cruises' Seven Seas Grandeur.

'Everyone's going to win'

Those and more spell $9bn in new tonnage for NCLH and 'We'll grow in a sustainable manner' Del Rio said. 'Everyone's going to win. That's why we're here. To be profitable and provide jobs ...

'... Today is the onset to a bright future as the public's pent-up demand for travel coincides with our growth.'

Norwegian Prima Christened

A cruise ship’s christening ceremony is always a special occasion and even more so when the event introduces an entirely new class of vessels.

“We have been eagerly anticipating and preparing for this special event for several years so we are delighted to embark on NCL’s next chapter with Norwegian Prima” said Harry Sommer president and chief executive officer of Norwegian Cruise Line.

You can watch some highlights of the christening ceremony below:

“It’s been a joy to see our vision come to life with this landmark christening ceremony which sets the tone for the unparalleled holidays guests will enjoy for years to come. We are so thankful to our team members and partners worldwide who have made Norwegian Prima a stunning reality.”

The ceremony in Iceland’s capital and largest city included a variety of notable events to welcome the new cruise ship. To mark the occasion more than 2500 guests enjoyed an immersive experience in the beautiful city ideal for a christening celebration like no other.

Multiple musical performances preceded the official christening and Norwegian Prima‘s godmother Katy Perry took to the main stage to officially name the vessel with the ceremonial champagne bottle break across the ship’s hull.

About Norwegian Prima

The first of six ordered Prima-class ships Norwegian Prima is set to redesign the cruise experience for Norwegian Cruise Line. This represents the first new class for the cruise line since the Breakaway class debuted with Norwegian Breakaway in 2013.

Norwegian Prima however is a completely new experience for guests.

“With her stunning design and unique offerings Norwegian Prima is in a league of her own” said Del Rio. “As the industry’s most spacious new cruise ship featuring ‘only-available-on-Prima-experiences’ she is continuing NCL’s legacy of industry firsts.”

At 965 feet (294 meters) long weighing in at more than 143500 gross tons and with capacity for 3100 guests at double occupancy Norwegian Prima offers the highest staffing levels and space ratio of any contemporary or premium cruise ship.

In fact Norwegian Prima – unlike the newest cruise ships for Carnival Cruise Line and Royal Caribbean International – is not the largest ship in the Norwegian fleet nor does she have the highest guest capacity.

What she does have is one-of-a-kind firsts that will redefine cruising for eager guests. Norwegian Prima boasts the largest variety of suites available at sea including the ultra-premium “ship within a ship” concept The Haven.

The ship offers phenomenal activities for all ages including The Rush and The Drop the fastest slides at sea as well as the Prima Speedway the first three-level racetrack on a cruise ship. The Ocean Boulevard is a 44000 square-foot outdoor walkway wrapping around the entire ship while The Concourse boasts a multi-million dollar outdoor sculpture garden for amazing reflective moments.

Infinity Beach is the ideal space to slow down and relax with its series of infinity pools while guests can also focus on their well-being at the breathtaking Mandara Spa with a wide range of treatment options and unique ways to relax including the first charcoal sauna at sea.

Norwegian Prima is just days away from her inaugural voyage which will set sail on September 3 from Amsterdam visiting several ports before arriving at Copenhagen on September 13.

The ship will offer two other inaugural tour sailings in northern Europe before departing for the U.S. where she will several voyages from New York Galveston and Miami before spending much of the winter season sailing from Port Canaveral Florida.

In 2023 Norwegian Prima will return to New York and then Europe before homeporting from Galveston Texas in late 2023 and into 2024.

The ship will be joined by the next Prima-class vessel Norwegian Viva in late summer 2023 and there are four additional Prima-class ships already ordered with deliveries planned for 2024 2025 2026 and 2027."

However it looks like the most recent price cuts haven't done particularly well in moving inventory and as such both companies are now preparing for a more brutal round of price cuts promotions and discounts on their existing lineup.

AMD & NVIDIA Prepare For A More Brutal Round of GPU Price Cuts For September To Clear Away Inventories Fast

The latest report comes from MyDrivers who are quoting industry sources within Taiwan and a major Taiwanese Economic news outlet. It is stated that the current round of price cuts hasn't moved inventory in a way that AMD & NVIDIA plus their partners hoped for. As such a second round of price cuts is underway one which will exceed the price drops we have seen so far on current-gen GPUs. Following is the statement:

The sound of graphics card price cuts has been heard for a long time but many users are not aware of it. According to the revelations of Taiwan Economic Daily the main reason is that manufacturers are still discussing better preferential measures with dealers . According to the latest news from Taiwan Economic Daily the industry's destocking is not as good as expected. Graphics card manufacturers will start a new wave of price cuts from September mainly NVIDIA and AMD products and the price cuts will far exceed the previous efforts which can be better to alleviate cost pressures. MyDrivers (Machine Translated)

These new price cuts are said to take place in September and will mainly be imposed by AIBs on their existing stock of chips. NVIDIA & AMD have asked their partners both board partners and retailers to get rid of excess inventory of GPUs to make room for the next generation. NVIDIA is already working on clearing away its stock with CEO Jensen Huang stating that they will be doing so over the next few quarters.

The situation of the excess inventory isn't expected to improve dramatically till 2023 considering the economic position and overall lower demand within the PC segment. Plus with crypto floods making several used GPUs enter the market there's little reason for consumers to buy a brand new graphics card this late in their lifecycle. The previous price cuts are already being offered on various GPUs from AMD & NVIDIA but for those who have really been looking to buy a graphics card & can't hold it off till next-gen I suggest you wait till next month to see what kind of price cuts are coming in next for you.

As I mentioned earlier this week the AMD Radeon & NVIDIA GeForce GPU prices will continue to drop across the board and there are also some major price cuts expected by the end of this month so don't be shocked if those RTX 3090s drop below $1000 US in a few weeks.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiuQFodHRwczovL3d3dy5ub3RlYm9va2NoZWNrLm5ldC9OdmlkaWEtR2VGb3JjZS1SVFgtNDA2MC1UaS1hbmQtR2VGb3JjZS1SVFgtNDA2MC0zRE1hcmstVGltZS1TcHktRXh0cmVtZS1zY29yZXMtcG93ZXItdXNhZ2UtYW5kLWF2ZXJhZ2UtY2xvY2stc3BlZWRzLXNob3djYXNlZC1ieS1za2V0Y2h5LWxlYWsuNjQzMjgxLjAuaHRtbNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Nvidia GeForce RTX 4060 Ti and GeForce RTX 4060 3DMark Time Spy Extreme scores power usage and average ...,"A new leak says that the Nvidia GeForce RTX 4060 Ti and GeForce RTX 4060 score about 8600 and 6000 points on the 3DMark Time Spy Extreme benchmark. The former consumes around 275 Watts of power and performs on par with a GeForce RTX 3080 and the latter trades blows with a GeForce RTX 3060 Ti while drawing 240 Watts.

UPDATE 09/09/2022: The leaker in question has admitted that they fabricated the information. Notebookcheck would like to apologise to our readers for any misunderstanding caused by news coverage of this matter.

ORIGINAL STORY



Over the past few weeks multiple leaks have provided insights into Nvidia's Ada Lovelace-based RTX 4000 graphics cards. As expected the GeForce RTX 4080 and RTX 4090 will outperform the reigning champion the GeForce RTX 3090 Ti while the GeForce RTX 4070 and RTX 4070 Ti will try and keep up with it. Now a report from a relatively new (and unknown) leaker sheds light on how their younger siblings the GeForce RTX 4060 Ti and GeForce RTX 4060 hold up.

@QbitLeaks has allegedly stumbled upon test boards presumably running an early iteration of the graphics cards. The GeForce RTX 4060 Ti draws between 270 W and 280 W of power and is clocked at approximately 2600 MHz. This configuration allows it to score 8600 in the 3D Mark Time Spy Extreme benchmark putting it on par with the GeForce RTX 3080. Lastly the GeForce RTX 4060 Ti is expected to run an AD104-180 GPU with 6144 CUDA cores and feature 10 GB of 17.5 Gbps memory on a 160-bit bus.

Its younger sibling the Nvidia GeForce RTX 4060 scores about 6000 points in the same benchmark while drawing ~240 Watts of power. It is clocked slightly higher at ~2700 MHz. The score is roughly the same as a GeForce RTX 3060 Ti (200 W TGP). A previous leak speculated that the GeForce RTX 4060 would use an AD106-300 GPU with 3968 CUDA cores along with 8 GB of 17 Gbps memory on a 128-bit bus resulting in a total memory bandwidth of 272 GB/s. It is quite odd especially when the previous-generation GeForce RTX 3060's GA106-300 GPU had a 192-bit bus and 12 GB of 15 Gbps VRAM for a total memory bandwidth of 360 GB/s. That said it is common for OEMs to try different configurations for their GPUs and the final result could be something else entirely.

Ada Lovelace brings a near two-node upgrade over Ampere. Hence the performance gains should be a lot more significant than what is portrayed. However the GeForce RTX 4060 Ti and GeForce RTX 4060 in question are almost certainly unpolished and one can expect the finished product to perform better. Furthermore the xx60 series of graphics cards are usually launched well after the high-end SKUs are out and about. Ada Lovelace already has some potential delays in the cards so it is very likely that the GeForce RTX 4060 and GeForce RTX 4060 Ti might not see the light of day until Q3 or even Q4 of 2023 giving Nvidia a lot of time to iron out any kinks.

While our peers at GamesRadar are right to wonder how this thing will ever run on Nintendo Switch its PC requirements strike me as pretty reasonable for a big budget open world RPG.

Hogwarts Legacy minimum requirements (1080p 60fps low settings)

OS: Windows 10

API: DirectX 12

Processor: Intel Core i5-8400 or AMD Ryzen 5 2600

Memory: 8 GB RAM

Graphics: Nvidia GeForce GTX 1070 or AMD RX Vega 56

Storage: 85 GB available space (SSD preferred)

Upscale Performance Setting

Hogwarts Legacy recommended requirements (1080p 60fps high settings)

OS: Windows 10

API: DirectX 12

Processor: Intel Core i7-8700 or AMD Ryzen 5 3600

Memory: 16 GB RAM

Graphics: Nvidia GeForce 1080 Ti or AMD RX 5700 XT

Storage: 85 GB available space (SSD preferred)

Upscale Quality Setting

I initially had a bit of sticker shock at the GTX 1070 as a minimum graphics choice the same as Elden Ring's suggested minimum but that's not really fair. The 1070's over six years old now quite long in the tooth for a mid-high tier card. The fact that it will apparently push 1080p resolution and 60fps performance in a 2023 AAA release is actually pretty stunning.

""Minimum"" performance has come a long way since the horrendous Games For Windows Live 720p/30fps-locked Dark Souls: Prepare to Die Edition port. Thrifty gamers out there might be able to squeeze more resolution/frame rate-compromised experiences out of Legacy with even older hardware.

The game's performance seems like it'll be helped along by image reconstruction tech—the ""Upscale Quality/Performance Setting"" mentioned in the requirements. It seems to be Avalanche's own solution or AMD's FSR as Nvidia DLSS would not work with the older GTX and Radeon cards in these specs.

I'm a bit puzzled by the proverbial half-step up for the game's recommended settings⁠—1080p 60fps with High settings on a similarly withered i7-8700/GTX 1080 Ti combo. This space might have been better used to suggest hardware for higher resolutions but this is a decent enough start and a strictly theoretical conversation for the time being. We'll have to wait until February 10 to see how Hogwarts Legacy actually performs.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiSWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRvbXNoYXJkd2FyZS5jb20vbmV3cy9pbnRlbC14ZXNzLXRlY2hub2xvZ3ktZGVtby1hbmQtb3ZlcnZpZXfSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Intel Details Inner Workings of XeSS,"Intel released an explainer video for its upcoming XeSS AI upscaling technology and showcased how the tech works on its nearly ready for public release Arc Alchemist GPUs. It used the fastest Arc A770 for the demonstrations though it's difficult to say how the performance will stack up against the best graphics cards based on the limited performance details shown.



If you're at all familiar with Nvidia's DLSS which has been around for four years now in various incarnations the video should spark a keen sense of Deja Vu. Tom Petersen who formerly worked for Nvidia and gave some of the old DLSS presentations walks through the XeSS fundamentals. Long story short XeSS sounds very much like a mirrored version of Nvidia's DLSS except it's designed to work with Intel's deep learning XMX cores rather than Nvidia's tensor cores. The tech can also work with other GPUs however using DP4a mode which might make it an interesting alternative to AMD's FSR 2.0 upscaler.



In the demos shown by Intel XeSS looked to be working well. Of course it's difficult to say for sure when the source video is a 1080p compressed version of the actual content but we'll save detailed image quality comparisons for another time. Performance gains look to be similar to what we've seen with DLSS with over a 100% frame rate boost in some situations when using XeSS Performance mode.

How It Works

If you already know how DLSS works Intel's solution is largely the same but with some minor tweaks. XeSS is an AI accelerated resolution upscaling algorithm designed to increase frame rates in video games.



It starts with training the first step in most deep learning algorithms. The AI network takes lower resolution sample frames from a game and processes them generating what should be upscaled output images. Then the network compares the results against the desired target image and back propagates weight adjustments to try and correct any ""errors."" At first the resulting images won't look very good but the AI algorithm slowly learns from its mistakes. After thousands (or more) of training images the network eventually converges toward ideal weights that will ""magically"" generate the desired results.



Once the algorithm has been fully trained using samples from lots of different games it can in theory take any image input from any video game and upscale it almost perfectly. As with DLSS (and FSR 2.0) the XeSS algorithm also takes on the role of anti-aliasing and replaces classical solutions like temporal AA.

Again nothing so far is particularly noteworthy. DLSS and FSR 2.0 and even standard temporal AA algorithms have a lot of the same core functionality — minus the AI stuff for FSR and TAA. Games will integrate XeSS into their rendering pipeline typically after the main render and initial effects are done but before post processing effects and GUI/HUD elements are drawn. That way the UI stays sharp while the difficult task of 3D rendering gets to run at a lower resolution.



XeSS operates on Intel's Arc XMX cores but it can also run on other GPUs in a slightly different mode. DP4a instructions are basically four INT8 (8-bit integer) calculations done using a single 32-bit register what you'd typically have access to via a GPU shader core. XMX cores meanwhile natively support INT8 and can operate on 128 values at once.



That might seem very lopsided but as an example an Arc A380 has 1024 shader cores that could each do four INT8 operations at the same time. Alternatively the A380 has 128 MXM units that can each do 128 INT8 operations. That makes the MXM throughput four times faster than the DP4a throughput but apparently DP4a mode should still be sufficient for some level of XeSS goodness.



Note that DP4a appears to use a different trained network one that's perhaps less computationally intensive. How that will translate into real-world performance and image quality remains to be seen and it sounds like game developers will need to explicitly include support for both XMX and DP4a modes if they want to support non-Arc GPUs.

Intel XeSS Performance Expectations

Intel showed off a couple of gaming tests running XeSS including a development build of Shadow of the Tomb Raider and a new 3DMark benchmark specifically made for XeSS. It also showed brief clips of Arcadegeddon Redout II Ghostwire Tokyo The DioField Chronicle Chivalry II Naraka Bladepoint and Super People running with and without XeSS at the end of the video. Note that Intel has never shown XeSS running in DP4a mode which is something we still want to see.



In Shadow of the Tomb Raider running on an Arc A770 graphics card at 2560x1440 with nearly maxed out settings including ray traced shadows XeSS provided anywhere from about a 25% performance boost on the Ultra Quality setting up to a more than a 100% to frame rates at using the Performance setting. The Quality and Balanced settings go for a middle ground and improved performance by around 50% and 75% respectively.



Those gains will naturally vary by the game engine settings and base performance. The more demanding the game and the lower the framerate the more beneficial XeSS will likely be. Using the Performance mode Intel showed typical gains of anywhere from 40% to 110% at 1440p while the Balanced mode delivered improvements ranging from about 25% to as much as 75%.

3DMark will also be adding an Intel XeSS Feature Test for its Advanced edition which includes a benchmark mode as well as a Frame Inspector that allows users to look at images of the benchmark zooming in to check the visual quality differences. It looks a lot easier to use than Nvidia's ICAT utility though of course it's also limited to providing frames from a single synthetic benchmark.



Because 3DMark uses its demanding Port Royal ray tracing scene for the XeSS Feature Test performance gains can be particularly impressive. At 1440p with XeSS in performance mode the benchmark saw a 145% improvement in FPS 109% boost with Balanced mode 81% using Quality mode and 49% with Ultra Quality mode.



The Frame Inspector also showed some good results with XeSS reconstructing the image very well to the point where Intel's Tom Petersen argues the XeSS image actually looks better than native with TAA. Of course you need to take that with a grain of salt and images from a single canned sequence likely won't fully represent real-world gaming experiences.

XeSS SDK and More Than 20 Games in the Works

Intel will be providing an SDK for implementing XeSS in a game engine. The interface and requirements will be very similar to TAA implementations as well as DLSS and FSR 2.0 so it should be a relatively easy addition for any modern graphics engine.



Like TAA FSR 2.0 and DLSS XeSS needs motion vectors along with the current frame and it keeps its own collection of previous frames. These are all fed into the AI network to ultimately generate a good result. XeSS also uses camera jitter to help eliminate aliasing in the scene. (The jitter is on the sub-pixel level so it won't be directly visible to the end user.)



At present Intel has more than 20 games with XeSS planned for release in the coming months. Some of those may fall through the cracks or get delayed but it's at least a decent start for the newcomer. At the same time AMD just announced another eight games that have recently added or will soon be adding FSR 2.0 and Nvidia has well over 100 games shipping with DLSS 2.0 or later. How many game developers will be willing to add all three alternatives which would provide gamers with the choice of the best algorithm? We suspect a lot of games will only support one or two of the possible upscaling options.



XeSS will officially launch when Intel releases its Arc Alchemist GPUs worldwide at some point in the presumably near future. The Arc A380 has effectively launched at this point and Intel has now teased the A750 and A770. Hopefully we'll get to experience XeSS in both MXM and DP4a modes in the not too distant future. At present uptake remains very far behind the AMD and Nvidia competition.

NVIDIA's CEO recently confirmed that the next generation of RTX GPUs are coming soon and the company will officially reveal the underlying architecture of the RTX 40 series of GPUs at GTC 2022. A new leak now suggests that the upcoming entry-level RTX 4060 Ti GPU might even outperform the flagship grade RTX 3080 GPU.

According to the tipster QbitLeaks the NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4060 Ti will have a TGP of 270-280W with an average clock speed of around 2600MHz. It is also said that the RTX 4060 Ti will score over 8600 points on the 3D Mark Time Spy Extreme test outperforming the RTX 3080.

The RTX 4060 Ti will be based on the AD104-180-A1 GPU consisting of 6144 CUDA cores. Along with that the GPU will also have 10GB of GDDR6 video memory with a bandwidth of 17Gbps.

Well it seems 4060 and 4060 Ti have been tested



4060 Ti: TSE ~8600 avg clock 26XX power draw ~270-280W.



4060: TSE ~6000 avg clock 27XX power draw ~230-240W. — FCL (@QbitLeaks) August 26 2022

At launch the RTX 4060 is expected to be the most affordable next-generation GPU from NVIDIA and this graphics card will have a TGP of 230-240W with an average clock speed of 2700MHz. The RTTX 4060 will be based on the AD106-300 GPU with 3968 CUDA cores and 8GB memory with 17Gbps memory speed.

When it comes to performance the RTX 4060 is said to clock a score of 6000 points on the 3D Mark Time Spy Extreme test. Looking at this number the RTX 4060 should match the performance of the RTX 3070/3070 Ti and is expected to sell in large numbers.

NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4060 RTX 4060 Ti Launch Date

NVIDIA is expected to launch the next generation of RTX 40 series GPUs at the beginning of 2023. These GPUs are expected to deliver better performance and are also likely to be more expensive than their predecessors. We should get more information on these GPUs in the next few weeks.

When Bruce and Winnie Meyers sold Meyers Manx to Phillip Sarofim and designer Freeman Thomas in 2020 the transaction left many questioning what the new owners would do with the company known for its dune buggy kit car based on a 60-year-old Volkswagen platform. Sure they could keep knocking out bright little fiberglass bodies based on Bruce’s brilliant original design but Sarofim and Thomas don't seem like guys who want to run a small-scale nostalgia business.



Recently we got a look at the new offering from Meyers Manx. The latest iteration of the classic dune buggy is a complete redesign that maintains the retro looks of the original but is powered by electric motors and promises notable improvements to performance and comfort. The Manx 2.0 was well-received and during The Quail (an event which like the Pebble Beach Concours d'Elegance is part of Monterey Car Week) we had a chance to sit and talk with Thomas about the challenges and thrills of reworking a vehicle as legendary as the Manx.



Photo credit: Car and Driver

C/D: The Manx 2.0 won’t be a kit car like the original Manx and will instead be a street-legal turn-key car right? What kind of testing does it need to do?

Freeman Thomas: Correct. It will be turn-key. This fits under the new low-volume vehicle act [an NHTSA regulation that allows for small companies to build and sell classic-themed cars without having to do all the testing a large OEM must do]. It allows us to build up to 325 of these vehicles a year.



But we want to make sure that the vehicle has integrity and that it works as an everyday vehicle. We're developing a door system with windows air conditioning and heating. We want to make sure that the suspension handles right. It isn’t based on an old VW now it’s a lightweight aluminum monocoque that's also a crash structure and the roll bar and roll cage will tie in beautifully to this.

C/D: Are you building this in-house or are you working with another company?

FT: A combination of both. We're developing it in-house and working with a manufacturing partner.

C/D: Would you say this new one is more street-oriented than the original dune buggy?

FT: We want it to be as capable as the original and then of course there will be versions that will be more extreme to cater to people's tastes. The first one that we will start producing will be a great all-arounder.

C/D: Is there anything on the new Manx that is a VW part?

FT: The headlight bucket. Currently the front suspension on this design prototype is also Volkswagen but we are evolving that.

C/D: How about the body itself is it still fiberglass?

FT: On this design prototype the body is actually carbon fiber but for production we're looking at a lot of different options including thermoforming. Thermoforming is recyclable as well which we like and you can do it with the color impregnated into the material. It’s important on a Manx to offer a wide color range and the big metal flakes. So we may have different types of materials or processes for the bodies depending on the customer’s color choice.

C/D: Do you envision special editions maybe referencing other Manx variants such as a Mod Top or a Tow’d?

FT: Absolutely. Because a Manx it’s really a canvas. It can be serious fun playful or retro. We could do a version with a bright color and white wheels a white top and a fun interior. It’s really a chameleon. It can adapt to anybody's taste.

C/D: Are you going to race one? Hit up Baja the way Bruce did?

FT: There's technology that we're looking at for racing but that's a separate discussion right now. I do like the idea of testing what you build via racing.

C/D: Was it difficult to try and reenvision the Manx in a way that made it an evolution in a good way rather than you know a bummer?

FT: It’s a high-wire act. This was one of the most challenging things I've done in my design career. First of all it's an icon and we want to take this icon to a wider broader audience without losing that magic and the secret sauce that made the original. We knew that if we did it wrong it would be highly criticized. Getting all the feedback from the reveal and from today has really given us a lot of confidence that we're doing the right thing.

C/D: What was the most challenging part of redesigning the Manx?

FT: The rear end is completely new. Because it doesn't have an engine hanging out the back I didn't want it to be a gaping hole or some pretend engine. It’s about the honesty of design. The body looks similar but every single surface has more volume to the radius and corner and that animates it a little bit more.

C/D: Is there still a flat spot on the fender to rest your beer?

FT: Of course of course.

C/D: Do you have a favorite Bruce Meyers story?

FT: There are many. One of my favorites is the way that he developed the height of the shoulder here the beltline [Thomas pats the side of the Manx]. He had the mock-up in his shed by the beach and he had a piece of wood mounted that he could raise and lower to test the height and angle. He was friends with the local abalone divers and they’d come in to hang out and he’d ask their input on his mock-up and eventually they got it all locked in and later he found out it was the exact height of a rowboat just like the divers getting into a rowboat. But it’s perfect comfortable and high enough to feel safe. You don’t feel vulnerable.

C/D: What do you think made Bruce’s design so long-lasting?

FT: Bruce was just such a wonderful fun spirited whimsical soul. That’s what I wanted to instill in the car. It’s not threatening. It's fun it's playful but at the same time it's serious. You know the seriousness of Old Red [the first Manx in which Bruce Meyers set a Baja peninsula record in 1967] is the way it's engineered—its capability its accomplishments. We tried to take the same approach with this but everything is a modern element of what was there.

The championship point leader captured the “win & you’re in” Vermont 200 qualifier victory on Friend Construction Night and he was joined in victory lane throughout the night by four drivers who earned the first wins of their careers – Gary English Ed Bell Brian Blake and Raelin Dunham.

Three-time champion Stone from Middlebury was both lucky and good; he was lucky enough to draw the number-one starting position in both his qualifying heat and the 30-lap Sunoco Sportsman Modified feature and he was good enough to lead every lap he ran all night long. The caution-free feature race was done in just over 11 minutes from the initial pace lap off pit road to the checkered flag.

Justin Comes continued his hot streak to drive from eighth place to finish second and Tanner Siemons grabbed a podium finish in third. Sophomore driver Shawn McPhee picked up his third top-five finish of the month in fourth place and Justin Stone – the winner’s son – completed the top five finishers. Rounding out the top 10 in order were Marty Kelly III of Shaftsbury David Boisclair Jimmy Davis Walt Hammond Jr. and Vince Quenneville.

By virtue of his “win & you’re in” victory – the 45th overall win of his career at the track – Todd Stone has a guaranteed starting position in the richest dirt Sportsman Modified event in the world: The $10000-to-win Fabian Earth Moving Vermont 200 at Devil’s Bowl on Sept. 4.

Gary English topped the list of first-time winners scoring in the 25-lap O’Reilly Auto Parts Limited Sportsman race. The Salisbury racer in his third year behind the wheel led the first seven laps of the race before Alex Layn took over after a restart. Layn looked like a first-time winner himself but English got a second chance with a lap-17 restart and reclaimed the point.

English held on through a final caution period with five laps left to seal the deal and was greeted by a happy crowd in the winner’s circle. Layn posted the runner-up finish ahead of Bill Duprey John Gosselin and Josh LeClaire.

Ed Bell won a highly competitive 20-lap feature for the Hoosier Daddy Racing Rookie Sportsman division notching his first-ever victory. Russ Farr led the first half of the race before spinning off the top of turn 3 at lap 12 allowing Bell to take over. After the final restart on lap 14 Orwell racer Bell engaged in an exciting four-way battle for the win with his cousin Daryl Gebo and Kamden Duffy and Josh Bussino.

Gebo nosed ahead to lead lap 16 but Bell led the final four circuits as the foursome sliced and diced with each other every step of the way. Gebo finished second with Bussino edging Duffy for third. Randy Edson completed the top five.

Cornwall’s Brian Blake finally scored his first win in the Mini Stock division after almost three years of knocking on the door. Blake took the lead from Griff Mahoney one-third of the way through the 15-lap race and then held off hard-charging Chris Sumner for the win. Leading rookie Matt Wade finished third ahead of Griff Mahoney and Mark Mahoney.

T.J. Knight of Wells won the 10-lap Mini Stock B-Feature ahead of Carl LaPoint and Willie Rice.

Queensbury N.Y.’s Raelin Dunham was a popular first-time winner in the Friend Construction 500cc Mini Sprint division. The 16-year-old rookie took the lead on the first lap and led all 15 tours around the half-mile as she held off a race-long challenge from veteran driver John Smith. Gage Provencher made some late passes for third place ahead of Logan Denis and Ray Hanson.

Devil’s Bowl Speedway returns to action on Labor Day Weekend as Fabian Earth Moving presents the Vermont 200 on Saturday and Sunday.. All Sportsman Modified qualifying and the 200-lap main event paying $10000 to win will be held on Sunday.

Acquired

In hyperlocal news Franciscan Alliance bought a 5.3-acre lot in Munster just east of The Times of Northwest Indiana's main office.

The healthcare provider bought the vacant land at 651 45th St. just west of existing Franciscan medical office buildings in Munster. The site is free of the wetlands that inhibit the development of most of the still-vacant land in the area.

Antony Miocic director of office group at Crown Point-based Latitude Commercial represented the seller of the property.

“This is one of the few remaining infill lots in and around Munster"" Miocic said. ""It’s great for the municipality that an established medical provider is taking possession of this property.""

Sold

Beacon Street Properties bought two fully leased commercial properties in Lake County.

Crown Point-based Latitude Commercial brokered the transactions. The firm spent $3.07 million to buy the two retail properties with a combined square footage of 23988.

Beacon Street Properties acquired a shopping center anchored by O'Reilly Auto Parts on a 1.60-acre site near the busy intersection of Main Street and Summit Street in Crown Point where nearly 27000 vehicles pass per day.

The strip mall was built in 1991 and is now 100% occupied.

Latitude Commercial President Aaron McDermott brokered that deal as well as the purchase of a Class B office building at 20 E. U.S. 30 in Schererville. The two-story office sits on a 1.59-acre site on a busy stretch of the highway.

The 12022-square-foot office is 100% full and anchored by the real estate firm Century 21 Affiliated.",,,,,,

And you should know that ""close"" doesn't adequately describe their devoted relationships.



They had spent nearly a decade as confidants and constant companions while their husbands coached football first at Vanderbilt and then at Penn State.



They shared babysitters vacationed together helped each other when their kids got sick and did what the wives of college football coaches do everywhere – they bonded in order to make the long days and nights while their husbands were away doing their jobs more palpable.



The group text began a day or so after Thanksgiving. Ricky Rahne had previously stepped down as Penn State's offensive coordinator to become head coach at Old Dominion and his Monarchs had just won their last five games to become bowl eligible.



James Franklin is of course Penn State's head coach and Brent Pry was his defensive coordinator.



Amy Pry got things going by texting that her husband would be named head coach at Virginia Tech. The text messages started flying back and forth. ""I was so happy for Brent and Amy"" Jen Rahne said.



But then it stopped when Amy Pry texted ""Oh my God we play you!""



Jen Rahne realized that was true and not only do Tech and ODU play they meet in the season opener. The Hokies and Monarchs square off at S.B. Ballard Stadium Friday at 7 on ESPNU.



It will be Brent Pry's first game as a head coach and the game will attract a ton of national attention and especially attention in Penn State Nation. When Penn State's former defensive coordinator and offensive coordinator square off as head coaches that's big news in State College Pennsylvania.



Because both coaches hired liberally from Penn State many on both staffs not only know each other they are close friends.



Jen immediately realized the importance of the game and the mixed feelings that would be involved and texted; ""I need to take a moment.""



When they resumed texting Fumi texted ""Oh I'm so there. I'm coming to that game.""



As luck would have it Penn State plays at Purdue on Thursday night. So Fumi Franklin along with 22 other coaches wives and family members from Penn State are indeed coming to Norfolk.



They will be at Ricky and Jen Rahne's house watching the Nittany Lions Thursday night – Ricky will be with his team.



The next day the Penn Staters will tailgate with ODU's coaches' wives and families in a lot adjacent to the Webb Student Center.



And guess who's coming to the party?



Amy Pry.



And that wasn't always a given.



When Brent Pry and Ricky Rahne appeared at a Norfolk Sports Club forum this summer Pry said Amy and Jen will ""have a heck of a tailgate party.""



Not so fast Rahne replied. He said that while Jen is a wonderful person she is also very competitive and likely wouldn't share her tailgate with a Hokie not even her good friend Amy.



Ricky came home and mentioned Brent Pry's comments.



Jen agreed that she was indeed competitive. But she loves Amy Pry. So she called her and invited her.





Fumi Franklin Amy Pry and Jen Rahne



""I think so much of her"" Jen said. ""If I were to describe her in one word it would be loyal. She is loyal like nobody's business.



""That's why I asked her to come to the tailgate. There aren't many (opposing coaches' wives) I would invite to come see us on game day.



""But Amy she's special.""



The ties between the head coaches' wives are strong but the ties between the two programs also run long and deep. There may not be two FBS programs that share more connections than ODU and Virginia Tech.



ODU special teams coordinator Kevin Smith wide receivers coach Mark Dupuis and offensive coordinator Kevin Reihner all coached at Penn State with Pry and Rahne. Assistant Director of Strength and Conditioning Aaron Rittgers came to ODU in late 2018 after interning at Penn State and is in his fourth season with the Monarchs.



Tight ends coach Justin Harper was a standout for the Hokies from 2004-2007.



Defensive coordinator Blake Seiler and safeties coach Remington Rebstock coached at Kansas State when Franklin and Rahne worked there.



Director of Player Personnel Tristin Iannone came with Rahne from Penn State to ODU. Graduate assistant Michael Shuster played at Penn State.



So did standout tight end Zack Kuntz who was at Penn State for three years before transferring to ODU. Kuntz finished second in the nation last year among tight ends with 73 receptions.



""I'm still very close with the players there"" he said. ""We text quite a lot. They are still my guys.



""I'm also close with a lot of people on Virginia Tech's staff. Even their equipment manager was our equipment manager at Penn State.""



Tech offensive coordinator Tyler Bowen worked closely with Rahne and Pry at Penn State as well as Reihner. ""He was in my wedding"" Reihner said. ""We're very close.



""I think my wife is happy that we're playing each other. Our phone calls used to be three hours. We used to talk about football and schemes. Now we just kind of call each other and ask how the wives are and then there's a pregnant pause and we hang up.



""My wife gets a lot more time with me.""





Ryder and Ricky Rahne at left and Brent Pry third from the right before a Penn State game.



Virginia Tech wide receivers coach Fontel Mines was ODU's tight ends coach in 2021. In interviews last week he credited Rahne with giving him the room to grow as a coach.



Perhaps the most well-known member of Tech's staff among ODU fans is likely Dwight Galt IV who came to Norfolk from Penn State in 2019 to head the Monarchs' strength and conditioning program. Greg Allen his top assistant at ODU went with him to Blacksburg.



Defensive coordinator Chris Marve worked with Pry and Rahne at Vanderbilt. Associate Athletic Director and Chief of Staff Michael Hazel Assistant Director for Football Operations Kevin Jusznyski Football Operations Assistant Jake Schell Equipment Manager Stewart Carter and analyst Jan Johnson Jr. who played linebacker for the Nittany Lions all came to Blacksburg from State College.



Joe Joe Headen who starred at defensive back for ODU last season was recently hired to help Tech's recruiting efforts.



The final ODU connection at Tech is Executive Associate Director of Athletics John Ballein second only to Whit Babcock in the Hokies' athletic department.



Ballein got his master's degree at ODU while coaching high school football in Portsmouth and Chesapeake. Because he knew of ODU's great potential and because Tech recruited heavily in the Hampton Roads area he and then coach Frank Beamer agreed in 2012 to begin a series.



Tech signed a three-game deal with ODU that included a game in Norfolk. It was a breakthrough moment for ODU. The Monarchs were still in FCS and were moving up to FBS.



Tech's willingness to come to Norfolk signaled to other Power 5 schools that ODU was a place they should consider visiting. Since then the Monarchs have hosted North Carolina and North Carolina State and will be hosting Virginia and Wake Forest in future years.





Jen Rahne and Amy Pry



Ballein was Beamer's right-hand man and his family remains enmeshed with Tech football -- his daughter Jalyn Ballein is director of on-campus football recruiting.



When he sent a signed contract to Dr. Wood Selig ODU's director of athletics Ballein included a personal check made out to the Old Dominion Athletic Foundation.



""I'll always be a Hokie"" Ballein said at the time. ""But ODU will always be my alma mater.""



Ricky Rahne and Brent Pry carried on a fierce competition in practice when Pry's defense lined up against Rahne's offense at Penn State.



""I'm a competitive person and I don't hold my tongue very well and neither does Brent"" Rahne said.



""And coach Franklin wanted that. Compete is one of our three C's here (care and character are the others).



""We were going to compete because we wanted our players to compete. If we as coaches weren't going to compete and show passion what were the players going to do?""



They managed to put that competitive spirit away off the field.



""We had a great working relationship and a good friendship"" Rahne said.



And while they are close and think a lot of each other Rahne said their wives are closer.



""Our wives hung out together more than we did"" Rahne said. ""We hung out together at retreats or the (national coaches') convention or some recruiting or travel camp trips.



""But as a football coach when you get time off you want to spend it with your family. When we're working our wives spent a lot of time together. And as coaches we work a lot of hours.""



Franklin insisted on Penn State's football offices being open to families and Rahne and Pry carried that philosophy with them to Norfolk and Blacksburg. It's not unusual to see toddlers ambling around the L.R. Hill Sports Complex. Coaches and their wives or girlfriends also often host players for dinner.



The scene in the south end zone at S.B. Ballard Stadium after games last season was touching. Wives girlfriends and children would flock on the field to be with ODU's coaches.



Even so coaches are gone for weeks at a time recruiting and during football season there are no days off. If your husband coaches for a successful program he's often away during Christmas at a bowl game.



Amy Pry is something of an interior designer so she would direct Christmas decorating at the Franklin and Rahne households.



""My house never looked better"" Jen Rahne said.





Catherine Pry and Jake Rahne



While their husbands were on the road the Franklin Rahne and Pry families would pile into their cars and drive to Florida on an extended vacation at a home the Franklins own there.



It is a natural process across the nation for the wives to form a partnership Amy Pry said.



""You come into a new city and you don't know anyone"" she said. ""The wives become your support group.



""You have a need for companionship a need for family. You become family with other wives pretty quickly.



""You're there for the others when things are bad. They're there to help you when your children are sick. You need that support when your husband is gone and your mother's not there.



""Jen and I did so much together. We had babies together.



""We kind of grew up together.""



So did the Pry daughters Madeline and Catherine Franklin daughters Shola and Addison and Rahne's two boys Ryder and Jake. Pry's son Colby is a college freshman.



At one time Jen and Amy jokingly predicted that Ryder and Madeline would eventually date. But of course when the Rahnes moved to Norfolk that talk ended.



Ryder 13 has changed a lot since moving to Norfolk. He seems to have grown a foot and is now taller than his mother and an outstanding lacrosse player. Jake plays hockey and now that the family is close to Virginia Beach has taken up surfing.



Yet even as their lives changed they remain very close with the Franklin and Pry daughters Jen Rahne said.



""Wives have to be incredibly independent"" Jen Rahne said. ""But at the same point when your husband says 'We're leaving' you have to say 'OK I fully support you. Let's go.'



""That can be tough on the kids. That's one of the reasons all of these kids are so close. They understand each other. They know what they've all been through. They've all moved and had to make new friends.



""My boys understand that the Pry girls are going to start at a new school in September. They were just there.""



Jen Rahne said her husband and Brent Pry did not become really close until they left Vanderbilt for Penn State.



""They were the first guys on the staff to travel there"" she said.





Madeline Pry and Ryder Rahne



""They both took a suit two pairs of clothes and maybe a set of workout clothes and never came back to Nashville"" she added. ""They lived in a hotel and went to Target and bought all new clothes and just stayed in their rooms and worked.



""That's when they became close. They were evaluating every player at Penn State. Day and night.



""I'll never forget the time they finally left the office and went out to get a beer. They are go-get-a-beer guys guys you'd like to have a beer with. And they're in a college town and it took them so long before they went out.



""When it comes to buckling down and getting serious they do it.""



Pry joked that when he was offered the Tech job no one told him he would be opening at ODU.



""I hate that we have to square off in the first game"" he said. ""But it also makes it fun.



""Ricky's one of my best friends in coaching. Our wives are very close. You know we started this thing together with coach Franklin at Vanderbilt and that's been so very special.



""And I love what Ricky has done at Old Dominion. I was so excited when he got the job at Old Dominion. He's really turned things around there.""



While at Penn State Rahne had chances to take jobs at other FBS schools but never considered leaving until ODU approached him.



""I had been on campus and when I did my research I thought this was a place where we could build something special"" Rahne said. ""When there were other openings coach Franklin had never encouraged me to leave. But he encouraged me to go after the ODU job.""



Rahne has been a great fit in Norfolk. Tall good-looking and personable he has worked hard to promote a program whose fan base has dwindled under the weight of three losing seasons in a row and a fourth in which the Monarchs did not play.



ODU sold more than 12400 season tickets this season a 72 percent increase over last season and the opener with Tech is a few tickets away from selling out.



Rahne also thinks that Pry is the perfect fit at Virginia Tech. Although he was born in Altoona Pennsylvania Pry was raised in Lexington Virginia and has that western Virginia drawl that Hokie fans have found endearing.



Pry worked at Virginia Tech for three seasons under Beamer and legendary defensive coordinator Bud Foster.



""I've always thought he'd be a great fit there and part of it is his passion for that place"" Rahne said. ""No one respects coach Beamer and coach Foster more than he does.



""Not everybody is going to fit in every job. Brent is just a great fit there.""



Amy Pry said her husband speaks of Virginia Tech with reverence.



""If you ask Brent how he feels about Virginia Tech he swallows hard and starts to tear up a bit"" she said.







""I've seen it happen several times. It makes me love him even more.""



Asked to reveal something people might find surprising about Pry Rahne said it's his love of the Allman Brothers band.



""He loves his family more than anything"" Rahne said. ""I think football is second. I think. But it might be the Allman Brothers.



""I've been with him places when we've had a few hours he'd go visit the grave site of one of the Allman Brothers. It's a big deal a major deal in his life.""



Amy Pry said Rahne loves music as much as her husband does and the ODU coach concedes that's true. Rahne wasn't born until after the Beatles broke up but he is almost as taken with John Paul George and Ringo as Pry is with the Allman Brothers.



""But my taste is pretty eclectic"" he said. ""I like the Beatles a lot. I always have. But I like Nirvana. I like Punk. I like some country music.



""But I'm not going to act like when I lived in New York City that I didn't go to some places where John Lennon had been. Yeah we've got that in common. We both like live music. In that sense we are kindred spirits.""



Jen Rahne said she understands why Brent Pry is a good recruiter.



""Brent is a charmer"" she said. ""He's got a tiny bit of a twang in his voice and when he walks into a room he makes everyone smile.""



When the Rahne family got ready to leave State College for Norfolk it was Amy and Brent Pry who hosted their going-away party.



""We felt so fortunate and blessed to have Ricky and Jen in our lives"" Amy said. ""They have been amazing to us. We truly want them to be successful. I couldn't be happier for them.""



Amy Pry said she doesn't intend to spend a long time at ODU's tailgate.



""I don't want to make it awkward"" she said. ""I want to go there. I want to hug their necks. I'll be so excited to see them and maybe talk a little smack.



""I miss those girls. I miss their faces. It will be awesome and special to get back with them even if it's just for an hour. It will be an hour of cherished time because those ladies are so very special.""



Jen Rahne said she is expecting more than 50 people to attend the tailgate. Usually she and other wives prepare the food. But not this time.



""But I'm having it catered"" she said. ""That's one less thing to do.""



And she's going to provide ODU attire for the Penn State wives and family members to wear.



""If you're coming to our tailgate you're going to wear ODU gear"" she said.



This is but the first of 10 consecutive games between Tech and ODU which next year's game set for Lane Stadium in Blacksburg.



""We're throwing a big tailgate this year"" she said. ""But this gets reciprocated next year.



""I told Amy 'Next season I'm coming to your tailgate.' ""



As guys who coached together and ran similar offenses and defenses you'd think both sides would be well prepared for what they will face Friday night.



""One thing I've been careful not to do is think I can get into Brent's head and figure out what he's doing"" Rahne said. ""Every year things change personnel changes.



""Both teams will be making adjustments throughout the game.""



Reihner said that on gameday the fact that friends will be coaching against each other will be evident in pregame as they greet each other on the field.



Then it will all quickly be forgotten.



""In this profession you play against friends all the time"" he said.



""It's not usually to this extent and that's certainly a neat layer to the game.



""But at some point it's simply going to be just a game.



""We're not going to be thinking of the guys across the field. That doesn't enter your mine during a game. All we're going to be thinking about is trying to beat a very good football team.""

The lineman was injured with 11:59 left to go in the second quarter.

With injuries stacking up in Arizona’s trenches Coward has seen his preseason action increase each week.

After seeing 24 reps (36% of available offensive snaps) in the team’s win over the Cincinnati Bengals he saw 65 snaps (96%) the following week against the Baltimore Ravens. Only fellow tackle Josh Miles saw more snaps in the loss to Baltimore.

Coward was signed by Arizona on Aug. 2.

While the lineman figures to be among the team’s final cuts he could be a candidate for the Cardinals’ practice squad.

Coward who turns 28 years old in November was an undrafted defensive lineman out of Old Dominion in 2017.

However after signing on with the Chicago Bears then-head coach Matt Nagy converted Coward to an offensive lineman for the 2018 season.

The 6-foot-5 319-pound Coward started 10 games at right guard in place of the injured Kyle Long in 2019.

In his four-year career Coward has played a total of 30 games 15 of which have been starts — all with the Bears. He can play either guard or tackle.

Arizona holds a 7-6 lead in the second quarter.

You shouldn’t be surprised.

Not only is the Silver State’s Republican Party nuttier than a jar of Planter’s cashews but Nevada is also a familiar setting for a chief alchemist of Donald Trump’s Big Lie fool’s gold slippery software guru Dennis Montgomery.

Lindell’s lawyers are attempting to intervene in a long-churning litigation in U.S. District Court between Montgomery and Reno-based software company eTreppid Technologies (first reported by The Nevada Independent) in hopes of obtaining information that will help the defense of the Dominion defamation case. In order to do that he’ll have to persuade a judge to lift a protective order that cloaks certain evidence from public view in the eTreppid case. The protective order has been in place since Aug. 29 2007.

Lindell claims the data he used to bolster his claims that Dominion machines were “hacked to manipulate the results of the election” came from Montgomery. Lindell has also been sued for defamation by voting machine company Smartmatic and in May he saw his own lawsuit against the company dismissed as frivolous.

But being frivolous has never stopped a Trump true believer and it certainly hasn’t deterred Lindell. In an Aug. 20 filing in the eTreppid case Lindell “sought to use “testimony and evidence concerning Montgomery’s background and his work for U.S. intelligence agencies and the information from Montgomery itself to defend the reasonability and veracity of his allegedly defamatory statements in the D.C. litigation.

“The information that Lindell in part relied upon the Data comprises internet transmissions sent during the 2020 election that were collected by technology Montgomery developed and previously licensed to the US government” the filing states.

In addition to all espousing the standard Big Lie fairy tales about millions of dead Americans voting for Joe Biden in 2020 Lindell has called his sweeping victory the “biggest cybercrime in the world.” That’s not considered defamation. That’s just a lie.

So is the grand conspiracy Lindell has woven about how 12 countries conspired to rob his hero of a second term by breaking into election office voting systems to reduce the number of Trump voters. How do you say “complete horse manure” in a dozen languages?

Lindell rose to creepy celebrity hugging his “Made in America” pillows on television. His attempt to parlay that fame into political prominence has lost not only its corny cache but millions in company profits as repulsed retailers have increasingly rejected his product.

Now he’s on his way to losing many more millions in court cases after spreading malignant theories free of facts that not only have hurt the credibility of Dominion Voting Systems but the public’s faith in the American voting process.

Lindell seems hellbent on self-righteous self-destruction. Lindell can’t stop shadowboxing with election conspiracies and in August 2021 held a South Dakota “cyber symposium” gathering that attracted a Star Wars saloon full of like-minded oddballs including Nevada Republican Secretary of State candidate and certified election denier Jim Marchant.

In promoting his particular brand of crazy Lindell uttered one of my favorite moments in a CNN interview around the time of the South Dakota cyber circus.

“I’m not wrong” he said. “I’ve spent millions. You need to trust me and come here.”

Now Lindell through his lawyers has come to Nevada with a plea to lift the protective order in the eTreppid litigation because he relied on Montgomery’s ahem expertise in as a cyber expert and believed he had proof that “voting machine manufacturers and their employees were hacked several times” and had worked in “illegal US government surveillance programs.”

It’s all pretty mysterious stuff. If only Montgomery possessed a lick of credibility. His scandalous history as a self-styled high-tech expert is a rich and malodorous one. But his role in whipping up conspiracy hysteria about widespread voter fraud in the 2020 presidential election puts him in a class by himself. The man who once conned the CIA and other federal agencies out of $20 million with phony claims he’d developed software capable of decoding al Qaeda terrorist plots secretly transmitted during Al Jazeera network broadcasts outdid himself in Trump’s great snipe hunt.

Right-wing media trumpeted Montgomery’s claim that he’d “invented” the super-secret “Hammer” and “Scorecard” software programs that had been purloined by the Obama administration in an effort to rig the election. Montgomery’s misinformation helped fire up the base in cross-eyed articles in such publications as The American Report which proclaimed “Biden Using SCORECARD and THE HAMMER to Steal Another U.S. Presidential Election.”

After reinventing himself as an “aggrieved whistleblower” as The Daily Beast put it Montgomery sued President Barack Obama former FBI Director James Comey and other officials with a claim that he had possessed 47 hard drives full of evidence linking the government to an illegal surveillance program.

This is the Montgomery who once accused Nevada Congressman and future Gov. Jim Gibbons of bribery in association with the eTreppid scandal. After an investigation and a lot of public controversy Gibbons was cleared of wrongdoing.

This is the same cyber expert who ran up $1.8 million in gambling debts at Strip casinos. Apparently he was still working on that blackjack system software.

After his cyber scamming was exposed Montgomery still managed to hook Arizona Sheriff and far-right crimefighter Joe Arpaio’s department for $124000 from the informant fund.

But a personal favorite Montgomery moment was the cyber scam that hooked the CIA and other federal watchdogs for lucrative contracts. After The New York Times exposed the fakery Montgomery’s former attorney Michael Flynn called his ex-client “a conman” and noted “The government knew this technology was bogus but these guys paid millions for it.”

All of this was easily available to Lindell of course but he wasn’t looking for it. He promoted the QAnon-inspired voter fraud conspiracy as it morphed from one shadowy villain to the next.

I’m not sure what dark secrets are tucked away under that protective order but it’s hard to imagine anything that will help refute his claims that Dominion’s former director of product strategy and security Eric Coomer was a traitor to the country and committed treason as the lawsuit against Lindell alleges.

Coomer has endured death threats that have put himself his family friends and work colleagues at risk according to the lawsuit. And the danger is real and ongoing:

“This conduct is so outrageous in character and extreme in degree as to go beyond all possible bounds of decency. It should be regarded as atrocious and determined intolerable in a civilized community.”

Lockhart is known as the BBQ capital of Texas and soon it may be known for something else too.

Micron is one of the largest semiconductor companies in the world with products used in cars computers phones and more.

The company has filed applications through the State's Comptroller's Office for tax breaks in Lockhart with plans to develop an eight phased semiconductor manufacturing facility called 'Project Evergreen.'

Micron's investment would total at least $80 billion and at least 80 jobs.

""This town is growing not too fast like Kyle or Buda but it’s still growing you know so I think that would be okay to bring something like that to here"" Lockhart visitor Marco Duque said.

Locals said they encourage the growth.

Lockhart Texas

""It would be a great thing for Lockhart I think it would be a good thing for the company. I’m all for it"" Lockhart resident Terence Gahan said.

It's not a done deal yet. Several locations are being considered.

The Micron application states receiving the tax break is crucial for the expansion to happen in Lockhart. It's filed under Chapter 313 which allows public school districts to offer tax incentives for businesses that invest in their communities. Several other high-tech companies have used it in the past including Samsung and Tesla.

Gahan said if the company does come to town he hopes the community will embrace the growth.

""I think the addition of a corporation like that for jobs and the future of our town is a favorable development"" Gahan said.

If Micron's application is approved the application said construction will begin in January 2028.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMid2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNjbXAuY29tL3RlY2gvYmlnLXRlY2gvYXJ0aWNsZS8zMTkwMzk3L2NoaW5lc2UtY2hpcC1tYWtlci1zbWljLWJvb3N0cy1leHBhbnNpb24tdXM3NS1iaWxsaW9uLWludmVzdG1lbnQtbmV30gF3aHR0cHM6Ly9hbXAuc2NtcC5jb20vdGVjaC9iaWctdGVjaC9hcnRpY2xlLzMxOTAzOTcvY2hpbmVzZS1jaGlwLW1ha2VyLXNtaWMtYm9vc3RzLWV4cGFuc2lvbi11czc1LWJpbGxpb24taW52ZXN0bWVudC1uZXc?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Top Chinese chip maker SMIC invests US$7.5 billion in new Tianjin plant,"SMIC’s new Tianjin project comes months after the contract chip maker earmarked a record US$5 billion for capital expenditure this year up from US$4.5 billion in 2021 with the goal of boosting its monthly production capacity by 130000 to 150000 8-inch equivalent wafers.

The announcement was made after SMIC entered into a cooperation framework agreement with the state-owned Tianjin Xiqing Economic Development Group which is responsible for planning and construction inside the Xiqing Development Area and the Tianjin Xiqing Economic and Technology Development Area Management Committee. The two local government authorities committed to provide support in terms of land use talent infrastructure and other requirements.

Products made by this new manufacturing line will be for telecommunications cars consumer electronics and other applications the company said.

The new plant will be built inside the XEDA Sci-Tech Park located south of downtown Tianjin in the Xiqing Development Area and have a production capacity of 100000 12-inch wafers a month covering 28-nanometre and more mature semiconductor manufacturing process nodes according to SMIC’s announcement in Hong Kong and Shanghai on Friday. It did not provide a timeline for this project.

The company currently has three 12-inch fabrication facilities under construction in Shanghai Beijing and Shenzhen. It already operates three 8-inch fabs and three 12-inch fabs in Shanghai Beijing Tianjin and Shenzhen.

Development of its new US$7.6 billion Beijing fab known as SMIC Jingcheng started in early 2021. It will have a production capacity of 100000 wafers per month when its first phase becomes operational in 2024. The new Shenzhen fab is expected to be completed by the end of this year.

The urgency of SMIC’s production capacity expansion has come into focus because of rising geopolitical tensions between Beijing and Washington.

The Bureau of Industry and Security an agency under the US Department of Commerce on August 15 started to enforce new export controls covering technologies for the production of advanced chips on grounds of national security. While China is not singled out in the latest US export controls analysts have said the restrictions clearly target the world’s second-largest economy."

This plus a number of unforeseeable factors has led to carnage in the industry

Government stimulus led some builders to grab too much work in order to grow

Swathe of financial ruin seeing builders and developers topple across Australia

The domino-like collapse of construction giants and property developers around Australia has largely been blamed on rising costs but that is only half the story.

It has been a devastating period as many families have watched their 'great Australian dream' of home ownership turn to dust - and there is set to be more pain on the way.

The story of why this is happening is not a simple one but what is easier to understand is the devastation wrought on people's lives as company after company collapses.

While the war in Ukraine and delays in materials caused by Covid-disrupted supply chains have mostly been blamed for the chaos others suggest the real reason for so many companies now going to the wall is because of their 'greed'.

Paul Liston here pictured with wife Pieta only learnt that the firm building his house Oracle Homes had collapsed when he was idly scrolling though Facebook while in hospital

Specifically some home builders scaled up their operations in response to the Federal government's building stimulus scheme HomeBuilder introduced in June 2020 during the Covid pandemic.

The consequence of over-committed construction companies has been carnage in the industry.

In the case of Oracle Building Corporation Pty Ltd - also known as Oracle Hunter Homes and Oracle Platinum Homes - there were 300 homes left in unfinished limbo in Queensland and NSW when it went into administration on Wednesday.

But that's been far from the only such horror story this year.

In Queensland Brisbane-based Besse Construction collapsed owing $1.7million and leaving 30 people out of work.

Also in that state Solido Builders Pty Ltd went into liquidation in May and Pivotal Homes Pty Ltd in June.

Mr Liston has described his unfinished house located in a southern suburb of Brisbane as a 'shell'

Victorian builders Wulfrun Constructions Pty Ltd went into liquidation in July.

Another Victorian builder Waterford Homes went bust a week earlier owing at least $600000 to 60 creditors.

Construction giant Probuild went under in March owing more than $14million to 784 workers while Gold Coast-based Condev appointed liquidators weeks later leaving creditors out of pocket $31million.

Developers have also not been spared.

It was reported in the Herald Sun this week that Victorian developer Caydon which went into administration in July owed a staggering $200million with around 130 apartments unsold.

A number of high-profile projects have been scrapped or put on hold around Australia.

Perth developer Sirona Urban has abandoned a $165million luxury tower while Melbourne developer Central Equity has stopped a $500million apartment tower on the Gold Coast.

Mr Liston said there was work to be completed both inside and outside the house by the builder which has been left in limbo

Melbourne-based construction giant Metricon - one of the nation's largest companies - last month sparked rumours it was in trouble after holding crisis talks with clients and meeting with the Victorian Treasurer.

The owners injected $30million into the embattled company although bosses have denied it is at risk of entering liquidation.

Sadly the swathe of destruction is unlikely to stop there with one liquidator saying the collapses are having a ripple effect through the industry.

Bill Cotter from Robson Cotter Insolvency Group the liquidators who have taken control of Oracle's assets said the construction sector was at risk of entering a 'vicious circle' because of shortages of material.

Interior shots taken of Mr Liston's house in August reveal there was still a lot of work to be completed

'People won't pay the company because they are worried about not getting supplies the company won't get its money so they can't pay their supplier' Mr Cotter told Daily Mail Australia.

'Their suppliers don't get their money so they don't provide the goods or the subbies don't do the work. A homeowner won't pay the next instalment so it is a vicious circle.'

Mr Cotter called this a 'storm' of increasing costs where delays in getting product become 'self-fulfilling'.

Oracle's managing director Tom Orel also laid blame on the 'storm' of increased costs according to the liquidators.

Mr Liston with wife Pieta said he had intended the house to be his first and last home for his family which includes three children

'Mr Orel has highlighted the well known difficult circumstances prevailing in the construction industry including the recent and rapid rise in construction costs' the liquidators said.

'These factors resulted in cost overruns and delays in project completions which severely impacted the company's cash flows and its capacity to continue to operate despite the owners and staff's best endeavours.'

While supply issues and shortages of staff have driven up prices it leaves out the other side of the economic equation - demand.

Dale Liston learnt of Oracle's collapse by idly scrolling through Facebook while he was laid up in hospital recovering from an operation for Crohn's Disease.

For Mr Liston this was catastrophic news. Oracle was building his house on Logan Reserve on the outer southern outskirts of Brisbane.

As it stands Mr Liston has been left with a 'shell' of a house that has brick wall and a roof but is largely unfinished inside and out.

The collapse of Oracle left around 300 homes unfinished with the failed company owing at least $14 million

While Mr Liston understands that there are factors inflating the costs of construction he has another explanation for what happened.

'It's all based around greed in my opinion' he said.

'He (Mr Orel) bit off more than he can chew.'

Mr Liston said that with buyers spurred on by the Morrison government's HomeBuilder scheme Oracle took on more projects than it could reasonably deliver.

'They've just seen all these dollar signs and said ""so we'll take on four times what they have built in the past and hope it all works""' Mr Liston said.

Records kept by the state's industry watchdog the Queensland Building and Construction Commission industry back up Mr Liston's claim.

The liquidators said that Oracle managing director Tom Orel had been offering his full cooperation

Oracle quadrupled the amount of contracts in the space of a year.

During the financial year 2019-20 it signed on 76 home contracts at a value of $22.4million.

The next financial year it began 316 contracts increasing the value of work overseen to $90million.

Russ Stephens co-founder of Association of Professional Builders which advises on housing finance said this was a staggering increase and a real warning sign.

'You can't scale a building company four times in a 12-month period' he told the Australian Financial Review.

Mr Stephens said with such a backlog of work the companies were struggling to deliver what they promised and that increased demand along with supply constraints sent costs soaring.

'Because costs kept going up 25 per cent a year … they were losing fortunes on every build' he said.

He pointed the finger at stimulus programs such as HomeBuilder which provided up to $25000 to buy a new house or to make a significant renovation.

Queensland Master Builders CEO Paul Bidwell said those with unfinished Oracle homes should be able to access the state's warranty scheme to help them complete works

It was intended to act as a stimulus measure to boost the economy as Covid lockdowns border closures and other restrictions began to bite.

'Whoever was advising the government gave them very poor advice because they didn't need stimulus' Mr Stephens said.

'All we did was inflate the property market unnecessarily – we poured even more fuel on the fire for construction and did it while allowing builders to commit to fixed-price contracts without allowing escalation clauses.'

Mr Liston has asked what watchdogs such as the QBCC were doing allowing builders to load up with work they could not possibly deliver.

'They are a contributing factor I believe' he said.



'They (the QBCC) are the ones that issued them (Oracle) with how much work they are meant to complete' he said.

Surfers Paradise builder Pivotal Homes one of Queensland's biggest home builders went into liquidation in May. Pictured is a stock image of a man painting the side of a house

'[They've] allowed these people to nearly quadruple the number of builds these people are allowed to complete in one year.'

Mr Orel and the QBCC have been approached for comment.

Mr Liston also said the QBCC were not being proactive enough in helping those left in the lurch with unfinished homes by Oracle's collapse.

'They are being reactive which I understand but being reactive to a problem doesn’t solve anything' he said.

'They have got to help us. Sitting there and saying we are going to make a team to do this it’s all well and good but it’s all words.

'I’ve had to call my mother in to try to help with this.

'I’ve got to jump through all these hoops to sort something out that isn’t my fault.'

Master Builders Queensland CEO Paul Bidwell admitted Federal government stimulus scheme Homebuilder and another $40000 package offer by the Queensland government to build in the regions had pumped up demand and caused some construction companies to take on more work than they could manage (pictured a home being built at Coomera on the Gold Coast)

Master Builders Queensland CEO Paul Bidwell admitted Homebuilder and another $40000 package offer by the Queensland government to build in the regions had pumped up demand.

However he said it was easy to say the market was overstimulated with the benefit of hindsight.

'Looking back a number of builders have said 'we didn't need HomeBuilder' - well that's OK but in 2019 we did need it' he said.

'And there was a case for that stimulus... in 2019 we saw a bloodbath coming in 2020.

'These things are blunt instruments - when they turn them on it takes a while for them to gear up.'

Mr Bidwell admitted some builders 'were more circumspect than others' in terms of how much work they loaded up.

'I am aware of some builders who thought it was a great opportunity to get a quantum leap in the size of their business a one-off opportunity to go from a small to medium builder to be a big builder' he said.

He pointed to a builder in Rockhampton who had pursued that opportunity and was 'probably regretting it'.

'At one point he was getting up and losing money everyday' Mr Bidwell said.

'The contracts that he was signing when I last talked to him he expected to make a profit from but he had a lot of work in progress that was losing money.

'Things got pretty grim. He's confident he will come out the other end but in a diminished state and that he will survive.

'That's because he was selling whatever assets he has to prop up his business and a lot of people have done that so they have proved to be quite resilient.

'That story has played out to a greater or lesser extent across the board.'

Mr Bidwell said beyond Homebuilder multiple factors including Covid smashing global supply chains natural disasters the war in Ukraine and people in lockdown looking around their homes and deciding they wanted renovations has caused the current chaos in the industry

Looking ahead Mr Bidwell said there were 'mixed views' as to whether the worst was behind the industry.

Sadly he predicted more failures but said he had actually predicted there would be more before now.

'If you tease it out more builders have got to fail but that hasn't happened' he said.

'And that's because they are throwing whatever they can in to prop up their business but it's not sustainable.

'You'd hope conditions would ease as we go into next year but it's not going to right itself neatly.'

He argued that multiple factors such as Covid smashing global supply chains natural disasters the war in Ukraine and people in lockdown looking around their homes and deciding they wanted renovations were unpredictable elements playing into the crisis.

'Who would have thought that all those things would coalesce and just sort of add on top of each other? Just sort of pile on?' he said.

Mr Bidwell said his main advice to builders and their clients was to communicate honestly with each other about cost issues

His main advice to builders and their clients was to talk to each other.

He said some people were able to cover extra costs when asked by their builders especially as rising property prices showed them the value of their investment.

He also said there were 'some deals being done'.

'A guy on the Sunshine Coast ... the builder said to him the ""costs have gone up $30000 how about I come back next year and build a pool""' Mr Bidwell said.

'The owner said ""sure"".'

However this could only happen where the builder 'has been communicating with their clients - those who don't communicate don't do well'.

'They're going to feel the pain a lot sooner and a lot more harshly' he said

For Mr Liston 33 he had hoped the house he was building would be his first and last home for himself wife Peita and their three children aged four 10 and 12.

'I was building something for my family for years and years' he said.

Even having already sunk $350000 into the land and what has been completed of his house Mr Liston now despairs that he will ever get to move into it.

Mr Bidwell was quick to point to Queensland's 'statutory home warranty insurance scheme' which will pay up to $200000 to complete works on insured homes.

'Everyone will get their home finished' Mr Bidwell said although he admitted it might take a long time and might be 'cold comfort' for some.

Mr Liston said for him the whole experience of buying a first home had been 'marred'.

If he got a payout where he broke even he would be happy to walk away 'and never think about this again'.

Others are likely to feel the same way as long as the 'great Australian dream' continues to turn into a nightmare.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZ2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFuYWx5dGljc2luc2lnaHQubmV0L2luc2lnaHRzLzEwLWNvbXBhbmllcy10aGF0LXVzZS1iaWctZGF0YS10by1hdXRvbWF0ZS1idXNpbmVzcy1wcm9jZXNzZXPSAXFodHRwczovL3d3dy5hbmFseXRpY3NpbnNpZ2h0Lm5ldC9hbXAvc3RvcnkvaW5zaWdodHMvMTAtY29tcGFuaWVzLXRoYXQtdXNlLWJpZy1kYXRhLXRvLWF1dG9tYXRlLWJ1c2luZXNzLXByb2Nlc3Nlcw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,10 Companies That Use Big Data to Automate Business Processes,Nielsen Holdings is a global measurement and data analytics company that provides the most complete and trusted view available of consumers and markets worldwide.

They extort millions — and often find easy targets.

Within just a few weeks a group of cyber criminals managed to throw Costa Rica into disarray.

In April hackers took over the computer system of the country's finance ministry demanding millions in ransom to return access. But authorities refused to pay. In the weeks that followed the criminals retaliated by crippling the systems of nearly 30 other government agencies.

People across the Central American country felt the consequences: Tax systems froze. Workers were paid late. Goods for export including perishable items like fruit were stuck in customs.

By early May the situation had become so bad that Costa Rica's newly elected president declared a national emergency. It marked the first time a country had taken that step in response to a cyber incident.

Since then authorities have managed to restore many of their services. But four months after the first strike not all the damage caused by the attack has been fixed.

""This is an eye-opening moment for how vulnerable we are to cyber attacks — not just our government or our companies but our entire society"" said Diego Gonzalez head of the cybersecurity chapter at Costa Rica's Chamber of Information and Communication Technologies.

From Latin America to Africa and South Asia

The case is a stark illustration of what cybersecurity researchers and industry professionals describe as a worrying trend: Cyber criminals are increasingly targeting government agencies and public institutions in mid-income and developing countries in the Global South they told DW in a series of seven interviews.

This month hackers brought down the court system of the Argentinian city of Cordoba. Last month attackers knocked out a flood monitoring system in the Indian state of Goa. Earlier this year an attack caused outages at the central bank of Zambia.

""There is no doubt that the number of ransomware victims in the Global South is on the rise"" said Anna Chung a threat intelligence researcher at cybersecurity company Palo Alto Networks pointing to a recent spike in ransomware attacks in Latin America.

Other researchers echoed her warning for regions in Asia and Africa.

Allan Liska a cyberintelligence analyst at cybersecurity firm Recorded Future said his company was observing an uptick of attacks across southern Asia adding that ""targets tend to be government agencies and larger organizations.""

The same is true for many countries in Africa said Joey Jansen van Vuuren head of computer science at Tshwane University of Technology in Johannesburg South Africa.

""Across Africa ransomware has become the cybercrime with the biggest impact on governments and businesses"" she said.

The tip of the iceberg

Ransomware attacks often follow a similar playbook: First intruders gain access to a computer network. Inside they spend weeks or even months snooping around. Once they find data that seems valuable enough that people would pay money to get it back they encrypt the files and send a ransom note with their demands.

Victims are left with two options: Refuse and try to restore their systems with backups — or pay and hope that the criminals will keep their word and return the data.

Cases in which victims publicly refuse to pay like in Costa Rica tend to make headlines.

But those are only the tip of the iceberg experts caution. Most cases in which victims end up paying remain unreported they say — and in some areas of the Global South that has become common practice.

""Today organizations often already accept this as a given — they are even making budgetary allocations because they expect that they will likely have to pay a ransom at some point"" said Charlette Donalds a lecturer at the University of the West Indies at Mona in Kingston Jamaica and the author of a book on cybercrime in the Global South.

Many ransomware attacks remain unreported Image: Lino Mirgeler/dpa/picture alliance/dpa

Across the Caribbean ransomware attacks are on the rise Donalds said. Several tax authorities in the region for instance have had their systems compromised by attackers according to the trade organization Caribbean Council.

Her co-author Corlane Barclay added that attackers often find easy targets. ""For a long time governments here thought that because we are small and the threat actors are international they will focus on more lucrative victims"" she said.

That is why many governments and institutions as they digitized their services invested little in cybersecurity measures she added.

Recorded Future's Allan Liska said that his company observed the same phenomenon across the Global South. He called it one of the reasons criminals zero in on the regions.

""The attackers know that they can find systems that are relatively easy to penetrate"" he said.

The canary in the coal mine

So how can countries in the Global South better protect themselves against ransomware attacks?

Researchers agree that governments need to ramp up cybersecurity measures and invest in training a new generation of professionals. Countries with no existing cybersecurity legislation should pass laws to force companies and public institutions to protect their systems from cyberattacks.

Governments should also push for more international cooperation they added pointing to a new ""counter ransomware initiative"" launched by the US government last fall. Seven out of 30 countries included in the initiative are located in the Global South.

And they stressed that governments need to raise awareness of cybersecurity among their populations — because the threat of ransomware is here to stay.

Once again that was illustrated by events in Costa Rica.

One month after the country declared a national emergency another group of cybercriminals managed to take over the IT system of Costa Rica's main public health organization. It led to thousands of patients missing medical appointments.

""That was when people realized that those attacks can affect our families our children"" cybersecurity entrepreneur Diego Gonzalez said. He hopes that this recent experience will prompt political decision-makers to boost long-term investment in cybersecurity.

But he is also convinced that what happened in his home country could soon happen again elsewhere.

""We live in the age of cyber attacks"" Gonzalez said ""this is only the beginning.""

Amid a prolonged fight against rising prices and a looming economic downturn it's a tough world right now for investors.

The Federal Reserve's hardline stance against inflation at Friday's Jackson Hole meeting sent stocks tumbling finishing off a rally that began in mid-June. Fears around heightened uncertainty and a potential recession also solidified as the Cboe Volatility Index (VIX) a traditional measure of market volatility spiked upwards.

When realizing gains is as difficult as it is right now Morgan Stanley's Vintage Values list comes as a welcome respite. The list published annually provides a selection of the firm's top equity recommendations for a one-year buy-and-hold investment horizon.

""In compiling the list our stock-selection framework blended our analysts' fundamental views with quantitative analysis"" wrote a team of analysts led by Morgan Stanley Chief Investment Officer and Chief US Equity Strategist Mike Wilson in the report published on August 24.

Last year's Vintage Values list which covered August 2021 to August 2022 outperformed the S&P 500 index by 100 basis points. Of the 50 stocks recommended this year by Morgan Stanley's North America analysts only the top 15 were included in the list.

To narrow down the selection each of the suggested stocks were extensively assessed to screen its ""macro exposure industry positioning valuation and risk-reward profile paying particular attention to the skew of the analysts' bull- and bear-case valuation estimates"" Wilson explained.

Next the stocks were cross-checked for their quantitative quality and environmental social and governance scores. To narrow down the final 15 the list was considered against Wilson's high-level equity sector allocations so that its weightings would match his current positioning which includes an overweight position in the healthcare and real estate sectors.

Morgan Stanley's top 15 stocks to buy and hold over the next 12 months

On the topline Morgan Stanley's Vintage Values list prefers high-quality stocks. With the average stock on the list trading 11% more expensive than the market on forward price-to-earnings ratios and 17% more expensive on price-to-sales ratios it may seem that the list of stocks is trading at a premium.

But according to Wilson the list is ""materially less expensive"" than the market when accounting for key cash flow-based valuation measures like the enterprise value-to-operating cash flow and also carries a more attractive free cash flow yield of 5% versus the market's 4.7%. And with relative earnings revisions for the overall market taking a nosedive Wilson pointed out that the Vintage Values list has a ""far superior"" positive revisions profile versus the S&P 500's negative 3-month smoothed revisions.

The list is more tilted towards larger firms with 63% of its stocks classified as either large- or mega-cap said Wilson. He also pointed out that the list's average market capitalization of $211 billion is significantly above the S&P 500's average of $74 billion.

60% of the names on the list were growth stocks with 7% of firms falling into the value bucket and the remaining 33% belonging to neither investing style. This is well above the S&P 500's 39% growth stock weighting and well below its 25% value weighting Wilson noted.

Finally Wilson highlighted the fact that the Vintage Values list is marginally tilted more defensively than the overall market with 33% of its stocks classified as cyclical and 27% as defensive versus the S&P 500's respective weightings of 41% and 24%.

Pierce: What will Utah viewers notice when Nexstar owner of KTVX and KUCW takes over The CW?,"(The CW) The Nexstar Media Group which owns KTVX and KUCW is the new owner of The CW network.

For the first time in 14 years there’s a network-owned TV station in Utah. But it’s different this time because a network didn’t buy KUCW-Channel 30; the station’s owner bought a network.

Well “bought” might not be exactly the right word for it because the Nexstar Media Group was essentially given The CW by the network’s previous owners.

(Courtesy Nexstar) The Nexstar Media Group owns both KTVX-Channel 4 and KUCW-Channel 30 in Utah.

That’s right. Paramount Global (the parent company of CBS) and Warner Bros. Discovery (the parent company of Warner Media) turned over 75% of The CW to Nexstar. OK so Nexstar is assuming between $100 million and $130 million of The CW’s debt.

And the deal appears to make sense because Nexstar owns the nation’s biggest broadcast TV station group — it owns or operates about 200 stations including 37 CW affiliates that account for about a third of the network’s national reach.

As for the network’s previous owners they pretty much removed an albatross from around their necks. (Paramount Global and Warner Bros. Discovery each retained a 12.5% interest in The CW.) As a network The CW has lost money since the day it was founded 16 years ago out of a merger of UPN and The WB.

But indirectly it made its owners a ton of money for many years. To put it simply CBS and Warner Bros. produced all the shows for The CW which got extremely low ratings on the network. But CBS and Warner Bros. sold those shows in syndication in foreign markets and to streamers — including a billion-dollar deal with Netflix — and made boatloads of money that more than offset the losses by the network.

However that business model has changed. Paramount Global and Warner Bros. Discovery both have their own streaming services now so they’re producing shows for themselves. And streamers operate globally so sales to foreign broadcasters are ending.

Jack Rowand | The CW Grant Gustin as The Flash

What does this mean for Utah viewers?

There’s going to be a major change in the kinds of programs that air on The CW. The network’s programming has been aimed at viewers ages 18-34 which it turns out is kind of nuts because the average age of its viewers is 58.

That is not a typo.

If you do watch The CW chances are that some (or all) of the shows you watch are ended or ending.

The CW has been known as the network that rarely canceled anything no matter how bad the ratings. (Remember CBS and Warner Bros. were selling these shows elsewhere.) That changed this spring when the network’s management — knowing that this sale was in the works — took out the ax and swung it at “Batwoman” “Charmed” “DC’s Legends of Tomorrow” “Dynasty” “In the Dark” “Legacies” “Naomi” “Roswell New Mexico” and “Tom Swift.”

In addition both “The Flash” and “Riverdale” will air their final seasons during the upcoming 2022-23 TV year.

So expect fewer shows aimed at younger viewers fewer superhero shows and more shows like “Walker” and its upcoming prequel “Walker: Independence” which appeal to older viewers.

What about the budgets?

Nexstar vows to make The CW profitable by 2025 while spending $2 billion a year on programming. CBS and Warner Bros. will continue to produce shows for the network but Nexstar will also look to other studios for shows.

But there was this rather alarming statement from Nexstar CEO Perry Sook: “We plan to apply the same strict financial standards to operating The CW as we apply to our other businesses.”

There are a lot of good things you can say about Nexstar chief among them that — unlike Sinclair — it doesn’t push a political agenda. But Nexstar also has a reputation for being cheap.

And you don’t have to look far to see examples of that. Just tune in to a newscast on KTVX-Channel 4.

Can Nexstar make it work?

Well … maybe. But cutting costs and airing cheap programming is probably the only way that’s going to happen. And will viewers watch cheap programming?

Nexstar isn’t having much success with its other national outlet. It converted what was once WGN America into an all-news channel NewsNation which is averaging about 50000 viewers in prime time.

That is not a typo. And yes a lot of local stations across the country average more viewers than that for their late newscasts.

What’s in a name?

Despite the change in ownership there are no plans to change the name of The CW — the “C” comes from CBS; the “W” from Warner Bros.

It’s not a unique situation. FX which is Fox without the “O” now belongs to Disney.

Utah’s other network-owned stations

• KSTU-Channel 13 was owned by Fox from 1990 to 2008. It was sold to a private equity firm in 2008 and then to Tribune Media in 2012. When Tribune Media (which is in no way associated with The Salt Lake Tribune) was sold to Nexstar in 2018 it sold KSTU to the E.W. Scripps Company to comply with FCC ownership rules.

Nexstar already owned both KTVX-Channel 4 and KUCW-Channel 30 in the Salt Lake market.

• In 1994 NBC bought controlling interest in KUTV-Channel 2. Later that year it announced that KUTV would be traded to CBS and would become Salt Lake City’s CBS affiliate as part of a trade involving stations in Philadelphia Denver and Miami.

That’s when KSL-Channel 5 became an NBC affiliate.

CBS immediately turned around and sold KUTV to Westinghouse Broadcasting; in 1995 Westinghouse merged with CBS so KUTV became a CBS-owned station again.

CBS sold KUTV to a private equity firm in 2007. Nexstar managed Channel 2 for several years until the station was sold to the Sinclair Broadcast Group in 2012.

Players are given the opportunity to spend their hard-earned cash on new bundles or pleasant discounted skins and as soon as the in-game client is made accessible players typically rush to check it out.

In order to buy the skins they desire from bundles and Night Market listings players are required to spend real-world money to purchase VALORANT points. The game’s demand for money sometimes causes the points-buying page to time out.

The following explains both why it occurs and what you can do to fix it.

Why does the page where you may buy VALORANT points keep timing out?

When there are too many users trying to access the VALORANT points purchasing page at the same time the website times out. This takes place in a few distinct scenarios including the release of new episodes and acts the introduction of new bundles for purchase and the activation of the Night Market.

This problem appears to be unsolvable; VALORANT players just can’t help but check for the newest bundle or their own particular Night Market drops.

How to Fix Valorant’s Purchase Failed Error?

If the page on which you are trying to acquire VALORANT points times out you will need to stop the game and restart the Riot Client before attempting to open VALORANT again.

There is a possibility that you are not using the most recent version of the game. If problems persist check your internet connection; you may need to reset your router or switch to a wired connection.

It is quite likely that the timeout was caused by an excessive number of players; hence the most effective solution is regrettably to just wait for the load on VALORANT to become less intense.

Any pertinent updates regarding maintenance log-in issues or other connectivity issues will be posted on the official accounts for VALORANT and Riot Games Support respectively.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiPmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmdldGRyb2lkdGlwcy5jb20vdmVubW8tbm90LXZlcmlmeWluZy1iYW5rLWFjY291bnQv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Venmo Not Verifying Bank Account How To Fix?,"Unfortunately for many Venmo users the bank verification is not working. They are complaining that Venmo is not verifying their bank account. Well this error may occur due to bad internet connectivity servers issue wrong account credentials etc. But no one is currently able to pinpoint the main culprit behind this issue.

Talking about Venmo PayPal owns Venmo and it is part of PayPal’s growing family of brands. It is basically a mobile payment tool that lets you send and receive money with ease just like any other payment app. With Venmo anyone whether a student or a business owner can save money and keep track of their finances. But these types of issues make users think twice before signing up for this service.

Anyway now no need to worry as we have some tricks that will help you resolve the Venmo not verifying bank account issue. So let’s jump into it.

How To Fix Venmo Not Verifying Bank Account

There aren’t many fixes available that you can use to resolve the Venmo not verifying bank account issue. You can however try out these fixes and see if that helps you resolve the issue. So let’s have a look at them:

Fix 1: Restart Your Device

As a first step you should just restart your device since there is a possibility that due to some stored cache files Venmo will not function properly. So you must first try rebooting your device and then check if Venmo not verifying the account issue gets resolved or not.

Fix 2: Check Your Internet Connection

Chances are also there that your internet connection might not work properly due to which the Venmo app isn’t able to connect to your bank server. Yes you have to make sure that your internet is working no matter whether you are using mobile data or a WiFi network.

You can simply hover over Google and search for Internet speed tests. After that use the first link to test your internet speed. Meanwhile in case you find that the internet is not working properly then before contacting your ISP try power cycling your router and check if it helps.

However once the internet starts working again you will find that the Venmo app again starts verifying your account.

Fix 3: Clear The Cache

There are possibilities that some cache files stored on your device may not be removed just by rebooting your device. So now in order to remove those files you need to use these steps and remove them manually.

First of all tap on the Venmo app and navigate to the App Info. After that tap on the Clear Data button > Clear Cache > Ok. That’s it. Now it will take 5-10 seconds to remove the cache data depending upon the size. Once done you will see that Venmo is not verifying the bank account issue.

Fix 4: Make Sure The Servers Are Working

Did you check if your bank server is working or not? Chances are high that your bank servers may have some regular maintenance checks. So you must initially verify this thing. However if there is scheduled maintenance going on then you have to wait for a few hours and try to verify the bank account again.

Fix 5: Invalid Bank Account

Extra care is needed while filling in the bank details. So you will need to make sure that the bank credentials or details that you have entered are correct. Whenever you fill in the details correctly you will see that Venmo will begin verifying your account. Therefore try this and let us know if you have entered the wrong details previously or not.

Fix 6: Account May Get Blocked

There may be a possibility that your account may be blocked by your bank due to which you are getting this type of issue. So you must first head over to your nearest branch and verify this.

In the meantime you can also check out your mobile banking app of the particular bank to check if your account is working or not. Meanwhile if that doesn’t work then go to the nearest branch and ask them to unblock your account. In general your account is blocked when no transaction has been detected for a long period of time.

Fix 7: Check After 24 Hours

If you have found that your account is blocked from the bank’s end and you have just initiated the unblocking process then you have to wait for 24 hours.

This is because the process will take at least 24 hours to complete from your bank’s end. So wait for 24 hours and again launch the Venmo app to check if the not verifying bank account issue gets resolved or not. However most probably if your account gets unblocked then it starts working so that you can link that account to your Venmo app.

Fix 8: Use Another Bank Account

If nothing helps and you are still getting the same issue then chances are there that the particular bank is not supported by the Venmo app. So in that case we advise you to use another bank account. Well although Venmo by PayPal supports almost every bank but we don’t know if they missed any.

Consequently you must check if the other bank account linked to your Venmo account is linked or not. We do not disclose the bank name but many users previously reported that when they changed their bank they were successfully able to link their account to the Venmo app. Please let us know if this helps if you try it.

Still no luck? Well don’t worry! First of all don’t panic. Talk to Venmo officials and explain this issue to their support team. After that depending upon the situation they will suggest you some fixes to resolve this issue.

For 2022 promising scholar Ricardo Shields was the recipient.

The 20-year-old is in his second-year at Caribbean Maritime University pursuing a Bachelor of Engineering in Mechatronics.

Recognising the wealth of talent among Jamaica’s youth spanning various industries including technical and manufacturing specialties Pepsi-Cola Jamaica says it is committed to honing and growing these skill sets through its talent programme.

The programme focuses on identifying opportunities for mentorship and other areas of development for university students.

Touched by Shields’ journey to tertiary education Pepsi-Cola Jamaica did not hesitate to reach out to him.

The internship which began in June will wrap in September.

Shields describes his experience as eye-opening.

“Working on the plant since June surrounded by all the machinery was certainly a win-win situation for me. My first day was an exciting one. Overall the experience has been a good challenge… I’ve been exposed to technology and processes that made me excited for the future of manufacturing in Jamaica. I am grateful for the opportunity to learn especially within the context of my career path” he shared.

Chantelle Richards human resource manager at Pepsi-Cola Jamaica shared: “Pepsi-Cola Jamaica continues to invest in practical ways to help young Jamaicans realise their true potential. We seek to equip persons with resources and experience to make positive contributions to the country.

“Ricardo is passionate about excelling in his craft. In addition to pursuing studies that is relevant to the manufacturing industry a key qualifier for our Youth Outreach and Talent Program is an eager attitude and a commitment to achieving one’s goals â€” he was a perfect fit. We look forward to continuing our relationship with him.”

To date through its youth outreach and talent program Pepsi-Cola Jamaica has come to the aid of over 40 university students across the island.

“My circumstances were certainly less than ideal” said Shields. “I struggled financially for a long time and I know many young persons would love an opportunity to show their potential and talent but are not given a chance. For me it was the fact that Pepsi took the time to acknowledge my story and consider my potential. I am truly overwhelmed by their kindness and will be forever grateful for the opportunity.”

While crediting his tenacity to his faith and conviction to always doing the right thing he cautioned his peers and other struggling individuals to never be shy to ask for help:

“As long as you have the determination to achieve something out of life put aside your pride and ask for help. I understand that it is a hard thing to do. For some time I was worried about what others would say about my struggles especially when they became public but I quickly realised that had I not asked for help I would not be where I am today.”

Now more hopeful about his future Shields is eager to become a mechanical engineer… at Pepsi-Cola Jamaica.",,,,,,,,,

The Cambridge Massachusetts company claims Pfizer-BioNTech’s vaccine Comirnaty infringes on patents it filed between 2010 and 2016 according to a Moderna news release.

“We believe that Pfizer and BioNTech unlawfully copied Moderna’s inventions and they have continued to use them without permission” said Moderna chief legal officer Shannon Thyme Klinger.

Moderna alleges Pfizer and BioNtech copied two key features of the company’s patented technologies which they say are “critical to the success of mRNA vaccines.”

Pfizer spokeswoman Jerica Pitts said the companies were ""surprised by the litigation"" and plan to ""vigorously defend against the allegations of the lawsuit."" Their COVID-19 vaccine she said was based on BioNTech's proprietary mRNA technology.

Also in the news:

► First lady Jill Biden tested positive again for COVID-19 the White House announced Wednesday – just one day after she tested negative. President Joe Biden continues to test negative.

► Pfizer and German partner BioNTech have submitted their new COVID-19 booster – that targets the omicron subvariant BA.5 – to the FDA for emergency use authorization the companies announced Monday.

► Novak Djokovic will not play in the U.S. Open as expected because he is not vaccinated against COVID-19 and thus is not allowed to travel to the United States.

Paxlovid showed no measurable benefit in adults 40 to 65 study says

Pfizer's COVID-19 pill Paxlovid appears to provide little or no benefit for certain adults while still reducing the risk of hospitalization and death for high-risk seniors according to a large study published Wednesday.

The results from a 109000-patient Israeli study are likely to renew questions about the U.S. government's use of Paxlovid which has become the go-to treatment for COVID-19 due to its at-home convenience. The Biden administration has spent more than $10 billion purchasing the drug and making it available at thousands of pharmacies through its test-and-treat initiative.

The researchers found that Paxlovid reduced hospitalizations among people 65 and older by roughly 75% when given shortly after infection. But people between the ages of 40 and 65 saw no measurable benefit according to the analysis of medical records.

A spokesman for Pfizer declined to comment on the results which were published in the New England Journal of Medicine.

Can we eradicate COVID? That’s a hard no according to Dr. Anthony Fauci

While Dr. Anthony Fauci who became both a reassuring and politically polarizing voice during the pandemic is retiring from public service in December he’s still got a lot to share.

In a wide-ranging interview with USA TODAY President Joe Biden's chief medical advisor and director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease says the world might be opening up again but that doesn’t mean the pandemic is behind us.

“I think that when you talk about new normal you have to focus predominantly on COVID” Fauci said. “We have the emergence of infectious diseases more often than people realize. Many of them are relatively insignificant at a global level.”

Fauci has spent his career studying emerging viruses and guiding America’s response to health crises like the HIV/AIDS epidemic in the 1980s and West Nile Virus.

“Could we actually eradicate SARS COV-2 the cause of COVID? I can tell you categorically the answer to that is going to be no” says Fauci. ""We've only eradicated from the face of the earth one significant pathogen and that's smallpox.""

Fauci says America’s best protection against COVID-19 is mass vaccination.

Pfizer says its COVID vaccines are 73% effective in children under 5

Pfizer’s COVID-19 vaccine was 73% effective in protecting children younger than 5 as omicron spread in the spring the company announced Tuesday.

Vaccinations for babies toddlers and preschoolers opened in the U.S. in June after months of delay. Health authorities authorized tot-sized vaccine doses made by Pfizer and BioNTech based on a study showing they were safe and produced high levels of virus-fighting antibodies. But there was only preliminary data on how that translated into effectiveness against symptomatic COVID-19.

The new study analyzed COVID-19 diagnoses between March and June in Pfizer’s ongoing study of the three-dose vaccine. There were 21 COVID-19 cases among the 351 tots who got dummy shots — compared to just 13 among the 794 youngsters given three vaccine doses.

The child cases primarily were caused by the BA.2 omicron version that was circulating in. Today another omicron relative BA.5 is causing most COVID-19 cases in the U.S. and much of the world.

Moderna claims that Pfizer and BioNtech used the company’s patented mRNA technology in COVID-19 vaccines without Moderna’s permission.

Moderna alleges that before the pandemic they had over a decade of research on mRNA in coronaviruses with six different “mRNA candidates for infectious disease in clinical trials.” The company obtained various patents for its technology from 2011 to 2016. Then when the pandemic struck “Moderna answered the call” and quickly developed a COVID-19 vaccine based on its exiting technology.

Moderna claims that prior to the pandemic Pfizer and BioNtech had no existing mRNA vaccine technology. Yet when Pfizer and BioNtech presented vaccine candidates for testing “they decided to make the exact same chemical modification to their mRNA that Moderna scientists first developed years earlier.” In scientific terms Pfizer and BioNtech’s vaccine “uses the exact same 1-methylpseudouridine chemical modification in a lipid nanoparticle formulation as Moderna’s patented COVID-19 vaccine.”

Moderna only seeks damages for Pfizer’s sales that occurred after March 8 2022. During the pandemic Moderna voluntarily pledged not to enforce their “patents against those making vaccines intended to combat the pandemic.” The company “refrained from asserting its patents earlier so as not to distract from efforts to bring the pandemic to an end as quickly as possible.” However now that the vaccines are easily accessible to most people Moderna seeks compensation for the continued sales of Pfizer and BioNtech’s vaccine and booster shots.

Moderna claims their goal is “to protect the mRNA technology platform [they] innovated invested in and patented and to ensure that intellectual property is respected.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWmh0dHBzOi8vZW4ubWVyY29wcmVzcy5jb20vMjAyMi8wOC8yNy9tb2Rlcm5hLXN1ZXMtcGZpemVyLWJpb250ZWNoLW92ZXItY292aWQtMTktdmF4LXBhdGVudNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Moderna sues Pfizer/Biontech over Covid-19 vax patent,"Moderna sues Pfizer/Biontech over Covid-19 vax patent

Messenger RNA vaccines are the ones most used worldwide against COVID-19

US pharmaceutical company Moderna Friday sued Pfizer / BioNTech over patent ownership infringement regarding the COVID-19 RNA vaccine

Moderna is convinced that Pfizer and BioNTech's Comirnaty Covid-19 vaccine infringes on patents filed by Moderna between 2010 and 2016 covering Moderna's fundamental messenger RNA technology the company said in a statement.

The two companies were the first to manufacture coronavirus vaccines shortly after the start of the pandemic using messenger RNA technology which enables it to instruct human cells to make proteins present in the virus to accustom the immune system to recognize and neutralize it thus changing the technique used until then in the development of immunizers which were based on weakened or inactivated forms of the virus to train the body to defend itself.

Messenger RNA technology was the culmination of four decades of research that has overcome numerous hurdles. This groundbreaking technology was crucial to the development of Moderna's own messenger RNA vaccine Spikevax. Pfizer and BioNTech copied this technology without Moderna's permission to manufacture Comirnaty Moderna's statement added.

We believe that Pfizer and BioNTech unlawfully copied Moderna's inventions and they have continued to use them without permission Moderna Chief Legal Officer Shannon Thyme Klinger said in a statement.

The patent infringement lawsuits were filed in Massachusetts in the United States and in Düsseldorf in Germany. Moderna said it filed patents from 2010 to 2016 for its mRNA technology.

We are filing these lawsuits to protect the innovative mRNA technology platform that we pioneered invested billions of dollars in creating and patented during the decade preceding the COVID-19 pandemic Moderna CEO Stéphane Bancel said who also pointed out that the company was continuing to use this technology to develop treatments for influenza and HIV as well as for autoimmune and cardiovascular diseases and some rare forms of cancer.

Moderna does not want Comirnaty removed from the market but does want compensation the company said in a press release.

Pfizer denied Moderna's claims saying in a statement Friday that Comirnaty was based on BioNTech’s proprietary mRNA technology and developed by both BioNTech and Pfizer and insisted they would vigorously defend against the allegations of the lawsuit.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTmh0dHBzOi8vdGhld2Vlay5jb20vdXMvMTAxNjIyNy8xMC10aGluZ3MteW91LW5lZWQtdG8ta25vdy10b2RheS1hdWd1c3QtMjctMjAyMtIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,10 things you need to know today: August 27 2022,"1.

The Justice Department on Friday released a redacted version of both the affidavit and memo related to the recent FBI raid on former President Donald Trump's Florida mansion. The DOJ even redacted portions of the documents in which it explained the rationale behind the redactions. As a result many of the pages didn't reveal much information. Critics of the Mar-a-Lago raid mocked the redactions on Twitter sharing screenshots of almost completely blacked-out material especially sections where the eliminated text rendered clauses like ""for example"" or ""as explained in the affidavit"" completely moot.

So you might want to look at some of the facts that could shape the stock's performance in the near term.

Over the past month shares of this world's largest consumer products maker have returned +5.8% compared to the Zacks S&P 500 composite's -0.2% change. During this period the Zacks Soap and Cleaning Materials industry which P&G falls in has gained 6.5%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?

While media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.

Earnings Estimate Revisions

Rather than focusing on anything else we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.

Our analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price investors tend to buy the stock resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.

For the current quarter P&G is expected to post earnings of $1.37 per share indicating no change from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -0.4% over the last 30 days.

For the current fiscal year the consensus earnings estimate of $6.55 points to a change of +11% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days this estimate has changed +1.6%.

For the next fiscal year the consensus earnings estimate of $6.97 indicates a change of +6.3% from what P&G is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month the estimate has changed +0.3%.

Having a strong externally audited track record our proprietary stock rating tool the Zacks Rank offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate along with three other factors related to earnings estimates P&G is rated Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

Story continues

The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:

Projected Revenue Growth

While earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.

In the case of P&G the consensus sales estimate of $20.81 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of +1.3%. The $84.32 billion and $87.18 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of +2.8% and +3.4% respectively.

Last Reported Results and Surprise History

P&G reported revenues of $20.2 billion in the last reported quarter representing a year-over-year change of +0.6%. EPS of $1.52 for the same period compares with $1.37 a year ago.

Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $20.48 billion the reported revenues represent a surprise of -1.41%. The EPS surprise was +7.04%.

The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates two times over this period.

Valuation

No investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.

Comparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples such as its price-to-earnings (P/E) price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF) to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued overvalued or undervalued whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.

As part of the Zacks Style Scores system the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on) making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued rightly valued or temporarily undervalued.

P&G is graded D on this front indicating that it is trading at a premium to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.

Conclusion

The facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about P&G. However its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.

It’s too early to know how or if the 19-month-long strike connects with this lawsuit filed Wednesday in Lucas County (Ohio) Common Pleas Court by Allan Block of Toledo Ohio. He’s the CEO of Block Communications Inc. which owns the PG its Toledo sister paper The Blade as well as Pittsburgh City Paper and other businesses including cable companies and TV stations. His suit accuses others in his family of scheming to sell all of it without his input.

The suit doesn’t mention the PG strike. Zack Tanner president of the Newspaper Guild of Pittsburgh one of the unions that walked out in October 2022 said the lawsuit has no impact on the strike.

“The Blocks are no strangers to infighting” Tanner said on Thursday. “If you worked at the paper for a minute or for 50 years you know the Blocks like to fight with each other. No big news there. But our fight is our fight. They can fight internally but we’re still committed to winning the strike.”

Tanner said he remains confident the striking unions will prevail. A National Labor Relations Board judge has ruled strongly in the strikers’ favor he noted and the NLRB’s regional office recently took the unusual step of signaling its intent to seek an injunction that could bring the strikers back to work under their last contract and compel the company to bargain in good faith a new one.

“We’ll have our day in court and we will win the strike” Tanner said “no matter whether the Blocks are fighting with each other.”

In the suit Allan Block seeks a preliminary injunction to prevent BCI from being sold by his brother Pittsburgh’s John R. Block and others who run the company several of whom also live in the Pittsburgh area.

The motion says John Block — the publisher and editor-in-chief of the two newspapers — several times has tried and failed to replace the plaintiff Allan Block as CEO a position he is contracted to hold until 2028. “Now in a last-ditch effort to assert his so-called ‘sovereignty’ John Block has conspired with the rest of the Director Defendants to exclude Plaintiff from the most major decision to ever face BCI in its over 100 years of existence: a full sale of all its assets.”

The privately-held BCI started in 1901 by the Block brothers’ grandfather Paul Block is not currently for sale but the motion says that in January John Block “caused BCI to form a strategic transaction committee to pursue a merger or acquisition of the company.” That committee the suit says excluded Allan Block.

That news and the possibility raised in the motion that this committee making a “rushed and haphazard” sale “will result in significant job losses” was concerning to people who are working for those businesses as well as those who are on strike especially at a time when newspapers specifically and media in generally are struggling.

The Block family’s struggle for control of BCI looks to play out in court as does the strikers’ struggle for a contract.

The motion confirms that Allan and John Block each have a 25% stake in BCI while the other 50% is owned by family trusts that benefit family members.

Listed as defendants in the suit in addition to BCE and John Block are William Block Jr. exempt and non-exempt trusts Donald G. Block exempt and non-exempt trusts Karen D. Johnese exempt and non-exempt trusts Barbara L. Block exempt and non-exempt trusts Block Family trust No. 2 Karen Johnese Diana Block Ron Davenport Nancy Reid and Emily Escalante.

Donald Block who lives in Fox Chapel in February was named president of Pittsburgh City Paper after it was purchased by a BCI subsidiary.

Meanwhile workers in four production unions went on strike at the Post-Gazette in October 2022 over a dispute that left them without health care coverage. Journalists in the Newspaper Guild of Pittsburgh joined them later in their own unfair labor practices strike which is now in its 19th month. The Guild’s issues go back farther than that in that the union’s last contract expired in 2017 and in 2020 the PG citing an impasse in contract bargaining imposed conditions including a company health plan on the workers.

In April the striking journalists learned that the regional office of the National Labor Relations Board had received approval from the NLRB to seek an injunction in their case in which a NLRB administrative law judge had in January 2023 ruled strongly in favor of the union. The judge ruled that the company had to bring the strikers back to work under their last contract and bargain a new one. The company appealed that decision and the appeal has yet to be heard by the NLRB. The union is expecting the regional NLRB office to file the injunction — called a 10(j) injunction — any day now but until it is doesn’t know the scope of what the NLRB wants a judge to order.

It’s a complicated situation and one with many moving and not moving parts.

Also in April one union the distribution workers ended its strike with the PG agreeing to do so and dissolve their union in exchange for severance payments.

The remaining unions still on strike have stressed that the Post-Gazette could settle with them at any time. The most recent actual bargaining sessions that the Pittsburgh Union Progress knows about and attended were in September of 2023. (One union met with company representatives in February to set bargaining dates but the Union Progress doesn’t know if any subsequent sessions happened.)

The Blocks’ commitment to the Post-Gazette is unclear though John Block said on Wednesday in a statement to The Blade that he remains “committed” to the PG as well as The Blade.

In a brief statement given to The Blade and other outlets a representative of Allan Block seemed to contradict that writing “It is unfortunate that certain Block family members would choose to further enrich themselves at the expense of local jobs and the communities that depend on local news coverage.”

Phone calls and messages from the Pittsburgh Union Progress to Allan Block John Block and Donald Block seeking interviews or comments about the lawsuit and the strike were not returned.

A small contingent of striking journalists went to John Block’s home on Wednesday and he was not home so a small group returned on Thursday evening. A man who answered the door said Block was not home and that the group could try again Friday.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMicWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNpbmNpbm5hdGkuY29tL3N0b3J5L25ld3MvMjAyNC8wNS8wOS9wZy1zaXR0ZW5mZWxkLWFwcGVhbHMtYnJpYmVyeS1leHRvcnRpb24tY29udmljdGlvbnMvNzM2MjY1NjAwMDcv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,PG Sittenfeld appeal: What's criminal when it comes to campaign contributions?,"No commitment required.

Getting a star athlete on a video call for a reasonable fee was an easy sell to fans but not to the athletes—the company had so many athlete no-shows for calls that the effort was scuttled by constant refunds.

He has higher hopes for his second athlete venture: Finlete which keeps the fan meet-and-greet of the first effort but adds what should be a stronger motivator—more money.

“Finlete is a platform that allows fans to support for now minor league baseball players” Connolly said in a phone call. “And with the current amount of money that these athletes make in the minor leagues there’s a really interesting potential return that people participating in Finlete can see.”

Finlete is a new entry in the increasingly popular financial play of athlete investing in which funds swap an upfront payment to an aspiring pro in exchange for a fixed percentage cut of future sports income. Comcast owns 7% of Finlete’s business while famed venture capitalist Tim Draper has a $50000 seed investment in the endeavor.

For Finlete Connolly sees a lot of potential in farm team ballplayers partly because minor league baseball pays most players badly. Finlete’s first athlete Texas Rangers middle infield prospect Echedry Vargas signed with the club out of the Dominican Republic in 2022 for a $10000 bonus–the minimum at the time according to Connolly. Right now Vargas plays in A-ball where salaries max out at $27300. “He’s like a minimum wage guy … but outperforming players that signed for millions of dollars” the executive said.

Finlete is taking a crowd-funding approach selling shares in a Securities & Exchange Commission-registered offering to retail investors. Investors can buy shares in Vargas for $8 (with a 12-share minimum) with the player receiving a $500000 advance. In exchange investors get a claim of 10% of his baseball earnings for the next 25 years if he makes The Show or even if he ends up off-Broadway so to speak in the top pro leagues of Japan Korea and Taiwan according to the player agreement disclosed as part of the offering. If he fails to make the majors stateside or in Asia Vargas won’t owe anything. The offering is still raising money and has about $26000 in commitments according to the Finlete website.

The presence of smart money suggests there’s increasing traction with the idea of swapping a lump sum of cash now for a cut of athlete income later on. The current wave of start-ups was sparked by the initial success of Big League Advance a private fund that is best known for striking a deal with the now-superstar Fernando Tatis Jr. when he was a minor leaguer. Finlete joins the golf pro-focused Commonwealth Sports NFL player-backing Vestible and international soccer player investing Nordensa—which isn’t available to American investors—as more recent entrants to the budding scene.

Conscious of the other competitors in the space the company sees the carryover of the original Cameo-like idea as a key to drawing in fan investors; part of the pitch to athletes too is to build a cadre of supporters early. In Vargas’ case he commits to things such as signing 100 autographs annually and holding meet-and-greets with fans at games as perks to people buying a minimum number of shares and at least two 30-minute video-chat appearance annually under the deal.

“It’s like a PG version of OnlyFans” Connolly said. “You’re involved with the athlete on an intimate level. You get to be a part of the athlete’s journey you get to hear what they’re struggling with and what they’re working on.”

Such a relationship is also potentially lucrative for Finlete. If the current share offering in Vargas’ future income sells its maximum proposed level of $800000 (100000 shares) $300000 goes to cover the offering costs and reimbursements to Finlete. It’s not quite a fair comparison because certain costs aren’t proportional but a typical stock IPO sees about 5% of proceeds directed to expenses and commissions. Finlete also gets the right of first refusal to buy any future baseball-related income Vargas might consider selling.

“We want to do $100 million in revenue in two years. We want to create a trading platform that allows fans to buy and sell their positions … and have over 100 athletes on our platform from Nascar drivers to horse racing jockeys to baseball players and UFC fighters” Connolly said.

That’s a lot of hope riding on the shoulders of Vargas who is currently batting .227 for the Down East Wood Ducks of the Carolina League.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZveDE5LmNvbS8yMDI0LzA1LzA5L3BnLXNpdHRlbmZlbGQtY29ycnVwdGlvbi1jYXNlLWZlZGVyYWwtYXBwZWFscy1jb3VydC1oZWFyLWFyZ3VtZW50cy10aHVyc2RheS_SAXxodHRwczovL3d3dy5mb3gxOS5jb20vMjAyNC8wNS8wOS9wZy1zaXR0ZW5mZWxkLWNvcnJ1cHRpb24tY2FzZS1mZWRlcmFsLWFwcGVhbHMtY291cnQtaGVhci1hcmd1bWVudHMtdGh1cnNkYXkvP291dHB1dFR5cGU9YW1w?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,P.G. Sittenfeld corruption case: Federal appeals court hears arguments Thursday,"CINCINNATI (WXIX) - Attorneys for former Cincinnati City Council member P.G. Sittenfeld returned to a federal courtroom Thursday to try to overturn his convictions for bribery and attempted extortion.

A three-judge panel with the 6th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals heard arguments from his attorneys and then federal prosecutors.

No decision is expected anytime soon.

Sittenfeld 39 of East Walnut Hills is one of three former Cincinnati council members arrested in 2020 and convicted on federal public corruption charges in a series of cases federal authorities launched in 2017.

At the time of his arrest Sittenfeld was the front-runner in the mayor’s race and repeatedly received the most votes in city council elections.

Sittenfeld rejected a plea deal before his trial that would have limited his punishment if found guilty from probation only to two years or less in prison court records show.

The jury did find him not guilty on four of the six total charges. Those were two counts of honest services wire fraud and one count each of bribery and extortion.

Last year U.S. District Court Judge Douglas Cole rejected Sittenfeld’s request to throw out his convictions and get a new trial.

Sittenfeld failed to present “any persuasive arguments” supporting either motion the judge wrote in his 26-page order.

Judge Cole sentenced Sittenfeld to 16 months in prison and one year of supervised release once he’s out.

In early January Sittenfeld reported to a prison in northeastern Kentucky. Federal Correction Institution of Ashland is a minimum-security prison about 2.5 hours away from Cincinnati.

It was listed as one of America’s “10 Cushiest Prisons” by Forbes magazine.

Federal prosecutors say Sittenfeld promised to support perform “official acts” and “deliver the votes” to help the development of a property with sports betting at 435 Elm Street across from the Duke Energy Convention Center in downtown Cincinnati in exchange for $20000 in donations to his political action fund (PAC) federal court records show.

His indictment alleged he solicited the money in exchange for his support to develop the Elm Street property which former Cincinnati Bengals player turned developer Chinedum Ndukwe envisioned as a hotel and office complex with apartments and a restaurant.

“This was not a single event one-off deal or momentary lapse in judgment” federal prosecutors wrote in his sentencing memo.

“Sittenfeld’s actions were part of a broader strategy to use his position of power within local government and his prospects for higher office to extract financial contributions out of individuals who regularly conducted city business. In doing so Sittenfeld made clear that his support for their city business was tied directly to their contributions to him. This is not faithful public service or even “politics as usual”—this is corruption.”

Sittenfeld’s federal trial attorneys however have repeatedly said that his indictment actually proved he did not commit a “quid pro quo.”

He has always been pro-development they noted contending his actions (raising money for future campaigns) are all perfectly legal and this is typical business conducted by politicians.

Sittenfeld’s lead appellate attorneys are Yaakov Roth and James Burnham.

Burnham is a Washington D.C. attorney considered an expert in federal corruption law because he successfully represented former Virginia Governor Robert F. McDonnell in McDonnell v. United States.

That case was a major challenge to the scope of the Federal corruption laws because the 2016 ruling narrowed the legal definition of public corruption and made it harder for prosecutors to prove that a political official engaged in bribery.

In 2017 then-President Donald Trump appointed Burnham as Special Assistant to the President and Senior Associate Counsel to the President.

Now in Sittenfeld’s appeal Burnham and Roth argue that federal prosecutors didn’t show clear and precise proof of corruption the “quid pro quo.”

If Sittenfeld’s convictions are allowed to stand it would bring “a First Amendment Ice Age” where every politician could face prosecution for fundraising according to his appeal.

“The government engineered a sting to see if (Sittenfeld) would accept a campaign donation in exchange for supporting a local development project. To maximize the sting’s chances of success the FBI approached Sittenfeld through one of his longtime existing donors in connection with a project Sittenfeld had already agreed to support” his appeal states.

“Yet despite the choreography Sittenfeld never bit. Over the course of a year-long prosecutorial Truman Show Sittenfeld rejected the only express quid pro quo his friend offered cautioned him on the legal limits around donations turned away contributions that did not comport with obscure campaign-finance rules and even invited two undercover agents to a dinner party with the U.S. Attorney.”

Several amicus briefs also have been filed in support of Sittenfeld’s appeal

Among them are ones from former U.S. Attorney Generals William Barr and John Ashcroft and the top federal prosecutor for the same government office who prosecuted Sittenfeld Carter Stewart. He was the U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of Ohio from 2009 to 2016.

Sittenfeld’s case they wrote “has two highly unusual features that render it an extreme outlier among campaign-finance bribery prosecutions. First Mr. Sittenfeld’s conduct did not involve the typical signs of wrongdoing that prosecutors expect to see when a public official is engaged in a corrupt enterprise…

“Second the case resulted from a two-year investigation that involved a sting operation specifically intended to uncover evidence of misconduct…The result was a conviction for conduct that was not criminal.”

Nicotine is one of the most addictive drugs in the world alongside heroin and cocaine and is what gets people hooked on tobacco which kills more than 8 million people every year.

PMI’s 0.5mg figure appears to be derived from its own modified version of the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) testing regime. The ISO regime measures the nicotine in a cigarette’s emissions – what you breathe in – which tends to be substantially lower than the total nicotine a cigarette contains.

Yet even if the 0.5mg figure was meant to refer to the stick’s emissions the Bureau’s testing found that each stick releases more than double this: 1.2mg. When approached by the Bureau PMI said that it had found a similar figure from its own “intense smoking” test regime – but we could not find any evidence that it has ever used this figure in any public communications.

PMI accused the Bureau of conflating nicotine emissions and nicotine content. It added that its own testing had found up to 4.6mg of total nicotine per stick and that the sticks “are considered to be as addictive as cigarettes”.

It also said the nicotine content of both heated tobacco sticks and cigarettes “is of low relevance to consumers” pointing out the differences between nicotine content emissions and exposure (the amount absorbed by the user).

But without any clear universal regulation as to which figure should be used and how it should be described consumers will continue to be misled.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMia2h0dHBzOi8vbmV3c2RheS5jby50dC8yMDIyLzA4LzI4L2thdGhlcmluZS1hbm4tYnlhbS1jYXJlZXItY29uc3VsdGFudC10dXJucy1qb3VybmFsbGluZy1pbnRvLXdyaXRpbmctYm9va3Mv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Katherine Ann Byam: Career consultant turns journalling into writing books,"Katherine Ann Byam: Career consultant turns journalling into writing books

Moving to a different country will always be a challenge especially if it's thousands of miles away from family and friends.

This is what author Katherine Ann Byam dealt with in 2009 when she first moved to the UK to pursue her career in Big Tobacco – a term used to refer to the largest companies in the tobacco industry.

The six largest tobacco companies are China National Tobacco Company British American Tobacco Philip Morris International Imperial Brands Altria Group and Japan Tobacco International.

At the time she held many roles and did jobs such as financing internal audit supply chain risk project management and change management. Byam now works for her own self-titled company and her brand and podcast Where Ideas Launch deals with career consultation.

""I provide consultancy services to small to medium enterprises on environmental social and governance implementation materiality assessments and sustainability strategy. I also coach leaders on implementing change either through group programmes or one-to-one. I run the courageous career club a group coaching programme to support positive impact career transitions.""

After having to celebrate a birthday in her 30s by herself in the winter of 2010 she started feeling depressed and to process her feelings she started journalling as advised by her therapist at the time.

""I was excited to be in Europe in the UK to be exact because it was after the financial crisis so it was an interesting time. But in 2010 I became really depressed because it was my birthday which is in January and it was also winter. I remember thinking 'oh my God why have I done this to myself? Why did I move to this cold place? Why did I do this?'""

With the intent of feeling comfortable with her decisions Byam started writing and eventually finished her first book – The Naked Finger – that is yet to be published.

""This is a book about me being single and drifting through these experiences I was having in my life my job at the time required me to travel all over the world and I was doing this as a single black woman so that brought lots of interesting experiences.""

But since the writing fever infected her she didn't stop there and wanted to help every one that felt the way she did 12 years earlier with her newly published book Do What Matters: The Purpose Driven Career Transition Guide.

""What I was going for with this book is something useful and well-researched but still accessible allowing the reader to feel like they're having a conversation with their slightly eccentric best friend. I wanted to write something that convinced people that they had the power to take action because I think a lot of us feel so overwhelmed at times.""

Byam said the book is to invoke a sense of purpose in every one whether they be seniors or fresh out of school and get them to think outside of the norm when it comes to their careers. She said while pursuing her master's in business administration in France in 2015 it allowed her to expand her interest on inequality geopolitics and frugal innovation.

""I knew then that I wanted to make a pivot to sustainable innovation in general and I wanted to also encourage others to do the same hence the coming together of my coaching and consulting work and my environmental and social activism in general.

""When I started my podcast Where Ideas Launch – The Sustainable Innovation podcast in 2020 I was really at the beginning of my journey in building credibility in this space but luckily I could lean on years and years of what I will describe as adjacent experiences to help me navigate some of the ethical and social questions.

""Having my community women in sustainable business as well this helped me to consolidate my knowledge and translate it into the incubator I also run.""

For her downtime Byam enjoys travelling either domestic or overseas and it all started because of her job.

""Travel started with my job. My first international audit assignment was in Mexico then Honduras. The interesting thing about the way my work was organised at the time was that we would have a multinational team going to a location for time periods of one week up to seven weeks.

""We would spend all our time on assignment so naturally evenings and weekends you got to explore the country you were in with either your clients your multinational peers or on your own.

""This meant that you got an immersion in a new culture whether you wanted to or not just by hanging out with the diverse group and if you were lucky local management would organise excursions for you to really experience and appreciate who they are and where they come from.

""After you’ve had that sort of experience it changes you. It’s impossible to have the same beliefs thought processes and behaviours once you’ve lived your life in another person’s shoes.""

She said it was also during that time that she began writing short stories self-deprecating pieces about encounters she had on her travels which were entertaining for her friends and peers.

Once she saw how much people were engaging with this content she started journalling more and so this format has found its way into her book. But more of her stories will be featured in her upcoming books Designed by Diversity/Built by Inclusion and The Naked Finger.

Byam added that she also makes time to walk along the coast as it's something that she cannot resist and takes every opportunity to do so either at the south of the UK or on the west coast of France.

""I also consider writing a hobby; this is the first time in 15 years of consistent writing have I managed to commercialise any of it! I also love music singing and dance although I have to say I’m not particularly good at any of those. ""

She has been doing this since 2007 as a means of solace while travelling every where without her family and she said this helped her develop her own voice as a person and author. Though her book is filled with helpful advice she still had some more to add to those who are looking at migrating or who has done so recently.

""Before you take a decision to leave your homeland and migrate know that integration takes time and be gentle and kind to yourself while being curious about others. At first you may consider that you don’t necessarily want to join communities of your own country folk because you want to learn the new culture but I recommend starting with country folk as they help you with that integration knowing where you came from and being able to anticipate things that will be weird different uncomfortable or huge adjustments for you.""

Byam said people should also develop hobbies that will help them meet new people so it can be easier to experience the new environment.

""Finally you will need to find the right blend for yourself between being authentically you and trying things a new way and that’s not an easy thing to know if you are getting right but be open to exploring and learning"" she added.

As for aspiring authors she said that writing is a demanding process and non-fiction does not sell as well as fiction but reminded people to always be clear on what they are writing and respect the process.

She gave ten pieces of advice to new and upcoming authors:

""Design for the outcome upfront; create a detailed manuscript plan; decide on your team; decide on what's critical to your quality; plan your research; manage the writing journey; involve your beta readers; manage proofing and editing; manage marketing and promotion; and plan and execute your public relations campaigns.""

Lastly she said to try and enjoy the process though it may be a long and seemingly treacherous one. The paperback version of Byam's book can be purchased on Amazon.",,,,,,,,,

By Ken MacLeod

For the talented golfers who grind out an existence on golf’s professional mini-tour circuits there has been a lot of bemusement as they’ve watched the elites of the game divvy up millions in the ongoing battle between the PGA Tour and LIV Golf.

The one bright spot for players such as Chandler Phillips who shot rounds of 65-63-67 for a 15-under 195 total to pocket $10000 for winning the Oklahoma Open at Oak Tree Country Club?

“The only good thing for us is that spots are opening up that have to get filled” said Chandler. “That means more opportunities.”

Chandler took full advantage of his opportunity and also the misfortune of his friend and playing companion Preston Stanley in Saturday’s final round.

Stanley the son of former University of Oklahoma golfer Jim Stanley and a 2015 graduate of Houston Baptist had poured in seven birdies to erase a three-shot deficit to Chandler to start the round the final one of which on the par-4 15th moved him to 16-under one shot ahead of Phillips.

After both players made par on 16 Stanley pulled his tee shot left into an unplayable lie on the par-3 17th over water leading to a double bogey which dropped him a shot behind. Then he pulled his drive on the par-4 18th left and out-of-bounds. The resultant triple bogey dropped him into a tie for third at 11-under with former Oklahoma State golfer Trent Whitekiller of Fort Smith Ark. who closed with the day’s best round a 6-under 64.

“Not really how you want to win” said Phillips a 2019 Texas A&M graduate who is the second-leading money winner on the 2022 All Pro Tour (APT). “I kind of got lucky. Preston was playing great better than anyone on the course for 16 holes. I know he wasn’t trying to flirt with the left side. That’s just golf. And I can’t believe what happened to his drive on 18. We all thought it was fine.

“I love winning but would rather do it in a different way. I play with Preston a lot and respect him so much.”

There have been many similar disasters late in the final round for leaders in the Oklahoma Open. Sam Stevens was comfortably ahead just last year until taking a triple-bogey on the par-3 13th. Chase Hanna led the 2020 Oklahoma Open by a shot standing on the 18th tee box but hit his drive out-of-bounds leading to a triple bogey and a two-shot loss.

It was the first win for Phillips since a second-stage event of PGA Tour Qualifying School last year. He has finished second three times this summer on the APT. He hopes the momentum carries him through the final stage this year when he goes back in search of his Korn Ferry Tour card.

First-round leader Christian Jalomo of Richmond Texas moved into second place after Stanley’s misfortunes three shots back of Phillips at 12-under after rounds of 62-69-67.

Griffen Locke of Joplin Mo. Logan Smith of La Plata Mo. and Joel Thelan of Hudson Oaks Texas tied for third at 9-under.

Oral Roberts University golfer Lane Wallace of Yukon was low amateur with rounds of 70-66-67 to finish at 8-under.

With the East Course playing firm and fast the young bombers turned it into mostly a pitch and putt. Phillips hit wedge or less into most of the par-4s with the exception of one hole in which he miss-hit his tee shot. Same for Stanley. There were even wedges hit on the second shot on the 562-yard par-5 12th including a beauty to about 3-feet for eagle by newly turned professional Brock Polhill of Edmond.

“You were getting 40 or 50 yards of roll on some of the drives so it’s not surprising that it played short” Stanley said.

Stanley said he pulled the wrong club on the 207-yard 17th.

“I tried to hit an easy 5-iron and should have just pulled the 6-iron and ripped it” he said. “It started a little left and then just went left with the wind. That’s golf.”

Stanley who hit brilliant wedge shots consistently in making the seven birdies said he left college with a 5-year plan to try to make it to the next level.

“Then I started playing some good golf toward the end of it so here I am in year seven” he said. “I am confident I can make it. The way I’m hitting it and putting absolutely I believe I can make it through.”

It was the final official OGA event for retiring executive director Mark Felder who unfortunately had to leave with an illness after getting the final groups started.

For example the terribly sad tragic death of a 2-year-old and her grandmother last year when Central flooded.

Plus we also can't forget the time a sinkhole swallowed a car in Central El Paso recently. Hell that story even made it on CNN and KSAT.com which stunned others outside El Paso.

Clearly we can't do anything when it comes to mother nature's deadly forces. The best thing for El Pasoans to do during a flash flood is to avoid being out if they don't need to be.

Unless you have to go to work or your job consists of you having to be on the road. But tons of people already know how much of a risk it is to drive when it is raining in El Paso.

Well the Eastbound side of 10 Freeway near the Arizona and California border collapsed. This isn't a first when it comes to heavy rainfall in California.

The road collapsed in Pinole California in 2017 due to heavy rainfall just refer to the video above. Just this past Thursday FOX 11 Los Angeles shared a YouTube video of the massive damage due to a flash flood below.

Something like this is definitely worse than having a semi-truck jack-knife on I-10 in El Paso. But can you imagine if I-10 had collapsed somewhere in El Paso the way it did over 700 miles away?

I am sure some people in El Paso worry about this happening when we have heavy rainfall that leads to a flash flood. This is something we hope doesn't happen in El Paso and if it does hopefully there are no drivers when it does. So if you're expecting someone from California who is driving make sure they know the detour to get to El Paso from California.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiOWh0dHBzOi8vdXNyYXJhY2luZy5jb20vbmV3cy9uZXdzX2FydGljbGUuYXNwP05ld3NJRD04NzM0OdIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,United States Racing Association | Griggs Charles triumph at Electric City Speedway,"OFFICIAL RESULTS

ROGERS -- The final phase of The District at Pinnacle Hills project should be nearing completion over the next three years according to the developer.

A luxury hotel restaurants shops business offices apartments a central plaza and two parking decks are planned for the major development on approximately 54 acres off West Pauline Whitaker Boulevard and South J.B. Hunt Drive.

""In the next 24 months everything will be finished or under development"" said Burke Larkin of Whisinvest Realty. ""In about 36 months I think we'll pretty much be seeing the conclusion of the project.""

Whisinvest acquired the land along Interstate 49 as part of a 2012 purchase of about 368 acres of bank-owned property in Benton County Larkin said. The company is still the landowner or building owner of the entire project area he said.

The project is situated in the southern portion of Pinnacle Hills designated the uptown regional center in the comprehensive growth map which guides development decisions for the city. Regional growth centers function as hubs for commerce arts and entertainment living recreation and retail according to the map.

Pinnacle Hills is one reason why Rogers is on course for a record year in sales tax revenue according to Steve Cox senior vice president of economic development for Rogers-Lowell Chamber of Commerce.

The city posted record-setting revenue numbers almost $2.461 million for August.

The 2-square-mile area represents well over $2 billion in development over the last 15 years according to Raymond Burns president and chief executive officer of the chamber.

Pinnacle Hills which extends from Village on the Creeks to Mercy Hospital and the Pinnacle Hills Promenade to recent developments around the Walmart Arkansas Music Pavilion has added to the quality of life in Rogers and The District will continue that Burns said.

""Back in the day I used to buy cow dirt out there"" he said. ""Seeing all that come together from its humbler beginnings has been amazing.""

THE PLANS

Five buildings totaling 153415 square feet -- two retail and restaurant spaces and three offices -- are already complete.

The buildings housing Andy's Frozen Custard Juicy Tails Fuzzy's Taco Shop European Wax Center Uptown Nail Spa Mirabella's Table and Smitty's Garage at 4200 and 4204 S. J.B. Hunt Drive and 4200 S. 48th St. were the first phase of development.

The second phase included class A office buildings at 4206 4300 and 4302 S. J.B. Hunt Drive one of which is home to Whisinvest Realty.

The final phase consisting of mixed-use buildings an outdoor plaza parking decks an apartment complex and a hotel will expand the project along Pauline Whitaker and the southbound ramp onto Interstate 49 to the Razorback Greenway which borders the property's eastern boundary.

Two mixed-use buildings are scheduled next for construction and should be ready for tenants in August 2023 according to Larkin.

The city's Planning Commission approved last month plans to construct a 40539-square-foot building a 61683-square-foot building and paved parking on 7.6 acres at 4301 S. J.B. Hunt Drive.

""We're excited to be building again and we're excited to be working with some of the tenants and restaurants we're talking to"" Larkin said.

In total the five mixed-use buildings of The District's third phase will house about 62500 square feet of retail and restaurant space primarily on the first floors and a total of about 107250 square feet of office space primarily on the second floors he said.

A green space plaza will be placed in the middle of the mixed-use buildings and south of the planned hotel. The plaza will include restaurant spaces of about 3500 and 4500 square feet according to Whisinvest.

The apartment complex on the eastern side of the development will house 305 units according to Whisinvest. It will be bordered on the west by the mixed-use buildings and a parking deck on the south by another parking deck and on the east by the Razorback Greenway.

The nearby portion of the greenway runs north and south parallel to Blossom Way Creek beside the eastern edge of the property.

THE HOTEL

Mississippi-based hospitality and real estate firm LRC2 Properties will co-develop with Whisinvest a luxury lifestyle hotel in the northern area of The District.

Regional growth the corporate and family markets and the nearby Walmart AMP all helped attract the firm to invest in the Rogers property according to Luke Chamblee president of LRC2.

The 150-room 95000-square-foot hotel will be a ""destination hotel"" in Marriott's Tribute Portfolio which are more customized and styled to the character of their locations than other Marriott brands according to Chamblee.

LRC2 is in the early design process Chamblee said.

Food and beverage establishments will be in the lobby and on the rooftop he said.

Details of the project and branding will be much clearer in about a year but the name likely will be something situated to the region like The Memphian in Memphis Tenn. he said.

LRC2's portfolio includes three hotels in the Tribute Portfolio family: The Memphian in Memphis and Cotton House in Cleveland Miss. both of which are finished; and The Alamite in Tuscaloosa Ala. which is unfinished.

The firm has also developed hospitality projects such as The Graduate and Home 2 Suites in Oxford Miss.; Hotel Indigo in Hattiesburg Miss.; and Holiday Inn Express and Suites in Flowood Miss.

Tribute Portfolio is ""a growing global family of characterful independent hotels drawn together by their passion for captivating design and their drive to create vibrant social scenes for guests and locals alike"" according to Marriott. The brand includes more than 70 hotels around the world.

Intel has signed a agreement with the infrastructure affiliate of Brookfield Asset Management one of the largest global alternative asset managers which will provide Intel with a new expanded pool of capital for manufacturing build-outs.

SCIP is a key element of Intel’s Smart Capital approach which aims to provide innovative ways to fund growth. Intel’s agreement with Brookfield follows the two companies’ memorandum of understanding announced in February 2022. Under the terms of the agreement the companies will jointly invest up to $30 billion in Intel’s previously announced manufacturing expansion at its Ocotillo campus in Chandler Arizona with Intel funding 51% and Brookfield funding 49% of the total project cost. Intel will retain majority ownership and operating control of the two new leading-edge chip factories in Chandler which will support long-term demand for Intel’s products and provide capacity for Intel Foundry Services (IFS) customers. The transaction with Brookfield is expected to close by the end of 2022 subject to customary closing conditions.

“This landmark arrangement is an important step forward for Intel’s Smart Capital approach and builds on the momentum from the recent passage of the CHIPS Act in the U.S.” said David Zinsner Intel CFO. “Semiconductor manufacturing is among the most capital-intensive industries in the world and Intel’s bold IDM 2.0 strategy demands a unique funding approach. Our agreement with Brookfield is a first for our industry and we expect it will allow us to increase flexibility while maintaining capacity on our balance sheet to create a more distributed and resilient supply chain.”

Sam Pollock CEO of Brookfield Infrastructure said “By combining Brookfield’s access to large-scale capital with Intel’s industry leadership we are furthering the advancement of leading semiconductor production capabilities. Leveraging our partnership experience in other industries we are pleased to come together with Intel in this important investment that will form part of the long-term digital backbone of the global economy.”

Benefits of the Transaction

Intel’s partnership with Brookfield is expected to enhance the company’s strong balance sheet by allowing Intel to tap into a new pool of capital below its cost of equity while protecting its cash and debt capacity for future investments and continuing to fund a healthy and growing dividend. Over the next several years the structure is expected to provide a $15 billion cumulative benefit to Intel’s adjusted free cash flow and is expected to be accretive to Intel’s earnings per share during the construction and ramp phase. SCIP provides Intel the ability to replicate the co-investment model with other partners for other build-outs globally.

Intel’s Smart Capital Approach

SCIP is an important component of Intel’s overall Smart Capital approach which is designed to allow the company to adjust quickly to opportunities in the market while managing its margin structure and capital spending. Through SCIP Intel is accessing strategically aligned capital to increase its flexibility and help efficiently accelerate and scale its manufacturing build-outs. This type of co-investment also shows how private capital is unlocked and becomes a force multiplier for government incentives for semiconductor manufacturing expansion.

In addition to SCIP the other key elements of Smart Capital include:

Smart capacity investments: Intel is aggressively building out relatively low-cost shell space which gives the company flexibility in how and when it brings additional capacity online based on milestone triggers such as product readiness market conditions and customer commitments. In 2021 approximately 35% of Intel’s capital expenditures was spent on infrastructure.

In 2021 approximately 35% of Intel’s capital expenditures was spent on infrastructure. Government incentives: Intel is continuing to work with governments in the U.S. and Europe to advance incentives for domestic manufacturing capacity for leading-edge semiconductors. Considerable progress has been made over recent months as President Biden signed into law the CHIPS and Science Act of 2022 that includes funding for $52 billion in incentives for the U.S. semiconductor industry; the U.S. Congress is making strides with the FABS Act which will establish a semiconductor investment tax credit in the U.S.; and the European Chips Act has added 15 billion euros to an existing 30 billion euros in public investments to build new infrastructure among other advancements.

Customer commitments: IFS is working closely with potential customers and several have indicated willingness to make advance payments to secure capacity. This provides Intel with the advantage of committed volume de-risking investments while providing capacity corridors for its foundry customers.

External foundries: The company intends to continue its use of external foundries where their unique capabilities support Intel’s leadership products.

“Intel’s Smart Capital actions provide Intel with greater flexibility reduce overall gross capital needs and act as a tailwind to adjusted free cash flow and gross margin. We expect that SCIP combined with the other pillars of our Smart Capital approach will allow us to significantly accelerate our transformation and help deliver the more globally balanced supply chain the world needs” Zinsner concluded.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiRWh0dHBzOi8vbmF0aW9uLmFmcmljYS9rZW55YS9uZXdzL2V4cGVydHMtMTAtcnVsZXMtb2Ytc3dpbW1pbmctMzkyOTA0MtIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Experts: 10 rules of swimming | Nation,"The water whose presence on a planet signifies life was the same liquid that took Hellen “Wendy” Nyabuto’s life.

A 24-year-old who was determined to rescue her family from the clutches of poverty by working in Canada Hellen had her life figured out until a swimming pool accident on August 18 took it all down the drain.

She post-humously gained fame because she was live-streaming her swim when the tragedy happened. The Toronto Star reports that Hellen will be celebrated this weekend in Toronto.

Yet Hellen wasn’t the first person to drown in a swimming pool in different circumstances.

In Hellen’s case the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation reports that on the day she died she had done a morning shift at a long-term care home in Owen Sound Ontario.

“It was 2pm when she arrived back at the motel where she was staying. Shortly after she went for a swim in the motel’s pool while recording herself through a Facebook Live” says the outlet in a report published on Wednesday.

The police said in a statement that Hellen “was removed from the pool and pronounced dead after life-saving measures were unsuccessful”.

The Sunday Nation engaged local swimming coaches who watched the video that captured Hellen’s tragic death. Not in any way blaming her the trainers pointed out what went wrong and gave important tips — dos and don’ts — on swimming.

Bernard Okome noted that her strokes were not perfect. “She was fighting the water all along. Always be gentle with water.”

Kenneth Wena said Hellen was okay in the shallow-end but could have ventured into the deep end unknowingly.

On the other hand Martin Wafula  pool attendant swimming instructor and lifeguard at the Grand Royal Swiss Hotel in Kisumu said one should always try not to be alone when swimming

Below are 10 general swimming pool rules as collected from the experts:

The 10 rules for safe swimming

1. Never ever swim alone

“Swimming alone is risky because there are times when you can get an emergency while inside the water. If you’re alone no one will help you” advised Wafula.

To which Okome added: “However good you are never swim alone because it’s always possible to die in the shallow end of a pool. Why? Because when you dive inside water you hold your breath. And the lack of breathing affects the brain and it can shut down. You just die like that because the oxygen is not there. You may think you’re comfortable holding your breath but you are dying.”

Wena also weighed in: “Even for us (expert) swimmers we are told not to swim alone. There has to be someone; you never know what happens.”

2.Know the shallow and deep ends

“Always make sure you know where the deep and the shallow ends are so that you can differentiate them. This is because when swimming most people close their eyes. You can open your eyes when you’re in the deep end and start wondering what you’ll do. The moment you start to ask yourself those kinds of questions that’s when fear gets in and once the fear gets in that’s when drowning follows” advised Okome.

He went on: “So long as you’re a pro-swimmer you can swim anywhere in the pool. A pro-swimmer doesn’t always look for the deep or the shallow end.”

Wena said people need to get more education on the basic parts of a swimming pool and to understand the deep and shallow ends.

3. Panicking only helps the water to kill you

Okome believes that most incidents of pool drowning happen as a result of panicking and throwing arms all over yet one should remain calm. Calmness he said helps one float in water of whatever depth.

Said Okome: “Always calm down and relax. The water will always carry you over. You will always float when you relax; don’t panic. That panic is what makes you sink. So don’t panic always float. You can even sleep on water looking at the sky then the water will always carry you. The moment you start fighting water it will fight you back.”

4. You are not a fish

“When around water always be careful. We are not fish and that’s all I can say. Any water body that you see around is harmful. Always be cautious however shallow it may be” Wena cautioned.

5. Don’t swim while intoxicated

Wafula said there is a risk of death if someone goes swimming when intoxicated. You won’t get a clearer warning on this than the one that is on the US army website under an article titled “Alcohol and water don’t mix”. It was published in 2019 and is written by Pamela Doty of the US Army Corps of Engineers.

6. Train well that an immobilised limb won’t cost you

“You know a muscle pull only attacks just one leg. But for swimming you can swim with your legs only or your hands only. It’s not a must that you engage both. So your legs may cramp but you can use your hands on your way to safety” said Wena.

Equally said Okome a person should train so well that even when they have no rubber tube or a floating device they can swim comfortably.

“You always need to know how to survive in the water with or without those floaters because it can find you anywhere; maybe a flood or something” he said.

7. Follow the rules

In any pool you are likely to encounter instructions. Wafula said it will be foolhardy to ignore them.

“The poolside should always have those rules and regulations. They should always be put in a place where they can be seen clearly and in a place where anyone can see and read” said Wafula. Rules like taking a shower before going into the pool and having proper swimming attire are common.

8. Get an expert to train you

“Many people know how to swim in their minds” said Okome. “In fact everybody you meet will tell you that they know how to swim. But that’s very wrong. Be genuine with yourself and always do what you’re very sure about. If you don’t know how to swim don’t try. Water always assumes that everyone that gets inside it knows how to swim. So don’t try swimming if you know very well you don’t know how to” he added. Okome recommended that everyone learns how to swim as it is a life skill. He also noted that the adventure-filled swims by children in rivers lakes oceans and other water bodies may not provide enough skills to survive drowning.

9. Not all pools are to be dived into

Your idea of a swimming pool might be the Olympics type where agile men and women dive in and compete like fishes in water. However not every side of a pool is worth diving into as Wafula explained. He added that it pays to listen to one’s lifeguard and to avoid distracting the guard with too many conversations.

The event held at Sixth Street Shelter in Allentown officially kicked off Be a Housing Hero with PPL Foundation and United Way as an added initiative to United Way’s 2022 campaign.

PPL Corporation and UWGLV believe that a strong resilient and united community can address the area’s housing crisis and invest in prevention and intervention solutions. In support of the PPL Corporation’s United Way campaign the PPL Foundation has committed up to $500000 this year through a matching program for all new or increased campaign contributions. The funds will go directly to United Way’s work in the community to aid neighbors and families experiencing housing insecurity.

“PPL Foundation’s pledge of up to $500000 will provide support for thousands of people who are experiencing homelessness or housing insecurity right here in the communities we serve” stated Vince Sorgi CEO and president of PPL Corporation and co-chair of the 2022 UWGLV campaign. “By partnering with United Way we know that these funds will be invested into organizations like Sixth Street Shelter and others in the community whose missions align with addressing housing insecurity through prevention and intervention.”

Sorgi along with his wife Michelle and fellow co-chairs Ashley and Joe Russo are committed to investing in United Way solutions to combat the growing housing insecurity felt by so many.

“At United Way of the Greater Lehigh Valley we believe that through a united approach we can truly make a difference” said David Lewis president of UWGLV. “I am grateful to the PPL Foundation and for Vince Michelle Ashley and Joe’s leadership and passionate commitment toward this growing need.”

Between now and March 31 2023 the community is encouraged to Be a Housing Hero and make a donation to the campaign by texting HOUSE to 40403. Additionally PPL Foundation’s gift will apply to all new or increased participation in corporate campaigns or online donations made to unitedwayglv.org/housinghero.

“Many people in the Greater Lehigh Valley are only one paycheck or emergency away from hunger or homelessness” reported Dawn Godshall executive director CALV. “Through the PPL Foundation’s commitment Community Action’s Sixth Street Shelter with vital assistance from United Way can invest in more solutions to help the ever-growing need in our area.”

The housing crisis in our community has increased due to many factors including the past two years’ health and economic crises. The Lehigh Valley’s most recent homeless reports depict a 36% increase in people experiencing homelessness in the region since 2020 including 50% more families with children and almost twice as many veterans. 122000 families (or 44%) are also currently experiencing serious financial instability and are forced to make difficult decisions daily such as whether to buy groceries or pay rent.

“There is no doubt that the nationwide housing crisis is being felt right here in our communities” said Sorgi. “With thousands of people at risk of homelessness or eviction PPL Foundation is honored to help those impacted by this situation.”

Shares Verizon of have outperformed the Zacks Wireless National industry over the past year (+12.8% vs. +11.7%). The company has reported modest first-quarter results with the bottom line beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate but the top line missing the same. The deployment of a cloud-native container-based virtualized architecture has led to increased flexibility scalability and cost efficiency across its network.



Verizon is offering various mix and match pricing in both wireless and home broadband plans which has led to solid client additions. Focus on emerging growth services like cloud security and professional services will likely reap long-term benefits.



However lower wireline and wireless equipment revenues are major concerns. Huge promotional expenses and lucrative discounts to expand customer base are weighing on margins.

ISRG’s initiative to increase the pricing of procedures should also continue to aid in sales growth in 2024.Improving procedure volume along with better system placements and services across all markets will drive top-line growth this year. Launch of da Vinci SP in Europe and da Vinci 5 in U.S. market should drive system placements higher.



However ongoing supply chain constraints although easing are likely to hurt the availability of devices. Labor shortage in hospitals will likely act as a headwind to procedure growth in 2024.

In a two-part series user @shanball starts by retracting a former positive video saying she was hired to work at the company. The video currently has over 200000 views.

“I take it back. I take it all back” she says. “Do not recommend. Zero out of 10. Negative 10 out of 10”

In a follow-up she shows job reviews from sites like Indeed to which she claims to agree with though she says that one was “maybe written by” herself.

The video cites numerous issues such as a lack of training constant surveillance being reprimanded for using the bathroom and more.

“Those are all employee reviews I found online” she explains. “I wish I had found those two months ago.”

She also claims that the training sessions made constant references to “drinking the Kool-Aid” explaining in a comment that they were allegedly “telling us over and over we needed to ‘drink Flo’s Kool-Aid.’”

As @shanball notes in her video “drinking the Kool-Aid” is a reference to the Jonestown Massacre in which a group of over 900 people under considerable pressure either voluntarily or forcefully consumed poisoned Flavor Aid thus killing them.

However when it comes to the positives of the job @shanball does note that the “pay and benefits are pretty decent.”

Despite this @shanball claims the toxic work environment led many of her co-workers to leave their positions.

“It’s not just me because nearly half the training class I started with is no longer there” she details.

In comments users shared similar experiences at both Progressive and other insurance companies.

“I was a injury adjuster for Statefarm” one user wrote. “I feel you.”

“I had interview with liberty Mutual with the recruiter who was snarky af” a second added. “I skipped my 1st interview and they text me to interview for A YEAR.”

“Can confirm everything that was said” a third shared. “Getting out of the call centers is a huge difference. Get into a local office and the pay is better and calmer.”

Still some shared their positive experiences with the company.

“I actually started as an adjuster at Progressive.. its tough but if you stick it out it opens many doors” a commenter offered. “Im now a litigated GL adjuster…with a much better work/life and MUCH more pay at a different company but it was prog training me on claims from the ground up that got me here!”

The Daily Dot reached out to Progressive via email and @shanball via TikTok comment.

It was March 2020—the beginning of the pandemic—and so he called a government help line. He was told that he might have the coronavirus and that he should stay home. But without leaving the house for a test Hernández couldn’t get proof of his illness—and without that proof he had no excuse for not coming into work. A week after he got sick he said his company fired him. (The firm cited “insufficient” job performance as the motive.)

Alone and newly jobless during lockdown Hernández who was thirty-two at the time considered his life. He was an engineer with expertise in the automotive industry so finding a new position wouldn’t be difficult. But he didn’t want just any new job. He wanted to work for a company that treated workers decently. His girlfriend who lived in the Basque region of northern Spain suggested that he consider a position within a group of worker-owned coöperatives there called Mondragon.

The Mondragon Corporation as it’s known is a voluntary association of ninety-five autonomous coöperatives that differs radically from a conventional company. Each co-op’s highest-paid executive makes at most six times the salary of its lowest-paid employee. There are no outside shareholders; instead after a temporary contract new workers who have proved themselves may become member-owners of their co-ops. A managing director acts as a kind of C.E.O. within each co-op but the members themselves vote on many vital decisions about strategy salaries and policy and the votes of all members whether they are senior management or blue-collar count equally.

When individual coöperatives do well their members share in the profits. When times are hard the coöperatives collectively support one another sharing funds and reallocating workers among themselves to preserve jobs. During the pandemic workers at many Mondragon co-ops voted to temporarily reduce their own salaries or hours until markets recovered; people who felt sick were trusted and encouraged to stay home. The treatment Hernández said he received when he was fired would be almost impossible within Mondragon since worker-owners must vote to dismiss one another and this can occur only in cases of very severe misconduct.

Worker-owned coöperatives are often considered both idealistic and inefficient; the model is seen as suitable mainly for upscale grocery stores or boutique bakeries in progressive towns. At a 2019 conference the economist Larry Summers characterized co-ops as intrinsically sleepy and short-sighted. “When you put workers in charge of firms and you give them substantial control over the firms” he said “the one thing you do not get is expansion. You get more for the people who are already there.” And yet Mondragon is not a sleepy grocery store. Its collection of co-ops employs around eighty thousand people and seventy-six per cent of those who work in manufacturing co-ops are owners. One makes bicycles at an industrial scale; others make elevators or produce huge industrial machines used in the production of jet engines rockets and wind turbines. Mondragon’s businesses include schools a large grocery chain a catering company fourteen technology R. & D. centers and a McKinsey-like consulting firm. In 2021 the network brought in more than eleven billion euros in revenue. The collective enforces five hundred and five types of patents and employs about twenty-four hundred full-time researchers. It also owns subsidiaries in countries including China Germany and Mexico and competes effectively in international markets winning contracts from firms such as General Electric and Blue Origin. The odds are good that key elements of something within a hundred feet of you—an espresso maker a gas grill a car—were made at Mondragon.

“We are a kind of mirror for conventional companies and in it they do not see a very beautiful image” Ander Etxeberria Mondragon’s director of coöperative dissemination told me as we drove between co-ops in the Basque country. A slender affable man who speaks many languages Etxeberria is essentially a professional explainer of Mondragon to its roughly two thousand annual visitors. It was a warm spring afternoon and he rolled down the windows and gestured to the passing countryside as we drove. A flock of sheep clustered on a hillside above the squat rectangular headquarters of a precision-machine-tooling co-op. We passed a bank a language-instruction school a grocery store a factory—each owned by its workers.

Mondragon’s network of co-ops many clustered along Spain’s Deba River has managed to survive nearly seventy years of capitalism’s creative destruction. Its persistence suggests that there are fairer and more sustainable ways of doing business. But whether a version of its model could be replicated outside of one beautiful region of northern Spain is an open question debated within Mondragon and beyond. The collective has a unique history and its density powers a rare feedback loop in which coöperative values shape institutions which then reinforce the same values spiralling outward to define an entire way of life. Mondragon is an inspiring and successful experiment. Will it ever be repeated?

The town of Mondragón in a green river valley surrounded by the Cantabrian mountains is home to some twenty-two thousand people. A medieval city occupies the town center with stone archways that soar over cobbled streets and a medieval Gothic church in a central square. The remains of José María Arizmendiarrieta the Catholic priest who founded the Mondragon coöperatives are buried inside.

Born in 1915 Arizmendiarrieta lost an eye in a childhood accident; mobilized during the Spanish Civil War but unable to take part in the fighting he still served as a Basque-language journalist for a publication opposed to the Nationalists led by Franco. He was arrested by Franco’s forces and spent a month in prison before being released. After the war he became a priest and was assigned by the Church to the town of Mondragón in 1941 when he was twenty-five.

He found that the area’s economy was deeply impoverished with virtually no middle class and that its society had been fractured by civil war. He mobilized citizens to launch civic and cultural initiatives including a soccer field a medical clinic and a housing complex for workers. Since the early twentieth century a locksmithing factory in Mondragón had been employing local boys who sometimes started at the age of fourteen clocked fifty-hour weeks and had few prospects without further education. Upon arrival Arizmendiarrieta began using the local Catholic Action center to educate young workers through study circles which met in a converted seventeenth-century palace. In 1943 Arizmendiarrieta created a technical school; students there worked at the factory in the morning and attended classes in the afternoon. Eventually he selected a group of promising workers who in the evenings began pursuing long-distance degrees in engineering. By 1956 five members who had finished their degrees left their factory jobs to launch a coöperative company that produced kerosene heaters. More industrial co-ops began appearing throughout the valley drawing workers from the technical school and collaborating with one another to share expertise. Thus was born the Mondragon experiment.

The growth of the co-ops followed a pattern. An obstacle would confront local workers and a new co-op would be created to overcome it. When in 1958 the Spanish Ministry of Labor excluded the new worker-owners from the national social-security system arguing that they were not eligible for workers’ benefits because they were also part-owners Arizmendiarrieta created an internal pension and health-care system that was itself organized as a coöperative; it still exists today supplying sick leave parental leave a generous pension unemployment benefits and medical insurance to Mondragon’s worker-owners. (The Spanish government has long since revised its position and provides coverage for co-op members in addition to that offered by Mondragon.) To meet the need for affordable financing Arizmendiarrieta organized a coöperative bank.

On my first afternoon in Mondragón Etxeberria and I walked into the dark interior of the church beside the central square. I could hear a choir rehearsing a hymn. Etxeberria pointed to the tomb of Arizmendiarrieta on one side of the central aisle. A stack of pamphlets lay beside it and I took one; it was part of a campaign to canonize the priest whom it described as “the apostle of coöperation.”

I stood for a while absorbing the atmosphere. (The Mondragon Corporation has no official position on the canonization campaign but Arizmendiarrieta is venerated even among the secular.) I saw that the pamphlet included a suggested prayer to Arizmendiarrieta and information on whom to contact if it were answered. I walked back out into the sun.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMicGh0dHBzOi8vZGFpbHlicnVpbi5jb20vMjAyMi8wOC8yNy91Y2xhLWZhY3VsdHktY2x1Yi1zZXQtdG8tZnVsbHktcmVvcGVuLXdpdGgtcHJlc2VydmF0aXZlLXlldC1wcm9ncmVzc2l2ZS1kZXNpZ27SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,UCLA Faculty Club set to fully reopen with preservative yet progressive design,"This post was updated Aug. 28 at 10:40 p.m.

The UCLA Faculty Club is fully reopening this fall after extensive renovations to update and preserve the integrity of the building over the past two and a half years.

The Faculty Club – opened in 1959 – is a space for faculty alumni professors retirees and parents of students to socialize have events and eat food said Luciano Sautto COO and general manager of the Club. UCLA Chancellor Gene Block allocated $10 million for the infrastructure and security systems renovations in 2019 he added.

Since its inception the Faculty Club has welcomed members from all departments according to the Club’s website. Henry Kelly a professor of English and member of the club since 1967 said the Club provides the opportunity for faculty to meet people from other divisions that they might not otherwise cross paths with.

Instead of relocating the Faculty Club when it fell in need of repair due to age the university redesigned the building to achieve reconstruction goals – such as roof replacement and outdoor expansion – without sacrificing the treasured landmark said Susan Santon associate vice chancellor for capital planning and finance in an emailed statement.

“A holistic planning approach enabled the project team to achieve seismic and infrastructure goals while preserving the defining features of this unique mid-century modern facility” Santon said in an emailed statement. “The Faculty Club has a rich history and renovations were designed to restore the original vision for the club.”

Working with UCLA and Faculty Club leadership allowed the renovations to revitalize both the inside and outside of the building while maintaining the architectural heritage said Clover Linné an architect with Moore Ruble Yudell Architects and Planners the company helping to redesign the club.

Kelly added that the social aspect along with the restaurant was the main reason why he joined the Club upon arriving at UCLA because it made him feel more comfortable in a place where he didn’t know many people.

“When you’re a professor you have to spend a lot of time in research teaching and so you don’t have the opportunity to take time for lunch every day” Kelly said. “I made the trek over to the Faculty Center (Club) every every day … you would look around and see other people come up and introduce yourself.”

The redesign also prioritized minimizing the club’s carbon footprint by establishing and maintaining sustainability practices such as recycling and planting drought-tolerant native plants Santon said. It also reduced electrical consumption through efficient heating and cooling systems and new light controls she added.

The Faculty Club has been a beloved institution and gathering place for faculty life on campus and it remains so Sautto said.

“We’ve honored the past but we’re moving forward in the future” Sautto said. “We really want to be a place where it’s great for all ages and they can see that it’s a well-respected institution on campus but it’s also moving forward with the times.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiRGh0dHBzOi8vamFjb2Jpbi5jb20vMjAyMi8wOC9pcmEtY29ycG9yYXRlLXRheGVzLXN0b2NrLWJ1eWJhY2tzLWJpZGVu0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Despite Its Flaws the IRA Will Raise Taxes on Corporate Profits and Stock Buybacks,"The Senate passed the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 through the budget reconciliation process. The bill allocates over $300 billion to incentivize clean energy production and fight climate change extends Affordable Care Act subsidies created at the height of the pandemic and grants Medicare limited powers to negotiate prescription drug prices. But the bill’s changes to the tax code are the most significant because they are the crux of how the Inflation Reduction Act would reduce the federal deficit and may thus help curb inflation. The Inflation Reduction Act’s tax changes consist of a 15 percent corporate minimum tax and a 1 percent excise tax on stock buybacks. The bill originally contained a provision that tightened the carried interest loophole which uniquely benefits private equity and hedge fund managers but Senator Kyrsten Sinema (D-AZ) had any mention of carried interest removed from the bill as the condition for her support.

The 15 Percent Book Minimum Tax The 15 percent corporate minimum is a “book tax” on the publicly reported financial statements of corporations whose annual profits exceed $1 billion. Corporations are presently required to pay a 21 percent federal income tax subject to tax credits and deductions which have allowed fifty-five of the largest highly profitable US corporations to pay $0 in federal income taxes the past few years. Tax credits and deductions create discrepancies in how corporations report earnings to the IRS versus how they report those same earnings to shareholders. If corporations’ tax burden ends up lower than 15 percent after those credits or deductions are calculated and only in that circumstance they would face the 15 percent “book minimum” in lieu of the 21 percent rate. The Joint Committee on Taxation estimated before Democrats hammed out compromises on the provision that the 15 percent minimum would raise $313 billion over ten years. This estimate may have become too optimistic after the Senate passed an amendment exempting companies financed by private equity from the book tax. At least $40 billion in savings will be lost by another amendment from Sinema which exempts “accelerated depreciation” from the corporate minimum. Companies will maintain the ability to claim larger write-offs for depreciation on an earlier schedule than if those deductions were spread out across the normal lifespan of an asset. Accelerated depreciation has accounted for just over 50 percent of the “total income tax breaks” granted to twenty large corporations from Google and Amazon to JPMorgan Chase and United Airlines. However the 15 percent book tax still positively influences how corporations calculate their liability especially if they claim depreciation benefits early and pay closer to 15 percent in subsequent years. Despite compromises the 15 percent book minimum tax ensures that the corporate income tax has a more solid floor that makes it nearly impossible for large corporations to have a tax bill of $0 or possibly a negative bill. Critics argue that the book minimum tax would incentivize corporations to underreport their income to shareholders. In fact taxing the books is more likely to improve financial reporting by giving investors an accurate account of a corporation’s real after-tax income. Underreporting income on financial statements is less likely than overreporting the more prevalent issue where corporations defraud investors by overstating their growth. A book tax would discourage the latter kind of manipulation because corporations would not overstate their earnings to shareholders if they want to avoid paying a greater proportion of taxes (15 percent of a larger whole).",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiPWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxhcHJvZ3Jlc3NpdmUuY29tL3BvbGl0aWNhbC1pc3N1ZXMvZmFzY2lzdC1mdXR1cmXSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Fascist Future in Our Progressive Industrial Complex,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.laprogressive.com/political-issues/fascist-future on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiPWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxhcHJvZ3Jlc3NpdmUuY29tL3BvbGl0aWNhbC1pc3N1ZXMvZmFzY2lzdC1mdXR1cmXSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen

Robin Epley is an opinion writer for The Sacramento Bee.

I attended an extremely poor extremely diverse high school in Sacramento where we were constantly told that attending college was the only way to pull ourselves out of poverty and reach the middle class. But the only way to afford the ridiculous cost of even community college or a state university was via loans so predatory that they all but ensured we would never be able to pull ourselves out of debt.

President Joe Biden’s plan announced Wednesday is to cancel up to $20000 of that debt (or at least $10000 of it for most of us). That’s an incredible gift that will change millions of lives forever.

Now let’s cancel the rest of it.

Tuition long ago outstripped students’ ability to pay with many schools adding amenities that have nothing to do with education. According to the Pew Research Center the share of students taking out loans to finance their degrees rose from 49 percent to 69 percent between 1993 to 2012. Between 1993 and 2020 the average loan amount grew nearly three times over surpassing $30000.

Until very recently I owed more than $35000 in federal student loans I took out to attend California State University at Chico even after 10 years of trying to pay them off. The only way I was able to pay off these loans was through the generational wealth gained through my family’s white privilege.

Before that unexpected windfall after the untimely death of a relative I too was stuck in the deepening pit of never-ending student loan payments with a disastrous credit score and no way out. Paying off my student debt gave me the ability to start putting money in my savings account and ultimately buy a home.

That’s because student loan debt — approximately 90 percent of which is composed of federal loans like mine — carries interest rates ranging from 4.99 percent to 7.54 percent. That’s regardless of work ethic or good or bad choices; student loans are a failing system that in effect makes upward mobility much harder.

I took out five years of federal loans. The first year I borrowed around $4000 and had enough left over for all of my textbooks besides. By the time I was a fifth-year senior the debt had ballooned to more than $7000 and would barely cover CSU’s rising tuition.

I had to ask my parents for help with housing because nothing was left over. I left college with approximately $27000 in debt which became nearly $45000 at one point thanks to interest rates that insured I would likely never make a payment toward my principal amount.

At one point soon after graduation I calculated that my interest rate was tacking on an additional $5 per day. That’s an additional $1800 per year during a time in my life when I was living paycheck to paycheck. I could hardly afford to pay the rent and buy groceries at the same time much less pay back hundreds in debt repayments every month. The financial stress I was under was a major factor in ratcheting up the anxiety and depression with which I still struggle.

A 2017 study by Prudential Financial Inc. found that 55 percent of student loan debtors say their debt prevents or forces them to delay saving for emergencies 42 percent said they have delayed buying a home because of it and 40 percent said their debt prevents or forces them to delay retirement savings. At least a fifth of respondents said they have delayed getting married or having children because of their student loan debt.

I recognize how incredibly lucky I am to have had my student loans paid off but it is the perfect symbol of what it means to be a middle-class (and often white) college student: My family paid them off for me. Without that assistance I would never have been able to do that and would still be drowning in debt and tanking both my credit score and my mental health.

And even though I would have benefited from Biden’s plan I still want my classmates and others — more than 43 million Americans — to have their loans forgiven.

None of us “did it the right way” — we simply won at a rigged game.

At the least we must release students and their families from interest rates so high that they make it impossible to ever pay off the initial amount.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiiwFodHRwczovL20uZWNvbm9taWN0aW1lcy5jb20vbWFya2V0cy9zdG9ja3MvbmV3cy9zZWJpLWFtZW5kcy1ydWxlcy1mb3ItcG9ydGZvbGlvLW1hbmFnZXJzLWludmVzdG1lbnRzLWluLWFzc29jaWF0ZXMvYXJ0aWNsZXNob3cvOTM4MTE2OTcuY21z0gGPAWh0dHBzOi8vbS5lY29ub21pY3RpbWVzLmNvbS9tYXJrZXRzL3N0b2Nrcy9uZXdzL3NlYmktYW1lbmRzLXJ1bGVzLWZvci1wb3J0Zm9saW8tbWFuYWdlcnMtaW52ZXN0bWVudHMtaW4tYXNzb2NpYXRlcy9hbXBfYXJ0aWNsZXNob3cvOTM4MTE2OTcuY21z?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Sebi amends rules for portfolio managers' investments in 'associates',"

MANILA Philippines — The Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas (BSP) has ordered big banks to closely monitor large exposures to protect their solvency from possible losses in the event of a default.

BSP Governor Felipe Medalla said the Monetary Board has issued Resolution 1179 which approves the amendments to the prudential guidelines on large exposures of the Manual of Regulations for Banks (MORB) and the Manual of Regulations for Non-Bank Financial Institutions (MORNBFI).

“The BSP is cognizant that risks arising from large exposures of banks/quasi banks to a single counterparty or group of connected counterparties could pose concerns to the stability of each bank and the financial system” Medalla said.

The BSP chief issued Circular 1150 pertaining to the approved prudential framework for large exposures monitoring threshold.

“In this light covered banks or quasi banks shall identify measure monitor and control large exposures to protect covered banks’ or quasi-banks’ solvency from maximum possible losses in the event of sudden counterparty failure” Medalla said.

Large exposures refer to exposures to a single counterparty or a group of connected counterparties equal to or greater than 10 percent of a covered bank’s Tier 1 capital.

On the other hand connected counterparties refer to a group of counterparties that are connected through direct or indirect control of one of the counterparties over the others or economic interdependencies and must be treated as a single counterparty.

In establishing connectedness based on economic interdependence the BSP said covered banks should follow the rule that 50 percent or more of a counterparty’s annual gross receipt or gross expenditures is derived from transactions with the other counterparty as well as one counterparty has fully or partly guaranteed the exposure of the other counterparty or is liable by other means and the exposure is significant enough that the guarantor is likely to default if a claim occurs.

The bank should also consider if 50 percent or more of a counterpart’s production or output is sold to another counterparty which cannot be easily replaced by other customers and the expected source of funds to repay the loans of both counterparties is the same and neither counterparty has another independent source of income from which the loans may be serviced and fully repaid.

The regulator said the banks should also monitor if it is likely that the financial difficulties of one counterparty would cause difficulties for the other counterparties in terms of full and timely repayment of liabilities or if the insolvency or default of one counterparty is likely to be associated with the insolvency or default of the other counterparties.

“Covered banks should identify possible connected counterparties on the basis of economic interdependence in all cases where the sum of all exposures to a single counterparty exceeds five percent of Tier 1 capital” Medalla said.

The BSP chief said that covered institutions should also maintain adequate documentation of the basis of their determination of a connected counterparty group and the due diligence conducted.

According to the central bank covered banks should comply with the large exposures monitoring threshold of 25 percent of Tier 1 capital on a solo and consolidated basis.

“The large exposures monitoring threshold shall be implemented to protect covered banks’ or quasi-banks’ solvency from maximum possible losses in case of sudden failure of a counterparty or group of connected counterparties and to facilitate monitoring by the BSP of concentration risks in the financial system” Medalla said.

Horizontal integration is the acquisition of a business operating at the same level of the value chain in the same industry—that is they make or offer similar goods or services. This is in contrast to vertical integration where firms expand into upstream or downstream activities which are at different stages of production.

Key Takeaways Horizontal integration is a business strategy in which one company grows its operations at the same level in an industry.

Horizontal integrations help companies grow in size and revenue expand into new markets diversify product offerings and reduce competition.

Disadvantages of horizontal integration include regulatory scrutiny the reduction of choices for consumers less internal flexibility and the potential to destroy value rather than create it.

A company can horizontally integrate by merging with another company acquiring another company or internally expanding its operations.

A contrasting approach to horizontal integration is vertical integration in which a company acquires a firm operating in the same industry but at a different stage of the production process.



Understanding Horizontal Integration

Horizontal integration is a competitive strategy that can create economies of scale increase market power over distributors and suppliers improve product differentiation and help businesses expand their market or enter new markets. By merging two businesses may be able to produce more revenue than they would have been able to do independently.

However when horizontal mergers succeed it is often at the expense of consumers especially if the merger reduces competition. For this reason horizontal mergers are heavily scrutinized by regulators to see if they violate antitrust laws.

Indeed the real motive behind a lot of horizontal mergers is that companies want to reduce competition—either from potential new entrants established rivals or firms offering substitute or alternative goods.

These are three of the five competitive forces that shape every industry as identified in Porter’s Five Forces model. The other two forces the power of suppliers and of customers drive vertical integration.

Types of Horizontal Integration

There are three primary forms of horizontal integration: mergers acquisitions and internal expansions.

Merger

When two companies merge two separate entities create a new joint organization. The brand of one of those two companies is usually retained though the composition of operations and personnel is shared between both of the former individual companies. In addition the product line of both companies is often similar and equally competitive in the market.

In a merger both companies are striving to become a larger presence in their existing market. Most mergers are of similar firms where integration of the two companies may be seamless due to the similarities between what the two former companies used to do.

Acquisition

Similar to a merger an acquisition occurs when one company outright takes over the operations of another company. Though the two companies technically join together one company remains in control. The acquiring company's staff executives and operations often remain in place while the acquired company's resources are integrated as management sees fit.

Companies often pursue acquisitions in an attempt to get something specific. For example Microsoft specifically wanted to enhance its presence in the video game market. Therefore it acquired Activision Blizzard in January 2022. This example of an acquisition shows an often deliberate strategy for a specific sector in which a company wants to achieve a very specific goal.

Internal Expansion

Companies can also embark on horizontal integration by making more conscious allocations of internal capital. Through internal expansion a company simply chooses to strategically change course and apply more resources in a different way. For example a restaurant can expand to offer catering companies or a beverage manufacturer may branch off to make food products.

In these examples a company continues to operate how it use to. However instead of committing capital to acquire an external company or transition with a merging firm it decides to deploy those resources in-house to train staff buy equipment make capital investments and grow a new branch of operations on its own.

The M&A market was as hot as ever in 2021. According to McKinsey the total value of larger deals (valued greater than $25 million) for the year peaked at $5.9 trillion up 37% from 2020.

Advantages and Disadvantages of Horizontal Integration

Advantages

Companies engage in horizontal integration to benefit from synergies. There may be economies of scale or cost synergies in marketing; research and development (R&D); production; and distribution. Or there may be economies of scale which make the simultaneous manufacturing of different products more cost-effective than manufacturing them on their own.

Procter & Gamble’s 2005 acquisition of Gillette is a good example of a horizontal merger that realized economies of scope. Because both companies produced hundreds of hygiene-related products from razors to toothpaste the merger reduced the marketing and product development costs per product.

Synergies can also be realized by combining products or markets. Horizontal integration is often driven by marketing imperatives. Diversifying product offerings may provide cross-selling opportunities and increase each business’ market. A retail business that sells clothes may decide to also offer accessories or it might merge with a similar business in another country to gain a foothold there and avoid having to build a distribution network from scratch.

Disadvantages

Like any merger horizontal integration does not always yield the synergies and added value that was expected. It can even result in negative synergies which reduce the overall value of the business if the larger firm becomes too unwieldy and inflexible to manage or if the merged firms experience problems caused by vastly different leadership styles and company cultures.

There are regulatory issues as well. If horizontal mergers within the same industry concentrate market share among a small number of companies it creates an oligopoly. If one company ends up with a dominant market share it has a monopoly. If a merger threatens competitors or seems to drastically restrict the market and reduce consumer choices it could attract the attention of the Federal Trade Commission.

Horizontal Integration Advantages May result in efficiencies economies of scale or synergies not otherwise possible

May reduce company risk through product and market diversification

May increase profitability through new cross-selling opportunities

May result in decreased costs due to better processes and greater expertise Disadvantages May reduce value or synergy if merger is not performed successfully

May expose inflexibilities that won't be resolved by the merger

May result in a clash of management styles with multiple leadership teams coming together

May result in regulatory issues if a dominant market share is formed

Horizontal Integration vs. Vertical Integration

Both horizontal integration and vertical integration are the practice of a company expanding its current operations. However each process aims to have a different strategic outcome. Horizontal integration occurs when a company aims to remain within its current part of the supply chain. The company often wants to enhance its existing product or get a larger share of the market.

Vertical integration is the strategy of expanding across the supply to get better at processes the company is currently not involved in. For example a manufacturer may acquire a raw materials distributor to have better control over the quantity pricing or timing of when it gets raw goods. The company is expanding from its current position in the manufacturing process and performing a backward vertical integration.

Vertical integration is often undertaken to have better control over a long process while horizontal integration is more suitable for a company wanting to become more niche for something specific. Horizontal integration often entails similar companies coming together while vertical integration often entails different companies related to a similar product coming together.

The ultimate goal of vertical integration is to become independent of suppliers and control more aspects of the supply chain. On the other hand horizontal integration strives to eliminate competitors grow in market size and create economies of scale.

Examples of Horizontal Integration

Many mergers that hit news headlines are examples of horizontal integration. If a company acquires or merges with another company and both firms are in a very similar industry it is most likely an example of horizontal integration. Specific examples include:

JetBlue's 2022 merger with Spirit Airlines

Marriott's 2016 acquisition of Starwood Hotel & Resorts

Anheuser-Busch InBev's 2016 acquisition of SABMiller (brewers)

AstraZeneca's 2015 acquisition of ZS Pharma (biotech)

Volkswagen’s 2012 acquisition of Porsche (automobiles)

Facebook Inc.'s (now Meta Inc.'s) 2012 acquisition of Instagram (social media)

Disney's 2006 acquisition of Pixar (entertainment media)

Mittal Steel’s 2006 acquisition of Arcelor (steel)

What Is the Difference Between Horizontal Integration and Vertical Integration? Horizontal integration is the strategy of acquiring other companies that reside along a similar area of the supply chain. For example a manufacturer may acquiring a competing manufacturing firm to better enhance its process labor force and equipment. Vertical integration occurs when a company acquires a company outside of their current position along the supply chain. For example a manufacturer may acquire a retail company so that the manufacturer can not only control the process of making the good but also selling the good as well.

What Is the Main Advantage of Horizontal Integration? The main advantage of horizontal integration is the strategically focused decision to penetrate a specific section of a supply chain. Horizontal integration allows a company to potentially acquire a competitor gain greater insight into the market expand its product line or create economies of scale. Horizontal integration is a way for a company to simply do better at what it was doing before.

Why Is Horizontal Integration Important? Horizontal integration is important because it allows a company to grow expand diversify and gather a larger market presence. Horizontal integration further enhances a company's current position in the market and instead of transitioning to widely different aspects of the supply chain it allows a company to become more competitive in the space it was already operating in.

The Bottom Line

Companies looking to grow in size increase revenue expand to new product lines and diversify operations may consider pursuing horizontal integration. Horizontal integration occurs when similar companies merge in the same stage of a supply chain merge. As opposed to a vertical integration which helps a company shift to earlier or later in the supply chain horizontal integration further solidifies a company's current position along a manufacturing process.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTWh0dHBzOi8vYm1jcHVibGljaGVhbHRoLmJpb21lZGNlbnRyYWwuY29tL2FydGljbGVzLzEwLjExODYvczEyODg5LTAyMi0xMzkyMC000gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Organisational structures and processes for health and well-being: insights from work integration social enterprise ...,"The findings are structured according to the research question of the organizational features that enabled WISE to impact on health and well-being. The data analysis uncovered the following organizational features as being important in influencing health and well-being: structure and space; funding finance and industry orientation; organisational culture; policy and process; and fostering local service networks.

Structure and space

There were a range of organisational structures through which psychosocial support and skill development occurred. The youth programs team in one of the cases provided an organisational structure for psychosocial support. In other cases where a team itself was not in place this support was provided differently through policies and processes which will be covered later.

Participants across all of the case organizations reported a deliberate strategy of extending the skills of the young people and having them confront new situations – including developing new work skills periodically changing work teams and venues and engaging in diverse customer-facing roles – to increase their self-confidence. Being able to provide a range of different roles at different sites was considered important for their skill development and self-esteem. Young people and staff felt respected and valued within the workplace and training environment:

… I was very scared so when I start with [WISE] they were very supportive they were very helpful so I feel secure I feel like – how to say sometime when I need support … especially for something work here at first I didn’t know much how to do so if I did something wrong so they … explain to me clearly. So they show me not just explain to me they show me how to do so that’s how I started to feel confident and so I start to improve other – like I know how to do other things and also after that when I apply for a job… so that’s how I start to build my confidence. (Case D Young person 10) I think the biggest thing is when we finish the first containers and I’m standing there ‘We can do it actually! We have done all of this!’ So I was proud. I can do it! So it gives me confidence. (Case C Young Person 4)

The constant recognition and praise for developing skills was seen as critical for the development of self-confidence and self-esteem.

The spatial design of the case WISEs impacted positively on young people’s sense of well-being. Each of the WISEs used space differently to cater for the different mental health needs of the young people. There was one case study that had a significant amount of green space which was noted as beneficial for well-being:

When I’m at home the environment is a lot different. It’s a lot more stressful a lot more work. Everything’s “Go go go go go.” When I come here for volunteer work it was come here chill do work. It’s quiet. You hear birds. You’re always surrounded by nature sort of thing so it’s just awesome. (Case D Young Person 6)

All case organizations included a number of hidden areas and lesser-used rooms which can help to reduce stress levels by providing a place for quiet and solitude when needed. Designated areas like break rooms or games rooms created a more informal space for young people to interact. There was a sense that socializing was a key element of the work and education environment and this was actively encouraged as a means to build self confidence in young people. The sense of belonging and having a community to connect with was seen as beneficial for autistic people or those with previous experience of social isolation; and also for people experiencing depression anxiety and general loneliness. These quotes reflected a common sentiment across the different organizations and young people who were interviewed:

Something tragic happened back in 2013 and that kind of like I was going through depression and stuff over it so that set me back a lot with career things … I went into a bad depression … some places I’ve worked I’ve had like the best boss ever but then some places I've had like people I just don’t want to work for and help out. But here is like it's definitely up there. I haven’t met a single person here that I've not liked or gotten along with yet. Everyone is great and nice. They’ll answer any question you have. They won’t make you feel bad for asking questions. Just really supportive and motivated to help you and learn. (Case B Young person 9) I suffer with severe anxiety and I do get a little bit of deep depression. But since being here that’s gone. I think it’s amazing. I’ve come here and I’ve just got this role now where I want to be at work I’m happy to be at work… I feel supported here. I can come here and I can have my little chats to people. (Case D Young person 1)

Feeling that sense of connection with other people was one of the key factors that people felt was responsible for improving their mental health and reducing feelings of anxiety and depression.

Finance Funding and Industry Orientation

Providing these work and training opportunities within a flexible environment was made possible through a mix of revenue streams. This included commercial product offerings internal investment through their parent organisation and/or grant funding through philanthropic and/or government partners. This was seen as constant challenge in operating this type of organizational model:

‘Access to finance is my ongoing challenge always. The challenges of trying to scale these things and getting access to the right type of capital… the market’s just too embryonic to have the things in place that you need to be able to access the capital at the right time’. (Leadership Case A)

The sustainability of the organizations depended in large part on aligning within an industry supportive of this business type and being commercially competitive. One of the key focuses was aligning the social goals of the WISE with the chosen industry to ensure that there were employment opportunities in that industry in that region for young people. There were some concerns by staff though that the culture and gender norms of the industry in which two of the case studies operated may not be suitable for the young people involved in the WISE.

Interviewer: people write about hospitality as quite a male dominated industry. And this isn't specific for social enterprise but more hospitality in general. What's your take on that? Participants: … I think this is definitely one of the main workplaces where I see a little bit more equal in gender but everywhere else I've worked is I would say 80% male dominated for sure. (Case A Young Person 11)

It was also noted in one of the case studies that industry norms around smoking was a point of connection between young people and staff which was a concern from a health perspective. As one staff member told us:

… we don’t have an area that separates the students from the staff. So we all smoke but the thing is we’ve only got one smoking area so it means that you’re out there having a smoke and all the students are out there having a smoke. (Case D Program Staff 2)

In addition to the negative impact of smoking accessible healthy food choices were a challenge in some industries due the location of the workplace. In some industrial settings there were no healthy food options available.

A point of consistency across the case studies was an acknowledgment of diversity was important to the WISEs which maybe atypical of industry norms:

It [Organization] is like a community because at the first time when we started the classmate that we had is all from different ethnic groups like from different communities different people like the people who came from - they kicked out of school or they were on drugs and stuff they’re disabled or something like that. You’re getting involved in a lot sort of people you know different sort of people. (Case C Young Person 8)

There was strong recognition of diversity and as detailed thematically a strong desire to validate people’s differences. From field notes recorded this was observed through strong visual cues – including posters staff profiles of visible diversity around the WISEs; use of iconic symbolism – such as pride colours – in workplace design; and purposeful integration of visual textual and auditory organisational health and safety materials to support participants of all abilities and linguistic diversity. While this was undoubtedly seen as valuable from the perspective of both the staff and young people a consistent concern was that it created an unrealistic expectation of the realities of ‘normal’ workplaces:

We provide an environment here that is really rare in that people are just supported no matter what their identity is what their background history. It’s a very supportive environment which in turn has its own unintended consequences down the track when it comes to putting them back out in the real world. (Case A Leadership)

This highlights the need for broader workplace reform and change to ensure that workplace inclusion becomes more common.

Organisational culture

Organisational culture refers to the shared beliefs and values that influences the relationship interactions and practices within an organisation. It was made abundantly clear in the interviews that this sense of feeling comfortable and being able to be yourself was highly important to the staff and young people in the case organizations. There was a strong focus on people feeling safe to disclose any mental health conditions. In terms of authenticity people felt comfortable being open about their mental health challenges and felt supported in doing so.

Yeah and be safe feel safe and supported and nurtured and know if there’s baggage and many times there are that can be left at the gate and just come in and have that free open mind and not be judged or accountable for too much that you would possibly spotlighted for in the community. (Case D Program Staff 1)

Across the organizations there was a strong culture of mental health awareness and support. Staff challenged the stigma around mental health that many young people encountered in other workplaces and educational settings with a focus on strengths-based approaches. In one of the WISEs there were specific tasks and workshops delivered on acceptance of differences and inclusivity in all other cases these themes were observed in the operation and actions of staff. The message that young people encountered in all case studies is that everyone faces different mental health family background challenges and this is a place where you can be yourself. This creates a safe environment in which young people can feel supported to participate in group settings where different learning styles and ways of being are normalized. This level of acceptance was fostered throughout the organizations and was made explicit to new participants:

I bring them up and I introduce them to [Name] [Name] what do you do? Right and particularly the young ladies on [our training program] … their ears prick up. Because they can see this young lady doing all this magnificent high precision soldering and component replacement and you watch them and you see their eyes stare … I say [Name] what were you doing five six years ago and she tells them she calls herself an alcoholic whether she was or wasn’t she had trouble with alcohol and stuff like that. Fought with her mother didn’t see her father no job no prospects and that’s when the penny drops. (Case B Manager 2)

This authenticity was valued across the hierarchy of the case organizations. The senior staff were focused on providing a safe environment for young people where they could speak their mind and be open about any challenges they were facing. The most common approach employed was to ‘check in’ regularly:

There’s been times here before where people will say ‘[Name] are you okay today?’ Like [Leadership staff] last week she said to me ‘Are you okay today?’ I’m like ‘Yeah why’s that?’ And she’s like ‘You’re not your happy bubbly like you want to be here - not saying you don’t want to be here but are you sure you’re okay?’ … She definitely noticed [a difference]. And I’m like ‘Yeah I seem okay. I’m just a little – [Staff member] is leaving and I’m just thinking a lot.’ She’s like ‘Yeah you’re just not your bright bubbly’ - and I’m like ‘Sorry. I don’t mean to be like that.’ And it really got me out of it. (Case D Young person 1)

The young people interviewed indicated they felt confident to express their mental health challenges and felt secure in the approach taken by staff. There was acknowledgement of the empathy being provided and the young people clearly felt a strong sense of connection and safety in the workplace. This level of collegiality and acceptance of the young people was something the young people really valued.

It keeps you involved – to get involved with a community or to get involved at work teamwork or in visually working. (Case C Young person 8) Yeah just for them to have our backs all the time I feel really supported. (Case A Young person 3)

Organisational culture was also reflected in organisational governance where on all boards there was a balance required between social goals and financial goals:

‘I think the beauty and one of the reasons I really enjoy being involved in [the Board] is I feel like that balance is pretty well managed. The harmony between ensuring that we are not leaving any stone unturned around the profitability of the businesses but remembering why we’re there in the first place and ensuring the effectiveness of the social programs as well’. (Director Case A)

In none of the case WISEs were young people involved in governance processes given the transitional workplace model whereby most of the young people were not there as long-term employees. However there was evidence of young people being given more authority and leadership roles in their organization which enabled them to have some sort of influence among their peers and for some a more direct supervisory role. This helped to build their self-efficacy and again contributed to an improved sense of well-being:

In terms of the skills I’ve definitely found that I’ve become more assertive… All the liaising that you need to do. Also leadership not just of other people but of yourself. Self-leadership is definitely a real thing. It’s all part of the motivation the initiative. And on top of leadership it’s teamwork skills and communication skills. (Case D Young Person 1) It helped me with a lot of things. It helped me with work. It helped me with sort of social stuff. It helped me de-stress. Work with different people that have never worked before sort of being more – how do I say it – more of a role model. (Case D Young person 6)

The self-confidence and improvement in mental well-being through taking on a leadership and mentoring role was a common reflection of both staff and the young people interviewed. For continuing staff there was some opportunities provided for management type experience. Again this was linked to an increased sense of confidence and self-esteem and reduced participants anxiety levels when confronted with new situations such as leadership opportunities.

Policy and process

All the case study WISEs had in place processes and policies to support business operations and staff and participant wellbeing. Some of the key policies related to accommodating flexible work arrangements to suit employees and providing opportunities for learning through mistakes within certain expectation boundaries as captured in the following field notes:

The rules of work apply… But if you cannot get transport to work there are alternatives to help you (youth support worker); if you conflict with someone there are people who can help you work this out (Trainers Assistant); if you do something wrong with the equipment you will be cautioned but this will not be held against you (Trainer). In each of these cases the staff response secures the engagement of the student. This is the internal network that exists to support student participation in the program. (Researcher field notes)

Providing flexible working conditions was one of the key processes identified in the organisations. This young person reflected on how they were offered the opportunity to take some time off after a ‘check in’ chat with a staff member:

For example on Monday knowing that another staff member was leaving that week and I was like I don’t want them to go. I was a little up in my head too much. And I was like great it’s just like [previous organization name] all over again. And I just started getting a little bit of anxiety. And my manager said ‘You’re really anxious today. I haven’t seen this in you since [previous organization name].’ And I’m like ‘Yeah it’s just everything happening at the moment.’ She’s like ‘Do you need to go home?’ I’m like ‘No I’m fine.’ And I think being here it really helps me. (Case D Young person 1)

Again this relates to feeling safe within the workplace to share feelings and concerns and feeling validated to do so. For other young people a strong sense of structure was helpful for their mental health and well-being:

Getting yourself in to a routine can also help you get in to a routine of improving your physical health as well. (Case A Young Person 6) Before I came to this course I was like pretty depressed... Because I just kept getting knocked back I was sort of like giving up. I definitely feel like healthier mentally just coming here every day and being punctual having a routine. (Case B Young person 9)

Another common reflection was the high degree of tolerance for making mistakes evident across all of the case WISEs which was a feature of the Culture and Policies and Processes of the organisations. Because of this participants reported that they felt safe trying new approaches and expressing different ideas. This was particularly important for those participants who identified as neurodiverse as inherent in their neurodiversity was that they saw the world differently and thus had different ideas and support requirements. Therefore feeling safe to express their ideas and learn from mistakes was an important factor for them to feel a state of positive well-being and reduce their anxiety and depression:

[The WISE] has been very lenient with my anxiety provoked mistakes. I do make pretty consistent mistakes. It’s good to have a sort of practice run. (Case A Young person 2)

A high degree of tolerance for mistakes also provided the young people with confidence that they could try and develop new skills. Some participants expressed that they felt valued for their contribution despite their mental health challenges and their self-doubt. One participant expressed how staff were able to respond to changes in his mental health needs by providing support and encouragement and this impacted positively on his self-confidence:

… The end of my first trial shift… [Name] who was supervising me at the time - I was worried I wasn’t doing too well that I was kind of slower than everybody else and couldn’t get my bearings. He came and reassured me and he told me that everyone had actually told him that I was doing great. That was really good to hear and I walked out of there feeling pretty proud of myself. (Case A Young Person 1)

Fostering local service networks

One of the important roles that the WISE managers and staff performed to support the young people was to develop relationships with local services and employers and at times acting as the intermediating within those networks to help young people transition to open employment opportunities:

‘I’ve got constant phone calls with [WISE Manager] so that’s been interesting and challenging and to be honest time consuming. But I think we’ve got a good working relationship . . . we can communicate and . . . tell each other . . . what’s working well what’s not working so well’. (Local employer and WISE partner organisation Case D)

All of the WISEs performed some role in facilitating referrals to education housing and welfare support providers on a case-by-case basis. Two of the case WISEs had a structured support program to help young people find work and in one WISE they had staff attend the induction at the new workplace with young people which was a source of social and emotional support. Conversely one of the case studies had spent considerable time and effort to establish industry relationships to support employment pathways but at this stage was struggling to see results for these efforts:",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMieWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRlbGNvdGl0YW5zLmNvbS9idHdhdGNoL2J0LXBlb3BsZS1tb3Zlcy1jb3Jwb3JhdGUtYW5kLXB1YmxpYy1zZWN0b3ItdHVybmFyb3VuZC1wcm9qZWN0LWNvbnRpbnVlcy81MzIyLmFydGljbGXSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,BT people moves: corporate and public sector turnaround project continues,"Go deep and get full access to the telco and infra content that matters most to you.

In a significant milestone in the Biden-Harris administration’s efforts to combat the climate crisis the Bureau of Land Management has approved ExxonMobil Corporation’s proposal to sequester carbon deep underground in Lincoln and Sweetwater counties Wyoming.

The proposal includes a carbon dioxide disposal well pad and pipeline. Once completed the infrastructure will provide the opportunity for permanent underground storage of carbon dioxide produced along with natural gas at the existing Exxon Mobil Shute Creek Plant near Kemmerer.

This is the first project of its kind to be approved on B.L.M. managed lands.

Currently ExxonMobil sells carbon dioxide for commercial uses and excess carbon dioxide is vented into the atmosphere under a permit approved by the Wyoming Department of Environmental Quality.

“This project is a prime example of how the B.L.M. can work together with industry leaders to combat climate change” said B.L.M. Wyoming State Director Andrew Archuleta. “Projects like this will allow the B.L.M. to play a part in reducing carbon dioxide levels in the atmosphere.”

The disposal well will sequester approximately 60 million cubic feet of carbon dioxide daily at a depth of roughly 18000 feet in the water leg of the Madison formation which is an approved disposal zone. The injection of carbon dioxide into underground geologic formations offers safe secure and permanent disposal.

Earlier this year the B.L.M. issued a new policy on the geologic sequestration of carbon dioxide on public lands.

Geologic carbon sequestration is the process of safely injecting carbon dioxide deep underground permanently preventing it from entering the atmosphere and contributing to the climate crisis. Carbon dioxide has been injected underground in the United States since the 1940s typically as a temporary measure to produce more oil.

Northeastern Wyoming is working towards becoming an international hub for coal research. Carbon capture is part of that research and is heavily promoted by Governor Mark Gordon.

This is the first time the B.L.M. has issued a policy to allow for the permanent underground storage of carbon dioxide.",,,,,,,,,

No Android OEM has taken advantage of the Snapdragon 7 Gen 1 yet but Qualcomm has another mid-range chipset up its sleeve. Unsurprisingly the company is gradually re-branding its entire product stack with Evan Blass confirming that SM6450 will launch as the Snapdragon 6 Gen 1. Presumably replacing the likes of the Snapdragon 680 and the Snapdragon 695 the Snapdragon 6 Gen 1 utilises a 4 nm node unlike its 6 nm-based predecessors. Unfortunately the leaked specification sheet does not confirm how many CPU or GPU cores the Snapdragon 6 Gen 1 has although it outlines numerous other features.

On the one hand the Snapdragon 6 Gen 1's CPU cores will operate at up to 2.2 GHz on a 64-bit architecture matching the Snapdragon 695. Additionally the Snapdragon 6 Gen 1 supports LPDDR5 RAM and USB 3.1 connectivity both an uplift on older Snapdragon 6 chipsets. For reference smartphones powered by the Snapdragon 6 Gen 1 could launch with up to 12 GB of LPDDR5 RAM running at 2750 MHz a specification typically reserved for high-end smartphones.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiW2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmdpemNoaW5hLmNvbS8yMDIyLzA4LzI3L3NuYXBkcmFnb24tNi1nZW4tMS1pcy1vbi10aGUtd2F5LWtleS1wYXJhbWV0ZXJzLWxlYWtlZC_SAV9odHRwczovL3d3dy5naXpjaGluYS5jb20vMjAyMi8wOC8yNy9zbmFwZHJhZ29uLTYtZ2VuLTEtaXMtb24tdGhlLXdheS1rZXktcGFyYW1ldGVycy1sZWFrZWQvYW1wLw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Qualcomm Is Going To Beat MediaTek In The Low-end Field As Well,"A year ago Qualcomm launched the Snapdragon 8 Gen 1 and Snapdragon 7 Gen 1 chipsets. These are the company’s latest products based on the cutting-edge 4nm process. Among them the former model is for flagship handsets while the latter is for mid-rangers. It turns out (honestly it’s been expected) that the American company is working on a new 4nm chip for low-end smartphones. If nothing else we are talking about the Snapdragon 6 Gen 1.

Earlier today Evan Blass (@evleaks) shared the parameter details page of the upcoming Snapdragon 6 Gen 1 mobile platform. Thus we have complete knowledge of this chip ahead of launch.

Snapdragon 6 Gen 1 Parameters

The upcoming Qualcomm Snapdragon 6 series chip will be the successor of the Snapdragon 695 chipset. Apart from the 4nm process the SM6450 will use a Qualcomm Kyro CPU with a frequency of up to 2.2GHz. At the same time the chip will support up to 12GB of LPDDR5 memory at up to 2750MHz.

The spec table above gives us a good overview of the core feature differences between the three chipsets. But let’s dive into a few more of the specifics.

On-paper: Next-gen CPU and GPU performance?

As you’ve probably noticed all three mobile processors feature Arm’s latest off-the-shelf CPU cores based on the Armv9 architecture. Specifically these are the powerhouse Arm Cortex-X2 mid-tier Cortex-A710 and power-efficient Cortex-A510. The exception from recent chipset announcements is the Google Tensor which uses the previous-gen Cortex-X1 A78 and A55 cores based on the Armv8 architecture in a more experimental 2+2+4 configuration. You can read more about how Tensor compares to Snapdragon 8 Gen here.

Given the latest Snapdragon Exynos and Dimensity all use the same CPU cores and 1+3+4 layout you can expect a similar level of performance. However you may see a couple of benchmark percentage points between them due to clock speed and cache differences particularly as MediaTek uses the superior TSMC 4nm manufacturing process rather than Samsung 4nm.

Still the core experiences will likely feel almost identical between all three in the real world. It is also worth noting that MediaTek supports slightly faster LPDDR5X RAM than its competitors although it will be down to partner devices to make use of this little extra potential.

Far more meaningful differences are found in the graphics department. MediaTek’s Dimensity 9000 is the most well-known quantity opting for an Arm Mali-G710 MC10 GPU that offers a 30-35% performance boost over the Snapdragon 888. While Qualcomm didn’t talk much about its latest Adreno GPU at launch we now know that it boasts 30% faster rendering than its previous generation which should make it a close-run contest between these two.

GPU features and capabilities are set to diverge more than ever this generation with Samsung introducing hardware-backed ray tracing.

Samsung’s Exynos 2200 offers the most radical change to mobile graphics in generations. The Xclipse 920 GPU sports the same AMD RDNA2 architecture powering the PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series consoles and high-end PC graphics cards. In a major first for mobile hardware-based ray tracing also finds its way into the Exynos 2200 GPU. However we’ve not seen many games leverage this technology yet.

Benchmarks: Where does the Exynos 2200 shine? Based on the above chart it’s clear that the Exynos 2200 fails to impress on some fronts. The CPU doesn’t outperform its predecessor for example and the GPU performance falls short of the competition. And even though benchmarks show a marked improvement over the Snapdragon 888’s GPU real-world use-cases like gaming will likely not show as much of an improvement.

The Snapdragon 8 Gen 1 meanwhile tells a similar story at first glance. However when it’s coupled with active cooling like the RedMagic 7’s built-in cooling fan the SoC gets a chance to stretch a healthy lead over its predecessor. However there’s a major caveat here. The Snapdragon 8 Gen 1 tends to run hot so much so that it cannot maintain its peak performance for more than a few minutes.

In mid-2022 Qualcomm launched the Snapdragon 8 Plus Gen 1 — a mid-cycle refresh of its flagship SoC. In a nutshell the refreshed chip is being made by a different more efficient chip fabrication plant than the original which mitigates the throttling issue and boosts battery life.

Despite the Dimensity 9000’s impressive on-paper specifications few brands ended up adopting it for their flagship smartphones throughout 2022. The Exynos 2200 powers the Galaxy S22 flagship series in select markets like Europe the Middle East and Africa.

Features for flagship phones

Qualcomm

These days the core smartphone experience is dependent on imaging machine learning and networking smarts. The Exynos 2200 Snapdragon 8 Gen 1 and Dimensity 9000 are all very robust in these areas too.

For starters all three boast competitive camera packages. The chips all sport very high-resolution image sensors simultaneous dual- and triple-camera support and 8K video recording. However the Snapdragon 8 Gen 1 is the only one to offer 8K HDR recording and routes an impressive 240 shot burst mode but it remains a hold-out against AV1 decoder support for video playback.

All three companies also tout enhanced image processing capabilities tying their AI capabilities closer to the imaging pipeline than ever before. MediaTek notes that this will enable video bokeh and improved noise reduction while Qualcomm boasts its burst-mode HDR and night shooting capabilities.

While there are critical differences in chipset capabilities the camera components and software features that smartphone manufacturers pick for their products are likely to be the more significant differentiators.

AI and imaging remain key focuses for all next-gen SoCs.

Speaking of AI performance all three make some big claims this generation too. Qualcomm has doubled the tensor performance inside its Hexagon DSP which will produce a significant boost for some workloads. Samsung touts a similar 2x gain in machine learning performance over its previous generation chip. Still MediaTek’s Dimensity 9000 is the boldest of the bunch with a 4x performance and 4x energy efficiency boost over its last-generation chip.

Where this leaves all these chips in the grand scheme of things is anyone’s guess as so much machine learning performance is task and smartphone-dependent. But the key takeaway is that all of these chipsets are looking to be on the bleeding edge of mobile AI performance.

One more often overlooked feature that may yield some more unique new use cases in this generation is security. The Snapdragon 8 Gen 1 boasts an all-new Trust Management Engine compliant with Android Ready SE. Similarly the Exynos 2200 comes withthe an Integrated Secure Element able to verify Root of Trust and verify data held in secure domains. More secure platforms could soon double up as your car keys driver’s license and other forms of identification.

Next-generation connectivity for some

Eric Zeman / Android Authority

You’ll find familiar 5G specifications amongst all three of these chipsets. 3GPP Release 16 5G compliance is the norm as download speeds exceed 7Gbps. Qualcomm and Samsung both claim they can hit 10Gbps downloads but this requires more specific data aggregation scenarios to achieve. For instance Samsung does this while leveraging a simultaneous 4G and 5G connection a situation that won’t exist once networks transition to 5G standalone in the future.

MediaTek is still missing a 5G mmWave capabile flagship chip for now.

Perhaps the most crucial difference between these chips is that MediaTek is the only one not to offer 5G mmWave support limiting the chipset’s appeal in the US and some other markets.

MediaTek Samsung and Qualcomm all support Wi-Fi 6E. However only the Dimensity offers Bluetooth 5.3 support. Still Bluetooth 5.2 is plenty for high-end audio including the LE Audio introduced with Android 13.

Snapdragon 8 Gen 1 vs Exynos 2200 vs Dimensity 9000: The verdict The 2022 flagship SoC landscape is more diverse than ever particularly when it comes to the Snapdragon 8 Gen 1 vs Exynos 2200 in the Galaxy S22 series. There’s plenty to be excited about with cutting-edge graphics developments in the Exynos 2200 a highly competitive offering from MediaTek and Snapdragon doubling down on imaging.

So which one should you pick? That’s a tough question to answer especially considering the limited regional availability of the Exynos 2200 and Dimensity 9000. If you want the absolute best however the Qualcomm chip blazed through our benchmarks. Moreover the refreshed Snapdragon 8 Plus Gen 1 is easily the most well-rounded premium SoC in the Android smartphone market. So should you pull the trigger and get a Snapdragon 8 Plus Gen 1 phone?

The men's style magazine released a photo of the actor decked out in Ralph Lauren for his wedding last weekend at his estate in Georgia. The photo came nearly a week since Ben and Jen said ""I do"" for the second time this time in front of family and friends during a weekend extravaganza that included a Sunday BBQ with friends and family.

Vogue first released Lopez's official portrait showing her three unique wedding gowns for the big day. That article also included details about Affleck's wedding attire: a classic Ralph Lauren Couture tuxedo which included a formal one button peak cream dinner jacket with a black double pleated trouser and narrow piqué bib shirt. The look was completed with a black bow tie and black patent shoes.

According to Vogue all five children were also styled in white Ralph Lauren Couture. In fact just about every guest wore white to the lavish affair.

An eyewitness told ET ""Guests were gathering at The Perry Lane Hotel [in Savannah] to head to Jennifer and Ben's wedding."" The source added. ""Everyone is dressed in white with most women in white dresses and gowns and most men in white suits a majority in linen material but the dress code features a wide variety. Some men are in white shorts and sneakers and there is a female guest in a white fringe leather jacket and sparkly cowboy hat.""

The all-white theme continued when the couple jetted off to their honeymoon in Italy. Lopez recently stepped out in white while in Milan. The ""Love Don't Cost a Thing"" singer and The Tender Bar star were spotted walking the streets as they shopped at high-end boutique stores. Lopez looked stunning in a white crop top with white jeans and platform heels. She completed the look with a fedora hat.

In addition to holding on to a purse Lopez also held on to Affleck. The actor donned a blue long-sleeve shirt with a few buttons unbuttoned to show off the white undershirt. He wore jeans white kicks shades and sported a scruffy beard.

Earlier this week the couple shared a kiss while taking in the view from a boat on Lake Como. According to Page Six they sat on the back of the speed boat and were mainly alone sans the captain and co-captain.

For that boat ride Lopez again wore white -- a white long-sleeved dress and matching white bag.

The “Rawkus 50” campaign allowed a new generation of MCs and producers to digitally release product with the same label that introduced many Hip-Hop Heads to names like Mos Def Talib Kweli Company Flow High & Mighty Thirstin Howl The 3rd and more. That same imprint would offer new pathways for veteran careers like Pharoahe Monch Kool G Rap Big L R.A. The Rugged Man and DJ Spinna to name a few.

As online video maker “Def Goldbloom” points out Rawkus has now been gone longer than the label ever existed. He has made an approximately 11-minute visual that examines the life-cycle of Rawkus through its releases and some lesser-publicized information.

9th Wonder Explains Why Soundbombing & Rawkus Kept His Hip-Hop Dreams Alive (Video)

The video highlights the impact of Nervous Records. That New York City label put out crucial releases by Black Moon Smif-n-Wessun (who would work closely with Rawkus in time as Cocoa Brovaz) and Mad Lion became an inspiration to the imprint launched by school-mates Jarret Myer Brian Brater and James Murdoch. Notably some of Rawkus’ early 12″ vinyl releases went beyond Hip-Hop dabbling in Rock Drum & Bass and more.

By 1997 the label made crucial inroads with Company Flow’s Funcrusher Plus. That release built upon years of groundwork from El-P Mr. Len and Bigg Jus. Later that year the label strategically picked Black Moon’s DJ Evil Dee to mix the first Soundbombing while decade-long veterans Kool Keith and De La Soul hosted the first Lyricist Lounge compilation a 1998 double-disc. Later in 1998 Mos Def & Talib Kweli’s Black Star union earned tremendous critical and commercial acclaim. That release reportedly allowed Rawkus to secure a distribution deal with the same Priority Records that had been instrumental to successes of N.W.A. Mack 10 and Master P. Over the next several years Rawkus continued to rise—earning a gold plaque for Mos Def’s Black On Both Sides and taking a major social stand with Hip Hop For Respect. That project involved 41 MCs to honor the 41 NYPD bullets that wrongfully struck and killed Amadou Diallo in early 1999. Rawkus also released a posthumous Big L album that also earned a plaque as well as the critically-acclaimed Train Of Thought by Reflection Eternal.

Thirstin Howl The 3rd Gives Polo & Ralph Lauren A New Kind Of Boost

With an increased profile Rawkus entered a joint venture with MCA Records. Veteran acts like Q-Tip Brand Nubian D.I.T.C. and Styles P continued to work with the imprint on songs and compilations. However the label—then home to J Dilla Blackalicous The Roots and Common would close and merge into Geffen/Interscope. There Rawkus suffered—leading albums by Kool G Rap and Mad Skillz to delay or shelf.

The doc also looks to where and how funds were spent in those later years using a quote from Evil Dee. After securing a deal with Sony Red distro Rawkus attempted to plant a flag the emerging digital space. They dropped albums by Marco Polo Kidz In The Hall and Procussions (whose Stro Elliot has since joined The Roots). The Rawkus 50 a user-facing contest invoked submissions from MCs like Silent Knight and Kaze to Mr. Metaphor and Finale however—the luster of the label was lost in the changing technologies and guards. It was an unceremonious end to an incredible 10-plus-year-run.

However through its artists Rawkus’ impact remains everlasting.

During an Aug. 20 ceremony in Nashville Toastmasters International presented the Tampa resident with its most prestigious honor. The organization awards the Golden Gavel to just one person annually and Davis joins an illustrious group of past honorees such as Dr. Joyce Brothers Walter Cronkite and Zig Ziglar.

Founded in 1924 Toastmasters is a nonprofit educational organization that teaches speaking and leadership skills through a worldwide network of clubs. It boasts over 300000 members in 149 countries and has presented the Golden Gavel to distinguished communicators and trailblazers since 1959.

“It’s amazing; it’s exciting and I’m still pinching myself” said Davis. “But what it really means for me is that all of the work that I’ve put in over my last 35 years in corporate America has come full circle in being appreciated and recognized because it has had so much impact on so many people around the world.”

Davis is the president and CEO of Tampa-based SDS Global Enterprises a female and minority-owned C-Corporation. According to its website SDS provides developmental solutions that enable leaders to create high-performing and inclusive cultures. While her clients span the world SDS Global works with several local companies including Raymond James Vinik Sports Group and the Straz Center for the Performing Arts.

Through her previous experience as a chief diversity & inclusion officer for several Fortune 100 companies Davis has offered her insights to business leaders in over 30 countries on five continents. Published by Wiley Press in January her latest book Diversity Equity & Inclusion for Dummies has reached best-seller lists.

Davis also penned Living Beyond “What If?” published by Berrett-Koehler Publishers in August 2021. She has served as a featured expert on several nationally broadcast TV shows and has written for prominent publications such as The Wall Street Journal and The Washington Post. She made the cover of Oprah Winfrey’s magazine O earlier this year – a particularly proud moment for Davis.

While she called the recognition “wonderful” as it highlights her work’s importance Davis relishes the increased opportunities to share her message.

“About how we have to truly change our mindsets and our attitudes and behaviors as leaders because the world around us is changing” she said. “And I’m seeing too many companies that I’m working with that are hiring our firm whose leaders are not as inclusive. They’re not as effective working across differences.”

While many leaders throughout the country have recently increased diversity and inclusion efforts Davis said much work remains to create opportunities and parity. She noted that some clients are just now increasing their funding of female and minority-owned businesses and one of the most significant challenges for those demographics is just getting noticed.

Women and minorities said Davis are often overlooked because people in power tend to only provide opportunities to friends and colleagues that provide a sense of familiarity.

“And if they don’t happen to know a lot of minority-owned businesses” she added. “Then they don’t usually give us the opportunity.”

Diversity and inclusion extend far beyond race and gender Davis stressed and encompasses many underrepresented groups. These include seniors non-native English speakers people from low-income backgrounds or even someone with an introverted personality in an office full of extroverts.

“We’ve got a lot more work to do in educating everyone that this is about engaging with all talent and all workers” she said.

As the pandemic caused a shift to remote and hybrid work business leaders must also modify employee engagement techniques. She added that at the core of those significant changes is ensuring people not seen as much in the workplace still feel included and valued.

Workers explained Davis are increasingly leaving their jobs due to feeling overwhelmed and experiencing burnout. She said those participating in the “Great Resignation” typically thought they were undervalued and lacked opportunities to grow and develop.

Many companies she added have recently increased salaries and attempted to address those issues. However she said owners need to not only pay their employees a fair and equitable wage that aligns with the increased cost of living but they also need to treat them with the highest level of respect and dignity.

“And the last piece of that is the company’s culture” said Davis. “They’ve got to know what distinguishes them from other companies that their companies are leaving to go to.”

Despite her recent accomplishments – Inclusion magazine also inducted her into its Hall of Fame this year – Davis said she would continue her mission of bettering corporate environments for underrepresented populations in earnest.

She said much work remains to ensure leaders follow up their talks of increasing diversity equity and inclusion with quantifiable results. She also plans to write another book and work on a documentary.

“I’ve got so many great opportunities and I’m just going to ride the wave out and continue to do everything I do” said Davis. “I’m just glad that was a natural output of the work that’s been so impactful.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMic2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm9ybGFuZG9zZW50aW5lbC5jb20vMjAyMi8wOC8yOC93aGF0LWluLWhlYXZlbnMtbmFtZS1oYXBwZW5lZC10by1jb2xsZWdlLWZvb3RiYWxsLWluLWZsb3JpZGEtY29tbWVudGFyeS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,What in heaven's name happened to college football in Florida? | Commentary,"ROB SCHUMACHER/THE ARIZONA REPUBLIC/ASSOCIATED PRESS

BYU won 35-27.

After then-freshman quarterback Timmy McClain passed for 186 yards and ran for 55 more in South Florida’s 35-27 loss to BYU last September many Cougar fans at LaVell Edwards Stadium went away thinking a more seasoned McClain would give BYU fits this year in the rematch in Tampa Florida.

The good news for the BYU defense is that McClain won’t suit up for the Bulls this Saturday in the season opener for both clubs at Raymond James Stadium (2 p.m. MDT ESPNU) because he transferred to UCF moving on after losing the starting job in 2022.

The bad news is McClain lost the QB derby to a signal-caller who actually did beat the Cougars last year — former Baylor QB Gerry Bohanon. In a scenario that sums up the state of college football these days Bohanon — who threw for 231 yards against the Cougars — transferred to USF after Blake Shapen was named the Bears’ starter out of spring camp by coach Dave Aranda.

“They have some new bodies and some new players. They have a lot of talent. I think they have a really really good coaching staff. They will have their guys ready. We have to be ready and make sure we are performing at our best.” — BYU football coach Kalani Sitake.

Bohanon “is a very very good quarterback” said BYU defensive coordinator Ilaisa Tuiaki. “We saw that last year.”

South Florida was picked to finish ninth in the 2022 American Athletic Conference football preseason media poll released in July. But the Bulls return 10 starters on offense and nine on defense as well as their starting punter and kicker. According to Bill Connelly of ESPN 86% of USF’s production in 2021 returns in 2022.

“They will be ready to play us. Everybody is undefeated right now. (Playing in) the first game is going to bring a lot of excitement” said BYU coach Kalani Sitake. “They have some new bodies and some new players. They have a lot of talent. I think they have a really really good coaching staff. They will have their guys ready. We have to be ready and make sure we are performing at our best.”

South Florida students began classes last Monday and the Bulls were given the day off. They began game-week type preparations for BYU on Tuesday. The Cougars wrapped up fall camp Tuesday took Wednesday off for some team activities and started focusing solely on USF on Thursday.

Aside from the on-field storylines such as BYU QB Jaren Hall returning to the site of his first college start last year’s shootout in Provo and the Bohanon transfer a theme that has emerged since the 4 p.m. EDT kickoff time was amounted in late May has been the expected heat and humidity on Sept. 3 in Tampa.

“The heat will be different (for the Cougars) but we have to be ready for it too” USF coach Jeff Scott told gousfbulls.com. “Even though we are in it every day that doesn’t make it easy. We have to execute at a very high level. I promise you it is going to be hot and humid at 4 o’clock on (Saturday).”

However according to a 10-day forecast on Weather.com there could be some scattered afternoon thunderstorms after a rainy morning.

“I think we will be in a really good spot going into the game and going into that humidity” Sitake said. “It helped that we had some really high record temperatures in the state of Utah this summer and even leading up to now. There was a lot of heat but the humidity is a different story. I think our guys will be ready for it.”

Sitake said BYU’s trainers and sports scientists have been working on a plan regarding hydration and nutrition to help the players avoid fatigue and cramping.

“We are sick of playing against each other. We want to play against somebody else and this is the right moment to end camp” Sitake said Tuesday. “Let’s start putting all of our energy and our focus on playing South Florida.”

The Bulls averaged fewer than 22000 fans per game at 75000-seat Raymond James Stadium last year according to The Oracle but Scott is predicting a “great crowd” and a “great student section” for the opener.

“And they have a chance to have an impact on the game” Scott said.

BYU will travel to Tampa on Thursday as it always does for Saturday games in the Eastern Time Zone.

BYU’s Hall said the Cougars are ready to get the season going.

“Everything is installed (on the offensive side)” he said. “Of course when you get to game week depending on your opponent what you think you can utilize you might add some things tweak some things here and there. That just comes with those first practices leading up to that first game.”

BYU running back Lopini Katoa said the Cougars are as prepared for an opener as he can remember in his five years in the program.

“You are grinding out the first few weeks of fall camp and just working hard to get on the same page as everybody and look like a good team” Katoa said. “Now it is time to settle in and get ready to play in the game.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxlZ2FjeS5jb20vdXMvb2JpdHVhcmllcy9uZXdzdHJpYi9uYW1lL21hcnktc2hhbm5vbi1vYml0dWFyeT9pZD0zNjMzMjgwM9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Mary Shannon Obituary (1938 - 2022) - Peru IL - News Tribune,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.legacy.com/us/obituaries/newstrib/name/mary-shannon-obituary?id=36332803 on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxlZ2FjeS5jb20vdXMvb2JpdHVhcmllcy9uZXdzdHJpYi9uYW1lL21hcnktc2hhbm5vbi1vYml0dWFyeT9pZD0zNjMzMjgwM9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen

The Prestige 15 is a compact daily driver with a full-size 15-inch display and a total weight of just 1.7 kilos. It can handle everyday multitasking and casual use just fine without choking or overheating or going loud and based on the configuration you’ll end up choosing it can also take on more demanding work/school chores and some light gaming but there’s a caveat about that. Plus it does all these without sacrificing build quality ergonomics or any important feature.

If you’re not familiar with this Prestige series which is not as popular as others in this niche this competes for your attention and money against devices such as the Asus Zenbook 15/VivoBook Pro 15 the ultralight LG Gram 16 and Acer Swift Edge 16 or the lower-specced configurations of the HP Envy 15 or Dell XPS 15 lineups.

I’ve spent the last few weeks using one of the 2022 model-year Prestige 15s and gathered my thoughts and impressions in this article down below. It’s a fair laptop with a versatile format and a competitive price in most markets but also with some quirks that you’d best be aware of before taking the plunge.

Specs as reviewed – MSI Prestige 15 A12U

MSI Prestige 15 A12UC Screen 15.6 inch FHD 1920 x 1080 px 16:9 aspect ratio 60 Hz IPS matte non-touch

300-nits and 100% sRGB colors Processor Intel 12th-gen Alder Lake P28 Core i7-1280P 6PC+8Ec/20T Video Intel Iris Xe + Nvidia GeForce GTX 3050 4GB (35-40W) Memory 16 GB DDR4-4266 (onboard) max 32 GB Storage 1x M.2 PCIe gen4 gen4 SSD (Samsung PM9A1) one extra PCIe gen3 M.2 slot Connectivity Wireless 6E (Intel AX211) 2×2 Bluetooth 5.2 Ports 2x USB-C with Thunderbolt 4 HDMI 2.0b 2x USB-A 3.2 micro SD card reader audio jack Battery 82 Wh 100W USB-C charger with quick-charging Size 357 mm or 14.05” (w) x 234 mm or 9.21” (d) x 18.9 mm or 0.74” (h) Weight 3.75 lbs (1.7 kg) + .35 kg (.77 lbs) for the charger+cables EU version Extras white backlit keyboard glass touchpad with finger-sensor HD webcam with IR stereo bottom speakers

Multiple other configurations are available as well starting at an Intel Core i5-1240P + RTX 3050 model and going up to 1280P + RTX 3050Ti + 4K display. Most of these are fairly affordable compared to their piers but the higher tier options get pricey.

Design and construction

As mentioned earlier the Prestige 15 is a premium compact 15-inch design.

It only offers a regular 16:9 15.6-inch display hence the bezels aren’t as small as on some other laptops but the overall format is portable and practical here while weighing just under 1.7 kilos for this tested model. That’s why in a way this Prestige 15 feels a bit dated in comparison to more recent designs – that’s no surprise given the Prestige 15 chassis hasn’t changed in a few years. For what is worth MSI also offers a newer 16-inch version of this laptop with the Prestige 16 just keep in mind that’s a more expensive device.

Just to better understand the dimensions of this notebook here are a few pics of the Prestige 15 next to a full-size 15-inch laptop the Lenovo Legion 5. It’s clear that the Prestige is smaller and thinner.

For the materials dark-gray pieces of aluminum are used for the main deck and the lid and only the underside is plastic.

The entire construction feels solid with a firm lid and a minimal amount of flex in the keyboard deck. This is no XPS or MacBook quality but close. MSI implemented a clean design as well with muted branding elements although that MSI engraving under the display is a bit much and could have been darker and smaller.

Ergonomics are mostly fine here. The rubber feet on the bottom are small but provided surprisingly good grip on a flat surface. MSI made sure to dull the front lip and corners which are comfortable on the wrists as a result and they also implemented strong hinges with the ability to lean back the display to 180 degrees excellent for on-the-go use.

There’s also a full-size centered keyboard on this laptop and a wide clickpad although a rather short implementation much like on other MSI laptops. That’s mostly because of the compact format of this chassis but also because MSI position the keyboard in the middle of the design leaving room for only a smaller arm-rest area.

The IO isn’t bad either for a thin design with multiple USB-C and USB-A ports a full-size HDMI an audio jack and a micro-SD card reader. There’s no Lock.

My nits with this chassis are the always-on light in the power button annoying when using the laptop at night as well as how the cooling module is set to blow hot air into the screen – that’s unfortunately a culprit of many other such portable designs. We’ll go over its impact in the performance and thermals sections further down.

Overall this is a practical and nice-looking mid-tier portable laptop even if the design hints its older age here and there.

Keyboard and trackpad

The Prestige 15 is a quick and accurate typer with a reliable touchpad but I do have some small complaints about the inputs on this series.

The keyboard’s layout is centered on the chassis which means there’s no space for a NumPad section. Instead MSI added an extra column of function keys on the right side which I find practical. However I’m totally against their way of implementing the FN key at the right side of the layout as a half-size key sharing space with the right Control key. That makes absolutely no sense to me but they do it on many of their laptops. You can switch the Windows and FN keys in the settings if you want to but that doesn’t help much as I’m using WIndows+ shortcuts all the time.

That aside though no real complaints. The keys feel nice to the touch and are properly spaced and sized. The arrow keys are also full-size even if cramped between the other keys.

As far as the typing experience goes this is a bit of shallower implementation and the actuations are on the chatter side but you’re going to get along well with this keyboard especially if you’re already used to this kind of short-stroke implementations available on most ultraportables.

This keyboard is also backlit with bright and uniform white LEDs. The edges of the keycaps are translucent and that allows for some light to bleed out from underneath the keycaps.

By default the illumination times out very quickly in just a few seconds but it can be easily reactivated with a swipe over the clickpad. On top of that I’ll also add that MSI implemented a couple of indicators for Casp-Lock mute microphone and Num-Lock on this layout.

The clickpad is still glass and wide but at the same time short as MSI positions the keyboard vertically centered on the chassis and that leaves for a rather small arm-rest on this compact design. I’ve seen this kind of touchpad on MSI laptops before and it works fine with daily use and gestures and taps. It doesn’t rattle with taps either and the physical clicks in the corners are well designed.

Palm rejection could be an issue for those of you with larger hands as the right palm touches the surface during use – still I didn’t have any problems with it during my time with the laptop.

For the biometrics there’s IR Hello support baked into the camera on this Prestige 15 as well as a dedicated finger-sensor. This is one of those designs that put the finger-sensor in the touchpad and that means a blind-spot is created if you end up swiping over the sensor during every use. Still as this sensor is placed at the top-left corner I rarely got to swipe over it.

Screen

There’s a 15-6-inch 16:9 matte display on this series with a choice of either an FHD or a 4K-UHD panel. Most configurations ship with the FHD panel and it’s the one we have here on this sample as well.

This panel is acceptable for everyday use but not anything to brag about by today’s standards. It’s only a little over 300 nits of max-brightness so not an option for outdoor use or brighter office spaces and it’s also sub-100% sRGB color coverage. Blacks contrast and viewing angles are fine though.

Here’s what we got in our tests with an X-Rite i1 Display Pro sensor:

Panel HardwareID: CHI Mei CMN152D (N156HCE-EN1);

Coverage: 95.9% sRGB 66.3% AdobeRGB 68.2% DCI-P3;

Measured gamma: 2.13;

Max brightness in the middle of the screen: 316.42 cd/m2 on power;

Min brightness in the middle of the screen: 15.26 cd/m2 on power;

Contrast at max brightness: 1173:1;

White point: 7000 K;

Black on max brightness: 0.27 cd/m2;

PWM: No.

You’ll want to calibrate this to fix the Gamma imbalances and skewed White Point. Once calibrated this ends-up uniform in our tests and didn’t show any noticeable light bleeding around the edges.

I’ll also add that this is a 60 Hz display with slow response times so not made for gaming.

All in all I feel like MSI should offer a screen on this lineup in 2022. This Chi Mei panel used to be competitive a few years ago but now it’s no longer properly suited for a premium wannabe notebook in the 1200-1700 USD/EUR segment. In comparison other brands give you sharper and richer OLED panels in this class or at least brighter IPS options.

MSI also offers an UHD-4K panel for this series with 500 nits of brightness and wide-gamut color coverage. That’s a much nicer screen option but also expensive and only available on the highest-specced versions of the laptop which are not as competitive as most other configurations.

Hardware and performance

Our test model is a mid-specced variation of the MSI Prestige 15 built on an Intel Core i7-1280P processor with Iris Xe graphics and an Nvidia RTX 3050 35-40W dGPU 16 GB of LPDDR4x memory and 1 TB of fast gen4 SSD storage.

What we have here is a retail model sent over by MSI for this review. We tested it a few months after this was launched with the mature software available as of late August 2022 (BIOS E16s8IMS.101 MSI Center 2.1.12.0 app Nvidia Studio Driver 512.96). Some aspects might still change with future software updates.

Specs-wise this is built on an Intel Alder Lake P28 hardware platform with the high-end Core i7-1280P processor on our configuration. This is a hybrid design with 6 Performance Cores and 8 Efficiency Cores and is allowed to run at high sustained powers for this kind of ultraportable design.

In fact when supplied with enough power the i7-1280P is pretty much identical in CPU capabilities to an i7-12700H Core H processor running at marginally higher clocks. It is a higher-tier bin though and thus more expensive.

For the GPU this generation of the Prestige 15 comes with RTX 3050 or 3050Ti chips with a TGP of 35W and the ability to run at up to 40W with Dynamic Boost. Our model is the mid-tier RTX 3050 40W. Configuration without a dGPU are also available which rely solely on the Iris Xe integrated graphics.

The memory is soldered on this design and can be specced up to 32 GB. MSI didn’t upgrade to LPPDR5 instead still implement LPDDR4x-4266 memory on this series like on the previous-gen Tiger Lake models.

For storage there are 2x M.2 2280 PCIe slots inside. One of them is gen4 capable and the other is only gen3. Our unit shipped with a fast Samsung PM9A1 drive so no complaints here.

The components can be easily accessed by removing the laptop’s underbelly which is held in place by only a few screws. The SSDs and WiFi modules are upgradable while everything else is soldered on.

As far as the software goes there are a couple of MSI apps preinstalled by default. I’d recommend reinstalling a fresh copy of Windows and only installing MSI Center in order to get access to auto-updates and the different power modes. The power modes are High Performance Balanced Silent and Super Battery and they’re self-explanatory. Balanced is a multi-purpose everyday profile. High Performance is meant for demanding loads and offers extra CPU and GPU power as well as allows the fans to spin a little faster and noisier.

The laptop feels snappy with daily multitasking video streaming text-editing and the likes where the fast processor and storage show their strengths. It also tends to keep silent while on battery on Balanced mode so you don’t necessarily have to go with the Silent profile.

Performance and benchmarks

On to more demanding tasks we start by testing the CPU’s performance by running the Cinebench R15 benchmark for 15+ times in a loop with 2-3 seconds delay between each run.

On the High-Performance mode the Core i7 processor kick in at 64W (PL2) and quickly drops and stabilizes at 45W (PL1 setting) with temperatures of ~85-88 degrees Celsius and fans at around 42 dB. These are powerful settings for a P28 processor and they show off in the excellent Cinebench scores pretty much on par with lower-power implementations of the i7-12700H processor available in other portable designs.

Pushing up the back of the laptop in order to improve airflow into the fans can help shed a few more degrees of the CPU but it’s not required as the processor is never thermally limited here.

Opting for the Balanced profile switches to a 45W PL2 35W PL1 profile with quieter fans and lower temperatures once the CPU stabilizes around 35W. The performance drops by 15-20% compared to the previous mode.

The laptop also runs at ~30 W of power when unplugged on the High-Performance mode which is an OK setting for battery use.

All these findings are detailed in the chart and logs published down below.

To put these in perspective here’s how this i7-1280P implementation fares against other i7/i9 or AMD thin-and-light designs.

It sure is competitive against pretty much every other ultrabook laptop both Intel or AMD and comes within reach or even outmatches higher-tier portable laptops with Core H processors such as the Blade 15 or the XPS 15.

Of course there are also other compact designs that will outperform this Prestige but for a Core P platform this is surely no slouch in multi-threaded CPU loads. Plus those are generally smaller thicker or heavier laptops even the most portable models such as the Zephyrus G14 or the Zephyrus G15.

We then went ahead and further verified our findings with the more taxing Cinebench R23 loop test and in Blender confirming our above findings.

We then ran the 3DMark CPU profile test on High-Performance mode. Once more these are higher scores than an i7-12700H returns on something like an XPS 15 but not on par with the i7-12800H in the Blade 15.

Finally we ran our combined CPU+GPU stress tests on this notebook on the High-Performance profile. 3DMark stress runs the same test for 20 times in a loop and looks for performance variation and degradation over time and the Prestige 15 managed to pass the test just fine which sugegsts the performance remains solid even when the heat builds up over time. However that changes a little in longer sustained work/gaming sessions as you’ll see further down.

Next here are some benchmark results. We ran the entire suite of tests and benchmarks on the High Performance profile with the laptop sitting on the desk at FHD resolutions. Here’s what we got.

Let’s discuss these results.

Once more we’ll refer to the XPS 15 (i7-12700H + RTX 3050Ti) previously tested. This Prestige configuration outscores it by around 5-8% in single-core performance and by 10-25% in multi-threaded performance. That’s impressive.

The Intel platform allows it to stay competitive even against known portable power laptops such as the ROG Zephyrus G15 or Flow X16 built on AMD Ryzen 9 hardware. Of course sustained CPU performance is slightly better on those but only by about 10-15% despite the fact that they allow for higher platform powers.

On the GPU side there’s only so much you can expect from a low-power RTX 3050 even if this performs within the platform’s capabilities in most loads and matches other portable designs such as the well-cooled Flow Z13 or the popular XPS 15. Thermals are a slight concern with sustained combined demanding loads though. We’ll touch on this matter in the next parts of this review.

Gaming performance

The Prestige 15 is by no means primarily made for gaming and even runs on Studio Edition drivers but considering the versatility of this series I’d still expect some of you to run games on it from time to time.

Hence we ran a couple of DX11 DX12 and Vulkan titles on the High Performance mode on this Core i7 + 3050 configuration at FHD resolution with Ultra and Medium graphics settings.

For starters here’s what we got on Ultra settings.

Most games run alright on this configuration at FHD resolution but for recent AAA titles you’ll have to cut on the details.

Here’s what we got on Medium settings at FHD resolution on the same High-Performance profile. I also added a couple of similarly-specced alternatives tested recently for comparison.

Despite running on an RTX 3050 this Prestige 15 is competitive against all the other 3050Ti reviewed options at FHD/Medium settings. On top of that opting for the 3050Ti variant of the Prestige will allow a further slight boost in framerates but not by much as both the 3050 and 3050Ti are max-q 35-40W dGPU variants in this product.

With these out of the way let’s go through some of the performance logs on each profile.

On the High Performance mode the hardware runs at about 60W of combined CPU+GPU power. Up to 40W are allocated to the GPU in all the titles that were able to scale well with Dynamic Boost and the reminding ~20W went to the CPU. However at FHD resolution most games keep the CPU around the 25-27W mark and thus only 30-35W end up allocated to the GPU.

As far as the temperatures go both the CPU and GPU run hot in this laptop especially as long as you’re keeping it flat on the desk. We’re looking at 95+ on the CPU at 85+ on the GPU with even some GPU throttling after 15+ minutes of gameplay when the heat builds up. At the same time the fans spin quietly at about 42 dBA during this time.

Bumping the back of the laptop off the desk in order to improve the airflow into the fans helps lower the GPU temperatures by 5-8 degrees allowing for the 3050 to end up at sub-80s C in most titles. However the CPU still runs hotly here at 95 and even 100 C.

You can also consider running games on the Balanced profile with a toll in performance and even quieter fans. However CPU and GPU temperatures are even higher in this case so I wouldn’t recommend it.

There’s no easy way to tame down the CPU in this design unless you’re willing to try to manually power-limit it with Throtlestop. I haven’t tried it and I’m not sure if that would work with the 12th-gen Alder Lake platform since Intel limited 3rd party voltage/power access more on more in recent years.

In conclusion I wouldn’t get this laptop for gaming or any serious work that stresses both the CPU and the GPU at the same time. This performs well but the issue is the high internal temperatures that might spell trouble long-term. Still if you do decide to run those sorts of tasks I recommend using at least a raiser stand to facilitate airflow into the fans or even better an active cooling pad that could help steer the CPU temps lower.

Noise Heat Connectivity speakers and others

MSI went with a peculiar thermal design on this Prestige 15 by opting for a smaller radiator and fan on the CPU side.

This is where the 2022 Prestige 15 shows that it’s based on an older design. The cooling module on this generation is an update of the cooling module used on past Prestige 15 models but even with the added heatpipes it’s not properly suited for the hardware in this generation. MSI are driving the Core P processor at fairly high power for a thin-and-light chassis in sustained crossloads the kind that thicker laptops with better cooling normally apply to Core H processors in these kinds of tasks and that measly fan and small radiator on the CPU side cannot properly cope with that kind of power. Thus the CPU ends up at 90++ degrees C in games and taxing loads.

Repasting the CPU might help here as well as somehow limiting the allocated power in demanding loads but I’m not sure that’s possible in any way. At this point I can’t tell whether the same kind of power is applied to the i5-1240P and i7-1260P configurations of this laptop or whether those processors are able to run at lower power and thus reduced heat. This is something to look for in other reviews of the Prestige 15 series.

As far as noise levels go while running games on High Performance I measured fan levels of 42 dBA with the laptop on the desk and 43-44 dBA with the back raised up both at head level.

With everyday use on the other hand the Prestige 15 keeps very quiet with the fans resting mostly idle with casual use and only occasionally kicking on with multitasking when the laptop is plugged in. I’ll also add that I haven’t experienced coil whine or electronic noises on this unit.

As for the external temperatures the chassis barely goes over 30 degrees celsius with daily use even with the mostly passive cooling. The area around the right exhaust will heat up if you’re also running tasks that will wakr-up the GPU as shows below and that will take some time to cool off. With casual use though the dGPU should stay quiet and that hotspot around the right radiator shouldn’t be as noticeable.

*Daily Use – Silent Mode – streaming Netflix in EDGE for 30 minutes fans at 0-30 dB

With demanding activities and games the keyboard and armrest areas stay within comfortable limits on the High-Performance mode with the middle of the keyboard deck hitting mid-40s.

However the hotspots are once more around the exhausts and on the screen’s bottom bezel which hit mid to high 50s C. The panel itself hits temperatures in the high-40s C in the areas close to the exhausts especially on the right side of the laptop which is borderline worrisome for long-term LCD reliability especially on this sort of matte LCD implementation without a layer of protective glass on top.

As explained in the previous section bumping the back of the laptop off the table helps lower the internal temperatures by a significant amount and positively impacts the external temperatures as well. Thus if you plan on running games on this laptop I recommend using a raiser stand or some sort of active cooling pad to keep this cool.

*Gaming – High Performance mode on desk – playing Witcher 3 for 30 minutes fans at 42-43 dB

*Gaming – High Performance mode raised up – playing Witcher 3 for 30 minutes fans at 43-44 dB



For connectivity there’s WiFi 6E with Bluetooth 5.2 through an Intel AX211 module on this laptop. It performed well with our setup but the speeds dropped quickly when stepping away from the router so you’d better keep this within your router’s proximity for best performance.

The audio quality isn’t much on the Prestige 15. A set of stereo speakers fire through cus on the underside so make sure not to muffle them when using this on the lap. They’re averagely loud at about 75-76 dB max and sound as you’d expect from regular ultrabook speakers. They’re fine for some movies and music and don’t distort or rattle at higher volumes just don’t expect them to sound great by any means.

I’ll also mention that there’s an HD camera placed at the top of the screen with IR and flanked by microphones. These mics are OK for calls but the camera quality is mediocre even in good light and with a narrow viewing angle.

Battery life

There’s an 82 Wh battery inside this Prestige 15 a fair capacity for a laptop of this size.

Here’s what we got in terms of battery life with the screen’s brightness set at around 120 nits (~60 brightness).

9 W (~8-9 h of use) – text editing in Google Drive Silent mode screen at 60% Wi-Fi ON;

– text editing in Google Drive Silent mode screen at 60% Wi-Fi ON; 9 W (~8-9 h of use) – 1080p fullscreen video on Youtube in Edge Silent mode screen at 60% Wi-Fi ON;

– 1080p fullscreen video on Youtube in Edge Silent mode screen at 60% Wi-Fi ON; 8.5 W (~9 h of use) – Netflix fullscreen in Edge Silent mode screen at 60% Wi-Fi ON;

– Netflix fullscreen in Edge Silent mode screen at 60% Wi-Fi ON; 16 W (~5-6 h of use) – browsing in Edge Balanced mode screen at 60% Wi-Fi ON.

This implementation proved more efficient than most other Alder Lake P28 platforms we’ve tested so far.

The configuration ships with a compact 100W charger which proved to be adequately sized for this hardware. It plugs in via USB-C in the ports on the left side of the laptop. It’s a dual-piece design with averagely-sized cables. A full charge takes over 2 hours with quick charging for the first part.

Price and availability- MSI Prestige 15

The Prestige 15 is widely available all around the world at the time of this article late-August 2022.

The base model with a Core i5-1240P CPU RTX 3050 graphics 16 GB of RAM a 512 GB SSD can be found at $1199-$1299 in the US and around 1300 EUR here in Europe. That’s competitive for what you’re getting.

Higher-tier options are also available with the top model going up to the i7-1280P RTX 3050Ti 32 GB RAM 1 TB SSD and a wide-gamut UHD 4K display for around $2000 or 2000 EUR here in Europe. This is not bad either considering what you’re getting in this sort of chassis.

For me the best value is that base-level model at the lower price point. You’re not getting much extra performance upgrading to the i7-1260P or the RTX 3050Ti specs. The 1280P is faster and worth paying a little extra and that top-specced model with the UHD wide-gamut display is worth considering as well although if you need those sorts of specs you might want to steer towards a better-cooled design instead.

Final thoughts- MSI Prestige 15

If you’re after a lightweight full-size-screen laptop capable of solid everyday performance and good runtimes plus the ability to handle demanding work/school loads and casual games from time to time the 2022 generation of the MSI Prestige 15 is an option to consider.

As mentioned earlier my go-to model is the i5 + 3050 configuration which I consider the better balanced and fair-priced of all the other available options. This is the one I’m rating at 4.25 out of 5 while the other specs aren’t as competitive imo in this chassis.

Even for this i5+3050 variant the potential deal-breaker is the IPS screen which is fine but not as nice as what you can get with other laptops. My other complaint is with the overall thermal design which blows hot air into the screen and cannot properly cool the internal components in sustained loads especially on the CPU side and when using the laptop on a flat desk. Up to you if these are acceptable drawbacks or not.

As far as the competition goes there are very few other 15-inch thin-and-light laptops with similar specs out there. The VivoBook Pro 15 comes to mind as the closest alternative similar in capabilities and size but with better OLED screens and a higher starting price – these are also available in either Intel or AMD options which might matter to some of you. The HP Envy 15 is another but not as widely available and the Dell XPS 15 is another but more expensive if you’re after the latest 2022 generation. The 2021 XPS 15 9510 on the other hand is available on sale these days.

The reason is that most manufacturers are steering their portable premium designs towards 16-inch designs including MSI with their Prestige 16. Most of those are expensive though in comparison to the base-tier Prestige 15 model. Nonetheless something like a Prestige 16 an Envy 16 a ThinkPad Z16 or a VivoBook Pro 16X should also be on your list especially if you plan to run demanding loads and games on your laptop more often than none.

This wraps up our review of the 2022 MSI Prestige 15 A12U series and I’d love to hear your thoughts questions and feedback down below. Would you get this over other portable full-screen-size models?

NVIDIA's CEO recently confirmed that the next generation of RTX GPUs are coming soon and the company will officially reveal the underlying architecture of the RTX 40 series of GPUs at GTC 2022. A new leak now suggests that the upcoming entry-level RTX 4060 Ti GPU might even outperform the flagship grade RTX 3080 GPU.

According to the tipster QbitLeaks the NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4060 Ti will have a TGP of 270-280W with an average clock speed of around 2600MHz. It is also said that the RTX 4060 Ti will score over 8600 points on the 3D Mark Time Spy Extreme test outperforming the RTX 3080.

The RTX 4060 Ti will be based on the AD104-180-A1 GPU consisting of 6144 CUDA cores. Along with that the GPU will also have 10GB of GDDR6 video memory with a bandwidth of 17Gbps.

Well it seems 4060 and 4060 Ti have been tested



4060 Ti: TSE ~8600 avg clock 26XX power draw ~270-280W.



4060: TSE ~6000 avg clock 27XX power draw ~230-240W. — FCL (@QbitLeaks) August 26 2022

At launch the RTX 4060 is expected to be the most affordable next-generation GPU from NVIDIA and this graphics card will have a TGP of 230-240W with an average clock speed of 2700MHz. The RTTX 4060 will be based on the AD106-300 GPU with 3968 CUDA cores and 8GB memory with 17Gbps memory speed.

When it comes to performance the RTX 4060 is said to clock a score of 6000 points on the 3D Mark Time Spy Extreme test. Looking at this number the RTX 4060 should match the performance of the RTX 3070/3070 Ti and is expected to sell in large numbers.

NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4060 RTX 4060 Ti Launch Date

NVIDIA is expected to launch the next generation of RTX 40 series GPUs at the beginning of 2023. These GPUs are expected to deliver better performance and are also likely to be more expensive than their predecessors. We should get more information on these GPUs in the next few weeks.

Spider-Man Remastered has swung onto PC after a few years as a PlayStation exclusive and it's one of the best PC ports we've played.

Not only does Spider-Man Remastered work great on the Steam Deck handheld console but it comes with a huge amount of graphical settings and features such as ray tracing DLSS upscaling uncapped frame rates and ultrawide monitor support.

This is another PlayStation PC port from Sony that puts other ports such as Elden Ring to shame.

So naturally I was excited to see how Spider-Man Remastered runs at 8K on our beastly test PC especially as I had finally got my hands on the Nvidia GeForce RTX 3090 Ti graphics card currently the most powerful gaming GPU in the world.

However before I was able to play the game disaster struck: I broke the PC.

A special kind of broken

I've been tinkering with PCs since the early 1990s and in that time I've seemingly perfected the art of breaking PCs. Among friends and family (and now on the internet) I'm the first person people go to when they have a problem with their PC or laptop.

These amateur PC destroyers usually have problems I can identify and fix pretty quickly. At worst they need a new hard drive or a Windows reinstall to fix things. Pathetic.

When I have a problem with my PC I really have a problem. And so that came to pass as I replaced the RTX 3090 with the RTX 3090 Ti. Everything seemed fine... except the PC wouldn't boot USB ports weren't working and the RAM's RGB lights didn't fire up.

After ensuring everything was properly seated I tried again – still no luck. However a white light on the motherboard next to the letters VGA gave me a clue – it was to do with the video card. Makes sense I thought as I'd just installed a new one. So I took it out put it back in and... had the same issue.

So I put the older GPU back in worried that it may be the RTX 3090 Ti's fault. But it wasn't. The PC still wouldn't boot and the light next to VGA stayed on. Taking out the GPU and using it in another slot didn't help and worryingly having no GPU in there at all and using the onboard graphics also didn't help.

I was stuck. I tried swapping out the RAM (luckily I have plenty lying about being a big ol' PC geek) which was tricky thanks to the huge CPU cooler in the case. I also tried to reflash the BIOS the last refuge of a scoundrel but no luck. The PC was dead Jim.

Scouring the internet it seemed like other people had similar issues with the same motherboard I was using but any fixes they offered didn't help.

It looked like I would have to do some major surgery on the PC.

Time for a brain transplant

It looked like the issue was either to do with the motherboard or the CPU (seeing as using integrated graphics of the processor didn't fix things). This meant I'd have to replace those. While I could have done some more troubleshooting to determine which one was causing the issue time was of the essence as I really wanted to test out Spider-Man Remastered at 8K as close to its launch as possible.

While having to replace the motherboard and CPU was certainly frustrating – and is one of the more time-consuming upgrades you can make – I decided to put a positive spin on it. I used it as a chance to make some big upgrades to the 8K rig and future-proof it for upcoming games.

So I swapped out the 8-core Intel Core i9-9900K for a 16-core Intel Core i9-12900K chip to make the PC more modern.

A new CPU means a new motherboard which is just as well as the mobo was one of the components I suspected of being faulty. So out went the Asus ROG STRIX Z390-E GAMING and in its place (literally) went the MSI MPG Z690 Carbon WiFi.

One of the main selling points of this motherboard is that it comes with a large selection of M.2 SSD ports so it was easy to move all of the existing storage from the old motherboard into the new one. I also added another 1TB WD_Black SN770 SSD for good measure.

I wasn't done upgrading however. The 12th-gen Intel processor supports the new faster DDR5 RAM. So I took the opportunity to switch to 32GB of Corsair Dominator Platinum RGB DDR5 5200MHz RAM replacing the 32GB of G.Skill Trident Z RGB DDR4 3200MHz memory.

Oh I also needed a new CPU cooler and while the large air cooler I did have was impressively quiet it was so big that it made tinkering difficult. So I used the Corsair iCUE H150i RGB ELITE Liquid CPU Cooler instead.

As with many all-in-one liquid coolers the cooling plate that rests on the CPU is connected via tubes to fans and a radiator in another part of the chassis (I installed it at the front due to the case layout with the fans pulling in cool air from outside). This gives you a lot more space on the motherboard itself.

Finally as this ended up being a major upgrade operation I took the opportunity to replace the Corsair RM850x 80 PLUS Gold 850W PSU with the Corsair HX1500i 80 PLUS Platinum 1500W.

While this made the upgrade more complex (despite both PSUs being modular and by Corsair you should always change the cables when switching power supply units) it's a forward-thinking upgrade. The RTX 3090 Ti is a demanding enough beast that the 850W PSU may have struggled but if rumors about the upcoming RTX 4090 are true the next generation of graphics cards could be incredibly demanding when it comes to power especially at the high-end. So while I was elbow-deep in components and cables I thought it wise to upgrade to a hefty 1500W model.

Because I was keeping everything else including the case the upgrade process was quicker than building a PC from scratch.

Once completed I pressed the power button with bated breath and... success! The PC booted.

Even better Windows 11 booted straight away and after a little bit of automatic configuring I was back on my desktop with everything where I left it. I didn't even need to reactivate Windows 11. It was impressively smooth and I have to give Microsoft and Windows 11 credit here. Previously swapping out the CPU and motherboard could cause all kinds of nonsense with the operating system and would sometimes make the OS consider the upgraded PC a whole new device requiring you to purchase another activation key.

Not this time though. So with a sigh of relief I fired up Spider-Man Remastered and got started.

Spectacular performance

Usually when I try 8K games I set the graphics levels to their highest setting see how poorly the game performs then begin tweaking settings such as lowering graphics quality or adding upscaling tech like Nvidia DLSS to get a playable frame rate.

That's what I set out to do with Spider-Man Remastered with graphics set to 'Very High' and ray tracing effects enabled. Jumping into the game and swinging around New York I was blown away by how good it felt despite the intensive settings and resolution of 7680 × 4320.

At this level average frame rates were an impressive 32fps just above the 30fps minimum I consider playable – and which the original Spider-Man game ran at on the PlayStation 4.

While framerates did dip to a minimum of 26.4fps it also hit highs of 39.3fps. For a game as visually stunning as Spider-Man Remastered with a large and busy open world that's remarkable. It's a testament to the power of the Nvidia RTX 3090 Ti as well as the hard work of developer Insomniac plus Nixxes Software which handled the PC port.

And while the original game is four years old – and made for hardware that launched in 2013 (finding out the PS4 is nearly a decade old has made me feel old thanks time!) – the remaster looks fantastic. The increased details and realistic ray-traced reflections really make the game's recreation of New York feel alive.

Switching off ray tracing gave the game a bit of a bump to 36fps on average and a minimum of 30fps. This was surprising as ray tracing usually makes a big impact on frame rates – sometimes as much as halving them when turned on.

The slight increase in performance wasn't worth losing the ray tracing effects so I turned them back on but this time I also turned on DLSS using its 'Balanced' setting.

DLSS is a clever method of using AI and machine learning to upscale games running at a lower resolution so that they appear to run at a higher resolution.

It can help you use intensive graphical settings while getting a performance boost. When done well it means image quality isn't much different from running the game at the higher resolution.

In the past this has made previously unplayable games playable at 8K. The balanced setting as the name suggests offers a mix of graphical fidelity and performance and I saw an instant improvement. Average frame rates were now at 51.4fps and hitting a maximum of 60fps which is the ideal frame rate for 8K.

The game felt smoother to play and still looked very good with little noticeable graphical difference while swinging through New York.

Switching to DLSS Performance mode where performance takes precedence over image quality there was another decent boost to 57.5fps on average. While some textures were a bit softer the game still looked great and those extra frames made it feel sublime. After all this is a game that focuses on fast and fluid movement and action.

Switching to DLSS Ultra Performance got the game up to 59.7fps basically at the golden 60fps mark. Graphical fidelity did take another knock. This time there was a perceptible haze around Spider-Man when he moved but nothing too distracting and it was undeniably impressive that I was playing the game at essentially 60fps.

After swinging around New York for a bit I took on some muggers during a randomly generated crime and frame rates during the fight remained at a solid 59.9fps. Because the fighting in this game relies on quick combos and strict timing a dependable frame rate is essential and that's exactly what I got.

Is 8K gaming more realistic?

When I started out with 8K gaming back with an Nvidia RTX Titan the idea of playing games at 7680 × 4320 resolution was frankly far-fetched. Not only were 8K displays hard to come by but the performance impact of playing games at 8K even on what was then the most powerful – and expensive – graphics card in the world just wasn't worth it.

Since then we've seen more 8K TVs come out more powerful GPUs with the RTX 3090 and RTX 3090 Ti and games that are better optimized for ultra-high resolutions. Technology like DLSS and FidelityFX Super Resolution – both of which Spider-Man Remastered supports – have made gaming at 8K even more achievable as long as you have the expensive hardware that can handle it.

The fact that Spider-Man Remastered runs at 30fps at 8K with graphics settings at their maximum level and ray tracing on is incredible. While 4K remains the sweet spot between looks and performance (the exact same settings at 4K got us 70fps on average) it shows that gaming at 8K is no longer a distant dream. Thanks to DLSS pushing the average frame rate up to 60fps the future looks bright for 8K gaming.

I should once again give a shout-out to Sony Insomniac and Nixxes Software (especially the last one) for a brilliant PC port that includes a huge range of settings. Because of the excellent performance straight out the box I didn't need to look at other upscaling options such as AMD's FidelityFX Super Resolution or use the Dynamic Scaling option which lets you set a preferred frame rate and the game will scale the resolution accordingly to make sure it hits that frame rate.

While I didn't make use of it this could be another handy tool for people with lower-powered hardware who want more consistent performance.

This is great to see. While 8K gaming is great for testing the limits of hardware and software using the technology to make modern games more accessible to people who can't afford powerful hardware is where this really counts.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMid2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5vdGVib29rY2hlY2submV0L1hpYW9taS1lLXZlaGljbGVzLWNvdWxkLWJlLW1hZGUtaW4tcGFydG5lcnNoaXAtd2l0aC1DaGluZXNlLWF1dG8tZ2lhbnQtQkFJQy42NDM1NTkuMC5odG1s0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Xiaomi e-vehicles could be made in partnership with Chinese auto giant BAIC,"Xiaomi's well-publicized plan to become an EV company by 2024 as well as a global electronics giant have recently hit a stumbling block. However the company might be back on track with its ambitions as it is reportedly discussing methods for the production of its first-gen car with the major manufacturer BAIC.

4 Reviews

Xiaomi has already announced plans to add electric cars to its impressive portfolio of gadgets sold under its name. The company had originally aimed to make these vehicles in its own right and had applied to Chinese authorities to do so. Unfortunately the OEM has faced unexpectedly tight regulatory hurdles in its path to doing so.

Therefore it seems Xiaomi is still intent on delivering its inaugural car by 2024 and will even resort to having cars made by another manufacturer under its brand rather than make it themselves at this point. To that end it is reportedly in talks with the Beijing Automotive Group Co (also known as BAIC).

Xiaomi's prospective e-vehicle ODM has apparently offered the mobile device company multiple options to complete its new project one of which is the purchase of a stake in the ""No.2"" BAIC plant co-opened with Hyundai in 2008.

This measure will reportedly result in future cars with the Xiaomi name slapped on them along with that of BluePark New Energy (a BAIC subsidiary). This might indeed realize the former's ambitions of getting its very own wheels on the road albeit not in the way its CEO Lei Jun may have envisioned.

Blackpink tore up the 2022 MTV Video Music Awards stage in their first U.S. awards show performance.

The K-pop quartet—composed of Jisoo Jennie Rosé and Lisa—became the first female K-pop group to perform at the VMAs tonight with a hyped-up rendition of their brand-new single ""Pink Venom.""

With the help of smoke effects and full-stage visualizers—including a pair of giant pink fangs—the four stars performed the track's intricate choreography alongside a dozen backup dancers. All the dancers were dressed in black with the group adding pink accents including sleeves and thigh-high boots to each of their looks.

The foursome who won awards for Group of the Year and Best Metaverse Performance earlier in the night are preparing for their first comeback since October 2020. After their forthcoming album Born Pink drops on September 16 the members will set out on a five-continent world tour.

In a recent interview with Rolling Stone the members opened up about the process behind their hit songs and performances.

""We are involved from the beginning building the blocks adding this or that feeling exchanging feedback — and this process of creating makes me feel proud of our music"" Jisoo told the outlet. ""If we just received pre-made songs it would feel mechanical. I feel more love for the process because we say 'How about adding this in the lyrics? How about adding this move in the choreography?'""

Prime numbers and their weird cousins Carmichael numbers which act like primes but aren’t. Daniel would lie in bed in his split-level house on a quiet street in Bloomington where his parents math professors at IU slept in a bedroom nearby and think about a complex math problem concerning Carmichael numbers. It was a problem that his father Dr. Michael Larsen estimated Daniel had little chance of solving as it had stumped a trio of mathematicians whose cumulative ages at the time of their breakthrough paper on the subject was 136.

Daniel was 17. A prime number. Two less than its twin prime number 19 but more on that later.

“It seemed like a long shot to me” recalls Michael Larsen. We’re talking math in the Larsens’ living room a big open space with a piano lots of books a bowl of seashells and several menorahs on the fireplace mantle. “It wasn’t an absurdity not hopeless but I thought if he was going to work on a problem for a long time and get frustrated it could be a negative experience. But he was into it. I didn’t tell him not to do it. He probably wouldn’t have listened to me if I had.”

This last bit makes Daniel laugh.

“You said I had a 10 percent chance!” he says. Daniel looks a bit like Harry Potter—thin brown hair glasses black socks. He’s soft-spoken and shy and laughs easily at himself. “That wasn’t really discouraging for me. I wanted to prove you wrong.”

Daniel is really good at things many people struggle with. Things like Rubik’s Cubes chess spelling bees crossword puzzles and math. When Daniel is interested in something he takes a deep dive—and often succeeds at the highest level. Take crossword puzzles. Daniel was just 13 when he published a Tuesday crossword puzzle in The New York Times the youngest constructor in the history of the newspaper. Since then he has published 10 more. The Times pays $750 a puzzle.

“I think it’s very generous since I do it for fun” he says.

And that’s the striking thing about all of Daniel’s creative projects. He pursues them—day and night—not because his parents nag or teachers egg him on not for the celebrity or the cash but because he finds them fun. And of all the challenges Daniel has pursued since what he calls “the olden days” when he was a kid the most fun—and wondrous—is math.

“I’ve been drawn to understanding how things work what the fundamental structure and order of something is and math is full of these beautiful pictures of how seemingly unrelated concepts are part of the same idea” says the Bloomington High School South graduate who is headed to MIT in the fall. “That’s my favorite part of math: how you have these beautiful connections. There’s a great sense of harmony and unity.”

MATH WAS IN the air in the Larsen house when Daniel was growing up. Michael Larsen used to host Math Circle a free Saturday-afternoon group for area kids where he talked about oddball topics that would excite kids about math. Daniel would listen in though he was only 4.

“The fact we were talking about math a lot when they were growing up had an influence I am sure” Michael says. “But children come with definite desires and interests and tastes. Your child wants to do what your child wants to do.”

What Daniel wanted to do was projects. At age 3 he would plant himself in front of classical music concerts on YouTube—and conduct. He took up violin at 5 piano at 6. When he could solve a Rubik’s Cube in 45 seconds he moved on to larger cubes four five and seven squares. He devised a Lego robot that would sort copper pennies from zinc ones. “It wasn’t very reliable” he concedes “but it was better than nothing.”

In middle school Daniel twice flew to Washington D.C. and competed in the Scripps National Spelling Bee. Despite wearing his lucky lion T-shirt he never made it to the final round of 50. In seventh grade he didn’t score well enough on the written test. The next year he aced the written test but misspelled a word that wasn’t on his study list of 5000. Sheepishly he tells me the word he missed but asks me not to print it.

“It’s a bit embarrassing that it’s a word everybody can spell but it wasn’t what I studied and I was under pressure” Daniel says. “It was not my finest hour.”

I jot down the proper noun seven-letters commonly slurred to sound more like six. Later I realize that I’ve spelled it wrong.

THE GREAT crossword puzzle adventure began on his family’s yellow couch where his parents and older sister Anne used to puzzle through puzzles together. “I wasn’t very good at solving them” Daniel says. “So I thought if I can’t solve them maybe I can make them and then I can stump other people instead of being stumped myself.”

Daniel began making 4-by-4 word squares then his father devised a crossword puzzle computer program so Daniel could design online. For his 12th birthday Daniel asked for a word list and wrote code to upgrade his software. His first puzzle submission to The New York Times had a Bertie and Jeeves theme based on a favorite writer P.G. Wodehouse. The Times wrote back: “This is solid work but the theme doesn’t quite excite us enough to say yes.”

Seven more rejection letters followed. “It was very discouraging at first” Daniel recalls. “I didn’t realize how competitive it was.”

His ninth attempt proved the charm. His theme was Elmer Fudd and Times crossword puzzle editor Will Shortz was so delighted to learn Daniel was 13 years old that he wrote a story about him. Fifty-eight teenagers have published puzzles in the Times including Daniel’s sister Anne. Daniel was the youngest by half a year.

Daniel didn’t tell his friends but his school caught wind of it and made an announcement. “It wasn’t a big deal” Daniel says. “I don’t expect that record to last very long but for now I am happy with it.”

The math of crosswords is daunting. The Times accepts only seven puzzles from 200 weekly submissions. Daniel has submitted 60 puzzles for his 11 acceptances. Each puzzle takes him two to 50 hours to create. The English of crosswords is also daunting. It’s not enough to simply fill your grid. Answers should be witty fun. If your crossword has a theme it can’t be cliched or obscure. One of Daniel’s coolest puzzles had an alphabet theme with phrases such as UVWAVE and XYZAFFAIR and his personal favorite FILMNOIR which has amazingly LMNO.

Daniel still struggles coming up with clues. “There are people who do almost all their clues but I was never able to come up with very many good clues” he says. “Most of the clues are theirs.”

His dad tries to help to not much avail. “The New York Times tells us we’re not good at clues” he says with a chuckle. “It’s a knack none of us have really mastered.”

Daniel combs through his latest puzzle checking off clues the editors kept.

Eight letters: Many national anthems: WARSONGS

Three letters: ____ Reactor (Iron Man’s power source.): ARC

Three letters: High degree: NTH

Five letters: Path an electron may take moving in a constant magnetic field: HELIX

Four letters: Big name in laptops: ACER

Three letters: Indifferent remark: MEH

Shortz the Times puzzle master says there’s nothing MEH about Daniel’s puzzles. “They are as good as a contributor of any age” says the Crawfordsville native. “He especially likes theme-less puzzles and he fills them with interesting colorful fresh juicy vocabulary.”

Case in point Daniel’s latest puzzle which has a whopping eight 15-letter answers such as A WALK IN THE WOODS THE BACHELORETTE CARE TO ELABORATE RUSSIAN ROULETTE SLEEVELESS DRESS and mostly avoids crossword puzzle-ese short cliched words jammed with vowels.

“This is a gorgeously made puzzle” Shortz says.

While most constructors have ditched graph paper and dictionaries for the computer and word databases Shortz insists there’s nothing facile about designing a compelling puzzle and prevailing in the fierce competition for publication in the Times.

“Anyone can make a bad crossword” he says. “It takes a special person to make a good one.”

AND NOW WE circle back to math with a quick lesson on prime numbers. For those who may have forgotten a prime number is a positive number with only two factors one and itself. 7 is a prime number because 7 and 1 are the only things you can multiply to get 7. Twelve is not because there are a few options (3 x 4 for example). Thousands of years ago Euclid—the founder of geometry born in 300 B.C.—proved there are infinitely many prime numbers. Interestingly some prime numbers come in pairs just two apart such 3 and 5 5 and 7 17 and 19. The spacing between these sets of “twins” becomes farther apart as the numbers grow. (The largest known twin primes have 388342 digits.) But does the list of twin primes ever end? This unsolved question has a name that sounds like a Robert Ludlum thriller: the twin prime conjecture. While all this number theory might sound really abstract prime numbers do have some practical modern-day uses. The encryption algorithm RSA uses the magic of primes to keep banking online shopping and other communication secure.

Enter Daniel and a movie.

Five years ago he watched the documentary Counting from Infinity which tells the story of Yitang Zhang an unknown mathematician who toiled for years on the twin prime conjecture at one point working at Subway to support himself. (Zhang earned his Ph.D. at Purdue but had a falling out with his adviser who did not write him a letter of recommendation for a job.) In 2013 Zhang proved there are infinitely many consecutive primes less than 70 million apart a thrilling breakthrough in number theory that made him an instant math celebrity. He was later awarded the MacArthur “Genius” Grant.

“If you go up to unimaginably large numbers primes that are 70 million apart are like right next door in the grand scheme of things” Daniel says. The grand scheme of things is where Daniel spends a lot of his time.

Daniel tried to read Zhang’s paper. Impenetrable. But then another mathematician wrote a clearer proof whittling 50 pages down to 15. Daniel followed his curiosity to an important 1994 paper by W.R. Alford Andrew Granville and Carl Pomerance which proved that just like primes there are an infinite number of Carmichael numbers. The authors also raised the question of whether Bertrand’s Postulate—for every number there is a prime between it and its double—could be proven for Carmichael numbers.

Daniel thought: “That can’t be that hard so I just started thinking about it.” He laughs. “It turned out to not be so easy.”

Daniel tackled the question in his free time.

For six months Michael Larsen watched his son persevere. “You need to get to the point where it’s under your skin and driving you nuts if you want to work at maximum effectiveness” he says. “It’s probably true for most people in other things as well. Daniel became obsessed with this problem.”

Last summer Daniel visited his grandparents in Massachusetts. Except for breaks to watch Olympic swimming Daniel was on the computer his spirits rising and falling with each breakthrough and setback.

“He wouldn’t give up” recalls his grandfather David Larsen. “That’s part of his nature.”

Daniel’s sister Anne encouraged him though she had her limits. “He would talk about it to anyone who would listen which was not really me” she says. Anne also heads to MIT this fall to pursue a Ph.D. in math. “I don’t want to talk about this at breakfast.”

After roughly 300 hours of work Daniel finally proved there is a Carmichael number between any number and its double. (His actual finding has a few caveats and complications too arcane for a reporter who never made it past calculus to explain.) He sent the paper to British mathematician Andrew Granville co-author of that 1994 paper on Carmichael numbers published in Annals of Mathematics a premier journal in the field.

“It’s amazing to be honest” Granville says. “It’s hard technical stuff really quite deep. The level of detail and depth is unbelievable for a high school student.”

The writing did need work. Granville made suggestions. “Daniel came back a few weeks later and he had far surpassed anything I’d expected or even thought of myself” Granville says. “He took everything I said and ran a long distance with it. He’s very very good at taking advice and thinking about that advice. He seems to have everything going for him.”

Granville says the paper would make a good Ph.D. thesis. Indeed Daniel is currently taking two graduate-level math courses at IU one with Dr. Noah Snyder who says in his 10 years on campus he can only remember one other high school student taking classes at this level: Anne Larsen Daniel’s sister.

“It’s difficult to make long-term predictions but I think it’s clear that if Daniel decides he wants to stay in mathematics or closely related sciences he’s likely to be quite successful” Snyder says. “He is very impressive.”

IT WAS Daniel’s grandfather David who suggested Daniel submit his proof to the Regeneron Science Talent Search formerly the Westinghouse the nation’s oldest and most prestigious high school science contest. The Larsen family has a long history with the contest. David applied but didn’t win. Daniel’s grandmother Suzanne Larsen received an honorable mention. Daniel’s father applied but was disqualified when a faculty recommender missed the deadline.

Nearly 1900 students apply to the Regeneron each year an elaborate process similar to applying to college. In January Daniel learned he was one of 40 finalists and flew to Washington D.C. for a week of interviews and events. The top 10 winners were announced in a formal ceremony—ballgowns and tuxes—which was livestreamed.

Anne followed the frantic family texts about sartorial stress. “It was kind of funny” she says. “My little brother is up there wearing a tuxedo. He’s never worn a tuxedo in his life. His roommate figured out his cufflinks.”

After an hour of speeches and windup the “class” of 40 finalists stood shoulder to shoulder on stage as the emcee opened the 10th-place envelope and worked his way up.

“I am standing on stage thinking This is nice but I am not going to get anything” Daniel says. “Then they called me for fourth place.”

It was the highest award for a math project.

His prize: a check for $100000.

His grandparents were thrilled. “It was so improbable that a high school kid could solve a problem that very good mathematicians had not been able to crack in 27 years” David says. “When I heard that he had done it I was very very happy. The prize is nice and the excitement of number four is nice but the achievement of his effort was the thing that I was most excited by.”

Daniel’s paper was recently accepted by the journal International Mathematics Research Notices. It is his second publishing credit.

IT’S COMFORTING in such moments to remember that even the most remarkable people have shortcomings. I ask Daniel what he’s not good at.

“It feels like I struggle with everything” he says. “Do you mean school subjects?”

I shrug. “I mean like making your bed.”

“Oh that for sure. Being organized in general. Using my time in efficient ways.” He clasps his hands and stretches. “I find I take the path of least resistance often. If there’s a situation that I am unhappy about I might not be as active in dealing with it as I should be.”

I press for an example. Sometimes when he’s cold he can’t be bothered to fetch his coat. The other day he couldn’t read the blackboard but didn’t move closer. “There was a problem and there was a solution. I guess laziness is what I’m trying to say.”

I HAD ALMOST finished a draft of this profile when I thought Gee maybe I should actually see Daniel’s paper. He emailed it to me. The shock was not that it was 26 pages. (As an English professor I see work 10 times that long.) The shock is that it was 26 pages of math—math like I have never seen before a menagerie of strange symbols like an oversized spikey E and swooping F like a crane’s neck. An alphabet soup of algebraic letters—some bolded others in italics—intermix with max and log and cos all stacked in elaborate fractions that squeeze under square-root signs like people hiding from the rain. Then in wanders an upside-down horseshoe and the IU logo and a yoga pose while dozens of greater-than and less-than signs swim about like lost fish.

The most complex equations stretch five lines long.

Like a paragraph. A paragraph of math.

These massive fractions build an argument. You can tell this by the English transition words therefore and hence and it follows and the paper grows more emphatic with the arrival on page 18 of a stampede of oversized II and the square-root signs swell and more cranes fly in followed by a wacky symbol with three horizontal lines like a triple bunk beds or a cheese sandwich and then the exponents rise up stretching like a delicate tree limb of baby leaves until on the final page the equations shorten—hence and therefore—and Daniel modestly concludes: “In fact Theorem 2 is effective.”

Stop.

It’s a symphony. A leaf under a microscope. A dictionary in Italian. If this is the blur Daniel was struggling to bring into focus of course he couldn’t be bothered to fetch his coat.

AFTER A COUPLE hours at the Larsens’ house I’m seeing math everywhere. How many books? The probability that one spring leaf will fall off a tree. Michael laughs and says he probably sees more math in the world than the average person but math “isn’t the key to every lock.”

Daniel interjects explaining this is one reason he’s taking a break from crosswords. “I’d be watching a movie and somebody would say something and I’d think That should be on my word list. I don’t want to be carrying that around all the time.”

I save a couple big-sky questions for last. What’s going to be the biggest problem of your generation? Daniel’s answer relates to why he dislikes cellphones.

“Everything feels very disconnected these days” he says. “Because we’re interacting with people online there is less sense of a community and common purpose and you see people being more selfish because they are not as connected with their environment and I think that’s a major problem. There might be more existential problems but this is a meta problem in that it stops us from addressing other problems.”

He sees this as another wondrous aspect of math. Math can build consensus a rare feat these days.

“If two people have a mathematical disagreement almost always they can konk it out and one of them will say ‘Okay you’re right’ or maybe they were both right but misunderstanding each other.” Daniel tips his head wistful. “In the rest of the world it’s very hard for people to agree on very basic things. I do think the principle of being able to agree on stuff is important.”

Daniel is Jewish and I ask him how someone devoted to proofs sustains religious faith. He jumps to physics. While human life is relatively mundane he’s astonished by the delicate balance of physical laws that make life and matter possible. “Intelligent design” I say. He agrees. “So God is a mathematician?”

“That’s how I like to think about it” he says.

“So you’re doing God’s work?” I ask.

He begs off with a laugh. “I don’t like taking it that far.”

MY LAST question is one I’m rather proud of: “If DANIEL LARSEN is the crossword puzzle answer what would be the clue?”

The lion face on Daniel’s shirt stretches almost seeming to blink. Daniel likes lions because they are majestic and there is something majestic about Daniel a young man who is exceptional but humble who uses his free time to puzzle through problems most of us can barely fathom.

After a moment Daniel gives up. “I should be able to think of something clever but I can’t” he says.

Even a puzzle master is sometimes stumped.

Later I ask Daniel’s father the same question. It takes Michael Larsen only a minute to think up his crossword clue for DANIEL LARSEN one that The New York Times would not accept but that surely comes from the heart: “Person I will miss very much when he goes away next year.”

Will Shortz also plays the game. “What jumps to mind when I hear the name Daniel Larsen? Brilliant young math-loving Hoosier.

A group of university students held the demonstration in front of Iran’s Public Conscription Organization in downtown Tehran.

They were holding placards bearing slogans against the mandatory service such as ""Modern Slavery"" ""Conscripts have no voice"" ""Military service: a factory for manufacturing frustration"" and ""Two years of forced imprisonment.”

Mohammad Eskandari the secretary of the so-called Student Justice Movement – the NGO which had organized the gathering – was arrested during the crackdown.

Many people are critical of the compulsory nature of the service and its physical and psychological pressures on the conscripts which in some cases lead to suicide or violent acts.

In March a young military conscript embarked on a killing spree in one of the barracks in the southern province of Bushehr killing four of his fellow servicemen after his request for leave was denied.

Earlier in the year Iran canceled the buy-out scheme for compulsory military service just one day after it was reported following widespread criticism by citizens and officials. Only wealthy families could afford to buy out their sons military service.

According to Iran’s constitution all men over 18 years old must serve in the military for about two years otherwise they cannot apply for a passport to leave the country. Most are drafted into the traditional Army but some with the right connections serve with the Revolutionary Guard where conditions are much better.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiLmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmF6Y2VudHJhbC5jb20vb2JpdHVhcmllcy9wYXIwNjMxODPSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Nora Leombruno Obituary - The Arizona Republic,"Nora Eileen Leombruno of Scottsdale AZ age 79 passed away on August 22 2022 after a very long and courageous battle with cancer.

However the goal here isn’t just to remember these moments it is to remember the moments leading up to THE moment that overshadowed everything in that game and sometimes the entire series. So let’s travel back in time history and recontextualize some of our favorite Lakers memories in order to fully appreciate their awesomeness.

In the first entry of this series we talked about what happened before and after Derek Fisher’s 0.4 game-winner against the Spurs in the 2004 NBA Playoffs. Now let’s jump into Game 4 of the 2002 Western Conference Finals between the Lakers and Kings — a game that turned on a mounting comeback followed by fireworks and later controversy.

Good things come in threes

This 2001-02 season saw the Lakers pursuing a three-peat as they tried to become the second NBA franchise to do so in the past decade after Michael Jordan’s Bulls did it twice between 1991-93 and 1996-98. Although a Lakers victory at the end of the 2002 NBA Playoffs would have created a new normal in the league of three-peats the occurrence over the league’s history is much more uncommon than it may have seemed in that era.

The San Antonio Spurs never did it. No LeBron James-led team has done it. The Golden State Warriors haven’t done it. In fact other than the Lakers and Bulls the only other franchise to do it is the Boston Celtics who won eight championships in a row from 1959-66 when there were like — I don’t know — three teams in the league?*

*This is barely an exaggeration. There were eight teams in the entire league during the course of that Celtics run.

But if Shaquille O’Neal Kobe Bryant and Phil Jackson (yet again) were to cement their legacies amongst those Bulls and Celtics teams they would have to go through the same road block they had to go through in both of the 2000 and 2001 NBA Playoffs while winning their first two championships.

The Sacramento Kings.

In a deep deep hole

After meeting in the first round of the 2000 playoffs and then the 2001 Western Conference semi-finals the Lakers and Kings took their budding rivalry to the natural next step in the 2002 Western Conference Finals.

The first-seeded Kings owned home-court advantage in the series over the third-seeded Lakers but the Lakers stole that advantage away to open the series. Winning Game 1 marked their 12th straight road playoff win as a franchise but that — as a lot of events within this series — did not last long.

The Kings took Game 2 before pummeling the Lakers in Los Angeles’ Game 3; they held a 75-52 lead heading into the 4th quarter before an OG Laker fake comeback cut the deficit to a baker’s dozen by the game’s end.

As Game 4 got going it seemed like the Lakers were about to lose their chance at a third straight title going down 40-20 in just the 1st-quarter inciting boos from the home crowd at Staples.

Mike Bibby led the way for the Kings in that opening quarter drilling five different mid-range jumpers off of screens leaving Kobe Bryant and Derek Fisher with no answer for the man who would later go viral for pumping a lot of iron. The Lakers didn’t couldn’t muster a potent response on the other end either as the entire team aside from Shaquille O’Neal (4-7 FG) shot terribly from the field (4-20 FG).

In the middle of the action it was indicated by the broadcast team that Chris Webber said something before the game about the Lakers now seeming “human” in their eyes and that “they don’t look at them anymore like superheroes” after meeting them in the playoffs twice before.

While they may have seemed merely mortal to begin the game their powers seemed to be returning as they neared halftime.

The Lakers went on a 16-6 run towards the end of the 2nd quarter with the score ending at 65-48 with just a few seconds before the teams were to head to the locker rooms. But with 4.6 seconds left the Lakers decided they weren’t done.

To cap off the run that turned a probable blowout into a competitive contest the Lakers got some help from one of the unlikeliest candidates in Samaki Walker.

Walker had not attempted a 3-pointer for the Lakers that season and had only attempted five total in the five seasons of his career up to that point. But at this moment he cashed in a near half-court three that would end up being much more important than any of us could have imagined in the moment. At half the Lakers were down 65-51.

The Lakers cut the gap in half in the 3rd quarter outscoring the Kings 22-15 behind some much more ferocious perimeter defense that finally shut Bibby down (for now) while Shaq decided he was going to get deep post position against Vlade Divac again and again and again. The big man had seven points in the frame Kobe had six of his own and the Lakers cut the Kings’ lead to seven with one last chance to save their season on the brink.

The Kings of the 1st quarter returned for the closing quarter with some more help from that pesky Mike Bibby. Spamming the same screens he leveraged over and over at the beginning of the game Bibby drilled another deep 2-pointer to make it 94-86 with only 4:36 left.

To continue this comeback the Lakers got some help from Shaq in a surprising way: free-throws. He notched a perfect 6-6 on free throws in the 4th quarter including two to make it 94-88 and then two more to make it 98-97 with 26.9 seconds left.

But he wasn’t the only player on the Lakers putting the team on his back.

Big Shot Rob

In terms of shooting Robert Horry was nowhere to be found for the first three quarters. He had only taken three field goals in that time missing his lone 3-point attempt. He did have 11 rebounds and five assists though proving that he could always do what was needed out of a role player alongside Shaq and Kobe.

But in the 4th quarter Horry came through again proving why Lakers fans still fondly refer to him as “Big Shot Rob.”

He made two 3-pointers including one that the Lakers desperately needed to make it a 96-93 Kings lead with only 1:39 left in the game.

Divac answered with a long 2-point jump shot to stretch the Kings’ lead to 98-93 with 1:17 left but after Shaq’s clutch free throws Divac missed the one of two that could have made it a three-point game for the Lakers with 11.8 seconds left.

Somehow not only was the door open for the Lakers to send this game into overtime after being down by so many points heading into halftime they could win it with a 3-pointer down just a pair.

The Lakers didn’t necessarily need a miracle to come away with the win but they got one anyways...

Big Fix Tim

The Lakers and Kings weren’t done with dramatic endings yet in the series. After Horry evened the series at 2-2 Kobe missed a game-winner in Sacramento’s Game 5 with the Kings again taking the series lead on a 92-91 victory. Luckily the Lakers would win the next two games and advance to the 2002 NBA Finals where they would then complete the three-peat via a four-game sweep of the New Jersey Nets.

And while Horry’s heroics may have been the biggest storyline for Lakers fans the Kings’ supporters were hung up on one of the most contested NBA sub-plots in recent memory.

If you don’t know Donaghy he was an NBA referee who resigned in 2007 and would later be found guilty in the federal courts for gambling on and fixing NBA games.

In that trial and in the media during the time Donaghy widely claimed that Game 6 of that Lakers-Kings series was fixed for the Lakers to win behind two of the three officials of the game (Donaghy was not working any of these games) wanting a Game 7 while Commissioner David Stern wanted the Lakers in the Finals due to the Lakers having a drastically bigger market than the Kings.

Look I’m not here to analyze whether this is true or not. In fact I like to live in a state of ignorance regarding it at all times. Now with that said there was a disparity between the Lakers and Kings’ free-throw attempts during the final quarter of that Game 6 of 27 to 9. Donaghy specifically called this quarter out in interviews.

I’m just here to talk about how awesome Horry is. If you want to do some investigations yourself check out this video of the full 4th quarter of that Game 6 which I reluctantly admit does feature some questionable calls.

Ice in his Veins

Even though Fisher’s 0.4 second game-winner is still up there if not right behind Horry’s shot against the Kings in terms of my all-time favorite Lakers moments Horry’s still reigns supreme due to the circumstances of the series and of course the fact that it came against the Kings.

Horry had already earned the nickname “Big Shot Rob” at that point but this really cemented his status as one of the clutchest shooters in NBA history and is easily his most memorable game-winner. It saved the Lakers’ chances at a three-peat endearing himself to the fanbase forever and paved the way to his current connection with the franchise as a studio host on Spectrum SportsNet’s coverage of the team.

Just like you can’t talk about the Shaq and Kobe era without mentioning the likes of Derek Fisher and Phil Jackson you can’t forget Big Shot Rob.

Kounde enjoyed an impressive first league appearance for Barca.

Half-PPR League,"There is a lot of hype about drafting at either the beginning (picks 1-3) or the end (picks 10-12) in your fantasy drafts. In the first round at the top you get either Christian McCaffrey Jonathan Taylor or Austin Ekeler while at the bottom you can snag two top running backs a top 3-5 wide receiver or a premier tight end like Travis Kelce. Later in drafts you can dictate when a positional run will happen by drafting a tight end or quarterback you want in the early to mid-rounds. This is probably the downside of drafting in the middle of your draft order as you won’t have the luxury of any of the above options. However if you secured the eighth pick in your upcoming draft don’t worry we got you covered.

The biggest pro early on in your drafts when drafting from the eighth spot is you will likely either get your top dark horse RB1 or a difference-making wide receiver. In a lot of Yahoo! half-PPR drafts picks 1-7 go running back heavy. In some cases you could see seven running backs taken. In that scenario you can snag a wide receiver like Cooper Kupp Ja’Marr Chase or Justin Jefferson. The more likely scenario is a balance of roughly five running backs and two wide receivers. When that happens you can typically pull the trigger on your favorite running back. Later in drafts when drafting in the middle you get a unique perspective on how the draft is going.

You can dictate your picks by seeing which teams before and after you have which types of positions. For example let’s say you’re in Round 7 (pick 79) and teams 8-12 already drafted their tight end. Instead of drafting a Dallas Goedert in that range you can probably wait until Round 8 since you know in a single tight end league most people will not draft a second tight end that early as a flex. This philosophy could be utilized for any position and will help you get more value in the middle and late rounds.

In this article I will walk through a perfect draft with the eighth pick in a 12-team Yahoo half-PPR league. Each pick was optimized using projections and value-based rankings from the 4for4 Draft Analyzer tool.

Round 1 Pick 8 (8) – RB Joe Mixon  Bengals

At 1.08 the draft went pretty much as expected with four running backs and three wide receivers coming off the board in picks 1-7. This brings us to the scenario that we discussed at the top of the article where you have the option of grabbing your favorite late first-round running back with this pick.

It was clear that running back was the way to go here as the draft analyzer offered five options that were all running backs. This included Najee Harris Joe Mixon Aaron Jones Dalvin Cook and D’Andre Swift. Swift was in consideration here as he had a strong start to 2021. In the first 10 games before his injury Swift averaged 16-half PPR PPG. That would have made him the RB6 in 2021. The Lions bring back all five of their offensive linemen and currently are ranked as a top-five unit on 4for4.com

The player I went with was Joe Mixon. Mixon is a rock-solid pick in Round 1 as he offers both a safe floor and a newfound ceiling in Cincinnati. His floor comes from his elite usage as he was one of only eight running backs in 2021 to average 20 touches a game. His ceiling comes from being tied to an acceding offense with a generational talent at quarterback behind a revamped Bengals offensive line that added three starters this off-season. All these factors should allow Mixon to build off a very strong second half of 2021 where he averaged 18.3 half-PPR PPG over the final eight games.

In each round Draft Analyzer suggests the top available suggestion along with four alternatives as shown at the top of this section. Throughout the rest of the article I will note those suggestions as well as my top alternative to the player that I actually selected.

Suggested Alternatives: Joe Mixon Najee Harris D’Andre Swift Aaron Jones and Leonard Fournette

Coresight Research reports 4432 new store openings compared to 1954 store closures equaling a net gain of more than 49 million square feet of new retail space.

Store closures have slowed since the same period of 2021 when retailers announced 4130 closures. Store expansion also slowed from a year ago with 4554 new store announcements.

Analysts said many retailers seek to right-size store holdings which may mean a mix of closures and openings. Retailers are also experimenting with new formats as shopping behaviors continue to evolve.

Athleisure specialty retailer Athleta owned by Gap is among those adding stores in 2022. Athleta said it’s on track to open up to 40 new locations this year including its first two outlet stores in Chicago this summer and Leesburg Va. scheduled to open this fall. The outlet locations aim to reach new customers looking for value in at-leisure apparel.

“Our new outlet stores are intentionally designed to stand out from traditional outlet and clearance store models helping drive new customer acquisition and increased brand awareness for Athleta” said CEO Mary Beth Laughton.

The off-price retail sector is also expanding with more stores this year. TJX announced plans to open 150 new TJ Maxx stores in 2022 in the U.S. on a base of nearly 4700 stores. Burlington plans to open 90 new stores on a base of about 840 stores and Ross Stores plans to open 75 Ross Dress for Less Stores and 25 of the DD’s Discount banners this year on a base of more than 1900 total stores. Ross opened 65 U.S. stores in the last year.

Earlier this year discounter Five Below outlined an aggressive new store plan with 1000 new locations by 2025. The plans called for between 375 and 400 new brick-and-mortar stores this year and next with the balance of stores opening in 2024. Former Walmart executive Joel Anderson is the CEO at Five Below. He said that the business was well positioned in June from an inventory standpoint with improved in-stocks and accelerated receipts for summer and back to school.

“With the planned openings and conversions in scale this year we are on track to end the year with nearly half of our stores in the new Five Beyond format. We are capitalizing on real-time opportunities in the marketplace including merchandise and real estate while piloting new products and services that embody the rituals of life and milestones of growing up” Anderson said.

He said the macro environment looks challenging through the balance of 2022. Coresight CEO Deborah Weinswig said discounters like Five Below should be in a strong position if the economy slows.

“Shoppers watching their budget can still feel good about themselves when they find bargains at $5” Weinswig said.

The dollar store segment leads the retail sector in new store announcements again this year. Goodlettsville Tenn.-based Dollar General plans to open 1102 stores this year. That will equal 11.7 million new square feet of retail square footage. Dollar General is also experimenting with a new format called Popshelf a concept that offers accessories decor cosmetics party items and household supplies at prices of $5 or below. The first 30 Popshelf stores opened last year with more than 200 new locations on tap this year.

Virginia-based Dollar Tree also has a growth plan to add 590 new stores with 800 Family Dollar renovations this year. Dollar Tree is experimenting with a Family Dollar-Dollar Tree combo format in rural south Arkansas areas like Lake Village and Hope. The company said 350 new Family Dollar stores would be the combo format.

Walmart is also experimenting with a new store format in a partnership with hospitality group Getaway for tiny general stores at campsites across the country. The first Walmart general store is slated to open in September in Wimberly Texas south of Austin. Walmart said the partnership also plans for general stores in Moodus Conn. Running Springs Calif. Roscoe N.Y. and Osceola Mo.

The “General Stores” concept will be on wheels in small wooden slope-roofed cabins. Walmart’s name and starburst logo are in yellow in smaller print under signage saying The General Store. The store’s tote bags say “Quality Goods Great Outdoors” with Walmart in a smaller font. Inside are rustic wooden shelves displaying a small heavily curated selection of goods.

“Walmart’s partnership with Getaway furthers our mission to help people live better no matter where they are” said Casey Schlaybaugh vice president of brand marketing for Walmart U.S. “We are going beyond just saving people money by enabling guests to maximize Getaway’s experience and empowering them to spend more quality time with those who matter most.”

Items sold at The General Store will also be sold on Walmart.com via a particular Getaway shopping page. And those who visit Outpost over the next year will receive a free trial of the retailer’s membership program Walmart+ the retailer announced on July 28.

“In partnering with Walmart we are able to amplify our efforts to a larger audience and provide our guests with more free time helping them prepare for their stays and enjoy the comforts of nature once they arrive” said Carlos Becil chief experience officer at Getaway.

Discounter Big Lots also plans to open 50 new stores this year including one in Rogers at 210 S. Promenade Blvd. Like many of the recent Big Lots locations planned this year the Rogers location which opened in May is a new format that features furniture and home furnishings including patio and other outdoor items. The new format does not sell consumables fashion or health and beauty aids like a traditional Big Lots format. The company has roughly 1400 stores in 47 states.

Big Lots typically sells closeouts at a reduced price to traditional retail. The chain has struggled with inventory shortfalls amid the supply chain challenges of the past couple of years but said it will continue to invest in the new format and add 500 stores by 2030.

Few houses in this city that can boast having had their walls covered in 108 different patterns of wallpaper.

But this home has been around for a long long time and over the decades its walls have been redecorated scores of times as evidenced by layers of wallpaper that have been painstakingly “excavated” like the various strata in an archaeological dig.

The walls of Ross Bay Villa were originally wallpapered when the home was built in 1865 but those walls were re-papered again in 1875 1880 1900 and 1940 — and who knows if there were other years when improvements were made over time.

These numerous layers of paper were likely due to the fact that 150 years ago such homes were heated by sooty coal and were frequented by men who were typically smoking cigars which quickly stained the walls.

“The villa has changed significantly over the years. It has matured and evolved” said longtime volunteer and former board member Nick Russell who believes it is now “in its prime” with the gardens looking gorgeous at this time of year.

The flowerbeds have been meticulously redesigned and replanted in the style of the era with all the flowers bushes and vegetables being ones that were available in Victoria in the 1860s according to early catalogues including dahlias lavender lobelia cosmos climbing roses honeysuckle sweet peas and more.

Ross Bay Villa 1490 Fairfield Rd. is one of four unique historic Victoria houses featured as part of a series in the Times Colonist with the next three focusing on Point Ellice Wentworth Villa and Carr House in future editions of the Homes section.

Each home has its own fascinating story to tell not only about its distinctive style and character and who lived there but also about the outstanding effort and creative energy that went into its restoration.

Russell a self-professed “heritage hugger” who has also renovated three of his own old homes noted that uncovering so many layers of wallpaper was just one of many surprises that the project enjoyed — both from a design and an historic standpoint.

Some of the other surprises that encouraged volunteers during the past 22 years of restoration were finding an itemized list of furniture that once belonged to the house and a diary that was kept by Anna Letitia wife of Frances James Roscoe.

The Roscoes were the original owners and lived there for more than a dozen years before he suddenly died at age 48 and his wife decided to leave Victoria and take the children back to England.

While the diary covers only two years it has been a tremendous source of information about the house and the couple’s lifestyle.

It was discovered after volunteers tracked down a descendent of the original family an American man who was totally unaware of his ancestral home here. He decided to come for a visit and brought the diary with him to everyone’s delight.

The list of contents was another treasure.

It appeared in the Daily Colonist when Letitia decided to sell the home. She ran an ad in the classified section to advertise an auction dated Jan. 8 1879. This provided a detailed list of everything the home contained from mirrors and tea service to a “breech loading shot-gun pony Phaeton and Singer sewing machine.”

“It was like finding gold” said Russell who added that over the years the volunteers have gradually managed to hunt down almost every item on the list including linens china furniture stoves and more.

A pony cow and carriage were not something they decided to pursue but they did recently find perfect stove for the front hall. It is dated from the 1860s and was built by Albion Iron Works a company that created boilers and steam engines for this city’s early steamship construction industry.

Russell also proudly pointed to a beautiful antique John Broadwood piano in rosewood which is of the exact era and style to match the original.

Finding the furnishings crockery artworks and more is icing on the cake and follows many years of hard labour during which the volunteers restored the home itself under the guidance of Davyd McMinn a professional heritage carpenter who led the structural work.

“We’ve have some incredible volunteers over the years probably 100 or more of them” said Russell. “It’s amazing how this project attracts talent.”

Board chair Simone Vogel Horridge is an oil painting restoration expert. “She is amazing and was able to identify the layers and layers of wall paper removed from the walls or peeled off door frames. She helped set up a silk screen to print replicas in the home’s former master bedroom now a multi purpose room.

“Simone is also an incredible researcher who spends nights on the computer. She is the one who found the great-great-great grandson of the Roscoes in Chicago.”

Another volunteer Royal B.C. Museum professional textile conservator Colleen Wilson has created replicas of clothing that would have been worn at the time so volunteers can don them for special occasions. She also spent scores of hours making doll clothes in addition to the life-size wardrobe replicas for volunteers.

John Veillette is another gem said Russell.

A former collections manager at the Royal B.C. “John is wonderful at finding furnishings that are appropriate to the house. Absolutely right for the 1860s.”

Veillette combs through garage sales auctions antique stores and more looking for treasures while other volunteers show up to garden or mould and paint fruits and vegetables for table displays.

All this is important because while the home pays no property taxes it receives no public funding. It has been lovingly restored and is now maintained by a team of keen people and is supported by small events.

The historic villa is open to the public for bookable tours on Saturdays and group tours any time. It hosts fundraisers such as weddings workshops concerts and lectures garden parties and even the occasional wake. The Villa also receives rent from the Old Cemeteries Ross Bay Society which has its office in the building.

Other funds are raised through a pop-up gift shop on Saturdays and a beautiful book that outlines the history of the home. More information at rossbayvilla.org.",,,,,,,,,

HMS Prince of Wales will cross the Atlantic with her task group ready to push the boundaries of uncrewed technology and the tactics used by the UK’s two new Queen Elizabeth-class carriers.

Along with notable port stops in New York Halifax in Canada and the Caribbean the next three months will see the Prince of Wales task group work closely with US allies operating F-35B jets and uncrewed systems which will define Royal Navy aviation of the future.

With fleet flagship HMS Queen Elizabeth also set to deploy to the Mediterranean and Baltic this autumn at the heart of a potent Royal Navy task group it will mean both UK aircraft carriers will be operating F-35B jets thousands of miles apart.

Commanding Officer Captain Richard Hewitt said: “Taking the HMS Prince of Wales task group across the Atlantic for the rest of this year will not only push the boundaries of UK carrier operations but will reinforce our close working relationship with our closest Ally.

“From operating the F35 Lightnings and drones to hosting the Atlantic Future Forum none of this would be possible without the efforts of the amazing sailors on board many of which are on their first deployment with the Royal Navy.”

The 65000-tonne warship deploys initially alongside frigate HMS Richmond tanker RFA Tideforce and an air group of helicopters and drones before F-35B stealth fighters join the deployment once the ship arrives in North America for the Westlant 22 deployment.

“I’m really looking forward to seeing the United States especially New York from the flight deck of an aircraft carrier. Getting the jets on board will definitely be a highlight and operating on the deck with them” said 23-year-old Able Seaman Owen Cooper an aircraft handler.",,,,,,

""What a s--- show of a job you have!"" comedian Josh Ocean Thomas said in response.

Thomas a San Diego native who moved to the Midwest to pursue comedy shared a clip of the exchange during his recent set at The Laugh Factory in Chicago on Instagram earlier this week where it has gone viral.

""You work for the Biden administration? Is your job to wake him up or what’s your job?"" Ocean asked ""Nick"" as the audience erupted into laughter.

BIDEN VOWS TO WITHHOLD WEAPONS FROM ISRAEL IF NETANYAHU GOES FORWARD WITH RAFAH INVASION

Miming a fictional Biden staffer trying to get the president’s attention he exclaimed ""Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! There’s a war! Hey!""

The bit continued with Thomas asking Nick what he really does for Biden. Before he could respond the comic remarked ""What a s--- show of a job you have. I can’t believe you admitted that in front of all these people.""

""You have the freedom to lie. You could have said you were a hooker and I would’ve been prouder of you"" he added.

The alleged Biden staffer started to tell Thomas that he travels to southern states before the comic interrupted with a burst of laughter.

""That’s crazy! You go to the south and try to sell ‘em on Biden? You’re f----- r------! What the f---? What are you talking about?"" he said. ""That’s your f----- job? Is to go ‘Hey listen I know you guys like Trump but Biden. I mean…’""

BIDEN WARNS NETANYAHU AGAINST RAFAH INVASION AS ISRAEL PREPARES FOR ACTION

The clip ended with one last joke as Thomas asked ""Wow. Are you ready to be unemployed? Or what’s your vibe?""

Thomas captioned the video writing ""This was my only option.""

Thomas wasn't the only comic to take aim at Biden this week.

Anti-Trump comedian Michael Rapaport torched the president in a video he shared to X on Thursday in which he officially declared he would not be supporting Biden’s re-election after the world leader told CNN he would not send weapons to Israel if it invades Rafah Hamas' last stronghold in Gaza.

He also enjoyed making his rounds on the farm in his golf cart. He built a go kart for his children and it has gone through all the grandchildren and now great grandchildren. It has been one of the many highlights of the kids going to the farm. Pete enjoyed his annual fishing trips with family and his many buddies over the years as well as spending time with family at the cabin at Red Willow.

Pete and Donna met at a dance in Calio and on November 19th 1956 were married at St. Boniface Catholic Church in Calio. They attended church in Calio and later St. Mary’s Catholic Church in Munich. Throughout their married years they were on the dance floor often dancing to their treasured waltzes and polkas. In later years they loved listening to the Sayler’s Polka Place music every Sunday afternoon and looked forward to occasional trips to the casino.

Pete was an active member of St. Boniface and St. Mary’s Catholic Church and was a life member of the Knights of Columbus.

Pete is survived by his beloved wife of 67 years Donna their children and spouses Dean (Kim) Laturnus Munich Daryl (Sandy Hendrickson) Laturnus Munich Dennis (Lori) Laturnus Grand Forks Steve (Donna) Laturnus Grand Forks and Bonnie (Alvin) Wald Bismarck along with 11 grandchildren; Deanna (Jeff) Heidi (Troy) Kayla (Brant); Amanda (Tyler); Justin (Jessica) Rebecca (Justin) Matthew (special friend Emily); Mitchel Conner Emma Dominic and 14 great grandchildren sister-in-law Helen Laturnus and many nieces and nephews.

Russians to celebrate WWII victory on Vienna‘s streets. Ukraine asks authorities to ban events.

ADVERTISEMENT

Hundreds of Russians marched through Vienna to celebrate the victory over Nazi Germany. Ukraine had asked Austria's authorities to ban the anniversary celebrations without success. Some of the participants were highly critical of Europe and Ukraine.

Just like in previous years Ukraine was again unable to obtain a ban on this event in Vienna. According to the Ukrainian embassy this celebration is anti-democratic and a mockery of all Ukrainians who are currently dying in the Russian war in Ukraine.

A Ukrainian protest was held right next to the anniversary celebration. Tetiana Bilyk a Viennese resident from Ukraine said: ‘We must mourn but not celebrate. There is nothing to celebrate. We must remember the victims and not spread Putin's propaganda. This is Putin's propaganda. He is abusing this important day.’

Leeds students interested in environmental and social impact intern with some of the most innovative and forward-thinking organizations. For both undergraduates pursuing the Social Responsibility and Ethics Certificate (SRE) and MBAs these internships build on their courses and on their co-curricular engagement with the Center for Ethics and Social Responsibilty (CESR) and provide valuable opportunities that advance their careers.

Every year the Center for Ethics and Social Responsibilty (CESR) at Leeds works with students who are focused on business responsibility for environmental solutions ethical leadership and postive social impact. We support students through programs that build skills and knowledge encourage networking and offer career advice. Learn about how some of our students spent their summer and how Leeds classes and experiential learning programs support their success.

Maddie Barrett (BS'23 SRE Certificate) Product Circularity Intern Seagate Technologies Seagate's Product Circularity program enables end-users and large business like OEMs and CSPs to recycle dispose of and re-new hard drives so their product life cycle can be extended.



The most challenging part was creating marketing materials and campaign materials for a competitive market. I wrote a positioning framework by conducting a SWAT analysis and orienting the program towards large B2B organizations.



My project ran through multiple organizations and I collaborated with different teams. Leeds has prepared me to function in a team overcome problems and face challenges. Consistent group work is what the business world will look like no matter where you end up.



Product marketing enables me to work on materials that can predict the success or the failure of a product. I love writing and organizing case studies solution briefs and developing relationships with partners that make all of that possible. I will be continuing with Seagate throughout my senior year and can’t wait to see what happens next! Mikah Anderson (BS'23 SRE Certificate) Circular Economy and ESG Activation intern at Hewlett Packard Enterprise This summer I created a gap analysis for my company's circular economy program. This project was inclusive of the internal circular economy programs and external opportunities for improvement from competitors. I also worked on a geo-specific materiality project to determine geographies with high feasibility of increasing sustainability solutions. The last major project I worked on was creating talking points about the company's sustainability strategy for customers investors and other stakeholders. My biggest learning was about how geographies impact and interact with the ESG strategies practices and material topics a company may be interested in. Leeds courses that improved my communication skills served me the best. There is a specific formality and vocabulary necessary in writing emails investor documents and internal documents that was required at HPE. I learned that my career goals align with having both ESG reporting and more technical environmental work. I know that I want to woek at a high level in sustainability management and my experience at HPE opened my eyes to different avenues to making that possible.



Evan Anderson (BS'Winter22) Investment Banking Summer Analyst - Consumer Group Piper Sandler

I worked on the Food & Bev industry as well as with the Agriculture Landscape group both of which were interested in sustainbility. I learned a lot in this role about professional communication and how to operate within the expectations set by a team. I also learned how to put together presentation materials from analytical and qualitative materials.

The hardest part was having to familiarize myself with a topic and then turning around to produce materials for it on a tight deadline. This taught me how to utilize my resources most efficiently and how to identify crucial information quickly.

The extracurriculars at Leeds are very helpful for creating professional networks gaining additional skills and specializing in interests. I’ve had several roles within Leeds include serving as a student club executive and am in my second year as Research Assistant at CESR. These contributed to landing the internship and to my success. I also had the support of a mentor through Leeds who helped me prepare and made introductions.

The great part about an internship is being able to confirm your interests and career goals. As a student you have to think about what you want to do in the future for a long time before you actually get there and try it out. It was good to know that I liked the job I thought I’ve wanted since the beginning of college. I also learned my work style which I believe is a HUGE part of success in a job. This experience showed me that I can have high ambitions and achieve them..

Michelle Lishnevsky (MBA'23) and Sonya Query(MBA'23) Board Fellows Naturally Boulder Board Fellows is a student-run MBA club that pairs graduate students with nonprofit partners. As Naturally Boulder's Board Fellows we worked on optimizing the organization's social media accounts including an audit of their current strategies. We presented our project to the board which allowed us to interact with them in a meaningful way to see how the board voted on our recommendations and then begin implementation. Being a Board Fellow helped us get to know people in the industry at all levels. We sat in on board meetings as non-voting members and got a look at the industry from the perspective of its leaders. One of the biggest challenges was being on Zoom and it was interesting to see how board members interacted with each other. This opportunity came through a strategic partnership between CESR and Naturally Boulder. Our classes helped prepare us to communicate effectively and present our work in a meaningful way. We will be Board Fellows for the remainder of the year.

Tyler Phillips (MBA'23) Summer Associate with General Motors Ventures GM's Corporate Venture Capital Fund My assignment was to assess the battery startup landscape from an investment perspective to aid in GM's overall EV Battery investment strategy.



I learned that even in large established companies it's possible to make a strong contribution to a team in a short amount of time. However I worked extra hard (some weekends) to make sure that I delivered real value throughout my experience.



Leeds - specifically Professors Gregg Macaluso and Chris Imamura of Supply Chain - gave me great practice building decks and presenting to a mock executive audience. I ended up presenting my research to the Chief Technology Officer at GM who took it to Mary Barra the CEO! I made sure that my presentation ""hooked them in the first 30 seconds"" as Professor Gregg would say.



My internship validated my passion for renewables specifically around e-mobility and battery electric vehicles. I am hoping to continue the work I started in the battery space with an established OEM (or new EV maker) to help inform their battery strategy.

Zachary Salinger (MBA'23) David & Lucille Packard Foundation MBA Fellow at the Climate Breakthrough Project My biggest learning this summer was that nonprofits are restricted in their ability to innovate because of funding. 80% of the time a nonprofit receives funding they can only use it for pre-designated expenses. This eliminates their ability to pivot which is needed for innovation and meaningful breakthroughs. Entrepreneurs know that the first idea is hardly ever perfect but nonprofits are being restricted.



The hardest thing about my position was wrapping my head around moonshot climate mitigation strategies. There is a disconnect between the private and public sector in how to address climate change. Creating solutions requires technological innovation and favorable policy that incentivizes entrepreneurs. In our current world fraught with energy food and supply-chain issues it is difficult to find a balance between economic feasibility and sustainability.



The first year of my MBA gave me the project management skills needed to effectively work with my colleagues. Many classes in the first year required learning how to effectively run a meeting and finish deliverables in a short period of time.



This fellowship changed my perspective on the nonprofit and climate philanthropy industry while also allowing me to see its immense complexity. It spurred an interest in the holistic ways the public and private sector can work together to tackle climate change

McKiernan Flaherty (MBA'23) Store Executive Intern Target's leadership development program My greatest takeaway this summer was how dynamic the retail industry has become. It is constantly growing and changing making every day unique. As for the most challenging part of my internship it would have to be the rotational nature as it pushed me to assess situations isolate complications and then take actions to drive results quickly before moving on to my next project.



My first year at Leeds School of Business prepared me to succeed in this role by providing me with a strong foundation in business analytics operations accounting finance strategy and marketing. Furthermore I would say my ability to deal with ambiguity build relationships and prioritize among competing deliverables enabled my projects to excel at Target. Along with these skills maintaining a growth mindset and leading with enthusiasm allowed me to flourish professionally.



At Target this summer I learned that I am capable of supporting a growing multi-billion dollar business influencing multiple levels of stakeholders and managing teams on complex projects across the enterprise. Also after this experience I have ultimately come to realize that I desire to have a multi-disciplinary career in the retail industry for a company that focuses on joy and families.

Sibanjan Das made a decision that along the way had a significant impact on his career choosing the latter option. When he started in Data Science/Machine Learning it was a relatively new area. But the journey since then has been equally challenging and rewarding.

Sibanjan shared his experiences to emphasize how crucial decision-making is in life. He says “Few decisions worked well for me and few didn’t. But life is all about making choices and once you choose stay with it. There is no going back. Perseverance is the key.”

Journey as a Leader in Data Science

Being a leader in the Data Science field has been a fun roller coaster ride for Sibanjan. He started as an engineer for ERP systems then became a business analyst for the Order to cash processes. A few years later he felt he was missing the other leg of Enterprise IT and transitioned into an analytics consultant role. He finally landed as a Data Scientist in 2013. But things never look that easy when you want to transition between different departments as it takes effort courage sacrifice and some hard decisions to make.

One of those decisions was Sibanjan quitting his job to study further in the area of Information systems and analytics when he was being offered to go United states as a consultant. He had decided to try the unknown and no lucrative offers could stop him. When he started in Data Science/Machine Learning it was a relatively new area. His focus was always to work in the field of Analytics and he tried to get into a functional analytics role. He landed up in the field of Machine Learning unintentionally. But the journey since then has been equally challenging and rewarding as well.

When Sibanjan started learning Machine learning he always had thought about how to inject Machine Learning into the workflows in ERP systems. Oracle ERP was always his den and he kept on trying and exploring things to make this a possibility.

Things didn’t work out well until Sibanjan got a chance to work with Oracle on precisely what he wanted. He never wanted to miss this opportunity and gave in all to design that product. His previous business processes skills Oracle ERP technical knowledge and ML skillset all came in together to do some justice to the responsibility that the organization gave him.

The happiest moment was when he saw the modules that he designed and developed were released as a part of general availability and are mentioned in the product user guides. But during this time he had already resigned not because of Oracle but for Analytics. He loves product development but he wanted to be part of the enterprise analytics team for a long.

But during this time again he was offered to move into Toshiba US as a Microsoft BI consultant. And yet again he didn’t go to the United States even when he had an H1B visa and was already stamped for travel. This was the second time he had rejected the travel. His friends complained that he was killing his growth. It’s not the case that he never wanted to go. But for him the work was more important than the location.

Today when he looks back then he thinks he made the best decision. ServiceNow is a great organization to work with. The leadership there is terrific with great people and enthusiastic teams. When Sibanjan joined ServiceNow he joined as a business insight analyst within the Data and Analytics team. He believed this role was an apt role for him as this is an intersection of business and data science. But a few months after he felt that the Data Science team within the same Data and Analytics team did the work he could do best.

Going the Extra Mile

During one of his conversations with his leader Brian Hoffman Sibanjan expressed his interest in working with the Data Science team. He never said no but he didn’t commit to taking him on his team either because he didn’t know him. So he started testing him and asking him to solve some problems. He also challenged him with some more complex problems day after day.

Little did he know Sibanjan had made up his mind about a do-or-die situation. He started working on two shifts – doing the work for Business insights during regular office hours and Data science work in the evenings. This continued consistently for a few months until one evening when Brian became tired and said “Sibanjan it’s time for you to officially join the Data Science team.” Five years later when Brian and Sibanjan remember these events they laugh thinking of those days.

Sibanjan also advises “Try to focus on things you can control. Don’t focus on something not in your control as it will burn you out. Being an Indian like the rest of India I am a fan of cricket. In cricket there are batsmen bowlers and fielders. If you are a bowler and start thinking much about the skillset of the batsman you lose your focus and he might hit your ball hard. Focus on your bowling. Don’t think much about the batsman. He is there to bat and is thinking about how to hit your ball. Fielders are ready to save runs. Fielders might miss a catch and you feel bad about it. But should you feel bad? Yes but for yourself. Your aim should be to bowl him out hitting the stumps directly. If you can’t do that don’t blame the fielder or batsman. Do things that you can do don’t think about conditions beyond your control.”

The Company’s Impact

For Sibanjan the impact is a magic word. He shares one of the many things that he likes about ServiceNow: people love creating solutions for complex problems and enjoy making them successful. The ServiceNow team likes solving challenging problems and always strives to improve yearly.

Sibanjan believes “There are very few companies in the world who think about their growth and their customer’s growth and success. ServiceNow is one of them and they are at the forefront. And I am not saying this because I am a ServiceNow employee. I have truly felt this in ServiceNow. ServiceNow always has a positive vibe and focuses on making customers employees and the community successful. There is always a “people” touch in everything they do at ServiceNow.”

A Piece of Advice for Aspiring Professionals

Sibanjan believes that leadership is a generalized term. It’s a responsibility to help grow your organization and support the team which starts with you. If you have never made your own decisions and worked on your priorities you might not be in a position to make decisions for your team and organization when you are a leader. Can someone make decisions that will impact organization and individual’s life career and growth when they have never decided for themselves?

Secondly Sibanjan talks about empathy. One needs to feel for their people and consider them as their own. He expresses “My heart goes out to people who are loyal and strive to be a better version of themselves every day. When I say “loyal” it doesn’t mean following orders but being dedicated to the commitments and things that they sign up for. Being a leader we should try to make them successful and more importantly see them happy.”

The third is trust. Sibanjan thinks trust is the thrust that keeps driving a team forward and achieving its goals. The great thing that he learned from ServiceNow is servant leadership. Sibanjan clarifies “Let me be honest here; I am not a leader yet. What I was speaking here is something I learned along the way and from our leadership team who backs me up with the decisions I make. I am just someone working daily to see everyone happy – My family colleagues team and organization. I try every possible way to have people around me happy and prosperous. I will consider myself successful as a leader only when I bring a positive impact on the world and community. ServiceNow provides me that platform and so I am here driving our vision – doing work work better for people and creating a platform that makes work flow.”",,,,,,,,,,,,

Pick a color any color. It's COTY Time. Every year about now top paint companies announce their Color of The Year their best guess at what the ""in"" color is about to be.

Start the drumroll.

While I don't believe for a minute that these announcements are much more than a public relations ploy to make consumers think about color and maybe buy paint which they do or these companies wouldn't keep doing this and while I have never actually gone out and painted a room in my home one of the anointed colors I love to look. The color experts' choices help me tune into how colors move in and out of style. And colors do move.

The first COTY announcement came earlier this month when HGTV Home by Sherwin-Williams picked ""Darkroom"" (HGSW 7083) a black with a purple undertone. Among the words the accompanying news release used to describe it were ""alluring"" ""classic"" and ""modernly retro for the throw-back inspired aesthetic."" My Darkroom reaction: Uhh maybe if I were doing a home for Morticia Addams.

A week later Glidden Paint by PPG pronounced Vining Ivy (PPG1148-6) a bluish-green tone as its 2023 COTY. ""Consumers are seeking to simplify in this post-covid era as the past two years have shed a new light on the importance of serenity and little moments"" said Ashley McCollum Glidden color expert in the news release. ""Vining Ivy embodies this vibe perfectly.""

I'm not sure what teal has to do with little moments but I prefer Vining Ivy to Darkroom.

A few days later the Sherwin-Williams 2023 Colormix Forecast came out. Don't confuse like I did HGTV Home by Sherwin-Williams a product line sold at Lowe's with the broader Sherwin-Williams brand which sells its paints through Sherwin-Williams stores and has its own COTY. As if color weren't complicated enough.

Sherwin-Williams named its 2023 Colormix Forecast Terra ""because it's about nature and our connection to earth as humans."" OK if you say so. The forecast features 40 colors divided into four curated palettes from which the company's COTY will emerge in late September said Sue Wadden the brand's director of color marketing.

Every year color forecasters from around the world meet to discuss what is going on globally ─ socially artistically politically ─ then predict what hues consumers will have a hankering for. For 2023 top picks include HGTV Home by Sherwin Williams Darkroom (HGSW 7083). (Courtesy of Sherwin-Williams)

I try to get her to spill which paint color she's leaning toward but all she'll say is that it's on the warm side. Well that narrows it down.

However what I really want to know from this woman who thinks about color all day every day and travels the world to observe color then talks to others who do the same besides how to get a job like that was not the color of the moment of the day or of the year but rather color trends for the long term like say the next 10 years.

In other words don't give me your flash-in-the-pan-fun-for-a-second color but colors we can count on reliably design around.

So I grabbed a cup of coffee and asked Wadden all the questions I selfishly wanted to know:

Marni: For those of us homeowners who want to make interior design choices that have staying power which colors should we walk away from and toward?

Wadden: Walk away from gray. I'm not saying gray is bad but it has had a really long cycle and the natural evolution is to move away. Walk toward warmer neutrals that have a little range like bone beige and greige. Go toward natural earth tones like terracotta and sand. Run toward brown.

Dark grayed-out purples and rich plums especially alongside super light tinted shades will be important. But the strongest color of the future is green.

Marni: What is having the biggest influence on color trends now?

Wadden: The opening up of our world post pandemic. After months of lock down and restricted travel we crave nature. We're moving toward darker colors. We're not painting everything white and gray anymore.

Marni: Kitchens are such an investment a place where you really want a look that lasts. What do you recommend there?

Wadden: On counters we're not seeing much outside of white or creamy white but we are getting away from kitchens that are white counters on white or gray cabinets. I always like the tuxedo look light counters over dark cabinets in timeless colors like carbon gray deep blue or forest green.

Marni: What color advice can you give all those who have gray on gray homes? How can they move on with color?

Wadden: They don't have to change everything out. They can look to the color trends as an opportunity to introduce a fresh color maybe a vibrant yellow in new seat cushions accent plates and fabrics to balance out the grays.

(Screenshot of PPB affidavit)

Emile Laurent the professional skateboarder and suspected graffiti artist was caught in February after he was spotted tagging a Chinatown wall by employees of a neighboring strip club.

He and two others fled the scene but cops chased him down. Laurent 22 was caught red-handed.

“Emile Laurent had fresh red paint on his hands and white specks of paint all over his face shirt and pants” according to a police affidavit establishing probable cause to search Laurent’s home. The affidavit was reported earlier this week by KGW. The manager of Spyce Gentlemen’s Club identified Laurent as the tagger.

Laurent denied the crime but police found what they say is his distinctive tag “Tendo” scrawled in 4-foot-high letters on the cement wall of the Oregon Leather Company across the street.

The police issued a warrant for his arrest last weekend and he turned himself on Monday. He was released later that day under a supervision agreement that allows him to travel to Europe prior to his next court date in December. His attorney Bridget Donegan declined to comment.

It wasn’t the first time Laurent had been caught.

Three years earlier in December 2018 a man reported two vandals tagging the wall of the Sandy Boulevard Rectal Clinic in Kerns. Again Laurent ran but was caught. His partner accused of being a lookout pinned the blame on Laurent. So did the police who watched as a spray can fell out of his pocket.

Laurent who was wearing a black hoodie with “Nintendo” printed on the sleeve said “he was making art to impress a girl.”

He was arrested and released. The charge of criminal mischief was dropped.

Following the 2022 incident in Chinatown however the cops investigated further. They hunted through city and state databases for reports of similar graffiti tags and documented several dozen other instances of “Tendo” being scrawled on walls sidewalks and street signs.

There was one on the metal awning of Mary’s Club downtown.

Another on the garage door of Floyd’s dispensary in Northeast Portland.

emile floyd Screenshot of image in police affidavit.

And on the wall of the paint manufacturer Sherwin Williams.

emile sherwin Screenshot of image in police affidavit.

In their affidavit the police pin the vandalism on Laurent arguing it is unlikely to have been done by copycats or a group.

“The reason ‘taggers’ don’t copy each other’s monikers is because such action would only garner fame for the tag’s originator not the person attempting to copy it” the police say noting that taggers will “physically fight” anyone who threatens their territory.

Officers searched Laurent’s home in April. They found over a dozen “practice pads” with Laurent’s “Tendo” tag in his bedroom. There were spray cans in the basement laundry room and a black paint-splattered “Polar Skate” jacket in the mud room.

Laurent is an acclaimed skateboarder who is sponsored by the Swedish apparel company Polar Skate Co. He remains listed as a member of the company’s team on its website which features a photo of Laurent ollieing off an air-conditioning unit. Polar has not returned multiple requests for comment from WW.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFwYXJ0bWVudHRoZXJhcHkuY29tL3ZpbnRhZ2Utc3R5bGUtaG9tZS1vZmZpY2UtY2xvc2V0LXJlZG8tZ3JlZW4tZGVzay0zNzEyMzk4MtIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Green DIY Closet Office Transformation for $800 - Before and After Photos,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.apartmenttherapy.com/vintage-style-home-office-closet-redo-green-desk-37123982 on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFwYXJ0bWVudHRoZXJhcHkuY29tL3ZpbnRhZ2Utc3R5bGUtaG9tZS1vZmZpY2UtY2xvc2V0LXJlZG8tZ3JlZW4tZGVzay0zNzEyMzk4MtIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,,,

The Moft Snap System offers different magnetic stand solutions for iPad

The Snap Case for iPad by Moft gives users access to a magnetic accessory ecosystem that doesn't inhibit the iPad's existing functionality.

The iPad Pro and iPad Air are thin and light tablets that use magnets to attach accessories like the Apple Pencil and Magic Keyboard. However the magnet placement on the iPads isn't ideal for every type of accessory.

Moft created the Snap System to enhance the existing magnetic functionality of the iPad. Using a slim-fit case or magnetic sticker iPad owners can take advantage of Moft's three magnetic stand types.

Since the magnets in the rear of the iPad are placed around the edges of the device casing accessories would need to fit the entire width of an iPad for secure fastening. Moft gets around this by having a set of strong magnets situated in the center of the iPad.

Thanks to those centered magnets Moft's accessories can be much more compact and only need to be large enough to cover those magnets. This gives users the opportunity to have a variety of smaller stands that can be easily stowed when not in use.

Moft Snap Case for iPads

The Moft Snap Case for iPads fits the 11-inch iPad Pro 12.9-inch iPad Pro and the iPad Air 4 and newer. It securely attaches using the iPad's internal magnets without needing a lip around the front of the device.

The Moft Snap Case has a leather back and plastic shell

The key component of the Moft Snap Case is the passthrough Smart Connector. This allows the case to remain attached to the iPad while connecting it to a Smart Keyboard Folio or Magic Keyboard.

The case's outer shell is plastic while the back portion is made from vegan leather. The top of the case has a hollow portion for keeping the Apple Pencil in place while it is attached to the iPad.

The overall design is simple and doesn't get in the way of using the iPad normally. The leather makes the case feel grippy but the case is thin enough to allow closing it in the Magic Keyboard.

The case has a passthrough Smart Connector

When the Snap Case is attached to the iPad it enables users to attach Moft's other magnetic accessories that are part of the Snap System. These include the Snap Tablet Stand Snap Float Stand and Wall Stand.

Using the Moft Snap Case

The Moft Snap Case lives up to its promise as a thin iPad case that stays out of the way. It attaches to the various Moft magnetic stands and the Magic Keyboard without any problem.

The leather is comfortable to hold and makes the entire case feel more premium. However the side of the case that covers the buttons and Apple Pencil is suboptimal.

The volume buttons are hidden behind a sloped piece of plastic that surrounds the Apple Pencil holder. The buttons are hard to reach and incredibly difficult to press.

The Snap Case makes pressing the volume buttons difficult

Even the power button is difficult to press because it sits within a recessed cavity. We wouldn't recommend using any of these buttons while the iPad is attached to the Moft accessories especially the Wall Stand because the force needed to press the buttons will send the iPad flying.

The Apple Pencil cover is also a problematic choice. Apple's magnetic attach and charging system for the Apple Pencil is amazing because of its ease of access. Adding a plastic guard around it may keep the Pencil from breaking free in a bag but it makes getting the Pencil in and out annoying.

Users have to reach behind the case and push the pencil out of the holder. If the case is situated where the hole is obscured in any way users will have to move the entire iPad out of the way to get the Apple Pencil free.

These are minor complaints overall. The case itself is nice enough to use and has mostly faded into the background of our daily iPad use.

Where to buy the Moft Snap Case

Moft Snap Tablet Sticker

Owners of iPads that are not compatible with the Moft Snap Case can still use the Moft Snap System thanks to the Moft Snap Tablet Sticker. Note that this is not a reusable pad but it is a relatively cheap option to get access to the Moft accessories.

Use the Moft Snap Tablet Sticker on iPads without a Snap Case

Instead of using an entire case the Snap Tablet Sticker attaches to the rear of the iPad or case to enable access to the Snap System. The sticker must be placed on the outermost layer for the magnets to work. Placing the sticker behind a case even a slim one won't work.

The best use case for the Snap Tablet Sticker is for households with multiple iPad users. Buying multiple cases may be too expensive but getting a few stickers will enable everyone to access the Snap System stands.

The Snap Tablet Stand and Snap Float Stand come bundled with one Snap Tablet Sticker.

Buy additional Moft Snap Tablet Sticker for $9.99 on the Moft website.

Moft Snap Tablet Stand

The Moft Snap Tablet Stand is an ultra-thin magnetic stand that folds flat when not in use. It can easily stay attached to the back of an iPad without adding noticeable thickness or be stored easily when not in use.

The Moft Snap Tablet Stand lays flat when not in use

The stand folds open and can be rotated into portrait or landscape orientations for multiple use angles. Lay the iPad on the stand in landscape to draw or view media or turn the iPad and stand to portrait for video calls easily.

When combined with the Moft Snap Case it sits perfectly centered on the rear of an iPad. The magnets are strong enough to keep the iPad balanced when in use but are not strong enough to hold the tablet's weight on its own.

There is only an open or closed position for the Snap Tablet Stand. Magnets align the parts to lock it into one of the two modes.

Using the Snap Tablet Stand

As described by Moft the Snap Tablet Stand is a minimal iPad stand that gets out of the way when needed. We like that it folds into a flat piece that can be tucked into a tablet sleeve in a backpack.

Open the Snap Tablet Stand in landscape for sturdy support

The stand is sturdy enough to use the iPad in multiple orientations. Touching the display drawing or even playing rhythm games wouldn't dislodge this magnetic stand.

Due to having only two fixed positions the stand doesn't wobble in use. We could easily visualize someone keeping this stand tucked into a kitchen drawer or desk for quick access to a tablet stand useful for the whole family.

Where to buy the Snap Tablet Stand

The Snap Tablet Stand is available in blue gray black orange and pink. Get it for $39.99 on the Moft website or on Amazon.

Moft Snap Float Stand

The Moft Snap Float Stand is a variable height stand that can be maneuvered into various positions thanks to its two-hinge design. Fold the Float Stand shut into a compact device that can fit in a pocket or bag without issue.

The Moft Snap Float Stand holds the iPad aloft

Since the stand is compact it can be used with any iPad using the magnetic case or sticker even the iPad mini. It attaches in landscape orientation but can be used with the iPad in portrait as a basic stand too.

The primary mode leaves the tablet floating above the table. It can be adjusted to clear about 3 inches above the surface which is also affected by the iPad size.

Close the top hinge to turn the Float Stand into a clamshell kickstand. This mode is useful for drawing with the Apple Pencil.

Using the Moft Snap Float Stand

The Moft Snap Float Stand is a little more interactive in its use case when compared to the other Moft stands. The hinges require two hands to position correctly and we definitely recommend taking the iPad off the stand whenever positioning it.

Unlike the Snap Tablet Stand this feels like you need to be more precise in placing the iPad. When used to float the tablet above the table it feels like you can slide the magnet around on the heavy 12.9-inch iPad.

Fold the Float Stand into a clamshell for keeping the iPad in portrait

Position the magnet wrong and the iPad will slide down or topple the float stand. This isn't too much of an issue if you're paying attention but it could lead to an iPad falling over if too complacent.

We like that it can fold into a small device when not in use like Moft's other accessories — it just gets out of the way.

The variation in angles and positions offered by the Float Stand makes this a great desktop companion. We found ourselves picking up and moving the iPad around the desk more with this simple stand versus when using a heavy-duty magnetic stand from Lululook.

The only significant negative for the Float Stand is its sturdiness. An iPad used while floating above the desk will shake and wobble constantly when touched or tapped. This stand is more useful when the iPad isn't being touched.

Where to buy the Moft Snap Float Stand

Get the Moft Snap Float Stand for $49.90 on the Moft Website. It is also available for $49.99 on Amazon.

Moft Wall Stand

The Moft Wall Stand is an adhesive magnetic wall mount for iPads and other devices. It has a reusable adhesive sticker that can be removed and reattached about 30 times.

The Moft Wall Stand lets users magnetically attach iPads to the wall

When in the flat position against the wall users can attach their iPad using the Tablet Sticker or Snap Case. It will hold devices up to 2.8 pounds so even the 12.9-inch iPad Pro can magnetically attach without issue.

The Wall Stand isn't just a magnetic attaching point however since it has a hidden magnetic shelf built into the stand. Fold the shelf down and any device weighing less than 2.8 pounds can sit freely on the stand.

Using the Moft Wall Stand

Moft's Wall Stand is one of our favorite accessories from this lineup. It is an elegant and simple way to add a universal tablet mount anywhere in the home.

The magnetic part of this stand feels more precarious than it should. Like with the Float Stand the magnets don't feel like they get an exact grip. Instead the iPad kind of slides until it locks in place.

Fold down the Wall Stand into a small shelf for devices without Moft magnets

We had one scare where the iPad slipped right out of the Wall Stand while using the Snap Case. This was entirely our fault due to how we placed the tablet but the magnets should line up more precisely than they do.

Fret not because this clever wall stand has a built-in shelf. Folding down the shelf lets any iPhone iPad or device sit simply against the stand — no magnets required.

Now this does mean the device is perched on a small wall shelf held up with adhesive but responsible use will prevent any accidents.

We like the Wall Stand so much that we're considering ordering one or two more to place around the home. Even if we stop using Moft's Snap Case they still act as handy stands so it solves an interesting problem.

Where to buy the Moft Wall Stand

Buy the Moft Wall Stand for $19.99 on Amazon or the Moft website. It is available in white or black.

Using the Moft Snap System as a whole

The Moft Snap System is an accessory ecosystem so users get more benefits when they own more than one component. Compared to other device ecosystems the key to this system is that committing to Moft's ecosystem doesn't mean excluding others.

Use the Moft Snap Case with the Magic Keyboard

We like that the Snap Case is compatible with the Magic Keyboard and other products that use the iPad's rear magnets. For example the Lululook magnetic stand works fine with the attached Snap Case.

To exemplify the system's usefulness we committed to using them alongside our other iPad accessories. Going from the Float case on our desk to the Wall Stand in the kitchen then the Snap Tablet Stand in the living room was seamless and satisfying.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMimwFodHRwczovL3d3dy5oZXJhbGR0cmlidW5lLmNvbS9zdG9yeS9zcG9ydHMvaGlnaC1zY2hvb2wvZm9vdGJhbGwvMjAyMi8wOC8yNy9mb290YmFsbC1yb3VuZHVwLW1vb25leS1lZGdlcy1ib29rZXItc2FyYXNvdGEtcm9sbHMtdmVuaWNlLWltZy11cHNldC83ODg1MDkyMDAxL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,FOOTBALL ROUNDUP: Mooney edges Booker Sarasota rolls Venice IMG upset,"No commitment required.

He put his best foot forward on his first snap on Saturday against the Tennessee Titans at Nissan Stadium.

Guarantano completed a 74-yard pass to Andy Isabella on his first pass attempt of the game then threw a 2-yard touchdown pass to Greg Dortch to finish his first drive.

Take a look.

In his rookie year Guarantano is battling with former Penn State quarterback Trace McSorley the fourth-year pro who has played in three NFL games and was signed off the Ravens practice squad by the Cardinals last season.

The undrafted free agent has made a lot of his limited snaps going 12-for-21 for 167 yards and three touchdowns in three preseason games.

Guarantano spent five seasons at Tennessee playing in 41 games with 32 starts. He fought through injury to help the Vols to a 2019 Gator Bowl berth then struggled in 2020 (like many of his teammates) during the final season of the Jeremy Pruitt era.

SNAP provides food-purchasing assistance to low-income working people senior citizens and the disabled. In New York SNAP is administered by two different agencies: the Department of Social Services Human Resources Administration is in charge of SNAP benefits in New York City and the New York Office of Temporary and Disability Assistance in the rest of the state.

Because there are two different agencies in charge of SNAP benefits New York has two SNAP schedules. Your specific SNAP schedule depends on where you live.

Benefits are paid out monthly to SNAP accounts linked to EBT cards which can be used to purchase most food items at grocery stores some retail locations and farmers’ markets. You can also shop for fresh produce and groceries online at participating stores.

To check your eligibility for SNAP outside of NYC you must apply for benefits. You can apply for New York SNAP through myBenefits.ny.gov or print and mail (or fax) the SNAP application to your local department of social services. If you live in New York City you can apply through the online portal ACCESS HRA. You can also pick up an application at your nearest SNAP center or call the NYC Infoline at 718-557-1399 to have an application mailed to you.

SNAP in New York has two different schedules. Outside of NYC benefits are sent out over the first nine days of every month based on the last digit of your case number.

Chugay conspired with others to encourage some workers to enter the United States and remain in the country in violation of immigration laws. Chugay and others sent checks and wires totaling more than $11 million in proceeds from the illegal scheme to conspirators in Ukraine and elsewhere.

According to court documents and evidence presented at trial Mykhaylo Chugay and others owned and operated a series of labor-staffing companies in southern Florida including General Labor Solutions LLC Liberty Specialty Service LLC Paradise Choice LLC Paradise Choice Cleaning LLC Tropical City Services LLC and Tropical City Group LLC between August 2007 and July 2021. Through these staffing companies Chugay facilitated the employment of individuals in hotels bars and restaurants in Key West and other locations even though the employees were not authorized to work in the United States.

A partner in several Key West labor staffing companies was sentenced today to more than 24 years in prison for tax immigration and money laundering crimes related to the operation of those businesses.

In addition to the term of imprisonment U.S. District Court Judge Jose E. Martinez for the Southern District of Florida ordered Chugay to serve three years of supervised release. Judge Martinez will enter a forfeiture money judgement and order Chugay to pay at a later date.

“Chugay’s illegal staffing and money laundering operation lasted more than a decade and cost the government millions of dollars in unpaid payroll taxes” said Acting Deputy Assistant Attorney General Stuart M. Goldberg of the Justice Department’s Tax Division. “Employers who follow the rules and pay their fair share of taxes deserve to compete on a level playing field. Those who cut corners and evade their legal obligations should know they will be investigated and prosecuted.”

“The elaborate scheme organized by this organization took advantage of U.S. Government programs designed to assist vulnerable populations seeking assistance and a better life here in the US for their own personal gain” said Special Agent in Charge Anthony Salisbury of Homeland Security Investigations (HSI) Miami. “This sentence is the culmination of a lengthy investigation which demonstrates the resolve and determination of HSI and its partners to stop individuals trying to take advantage of the systemic vulnerabilities to fuel their lavish lifestyles.”

“We are committed to finding criminals who break the law to gain an unfair market advantage and enrich themselves by avoiding to pay taxes” said Special Agent in Charge Matthew D. Line of the IRS-Criminal Investigation Miami Field Office. “This is another example of how our local agents and staff applied their skilled forensic financial analysis and criminal investigative expertise to investigate crooked staffing companies engaged in illegal employment practices.”

Acting Deputy Assistant Attorney General Goldberg and U.S. Attorney Juan Antonio Gonzalez for the Southern District of Florida made the announcement.

The U.S. Department of Homeland Security’s Homeland Security Investigations and IRS-Criminal Investigation are investigating the case. U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services and U.S. Customs and Border Protection Air and Marine Operations provided substantial assistance at trial.",,,,,,,,,

Daniel Slim / Getty

Winter is coming.

Yes again.

It seems like only this morning that I read of yet more airline disruption across America but airline executives are -- as they so often do -- looking ahead to the storms to come.

How can they tackle them? How can they keep getting you to fly when vacation time is over kids are back at school and elections loom like grisly bears in the wood?

We love you. We really love you.



I've been especially fascinated with the movements at Southwest Airlines of late.

See also The best airline credit cards Airline business credit cards allow you to earn free miles from travel and everyday purchases. Read now

It's the airline that always professes love but doesn't always show it. Recently though it's made something of a spectacle out of endearing itself to humanity.

Why but a couple of weeks ago Southwest announced that its flight credits will live forever.

""What is this fair madness?!"" exclaimed rival airline executives in their sleep. But yes it was true. Southwest stopped to consider what real human beings would like and gave them something they might respect appreciate and even adore.

Why would an airline do that?

I wanted to believe this was exclusively an appeal for renewed love and affection from the everyday human. There may however be a slightly more venal aspect here.

On the airline's second-quarter earnings call Southwest confessed that leisure travelers have a certain limit to how much they're prepared to pay.

Southwest's executives worried whether business travel would soon return to sufficiently bounteous volumes. It didn't seem to be happening.

Would it surprise you to hear that the businesspeople traveling most were in the education government and small business fields?

Would it also surprise that those traveling less -- at least on Southwest -- were in the consulting banking and oh look tech fields?

Please imagine then that by ensuring flight credits never expire Southwest may be tempting businesses to schedule more of their executives on trips knowing that if the trips are cancelled for some reason they have permanent credit in their bank.

Oddly here was Southwest's chief commercial officer Andrew Watterson on the earnings call: ""The hoped-for benefit as we get into the travel season here post-summer is getting more travelers per account out on the road.""

What do you know? This new outpouring of love may really be all about business travel.

My evidence m'lud doesn't stop there.

Let us help you help yourselves oh businesses.



No sooner had Southwest offered its flight credit joy than it launched Southwest Business Assist.

The idea here is simple -- to give those hard-working corporate travel managers instant technological control over their company's flying.

Which corporate travel manager wouldn't love ""unique dashboards reports automated processing of contractual benefits receiving or requesting customer service and much more.""? Yes so much more.

And wait what's the first benefit underneath the main introduction on Southwest's site? Why a picture of two very happy Southwest flight attendants who look like they've flown a lot together. Oh and the words: ""Flight credits don't expire. Expiring flight credits are a thing of the past.""

They're big on emphasizing that to businesses you see.

There's more. So much more.



By now you'll be thinking Southwest is very very desperate for the love of business customers. But wait there's much more. So much more.

In a veritable lava flow of love Southwest announced that customers can now upgrade their boarding group online.

Who wouldn't want to be in the glorious A1-A15 boarding group? The one where people rush to get the best seats. Which for some are actually aisle seats making it awkward for B-level customers to push by. The A's get first dibs on overhead bins too.

Now what sort of flyer do you think would want that most? Perhaps the flyer in the consulting banking or tech industry who just wants to get home after three days of difficult meetings -- and whose companies were too stingy to buy them Business Select tickets?

There's something bracingly pleasing about an airline that seems truly focused on actually surprising its customers. In a good way that is.

There's one final kink to all this. Southwest has invested heavily in short-haul flights between businessy sorts of cities. It works operationally for the airline. But as winter approaches the ideal would be for actual businesspeople to flood these particular routes.

Southwest's Watterson again: ""It just shows you there's insufficient business demand for that level of short-haul at this point in time. But as we go into a more heavy business travel season that can be mitigated through the return of business travel.""

It will be fascinating to see how much of an effect Southwest's Winter of Love may have.

But wait this just in. The Global Business Travel Association's annual report and forecast have just been published. It muses that business travel may not return to pre-pandemic levels until 2026.

Ah.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiMWh0dHBzOi8vdGhlcG9pbnRzZ3V5LmNvbS9uZXdzL2VhZ2xlLW9uLXNvdXRod2VzdC_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Soaring with Southwest; Clark the Eagle flies commercial and draws stares at the airport,"TSA officers and passengers at Charlotte Douglas International Airport (CLT) did double-takes and whipped out their cell phones to snap photos and videos when a large bald eagle and its handler joined the security checkpoint line on their way to a Southwest Airlines flight.

""Our special guest was Clark the Eagle with the World Bird Sanctuary who decided to give his wings a break and fly commercial"" TSA said in a tweet thread that included photos of the big bird. ""His airline notified us and we screened him and his handler. Clark is trained to spread his wings and even showed off a bit during screening.""

In a video shared by a passenger at CLT the eagle can indeed be seen spreading his wings at the checkpoint behind a TSA officer that appears to be doing her best to inspect the bird's travel cage amid the feathered commotion.

What was Clark doing at the airport? He traveled for business and was on his way home after welcoming new students at North Carolina's High Point University.

After Clark the Eagle gave TSA agents and onlookers a free show at the checkpoint he was returned to his carrier. ""On a case-by-case basis Southwest Airlines works with reputable animal organizations such as the World Bird Sanctuary to make exceptions by allowing certain animals to travel in-cabin"" the airline told the Points Guy.

""We were very pleased to offer our assistance with this very special passenger flying alongside his trained handlers and ensured that the animal was accommodated with the appropriate amount of space while traveling the skies onboard our Boeing 737"" Southwest's Brandy King told TPG when reached for comment. Southwest couldn't say exactly how the bird flew in the cabin but we hope the bird got a whole row.

Clark the Eagle is clearly a frequent flier and a working bird not an emotional support animal.

He's one of four Bald Eagles who serves as a 'flying ambassador' for the World Bird Sanctuary based in Valley Park Missouri near St. Louis. The 300-acre sanctuary provides safe haven to about 270 animals of various species.

Clark the Eagle was hatched in 2002 at the sanctuary's conservation department when it was breeding the then-endangered Bald Eagles for release into the wild.

But Clark couldn't be released because he was born with deformities on his feet. Instead the sanctuary trained Clark for its Eagle Flight Team which travels around the country often flying by plane.

On its Adopt-a-Bird page the sanctuary says Clark ""began flying at St. Louis Cardinals' baseball games to the cheers of thousands of fans for the National Anthem and has also flown for other high profile events such as The Horatio Alger Association the Chicago Bears and an annual Boeing event.

With an escort the nearly 8-pound bald eagle flies between five and seven times a year trainer Daniel Cone the assistant director of the World Bird Sanctuary told ABC News. And this week Clark and Cone were flying back to St. Louis on Southwest Airlines after the freshmen welcome flyover at High Point University. Cone says Clark has had that gig for about a decade and is also a regular guest at the school's Veterans Day ceremony and graduation.

On Monday a bald eagle named Clark was seen traveling home after making a special appearance at High Point University's convocation Sunday in North Carolina.

Twitter user @ElijahWhosoever shared a video of Clark making his way through the TSA checkpoint at Charlotte Douglas International Airport which has now garnered more than 120000 views.

Clark was bred at the World Bird Sanctuary in Missouri 20 years ago in the conservation department according to the organization's website. He was initially supposed to be released into the wild as the species was endangered at the time the website states and due to Clark's feet deformities he wasn't able to join his siblings in the wild.

Currently the trend for Stanley Black & Decker Inc is flat indicating a lack of significant price movement in either direction. This suggests a period of consolidation and indecision among investors.

Furthermore the stock is underperforming meaning it is not keeping pace with the broader market or its industry peers.

She pushed the call button in her cell for two hours without a response and when county employees finally did take her to a hospital they stopped at a Starbucks along the way her lawyer said in a federal lawsuit. She lost the pregnancy according to court records.

On Tuesday the Orange County Board of Supervisors voted unanimously in a closed session to pay Ms. Quinones $480000 to settle a civil rights lawsuit she had filed in federal court that claimed denial of medical care negligent treatment and other violations.

An Orange County Sheriff’s Department spokesman declined to comment about the lawsuit or the settlement. Phone and email messages left for the board chairman and a lawyer representing the county were not immediately returned on Sunday.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMif2h0dHBzOi8vZmluYW5jZS55YWhvby5jb20vbmV3cy9pbi1uLW91dC1idXJnZXItY2hpcG90bGUtc3RhcmJ1Y2tzLWhvdy1yZXN0YXVyYW50cy1yYW5rLWZvci1lbXBsb3llZS1zYXRpc2ZhY3Rpb24tMTY0OTExOTIzLmh0bWzSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,In-N-Out Burger Chipotle Starbucks: How restaurants rank for employee satisfaction,"Fast food chains are in competition to recruit and maintain talent with some businesses faring better than others when it comes to employee satisfaction according to new report from financial services firm William Blair.

In the study the firm analyzed more than 350000 Glassdoor reviews on over 90 restaurant concepts including fast-casual quick service speciality and casual dining.

Topping the list 87% of In-N-Out Burger employees would recommend their jobs to friends followed by Barcelona Wine Bar at 79% and Snooze at 77%. Newcomers to the top 10 this year include Black Rifle Coffee Company at 76% MOD Pizza at 73% and Chuy’s with 73%.

All told two-publicly traded restaurants made the top 10: Black Rifle Coffee Company at No.4 and Dutch Bros at No. 5 both of which came in with 76% of employees saying they'd recommend working there.

The firm's overall findings were in line with previous years: culture outweighs compensation.

""We've been seeing this really consistently since 2015 when we started doing this analysis — where culture and values senior management diversity and inclusion — those seem to be much more correlated to overall employee satisfaction in the restaurant industry. Of course those are the tougher things to get right. It's easy to raise pay. It's tough to change your culture"" Sharon Zackfia William Blair equity research group head of consumer sector told Yahoo Finance.

In the report the firm noted that when ""companies get the foundational intangibles right the reward is often manifest in multiple years of top-ranked NPSs [net promoter score] related to how many employees would recommend their job to a friend.""

The original restaurant could only queue about 11 cars this new design will fit up to 34 vehicles.

Zackfia noted that as a private company top-ranked In-N-Out Burger has a family feel.

""It's family-run. I think because it's family-run it has a very familial element to it. They don't have to kind of strive to meet quarterly earnings targets or sales targets for Wall Street so I think there is a little bit less of that constant pressure that you might see for a public company"" Zackfia shared.

Though Starbucks didn't make the top 10 seventy-one percent of employees said they'd refer a friend to work there.

""Starbucks has obviously been in the news a lot for its employee relations"" Zackfia said. ""But if you look at Starbucks on an absolute basis it's been a top 20 net promoter score for the entire time we've done this since 2015 which is remarkable given that Starbucks has well over 30000 locations right now so scale isn't necessarily the enemy of employee relations but it is obviously hard to stay small as you get large.""

Story continues

While the analysis was done when founder Howard Shultz was named interim CEO Zackfia says ""we'll see what happens"" this fall.

""Clearly Howard Schultz is back as interim CEO [he] has a strong vision for the company and all the expectations are that he will remain as chairman of the board so there will be that founder-led dynamic obviously with a new CEO coming in to partner with the board on leading that vision"" Zackfia added.

According to records from the NLRB an independent federal labor agency 228 Starbucks stores have voted in favor of unionization so far as of Tuesday. While 208 of those have been certified and must now begin bargaining in good faith with the union.

Here's where some other well known brands ranked: Shake Shake 64% Dave & Busters 59% and Bloomin' Brands which has the following brands under its umbrella: Bonefish Grill 69% Carrabba's Italian Grill 65% and Outback Steakhouse 65%.

The firm highlighted that it saw ""worrisome trends"" among employees at Chipotle 53% BJ's Restaurants 66% sweetgreen 54% and Kura Sushi 39%.

Zackfia noted a downward trend of employee satisfaction at Chipotle was ""probably is one of the most surprising findings.""

""I think with Chipotle they went so digital during the pandemic and that's a different muscle memory for employees when they're serving primarily Uber Eats drivers who are delivering the food or orders are being placed ahead and consumers are just coming in to pick up. Now that those lines are coming back to the front of the stores again which I think we've all seen that's a different dynamic. That's a different level of pressure for those employees"" she explained.

Frappuccinos Dragon Drink Refreshers and Pumpkin Cream Cold Brews helped lead the beverage giant to a record $8.2 billion in revenue.

Schultz reported that iced coffee and other cold beverages accounted for 75 percent of its beverage sales in the quarter — a Gen Z favorite that young consumers like to customize and then post their creations on social media.

All that sugar and syrup is not very healthy as a consistent consumable. But these young folks have it half right — sans the saccharine add-ons cold brew coffee like hot coffee can encourage brain health as a regular part of your diet. Scientific research shows that in addition to improving mental acuity the iced version may prove even more healthy than its hot cousin.

Here The Manual shows how your cold brew coffee consumption can keep the body in shape and the mind sharp and even help prevent several diseases.

A More Potent Energetic Jolt

Caffeine is what gives coffee its jolt. And in cold brew coffee extra caffeine adds an extra spark.

What is cold brew coffee? Typically steeped in a lower concentration of water for a longer duration at ambient or cold temperatures the resulting black batch offers a higher caffeine concentration than quick-brewed hot coffee. Cold brew’s naturally elevated caffeine content encourages more focus better attention and blissful productive wakefulness.

A second factor: people tend to buy cold brew and other iced drinks in larger quantities than their hot peers. This causes faster consumption especially through a straw. The quicker you sip your cold brew the harder the java hits.

Higher Caffeine Levels Keep You Going

Caffeine is a stimulant chemical compound which increases brain activity. A research article on caffeine’s energizing effects breaks down how adenosine a natural human neurotransmitter levels up throughout your day until hitting a dozy tipping point instigating a sleepy wind down. Caffeine invigorates in part by binding to adenosine receptors in the brain decreasing its impact.

Careful though. Too much caffeine has negative health effects. In high doses (three to five cups a day) the stimulant can make you anxious and jittery affecting sleep digestion blood pressure and heart rate. In moderate amounts however caffeine can be an elixir.

Caffeine Encourages Happy Minds

The magic ingredient that can give you more zing in the morning (or afternoon) can also improve your overall mood. According to an article published in Psychology Today caffeine helps the brain to increase dopamine absorption when it binds and blocks adenosine receptors. Dopamine stimulates the part of your brain associated with reward and motivation which can lead to more positive feelings.

The author Berit Broggard goes on to explain how depression may be an immune reaction that causes brain inflammation. Chinese researchers hypothesize that coffee may help ease this particular inflammation owing to “its special combination of antioxidants.”

Whatever the source the March 2016 issue of the Australian and New Zealand Journal of Psychiatry suggested one cup of coffee reduces depression risk by 8% according to the mental health magazine.

Caffeine Can Be Preventative Too

In eliminating free radicals from the body these naturally occurring antioxidants not only can help prevent depression but decreased the risk for neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s disease.

A Mayo Clinic article explains how free radicals build up in cells as a result of routine metabolism especially for typical Americans with low-nutrient diets. Oxidative compounds damage cells leading to elevated risks from cancer arthritis dementia and other major health issues.

More caffeine can improve cognitive function and help protect the brain from degenerative dementia and other neural disorders.

Cold Brew Can Help Men Maintain Erections

According to the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases erectile dysfunction is very common affecting about 30 million men in the United States. Once again then antioxidants can come to the rescue.

Antioxidants in coffee can help promote better blood flow leading to longer-lasting erections and improved sexual health. (As asserted earlier sugar and cream in your iced drink can add just as many debilitating effects.)

A study in the journal PLOS ONE caffeine intake “reduced the odds of prevalent ED.” This conclusion comes from data analyzed from 3724 men who drank the equivalent of two to three cups of coffee per day. Since erectile function requires blood flowing through vessels via a healthy cardiovascular system it makes sense that caffeine would benefit as an extension of these cardiovascular benefits.

Cold Brew Is Easier On Stomachs

One of the challenges of hot coffee is its acidic component. Coffee can be hard on stomachs and cause heartburn. Cold brew on the other hand steeps in coffee grounds and cold water often for an entire day. This leads to a smoother brew and a less acidic effect than regular coffee. This translates to an easier punch to the digestive system particularly for heartburn sufferers and sensitive stomachs.

A Smoother Drink Can Help You Lose Weight

A smoother less acidic cold brew is often a tastier choice for consumers. In this case there’s less need to mask an astringent taste by dumping cream milk honey caramel chocolate and/or sugar into your cup. Dodging this calorie bomb can also help to increase your metabolic rate and reduce body fat by about 4% according to a Harvard study.

Reduced Sweeteners Means Downsized Diabetes Risk

In case you need more reason to dodge Dunkin Donuts brown sugar cold brew and Starbucks chocolate cream cold brew avoiding these over-sweet drinks reduces your risk of developing type 2 diabetes.

A Dutch study involved a prospective cohort of 40011 participants with a mean follow-up of 10 years. Data showed that 918 incident cases of type 2 diabetes developed and those who drank three or more cups of regular-strength coffee a day — the equivalent of about one and a half cold brews — were more than 40% less likely to contract type 2 diabetes.

Nothing is guaranteed in this life but you can tilt some odds in your favor. A smooth cold brew can help your body and mind now and down the road.

The campus is home to a new We Proudly Serve Starbucks coffee shop that opened earlier this semester. The shop which is operated by Glenville State’s dining partner Aramark Collegiate Hospitality is located inside Louis Bennett Hall in the center of main campus.

The location officially opened on Monday August 15 and students faculty and staff have already been enjoying the “perks” of having a coffee shop on campus.

“This is yet another campus improvement that you will be seeing here at Glenville State University” said Glenville State President Dr. Mark A. Manchin. “Adding this coffee shop to our dining offerings is a great thing for our students and employees. I’m pleased with how it has turned out and thank our Aramark partners for helping make this a reality. I encourage everyone to stop by and grab a coffee.”

“Pioneer Dining Services is happy to announce the opening of the Pioneer Coffee Shop. I am extremely excited to be able to provide a place for students faculty and staff to commune and get a cup of coffee and an environment for students to come and study. I am extremely excited for Glenville State University and truly appreciate the collaboration to make this a reality for the campus community” said Aramark Collegiate Hospitality District Manager Brett Ridgeway.

“I am beyond pleased to have our own We Proudly Serve Starbucks location here at Glenville State” said Glenville State Vice President for Administration Rita Hedrick-Helmick. “Having a coffee shop really adds to the collegiate atmosphere of campus and it introduces another intimate space for students to relax between classes yet it’s also conveniently located to simply pop in for a quick coffee.”

Although now used as space for campus offices Louis Bennett Hall was originally a men’s dormitory. The coffee shop is located in the space formerly occupied by the main office and mail room. A corner column of the coffee shop is wrapped in mailbox fronts preserved during demolition and added as a decorative finish as a nod to the past. City Construction Company worked over the past year to refurbish the lobby and construct the coffee shop.

The coffee shop at Glenville State University is open Monday-Thursday from 7:30 a.m. to 3:00 p.m. and Fridays from 7:30 a.m. until 2:00 p.m. Visitor parking spaces are available in the parking lots adjacent to Clark Hall and the Heflin Administration Building for community members visiting the coffee shop."

Bank of Singapore is one of the latest to make a senior China-desk hire. Sharon Ho has joined OCBC’s private banking offshoot as an executive director and team head for Greater China according to her LinkedIn profile.

Ho previously spend just under three years at HSBC as the Singapore-based North Asia market head for the firm’s Jade wealth unit.

Prior to that she had a long career in mass-affluent banking including a 12-year stint at DBS Treasures latterly as private client desk head for North Asia.

Mandarin-speaking RMs with strong mainland client networks are particularly sought after in Singapore thanks to an influx of Chinese clients including family offices who want their investments managed from Singapore

Earlier this year for example Julius Baer hired Wai Meng Loh from UOB as a team head for Greater China and BNP Paribas took on Ruth Chung from Pictet as market head of Greater China.

Other banks building China desks in the Republic include Credit Suisse and JP Morgan.

“A market head in private banking in Singapore just told me that he’s interested in hiring RMs from Hong Kong to come to Singapore and serve mainland clients” a headhunter told a recent eFinancialCareers round table.

(AP) —

Florida State showed its offensive identity — running the ball at will — and dominated an FCS program.

Treshaun Ward Trey Benson and Lawrance Toafili surpassed 100 rushing yards and Florida State dominated Duquesne 47-7 in a lightning-delayed game on Saturday. The Seminoles ran for 406 yards and opened the season with a victory for the first time since 2016.

“This was the first glimpse of the 2022 Florida State football team and I’m proud of our players” Florida State coach Mike Norvell said. “It definitely wasn’t a perfect game. A lot of guys played got opportunities. There was some good some bad things that we’re going to have to continue to grow upon. But the experience and the approach is what I’m really pleased about. I thought we showed as a fast and physical football team.”

Florida State had shown it could be a run-oriented offense in Norvell’s first two seasons. But the Seminoles had three 100-yard rushers in a single game for the first time in school history albeit in a game against an overmatched Duquesne.

Ward (14 carries 127 yards) Benson (11 carries 105 yards) and Toafili (13 carries 101 yards) led the ground attack which featured six touchdowns. Ward had two TD runs and Benson had a 41-yard TD as the Oregon transfer frequently racked up yards after contact. True freshman Rodney Hill also had 55 rushing yards and a touchdown.

“Before the game this morning we broke off on 500 because that’s what we wanted to get” Ward said. “Just to see everyone get 100 yards makes me proud. And seeing Rodney score too made me proud as well. Seeing everybody get their burn and seeing everybody get their touches it makes us proud. Nobody is selfish in this room. We want to see everybody eat and get to the next level. So it’s something in our room that no one else has.”

Florida State scored on eight of its first nine drives. Jordan Travis Toafili and Ward had TD runs as Florida State led 20-0 after the first quarter.

Travis completed 11 of 15 passes for 207 yards. Kentron Poitier had four receptions for 84 yards. Mycah Pittman also had four catches for 44 yards. Johnny Wilson hauled in a 51-yard grab that set up a touchdown.

Joe Mischler completed a 22-yard touchdown pass to Abdul Janneh in the third quarter for Duquesne. The Dukes capitalized off a short field after Ryan Webb intercepted a pass from Florida State backup Tate Rodemaker.

Florida State’s defense forced eight punts. The Seminoles had five pass break-ups including two by safety Jammie Robinson.

IMPACT TRANSFERS

Three of Florida State’s top receivers — Pittman Wilson and Deuce Spann — were transfers. Spann added three receptions for 40 yards. Linebacker Tatum Bethune who played at UCF had four tackles and a pass breakup. Jared Verse who played at Albany had four tackles and recorded a sack.

A FIRST BUT WORK TO DO

Florida State had not won a season opener under Norvell. The Seminoles have started slow in his first two seasons and are a combined 0-6 in September in the Norvell Era.

TAKEAWAYS

Florida State: The Seminoles last surpassed 400 rushing yards in a game in 2016 when Dalvin Cook and Jacques Patrick led the team to 478 yards at South Florida.

Duquesne: The Dukes managed just 164 yards (3.5 yards per play).

The training was meant to simulate true-to-life scenarios. The officers who portrayed disgruntled employees or former patients pretended to show up angry to the Minnisink Road campus. The staff members were then challenged to calm down the actors who in some instances escalated the situation and pulled out weapons to fire blank projectiles.

Christopher Johnston the director of safety for St. Joseph's Health said the lessons taught during the drill were powerful and that the emergencies seemed ""very real.""

""There's a lot of staff that have never seen a firearm"" Johnston said.

""When you first see one presented to you"" he added ""there's the oh-my-goodness moment and they sometimes freeze. I'd rather them freeze during the training scenario than if they actually saw something like that in real life.""

""We want our employees to have a sense of their surroundings and to be mindful of their safety and security whether they're on campus or off campus"" Johnston said.

More shootings in and near hospitals are forcing reviews of security protocols at health care sites around the country.

The triple killing at what was then Mercy Hospital and Medical Center in Chicago in November 2018 was considered the worst attack in such a setting in at least 20 years. The perpetrator an ex-fiancé of one of the victims was gunned down in a shootout with police.

In June a man who reportedly underwent an operation and had been in pain since the procedure opened fire in a hospital in Tulsa Oklahoma killing four people before turning the gun on himself. Among the victims was his surgeon.

ST. CLOUD — Central Minnesota soccer has experienced significant growth in recent decades most notably in St. John's longevity at the collegiate level and St. Cloud Apollo High School's state title run detailed in part one.

But challenges have also arisen. Soccer is an ever-evolving game in the area which means problem-solving can also feel like a moving target.

But one challenge always persists: How do you keep youth talent local?

That is always the first topic that comes up when you ask an area coach about what difficulties youth soccer faces.

And for good reason.

More:Soccer is gaining popularity in St. Cloud. Here’s why.

St. Cloud's proximity to the Twin Cities draws competitive players who want to play in college

The Minneapolis-St. Paul metro area's population stood at about 3.7 million in the 2020 census about two-thirds of Minnesota's population. The St. Cloud metro area of Stearns and Benton counties sat at around 200000.

With dozens and dozens of clubs in the Twin Cities opportunities in an ultra-competitive market are easy to find. The main obstacle to entry is the hour-plus drive back and forth for training multiple times a week.

But that doesn't stop St. Cloud-area players from chasing that opportunity. Sartell senior captain Reese Kloetzer is one example.

More:Soccer’s popularity in St. Cloud started with a college swimming coach and rose to high school dominance

Kloetzer first started playing soccer at the age of three in Ohio instantly falling in love with the feeling of the ball at her feet. She moved to Minnesota in fifth grade initially playing a few seasons in the Central Minnesota Youth Soccer Association.

In seventh grade she started playing for the Sartell High School team and in eighth grade she began training with her longtime club Twin Cities Rush in Blaine.

""I wanted to play in the (Twin) Cities because I wanted more opportunities to get exposure in front of colleges and to venture out with other coaches and players"" Kloetzer said. ""More opportunities to play around the country and around the world.""

Twin Cities Rush is just one club in the larger family of Rush clubs that extend worldwide boasting more than 60 clubs in the United States and over 110 around the globe. Kloetzer plays year-round and has had chances to play with other elite Rush talent in Arizona Pennsylvania and Sweden this year.

""The kids can be a part of Sartell soccer from the time they first lace up cleats at six years old all the way through their high school experience.” - Roy Snyder director of player development for Sartell Soccer Association

""That was awesome; best trip of my life"" Kloetzer said about the 2022 Gothia Cup in Sweden. ""We got to represent USA and walk the flag around the field in front of 46000 people. Just the experience of playing other teams from around the world outside of the United States was incredible.""

Kloetzer is currently weighing options to play Division I or Division II college soccer on the east coast crediting her Rush club for her development as a player. She felt the resources and reach of a massive club like Rush was necessary for her to play soccer at the highest level.

""I've noticed tremendous growth just from playing club and then going straight into high school"" she added. ""I feel that bringing my skill into the high school level also helps other players around me get better. I also feel my leadership plays a role from my club.""

Can Central Minnesota clubs accomplish the mission of building a soccer culture on the same scale as Minneapolis?

Can Central Minnesota clubs accomplish that same mission on a smaller scale?

Work is being done to make that a reality. Emily Willaert is the current director of coaching and player development for CMYSA joining in 2015. The Mankato native played for the College of St. Benedict from 2007-11 and is entering year eight as an assistant coach on Steve Kimble's CSB staff.

The club has 25 travel teams from U9-U19 totaling nearly 1000 kids with its recreation soccer programs included.

""As soccer grows in the area they want to play at a higher and higher level"" Willaert said about growth in travel teams. ""As a club we've established our developmental curriculum − what you're going to do at each age group. We've brought in a lot of the expertise of coaches in the area: St. Cloud State St. John's St. Ben's has players and coaches that will run clinics for us. That's been invaluable to our growth as a club.""

More:What’s next for soccer in St. Cloud as the sport continues to grow in popularity?

CMYSA has also added two assistant directors of coaching: SCSU men's assistant coach Zach Neiberger and recent SCSU defender Eddie Saydee. Willaert said their passion and energy for the game is huge for the club's progress.

""They've both picked up a club team and taken on training responsibilities for our younger kids"" she said. ""Now at the U9 level our kids are training with three college coaches. ... They train with us for 12 weeks throughout the year.""

CMYSA used to be the only youth club in the area for decades but that has changed. A St. Cloud suburb has their own club the Sartell Soccer Association. A football-centric town is now home to the Cold Spring Soccer Club for rec and travel teams ranging from 4-14 years old.

“As our community becomes more diverse I think soccer is a connection that brings everybody together.” - St. Benedict head coach Steve Kimble

Roy Snyder director of player development for Sartell Soccer Association has also been the head girls soccer coach at Sartell High School since 2015. Developing talent at the youth level and keeping them within the club at older ages is a challenge Sartell faces just like CMYSA. Snyder wants Sartell Soccer Association to continue to grow so players don't feel the need to drive to Monticello or Blaine for competitive soccer.

""The kids can be a part of Sartell soccer from the time they first lace up cleats at six years old all the way through their high school experience. Hopefully that's special for them"" Snyder said. ""Do we have an environment where we can really challenge our elite players to continue to grow and still provide a good experience for (rec soocer)? Finding ways to balance that is a struggle.""

Nearly every leader in the soccer community also cited a key area that is a necessity to spur growth: coaching education.

Many of the local college coaches have taken advantage of the extensive licensing system available for coaching. Extending that further to the high school level and the next generation of coaches will only raise the level of play.

""Good coaches develop good players; if you really want to grow the game you've got to have people who are committed to learning to be really good coaches"" Snyder said. ""As more and more of our kids grow up playing high-level soccer and care about the game ... they come back and will be that next group of coaches.

""These kids will now have grown up playing soccer: that's a good foundation.""

How can St. Cloud's diverse population be integrated into club play?

The St. Cloud area has become increasingly diverse in the past decade. Just take a look at the 2020 census data.

Over 10 years every major community in the St. Cloud area saw its population of Black citizens grow by more than 100 percent. Waite Park went up 400 percent.

Remember Abdiaziz Handule who played on the Apollo state team featured in part one? He came to St. Cloud from Somalia when he was 12 already deeply ingrained in soccer culture. He’d follow his older brothers to play anywhere they could whether it was an open field or in a warehouse.

He still plays soccer often happy to see the pickup games now trend younger with new faces joining in.

But Handule never had the chance to play on a local club team playing only a year of U18 soccer on a premier team in the Twin Cities.

CMYSA is hoping to bridge that gap getting talented local players who may not have had the opportunity in the past to get into the club at an early age.

“Our board right now is really committed to our financial assistance program just trying to make soccer accessible to everyone in the area” Willaert said. “When I first started we were giving out about $1500 worth of financial aid and now we average about $15000. … It makes it easier to allow more kids to play since our price point is different.”

St. Cloud Tech and Apollo have seen large shifts in demographics at their respective high schools something that could cause division. Instead the schools have utilized their different soccer backgrounds for a common goal.

""Our biggest strength is that we have so many different players from different soccer and cultural backgrounds"" Tech head coach Dan Stoterau said. ""Everybody brings different knowledge and skills and style of play. We have a wide range of abilities. ... It makes it more fun. A real experience of getting to know people unlike ourselves.

""Coming together to achieve something great and working towards it ... (is) one of my favorite things about coaching in St. Cloud.""

College of St. Benedict head coach Steve Kimble also believes soccer has come a long way in recent years growth that can be partially attributed to the diverse population in St. Cloud.

“Soccer is such a global sport; they play in all kinds of countries” Kimble said. “As our community becomes more diverse I think soccer is a connection that brings everybody together.”

Can St. Cloud area facilities support the growth of the game - even in winter?

One of soccer's biggest challenges in Minnesota has always been Mother Nature. How do you get consistent year-round play with snow covering the ground for nearly half the year?

Domes at St. John’s University and St. Cloud State help especially for players looking for local winter training within their clubs.

Opportunities have also arisen due to construction at the College of St. Benedict and the opening of its outdoor athletic complex in 2018. The turf fields are now home to all of CMYSA’s league games also bringing divisions of the youth state tournament to St. Joseph.

St. Cloud State’s Husky stadium also has plenty of soccer history serving as the site of Apollo's state soccer title in 2014. It’s been the home for SCSU women's soccer since the 4400-seat stadium was built in 2004.

But its main tenant was the SCSU football team.

The final home game of the 2019 SCSU football season saw the Huskies fall 24-13 to MSU-Moorhead on a November afternoon. Little did anybody know that would be the final Division II football game played in St. Cloud.

Husky Stadium soon had an extra locker room available.

And a radical new project was on its way to shake up the St. Cloud sports landscape.

Through Synopsys Academic & Research Alliances (SARA) Synopsys will provide its University Software Programme which includes curriculum educational resources and the ‘Train the Trainers’ programme to SHTP to set up its chip design centre.

SHTP will invest in the IT infrastructure to set up the design centre in the next three years.

“Synopsys is known for its industry-leading semiconductor design software IP and software security solutions” said Nguyễn Anh Thi president of SHTP.

“The collaboration for SHTP chip design centre in Việt Nam can benefit from the company’s world-class design technology by cultivating our future chip designers with the latest industry trends while they are still in school. The cooperation can also help facilitate the development of Việt Nam’s semiconductor industry” Thi said.

Robert Li Synopsys sales vice president of Taiwan and South Asia said “SHTP is the innovation hub of Việt Nam’s high-tech industry and we are happy to support SHTP’s establishment of a chip design centre with Synopsys advanced technology and University programme initiatives.

“The successful development of the semiconductor industry requires teamwork among government research universities and entrepreneurs collaborating together. Synopsys will work closely with the SHTP to help fortify semiconductor industry development and further its leadership in the region” he said.

SHTP chip design centre is authorised to welcome lecturers from three universities belonging to Việt Nam National University at HCM City including HCM City University of Technology University of Science and University of Information Technology to attend the Synopsys ‘train the trainers’ programme and also do the training at SHTP chip design centre. —VNS",,,,,,,,,,,,

With help from local partners CHS is hosting a back-to-school event from 4-7:30 p.m. Wednesday August 31 for the entire school community to welcome incoming

first-year students enjoy a meal together and hold an open house and other activities.

Canby Burgerville donated 1000 burgers to the event and Cutsforth’s Market added 1200 fresh-baked cookies. With other donations from the CHS Booster Club and Sysco students and families who attend will get burgers chips cookies and water as they officially kick off a new year.

You’ve heard of back to school? Call this “beef to school.”

“I knew the Canby community was generous. I’ve always known that” said Associate Principal Kimie Carroll. “But they’re just stepping right up and not asking for anything in return. It’s just thrilling. The support just makes you want to cry because it’s such a good place to be.”

The freshmen welcome runs from 4 to 5 p.m. Families should meet near the stadium for special activities for incoming freshmen including tours and a question and answer session.

Then comes the meal for the first 1000 people from 5 to 6 p.m. and the open house from 6 to 7:30 p.m. when families will have the chance to talk with teachers in different departments and community partners like The Canby Center Student Transportation of America and the district’s nutrition services department.

Students and families can also greet new Principal Cari Sloan the former associate principal who replaced the retiring Greg Dinse this summer along with returning associate principals Carroll and Ben Winegar and new Associate Principal Megan Jackson.

The building itself will look slightly different to folks as demolition has taken place at the back of the building near the stadium in preparation for the new 50000-square-foot science and general education wing made possible by the 2020 bond.

Construction will continue until the wing’s anticipated completion in fall 2023. A real-time view of the construction process is available online here.

The companies claim that next-generation Starlink satellites set to launch next year will be able to communicate directly with phones letting you text make calls and potentially stream video even when there are no cell towers nearby. What’s more Musk promised all this is possible with phones that people are using today without consumers having to buy any extra equipment.

It’s a bold proclamation from the carrier — Verizon and AT&T don’t offer anything like it. However SpaceX and T-Mobile aren’t the only companies looking to use satellites to directly communicate with cell phones using existing cell spectrum. For years a company called AST SpaceMobile has promised that it will beam broadband to phones from space and a company called Lynk Global has already demonstrated that its satellite “cell towers” can be used to send text messages from regular phones. It’s easy to imagine that these companies would be afraid that two giants were suddenly looking to get in on a similar game — but it turns out that’s not the case at all. They actually seem delighted.

Who’s competing with SpaceX and T-Mobile in satellite-to-phone tech?

“We love the validation and the attention that this is bringing to this technology” said Lynk’s CEO Charles Miller in an interview with The Verge. “We’ve been getting all kinds of calls of carriers today who are like ‘help us!’”

Earlier this year Lynk deployed its first commercial satellite which was ferried into orbit by a SpaceX Falcon 9. Image: Lynk

Lynk’s initial goal is similar to SpaceX’s — it’s partnering with a number of carriers around the world to let their customers send texts using a satellite network it’s currently in the process of building. Like T-Mobile’s presentation Miller especially stressed the tech’s importance during emergencies and natural disasters where things like hurricanes wildfires flooding or earthquakes can take down traditional cell networks. “It’s resilience. It’s instant backup working for everybody on Earth. Your phones even though the towers are down can communicate” he said. “This will save lives.”

Miller’s pitch is very similar to Sievert’s and Musk’s but he doesn’t seem particularly worried about competing in the same space (pun intended) as them. Part of his confidence comes from Lynk being an early leader in the market — it claims that in early 2020 it became the first to send a text message to an unmodified cell phone from space. “We think there’s going to be more big companies jump in. They have years and years to go. They’re years behind us” he said. “We’re going to be like ‘wonderful! Educate the world that this technology is done.’ And when we start rolling it out at the end of this year people are going to go ‘I want it.’ They’re not going to want to wait years for it.”

Lynk SpaceX and AST all promise varying levels of connectivity

Scott Wisniewski the executive vice president and chief strategy officer at AST echoed a similar sentiment. “Our CEO actually tweeted and he said we’re happy that they’re focusing on this real big market and this real big need. And it was comforting to hear folks say things like the technology works for them” he said. He also predicted that the market for satellite-to-phone communication likely wouldn’t be winner-take-all. “In terms of the overall market it will be multiple winners in our view.”

AST’s service is perhaps more ambitious than what T-Mobile announced. Sievert said that he hopes T-Mobile will someday be able to deliver data via SpaceX’s satellites where AST’s express goal is to operate 4G and 5G networks. It’s betting that the idea of broadband will be more appealing than just being able to text and make calls from remote locations. “We all really understand that phones can go out of service quite frequently or coverage can be poor. And that was a point that was highlighted by T-Mobile. So our solution is really attractive in that regard” Wisniewski said.

Where SpaceX and T-Mobile’s plan is largely limited to the US and its territories — the wireless spectrum SpaceX is using for its service is owned and operated by other carriers and agencies internationally so additional deals are necessary for it to work anywhere outside the US — AST and Lynk have global aspirations. AST has gotten investment and a five-year exclusivity deal with Vodafone one of the world’s largest cell providers and has also received investment from Rakuten a mobile carrier in Japan. Miller says that Lynk’s testing its service in 10 countries “as we speak” and is capable of providing it in dozens more.

Even the timing of T-Mobile and SpaceX’s announcement is perfect for AST and Lynk as they tell it. The former is getting ready to launch a test satellite in just a few weeks (with five more slated for 2023) and the latter is planning on launching its commercial service with 14 network operators by the end of the year. If there was ever an ideal time for consumers to become very interested in exactly the thing you’re working on right as you're about to take a big first step might be it.

How Apple and iPhone 14 rumors fit into this puzzle

Tim Farrar an analyst at satellite and telecom-focused consulting and research firm Telecom Media and Finance Associates however thinks T-Mobile’s timing could be because another huge competitor is about to enter the market — one that could have advantages that AST SpaceX and Lynk don’t. “The issue is going to be what happens with Apple next week” he said referring to rumors that the next iPhone may be able to communicate with the Globalstar satellite network for emergency purposes.

If that happens he says iPhone users might get this feature very soon and in a version that includes international support from the start. “I think what’s likely is if Apple does announce something next week it will be something that’s ready to go as soon as the phone’s available. Because if they’re partnered with Globalstar Globalstar already has 24 satellites operating in space that you can communicate with and they have the licenses with the FCC and many other international jurisdictions.”

That last part is particularly important. All Apple has to do according to Farrar is get equipment authorization from the FCC through a “simple and well-defined” process and it’s off to the races. For the other companies — including SpaceX — who want to transmit from space using spectrum that’s licensed by cell carriers it’s not so easy. Historically satellites used satellite spectrum and cell towers used terrestrial spectrum. But Farrar says that satellite-to-cell tech mixes the two in a way that the rules currently don’t really allow for. “It’s a big regulation change for the FCC to make. And it’s something they’ve been considering for two years and not really reached a resolution.”

T-Mobile’s carrier competitors may even try to look for a way to prevent SpaceX from using the carrier’s spectrum which could complicate things further. “There’s going to be a lot of fighting over use of terrestrial spectrum on satellite” Farrar said. “There have already been interference concerns expressed when AST was looking to partner with AT&T to trial their system. None of the major wireless carriers want their rivals to gain the advantage. So clearly people will protest any application for use of T-Mobile spectrum on satellites. And the FCC will have to make a decision that which may not be reached very quickly.”

“Regulatory’s a process all of telecom is regulated.” - Scott Wisniewski

Indeed Miller wouldn’t really talk about spectrum saying that Lynk has “an open issue” with it. Wisniewski said that one of AST’s plans for dealing with spectrum issues is to work with carriers to get approval from regulators. He also said that the nature of providing service where there currently isn’t any could make things a bit easier. “We share the spectrum with mobile network operators on a noninterference basis in places where they don’t have towers.”

While AST has regulatory approval for commercial operation in seven countries according to Wisniewski the FCC has only authorized it to test its satellite to provide service to the US on an experimental basis.

As for SpaceX and T-Mobile their plans are quite a ways out giving the companies time to try and work things out with regulators — they don’t expect to even start testing their service until the end of next year.

If one company can break through with a phone that connects to satellite networks though it could potentially help all the other companies out. For example if Tim Cook gets on stage on September 7th and announces that you can send emergency satellite messages from the iPhone 14 a lot of people who don’t use iPhones are going to get real jealous real fast. That could add to pressure on the FCC to authorize the satellite-to-phone tech for carriers and their satellite communications partners. And if T-Mobile has it you know AT&T and Verizon will be making some calls. (Farrar thinks that other handset makers that don’t have as much clout as an Apple or a Samsung would have a difficult time introducing a similar feature — carriers could fight them arguing that their phones should just use the carrier’s satellite capabilities instead.)

Verizon specifically does actually already have an agreement for satellite connectivity though in a different form. It’s partnered with Amazon’s Kuiper project which aims to create a satellite constellation similar to SpaceX’s. Instead of doing direct satellite-to-phone communication though Verizon’s plan is to feed remote cell towers with satellite service instead of having to run fiber or cable to them. During the event on Thursday Sievert did say that T-Mobile was open to the possibility of doing something similar with SpaceX.

Neither Verizon nor Amazon responded to The Verge’s request for comment on whether they’d be modifying their plans based on T-Mobile and SpaceX’s announcement.

As for AST and Lynk neither company is particularly interested in competing on that front. “You don’t need to build these remote cell towers if your phone’s already connected by the satellite” said Miller.

Elon Musk let the satellite-to-phone cat out of the bag

At this point there’s really only one thing that seems totally clear: T-Mobile and SpaceX have let a genie out of the bottle. They announced loudly that soon your phone will be able to connect to satellites letting you have at least some level of communication even when you’re in areas that have traditionally been completely isolated.

There are a lot of ways things could play out from here — AST’s tests could show that yes you really can beam relatively fast internet to phones from space and raise the bar for what consumers want higher than where T-Mobile and SpaceX have set it. Or maybe regulators could suddenly figure things out letting Lynk swoop in before T-Mobile gets out of beta. And of course there’s always the possibility that everyone gets caught in a huge regulatory mess letting Apple come in and do its own thing with a completely different kind of technology.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiemh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5ld3NuYXRpb25ub3cuY29tL2J1c2luZXNzL3QtbW9iaWxlLXBhcnRuZXJzLXdpdGgtc3BhY2V4LXRvLXVzZS1zdGFybGluay1zYXRlbGxpdGVzLWZvci1tb2JpbGUtbmV0d29yay1hY2Nlc3Mv0gF-aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cubmV3c25hdGlvbm5vdy5jb20vYnVzaW5lc3MvdC1tb2JpbGUtcGFydG5lcnMtd2l0aC1zcGFjZXgtdG8tdXNlLXN0YXJsaW5rLXNhdGVsbGl0ZXMtZm9yLW1vYmlsZS1uZXR3b3JrLWFjY2Vzcy9hbXAv?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,T-Mobile partners with SpaceX to use Starlink satellites for mobile network access,"A string of SpaceX StarLink satellites pass over an old stone house near Florence Kansas in a long-exposure photo taken in May 2021.

(The Hill) – T-Mobile will partner with Elon Musk’s SpaceX and use the company’s Starlink satellites to provide mobile networks for cellphone users in remote areas both companies announced at an event Thursday.

At SpaceX’s Starbase in Boca Chica Texas Musk and T-Mobile CEO Mike Sievert said the rollout would have a huge impact on enhancing cellphone service in rural hard-to-reach areas.

Before they spoke the company executives previewed a video featuring mobile phone users who voiced concerns about the lack of cellphone reception in rural remote regions of the U.S. Some explained how their lives could be endangered in the event an accident occurs and they are unable to call for help.

Sievert said expanding network coverage into those remote areas is “important for safety important for connectivity” and “important for all of us.”

“We have all — every single one of us — driven down that windy country road through the hills and dales beyond the reach of any cellular network” the T-Mobile CEO said. “This partnership is about imagining a different future … where if you have a clear view of the sky you are connected on your mobile phone.”

T-Mobile will enter a beta phase in late 2023 with Starlink strictly for messaging and texting apps but the effort will eventually phase into more cellular services. T-Mobile also announced its intention to spread the service to rural areas across the globe.

Musk’s Starlink satellites are designed to connect high-speed internet to rural areas. The company has around 2000 satellites currently in orbit above Earth.

Providers like T-Mobile generally use cell towers to provide network service to cellphones so the technology of linking satellites for mobile network coverage is entirely new.

On Thursday Musk said T-Mobile’s network coverage will be powered by a second-generation Starlink satellite with large “extremely advanced” antennas. The satellites will only connect to cellphones when they enter a dead zone not covered by a cell tower.

T-Mobile which recently acquired Sprint and is the second-largest carrier in the U.S. said the satellite service will be included for free in most plans provided by the company.

Musk said the goal of both companies was to save lives and ensure there are “no more dead zones” across the world.

“I hope the public understands the magnitude of the announcement” the SpaceX CEO said. “This is a really massive game changer.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMigAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5saXZlbWludC5jb20vaW5kdXN0cnkvdGVsZWNvbS9zcGFjZXgtYW5kLXQtbW9iaWxlLXBsYW4tdG8tbGluay1zdGFybGluay1zYXRlbGxpdGVzLXRvLWNlbGxwaG9uZXMtMTE2NjE2OTI4NTE2NzEuaHRtbNIBhAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5saXZlbWludC5jb20vaW5kdXN0cnkvdGVsZWNvbS9zcGFjZXgtYW5kLXQtbW9iaWxlLXBsYW4tdG8tbGluay1zdGFybGluay1zYXRlbGxpdGVzLXRvLWNlbGxwaG9uZXMvYW1wLTExNjYxNjkyODUxNjcxLmh0bWw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,SpaceX and T-Mobile plan to link Starlink satellites to cellphones | Mint,"SpaceX and T-Mobile US Inc. said they plan to work together to use the rocket company’s satellites to provide connections to T-Mobile cellphones across the U.S. even in remote areas with no current wireless service.

The companies said Thursday that the new service would use Starlink satellites that SpaceX plans to launch and provide connections to U.S. consumers using wireless spectrum controlled by T-Mobile. The companies said they plan to start with a test of text-messaging services in select markets before the end of 2023.

The goal of the partnership is to provide voice and data services anywhere regardless of cell towers allowing areas not yet reached by wireless networks to get service. That would include places where cellular signals can’t reach such as the middle of a national park or a large body of water.

“It means no dead zones anywhere in the world for your cellphones"" SpaceX founder Elon Musk said at an event at SpaceX’s facility in Texas. He said the satellite signal would reach phones in people’s pockets or inside a car and could provide basic messaging connections in places hit by a natural disaster.

Mr. Musk said that the bandwidth would be limited and that the new satellite service wouldn’t supplant existing ground-based cellular services. “This is meant to provide basic coverage to areas that are completely dead"" he said.

T-Mobile Chief Executive Mike Sievert said that the company expects most current smartphones would work with the new service and that it expects the satellite service to be included free on its most popular monthly plans.

Remote areas can be expensive to reach with land-based wireless networks and contain few paying subscribers to justify the cost. Existing satellite phone services generally require handsets with large antennas and monthly plans that charge per message or minute.

The new service would use Starlink satellites as cellular towers and transmit directly back to devices on the ground. T-Mobile plans to set aside a slice of its midband spectrum for these connections. It would use the airwave frequencies in a way that they can also be used on its ground-based network.

The project faces regulatory hurdles. The Federal Communications Commission would need to sign off on SpaceX’s use of the T-Mobile spectrum a spokeswoman for the carrier said. She added that SpaceX would need to secure additional permission from the agency.

“We look forward to making our case and hearing their reaction"" the T-Mobile spokeswoman said. Representatives from the FCC couldn’t immediately be reached.

Mr. Musk said the service would use second-generation Starlink satellites that would be outfitted with large antennas that cover swaths of land that have no service. SpaceX has a pending application before the FCC to launch around 30000 of the second-generation satellites over time.

Some competing satellite operators have raised concerns about the size of that fleet or have said they oppose it. The National Aeronautics and Space Administration a SpaceX customer has registered worries that the satellites could cause more collisions in orbit.

In a recent filing with the FCC SpaceX asked the commission to approve the application for the second-generation fleet. A spokesman for SpaceX didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment.

On Thursday Mr. Musk said each Starlink satellite would cover a large area on the ground and could provide about 2 to 4 megabits per second of bandwidth to be shared across such a zone. He estimated that bandwidth could support about 1000 to 2000 voice calls at the same time within that zone.

T-Mobile and SpaceX said they want to expand their technology alliance to include wireless companies in other countries. Mr. Sievert said T-Mobile was willing to offer reciprocal roaming agreements. “We do want to work with other partners in other parts of the world"" Mr. Musk said.

The plan is ambitious partly because it will use existing phones rather than requiring new hardware and while grand in scope it will begin with texting and messaging apps. Text messages are less burdensome on a network compared with calls or streaming data.

Reaching far corners has long been a goal in wireless communications in which weather geography and economics can create engineering challenges and high costs. Cellphones connect to networks wirelessly but cell towers themselves are generally connected to fiber-optic cable that can move large amounts of data more efficiently than wireless signals.

Last year Google parent Alphabet Inc. shut down a project that used highflying balloons to provide internet access in hard-to-reach regions of the world. After a decade the effort wasn’t able to reduce cost enough to make the business viable Alphabet said.

Companies such as Lynk Global Inc. and AST SpaceMobile Inc. have been working to develop businesses using satellites to provide connections for mobile phones.

Lynk Chief Executive Charles Miller said the deal between SpaceX and T-Mobile validates Lynk’s business model. Lynk plans to launch commercial service outside the U.S. this year.

Space Exploration Technologies Corp. as SpaceX is formally known has been pushing to broaden Starlink’s reach. The company regularly uses its rockets to blast batches of Starlink satellites to orbits relatively close to Earth and it reported more than 400000 subscribers for the internet service globally in a June presentation filed with the FCC.

In addition to targeting customers needing internet service at their homes SpaceX has pursued deals with airlines and recently won the right to connect boats recreational vehicles and other moving vehicles.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMie2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJsb29tYmVyZy5jb20vbmV3cy9uZXdzbGV0dGVycy8yMDIyLTA4LTI4L3doYXQtcy1jb21pbmctYXQtYXBwbGUtcy1hYXBsLXNlcHQtNy1mYXItb3V0LWlwaG9uZS0xNC1ldmVudC1sN2Rkd2VlbtIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,What’s Coming at Apple’s (AAPL) Sept. 7 Far Out iPhone 14 Event?,"Why did this happen?

This will include everything from funding rounds to trends to an analysis of a particular space to hot takes on a particular company or phenomenon. There’s a lot of fintech news out there and it’s my job to stay on top of it — and make sense of it — so you can stay in the know. — Mary Ann

As we all know the housing market goes through cycles. Low interest rates mean more purchases and refinances. Higher interest rates mean far fewer purchases and refinances — and lots of business for fintechs operating in the real estate industry.

In 2020 historically low interest rates led to a surge in both rates and purchases. Existing home buyers rushed to alter the terms of their loans and aspiring home buyers took advantage of those low rates to purchase homes. Factor in that more people were spending more time at home than ever due to COVID shelter-in-place orders home took on new meaning. Suddenly many needed more space. Others took advantage of new remote work policies and being constrained by commutes to relocate to new homes.

This led to a boom in business for startups catering to home buyers. Companies (like digital mortgage lender Better.com) couldn’t keep up and had to go on a hiring spree to meet all the consumer demand. Venture dollars flowed into proptech after proptech.

Then 2022 came.

Mortgage interest rates which began their ascent in 2021 continued to climb…significantly. Prospective home buyers turned off by the rate surge as well as the competitive and overheated housing markets began to reconsider their plans as buying was suddenly far less appealing. At the same time as the venture market slowed dramatically and suddenly raising capital was much harder.

Layoffs in the sector began — and they took place in a range of real estate tech companies big and small. Digital mortgage lender Better.com conducted its first of four layoffs in the past nine months on December 1 2021. Its fourth layoff was scheduled to take place last week before news of it leaked to some employees and the media. (You can read my story on that here).

And real estate tech startup Reali announced last week that it had begun a shutdown and would be laying off most of its workforce on September 9.

In a press release co-founder and chairman Amit Haller said “the challenging real estate and financial market conditions and unfavorable capital-raising environment” led to the decision to wind down operations.

“Reali was one of the pioneering companies to offer the ‘buy before you sell’ and ‘cash offer’ programs to homeowners” he said in the release. “We believed deeply in benefiting the consumer foremost in every transaction.”

Readers reacted with shock that a company could burn through so much cash so fast.

Indeed a little birdie told me that six-year-old Reali had been burning through cash and is in debt as it tries to sell off parts of its business. The company did not respond to my requests for comment.

Now to be fair Reali and Better.com aren’t the only ones facing challenges in the real estate tech world. Earlier this month another “buy before you sell” startup Homeward laid off 20% of its staff. And Redfin and Compass let go of a combined 900+ people in mid-June. In February online brokerage Homie laid off about one-third of its staff or some 90 to 100 people.

While Better.com and Reali aren’t in the same exact space they both cater(ed) to home buyers. And they both apparently burned a lot of cash in 2021. In case you missed it Better.com CEO Vishal Garg was recorded — in a meeting held after the company’s first round of layoffs last year — saying: “Today we acknowledge that we over hired and hired the wrong people. And in doing that we failed. I failed. I was not disciplined over the past 18 months. We made $250 million last year and you know what we probably pissed away $200 million.”

Oof.

Frankly it’s both mind-blowing and offensive to hear of companies that can blow through enough cash to help millions of people in need like it’s nothing.

Personally I’m all about the lean-and-mean mentality. Operate capital efficiently all the time downturn or no downturn and you won’t be as panicked and sinking when the going gets tough. That means not hiring for the sake of hiring thinking long-term and not spending like there’s no tomorrow.

More fintechs are focusing on nonprofits

Last week I came across or was pitched several tidbits of news that made me realize that an increasing number of fintech companies are launching products to help nonprofits and charities more efficiently move raise and distribute more money.

First up fintech startups Highnote and GiveCard said they are partnering to help nonprofits shelters and governments issue prepaid debit cards to the “financially vulnerable” communities they serve. Via email they told me: “Studies show direct cash payments can put people on a path to permanent housing and end their reliance on predatory lenders. But buying a bunch of prepaid debit cards from the local corner store and then surveying the recipients every week to see if it’s helping isn’t a scalable solution and the lack of data is a major reason why city governments are reluctant to fund it. The tech behind Highnote allows GiveCard to rapidly deploy cards to its network of nonprofits and collect enough top-level anonymized data to figure out whether the programs are working and whether the amount or the frequency of the payments needs to be adjusted opening the possibility for more city governments to start adopting these programs.”

Los Angeles–based B Generous a self-described “fintech for good” platform has launched Donate Now Pay Later (DNPL) a new tool it says allows donors “to make contributions to their favorite nonprofits through a proprietary philanthropic credit product called a Point of Donation Loan™ (PoDL). Using Donate Now Pay Later™ B Generous says the nonprofit receives the donation immediately and the donor gets the tax receipt right away but the donor pays nothing out of pocket at the point of donation and instead pays over time with no interest costs or fees.” The goal it says is to increase average donation values for nonprofits.

It’s not only startups getting in the nonprofit space. TC’s Sarah Perez reports that “PayPal is expanding further into the charitable donations business with its August 25 launch of support for Grant Payments. The new product has been created in partnership with National Philanthropic Trust (NPT) and Vanguard Charitable and allows Donor-Advised Fund (DAF) sponsors community foundations and other grantmakers to move their donations electronically through PayPal’s platform.” Notably Sarah adds that PayPal cited “a sizable market in charitable giving as a reason for entering this space with a new product.”

Fintech for good? Love it.

Weekly News

Within half a year of going to market with its bill pay feature Ramp went from launch to more than $1 billion in annualized bill pay volume according to co-founder and CEO Eric Glyman. Last week he told me that Ramp has now added financing and overlay to its bill pay product with a new offering called Flex. With the new Flex feature customers will have the option “in one click” to add financing to pay the money back up to 30 60 or 90 days later for a fee while the vendor “gets paid right away.” Besides the extra time bill pay gives the business the flexibility to pay any way they wish or the vendor requires including via ACH check or card. Read more by me here.

Natasha Mascarenhas broke the news that Argyle which at one point aimed to be the “Plaid for employment records” has laid off 6.5% of its staff — five months after raising a $55 million Series B. The company blamed the decision on a move upstream to serve more enterprise customers rather than SMBs (sound familiar? Ahem Brex). Yet it’s still hiring. Confused? So were we. But we can only infer that it needs to hire more people with enterprise experience and let go of those with smaller company–focused skill sets.

News that T. Rowe Price cut the value of its stake in fintech giant Stripe made headlines last week the new data point coming in the wake of similar cuts by other investment houses regarding their ownership in late-stage startups. However while it is true that T. Rowe Price reduced the value of its stake in Stripe part of its Global Technology Fund the latest reduction in its worth is not unique. Not only has Fidelity disclosed that it now values its Stripe shares at a discount to prior marks but the latest T. Rowe Price news also comes after a similar cut in March. But the company is not the only fintech under pressure Alex Wilhelm and I write in this piece. Meanwhile at least one VC wants to cash in on Stripe’s lowered valuation. Homebrew’s Hunter Walk tweeted: “pls let me know if you find anyone selling preferred shares at this latest valuation because I’d like to purchase.”

“Google Wallet is now available in South Africa the first market for this product in Africa to make it easy for users to save and easily and securely access their payment cards loyalty cards and boarding passes” reported Annie Njanja.

MANTL a provider of account origination solutions has partnered with Alliant Credit Union — a $17 billion digital financial institution — to expand into the credit union market with MANTL for Credit Unions. Via email the company said the software was designed to improve application conversion rates and reduce the time to open new or additional accounts.

Personal finance company MX announced that Wes Hummel — who previously served as PayPal’s vice president of site reliability and cloud engineering — has been named chief technology officer (CTO) of MX. The company told TechCrunch Hummel joins MX just weeks after Jim Magats also formerly of PayPal was named CEO of the company.

Melanie Perkins and her husband Cliff Obrecht tech darlings and founders of DIY graphic design platform Canva no longer feature on Bloomberg's real-time list of the 500 wealthiest billionaires.

Last year the Perth sweethearts topped the Australian Financial Review's Young Rich List with a combined wealth of $16.5 billion while the value of their company reached a staggering $54.5 billion.

However Canva's valuation has almost halved after suffering a series of mark-downs from major investors and a substantial sell-off in listed tech companies.

Global investment company T.Rowe Price dropped its valuation of Canva by 30 per cent on August 25 - its second mark-down since the beginning of the year.

The fund slashed the company's valuation by a total of 44 per cent which has downgraded Canva's worth to $32.1 billion according to the Australian Financial Review.

Australian venture capital funds Square Peg Capital Blackbird Ventures and AirTree Ventures followed suit and dropped Canva's valuation by 36 per cent.

A Canva spokesperson told Daily Mail Australia the company is not distracted by 'short-term changes in the market' and is confident its valuation will rebound.

'Our team is hype focused on continuing to deliver new products and category expansion opportunities that will grow and strengthen our long-term value' Canva spokesperson said.

'We're confident that no matter the market conditions we'll exceed our current valuation in the not-too-distant future.

'We're using this period to continue to double down on efforts like internationalisation new product offerings and the incredible opportunities ahead as we accelerate our efforts in teams and workplaces.

'While the overall market is turbulent our growth trajectory remains unchanged and our metrics continue to move in the right direction.'

The spokesperson said the company has received 'more interest than ever' with over 700 new staff members and more than 200000 job applications in the last six months.

Canva was founded in 2013 by Ms Perkins and Mr Obrecht alongside Tasmanian developer Cameron Adams.

The online graphic design company boasts over 85 million monthly active users across 190 countries.

Ms Perkins and Mr Obrecht each own about 15 per cent of Canva and have lost $3.1 billion each as a result of the drop in the company's valuation.

The pair are still expected to hold top spot on the Australian Financial Review's Young Rich List despite their combined wealth falling to $10.89 billion.

Gamers have been desperate for information on the newest Grand Theft Auto game.

But when reports emerged that the next instalment of the videogame franchise — in which hardened criminals wreak havoc with car chases gunfights and plenty of curse words — will co-star a playable female character a wave of negativity on social media and YouTube soon followed.

""The fat feminists have gone too far now"" said one YouTuber.

""I can guarantee you if it's some woke bullshit there's no way that this is going to outsell GTA 5"" lamented another.

According to a report from Bloomberg's Jason Schreier  the sequel to 2013's Grand Theft Auto 5 will feature a Latina woman as one of the game's main characters. She'll be one half of a pair of characters inspired by the real-life criminal duo Bonnie and Clyde.

The report also said that developer studio Rockstar Games is tweaking the next game's humour. Previous GTA games drew criticism for jokes some labelled as sexist racist and transphobic . Rockstar has apparently committed to not ""punch down"" on marginalized communities as much as in past instalments.

""People like me have been very excited [for the new release].... But unfortunately as is the way of the gaming community some people have been a lot more negative"" said Eleni Thomas a writer for the gaming and pop culture site Dexerto.

""There has been a lot of sexism as a result of this — things like people posting you know potential first mission ideas ... for the female protagonist to wash the dishes.""

The report on the upcoming Grand Theft Auto as well as the rocky reaction to it among some gamers and commentators online is yet another example of the polarized discussion between fans eager for a fresh take on a long-running franchise and others resistant to more inclusive iterations of their favourite games.

Female leads more common today

According to Schreier's report the new game is at least two years away from release. Rockstar and its publishing company Take Two Interactive previously confirmed the new game is in the works but have not released any other details.

The Bloomberg story cited more than 20 unnamed current and former Rockstar employees; the notoriously media-shy company did not make an official comment.

Day 6 9:58 Grand Theft Auto 6 and the first female protagonist shaking things up

The report notes a possibly significant shift said Thomas considering the series hasn't had a playable female character since at least before 2001's Grand Theft Auto 3.

Since then game series with women and non-white protagonists have risen in popularity such as The Last of Us and Horizon.

But as big as those games may be arguably none of them have the cultural cachet of Grand Theft Auto a series that has grossed billions of dollars since its debut in 1997. Even now GTA 5 which launched nearly 10 years ago still makes the monthly bestseller charts.

""Grand Theft Auto is an older franchise and I think in some ways ... it represents sort of what the gaming culture used to be"" Thomas said. ""It was at that point in time more male-driven more male-dominated ... the industry the community and the players themselves.""

Saints Row stumbles

Just this week another game series attempted to refresh itself with mixed results.

Saints Row is the fifth in a series that debuted in 2006 as a competitor to the GTA games. Critics originally labelled it a GTA ""clone"" given its similar mission structure and tone. Later sequels differentiated themselves with a greater emphasis on slapstick comedy and science-fiction twists.

Early trailers revealed the new instalment — the first in nine years — would be a hard reboot breaking away from the previous numbered sequels.

Gone were the previous games' cool guys and hot girls wielding a giant purple sex toy like a baseball bat. Replacing them was a quartet of millennial ne'er-do-wells who spend their off-time playing board games and singing karaoke.

The new cast is distinctly non-white and players can customize the appearance and voice of The Boss whom they control throughout the game including options for male female and gender-neutral features (as well as prosthetic limbs).

Like the Grand Theft Auto reports some fans did not take the changes well. Critical reviews didn't show much love for the game either. Saints Row currently holds a 63-69 per cent average on the reviews aggregator site Metacritic.

""The characters are not ... in the top-10 list of reasons why the Saints Row reboot doesn't work for me"" said Jordan Middler who called the game ""a painfully generic open-world malaise "" in his review for Video Games Chronicle.

'Pointless culture war'

Middler worries however that the discourse surrounding the game's new cast may drown out discussion over its actual weaknesses.

""When games are revealed these days a certain small segment of the audience senses any kind of change that could be perceived as ammo in this ongoing pointless culture war that the game could somehow 'go woke' or anything like that"" he said.

New takes on Saints Row Grand Theft Auto and other games are simply a reflection of the fact that the people making them are aware of certain cultural shifts says merritt k. managing editor at gaming site Fanbyte.

""The conversations and discussions around you know social dynamics around race around sexuality around gender — all this stuff has changed ... a lot in mainstream spaces over the past decade"" she said. ""These conversations have become much more mainstream.""

In a column  merritt wrote that the fervour of the debate ahead of Saints Row's launch was divided into two camps: people who were hoping the game would fail and those who argued that its financial success would mean a victory for progressive politics and representation.

""People do sometimes look at video games like Saints Row and think oh this is a barometer for the culture war and is my side winning or is the other side winning"" merritt told Day 6.

""Video games obviously like any media can tell important stories and can make people feel seen and can facilitate human connection. But you know buying a game isn't fighting in a culture war and isn't necessarily a political act.""

Ultimately the negative critical response to Saints Row may put a greater onus on the next Grand Theft Auto game to knock it out of the park.

""I think that's the biggest thing that Rockstar have to do ... just make sure that [the new heroine] isn't just a one-dimensional character"" Thomas said.

""Prove the naysayers wrong by creating a character that even the people who have some hesitations ultimately fall in love with. I think that's the best way to respond.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiSWh0dHBzOi8vZnJvbnRvZmZpY2VzcG9ydHMuY29tL25ld3NsZXR0ZXIvcmVkZWZpbmluZy13aGF0LWdvbGYtbG9va3MtbGlrZS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Redefining What Golf Looks Like,"Read in Browser POWERED BY Hi this is Justin Byers writer at Front Office Sports. I live in Indianapolis and grew up during a time when Tiger Woods was pretty much the only representation for people who look like me in professional golf. Things have changed and there continues to be more visibility for people from all walks of life who love the game. This piece is about some of the high-profile celebrities and global brands helping make that possible. Let’s keep the conversation going on Twitter. You can find me at @Justin_A_Byers. The Changing Culture of Golf Tom R. Smedes/Special to RGJ Professional golf wasn’t integrated for over 60 years — not until 1961 when a PGA clause stating only white players could play for the Tour was eliminated. The Masters — golf’s most prestigious tournament — didn’t feature a Black player until 1975 when Lee Elder teed off at Augusta National Golf Club at the age of 40. Tiger Woods continued to move the needle as the first Black player to win the Masters in 1997 in addition to being the tournament’s youngest winner ever at 21-years-old. In the 25 years since then we’ve seen milestones like Hideki Matsuyama winning his own green jacket in 2021 and Michelle Wie West qualifying for an LPGA event at age 12 back in the early 2000s. Here are some more people and places pushing golf even further forward. Steph Takes a Swing Four-time NBA champion two-time NBA MVP and eight-time NBA All-Star Stephen Curry is helping those underrepresented in the sport reach their full potential. In April the NBA superstar announced the launch of UNDERRATED Golf which will select 24 boys and girls to compete in a tour championship that will end with the “Curry Cup.” UNDERRATED Golf will provide all-expense-paid meals travel and hotel accommodations.

It will also give players access to elite PGA Tour courses. The reigning NBA Finals MVP has a track record of investments aimed at facilitating diversity in golf. In 2019 Curry made a seven-figure donation to fund a men’s and women’s golf program at Howard University one of the nation’s Historically Black Colleges and Universities. A Sport Fore Everyone Golf has also caught on with another member of the NBA fraternity former Sixth Man of the Year J.R. Smith. The two-time NBA champion — who was drafted out of high school in 2004 — is currently an athlete on North Carolina A&T’s men’s golf team. Smith was named NC A&T’s 2021-22 Academic Athlete of the Year and has since secured an NIL deal with athleisure giant Lululemon as a brand ambassador. On a similar note Los Angeles rapper ScHoolboy Q’s love and appreciation of the sport caught the attention of Nike. The company — which shuttered its golf equipment business in 2016 after failing to turn a profit in 20 years after revenue fell to $706 million in 2016 down from $769 million in FY2015 — featured ScHoolboy Q in an advertising campaign about Tiger Woods and his impact on golf. ScHoolboy Q brought his talents to the 2022 AT&T Pebble Beach Pro-Am in February where he competed with a handicap of 11 while being paired with pro golfer Daniel Berger.

Rapper Macklemore also participated in the event with pro Lanto Griffin. The Grammy-winning “Thrift Shop” artist recently launched Bogey Boys a golf-focused lifestyle and apparel brand.

also participated in the event with pro Lanto Griffin. The Grammy-winning “Thrift Shop” artist recently launched Bogey Boys a golf-focused lifestyle and apparel brand. Even 21 Savage another Grammy Award winner has picked up clubs and hit the course. (He needs a lot of practice.) Video game publisher 2K — a subsidiary of Take-Two Interactive — is also moving representation of diverse players and fans to the forefront. 2K’s “PGA Tour 2K23” gaming title will feature Woods on its cover and will have Michael Jordan as a playable character when it hits the market on Oct. 14. The commercial 2K rolled out this week promoting the release starred ScHoolboy Q WWE superstar Mike “The Miz” Mizanin golf media personality Tisha Alyn “Happy Gilmore” actor Christopher McDonald 100 Thieves CEO Nadeshot and Woods. Creating Opportunity The nonprofit Advocates Professional Golf Association (APGA) aims to prepare minority golfers to compete at the highest level. Established in 2010 the APGA has hosted and operated pro golf tournaments across the country while offering player development and mentoring programs. “Having programs and being hands-on you’ll see a positive outcome for these kids with the life-changing experiences that they get” APGA player Kamaiu Johnson who was awarded an opportunity to play in last year’s PGA Farmers Insurance Open told Front Office Sports. The APGA Tour will host 18 professional tournaments in 2022.

More than $800000 is collectively up for grabs  in addition to $30000 available through the Lexus Cup Bonus pool. The recent Cisco Invitational Baltusrol had a $125000 purse.

 in addition to $30000 available through the Lexus Cup Bonus pool. The recent Cisco Invitational Baltusrol had a $125000 purse. The APGA Tour also gives players a chance to earn a special exemption to participate in PGA Tour events such as the Ascension Charity Classic and the Farmers Insurance Open. The organization secured support for its mission in May through a deal with Cisco which is also supporting five members of the APGA Tour individually too. The sponsored team consists of Kevin Hall Aaron Beverly Troy Taylor Olajuwon Ajanaku and Kamaiu Johnson — who won the 2022 Master APGA Tour Championship on Aug. 9 taking home $50000 with a one-shot victory at TPC San Antonio. “For me it has been life-changing to have Cisco involved” Beverly told Front Office Sports. “I was working at a golf course full-time five-to-six days a week 10 hours a day to provide a way to play. Since Cisco came along I was able to quit that job and just focus on playing golf.” Whether it’s through the APGA donations from athletes like Curry or “PGA Tour 2K23” getting as much marketing love as “NBA 2K23” — the landscape of golf is undoubtedly changing.

It quickly gained a lot of die-hard fans thanks to its strong plot cinematic elements and sophisticated gameplay.

Vávra drew heavily on his favourite film Goodfellas (know as Mafiáni in Czech) for inspiration. The narration style played a big part in the success of the game which is interspersed throughout with humorous and satirical mafia scenes. In Czechia the excellent sales figures also owed some of their success to the famous actors that voiced the characters such as Marek Vašut Petr Rychlý and Dalimil Klapka.

Over two million copies of the game have been sold to date and in an online auction on Czech site Aukro the original unboxed PC version of the first Mafia game sold for CZK 60900.

Thanks to the success of the game foreign video game developers started to become interested in the Brno company and at the start of 2008 it was acquired by American giant Take-Two Interactive Software and renamed 2K Czech.

In 2010 a second equally successful sequel came out which sold almost 3.5 million copies worldwide. The third and final instalment was released in 2016 and sales surpassed both of the previous two games.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiT2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZvb2wuY29tL2ludmVzdGluZy8yMDIyLzA4LzI3L3Nob3VsZC15b3UtYnV5LWVsZWN0cm9uaWMtYXJ0cy1zdG9jay_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Should You Buy Electronic Arts Stock?,"EA offers the right mix of games to deliver consistent growth.

Video game producer Electronic Arts (EA 0.02%) has performed well for investors in 2022. The stock has significantly outpaced the S&P 500 index year to date down only 4% compared to the index decline of 13%.

The video game industry is attractive for investors because of the ability of the most popular games to keep players entertained and spending money on content updates for long stretches of time. EA's top games are delivering exactly that in a challenging economic environment.

Here are three reasons to consider buying the stock now.

1. Live services growth

The most important indicator of how well a video game company is keeping players engaged with certain titles is the money they spend on extra content while playing a game. Companies use different terms for in-game spending but EA calls it live services.

Live services refer to what games have become in the gaming industry. Games are no longer one-time sale opportunities; they are year-round services. Players stick with the same game for months at a time playing online with friends and that means lucrative sales opportunities for digitally delivered content updates.

EA includes several items in its live services revenue such as subscriptions extra content and other revenue earned outside the base games. The extra-content portion of live services such as in-game spending nearly doubled to $3.9 billion over the last four years according to Statista.

EA expects total bookings for fiscal 2023 to grow 6% year over year to about $8 billion so growth in extra content will serve as an important driver.

EA's FIFA and Apex Legends games are key contributors of extra-content sales that still have opportunities to grow. The interest in soccer globally has been a key momentum driver of FIFA. The best-selling soccer title just completed a record first quarter in Asia and management is looking to build on that momentum with the upcoming release of FIFA 23.

2. Apex Legends is on fire

EA's player network grew to nearly 600 million players in the fiscal first quarter of 2023. The growth stands out against the decline in monthly active users at rival game producer Activision Blizzard which has seen its player base decline to 361 million from 408 million in the same quarter last year.

Apex Legends has been stiff competition for Activision's Call of Duty over the last year. In the second quarter Activision reported a decline in in-game bookings which the company credited to lower spending in Call of Duty: Vanguard compared to the previous release in the series.

Meanwhile Apex Legends has experienced consistent growth since launching in early 2019. The number of viewers that watch others play the game on Amazon's Twitch streaming platform has increased from fewer than 20000 in 2019 to nearly 100000 this year according to Statista.

The growing viewership on Twitch mirrors the game's contribution to EA's top line. Apex Legends posted double-digit growth in net bookings in the last quarter and EA just launched a mobile version of the game which should keep interest growing.

3. The best value in gaming

EA has the right mix of sports action shooters and lifestyle games (e.g. The Sims) to deliver consistent returns for investors. The company seems to have established a nice rhythm of releasing frequent content updates for its games that encourages players to keep coming back for more. This gives EA recurring revenue streams that are particularly valuable during challenging economic times.

The stock trades at a modest valuation of just 17 times forward earnings estimates. That is a discount to the S&P 500 average price-to-earnings multiple of 21. The relatively lower valuation makes EA the best value among the top video game stocks right now.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm55dGltZXMuY29tL2ludGVyYWN0aXZlLzIwMjIvMDgvMjcvc2NpZW5jZS9uYXNhLW1vb24tYXJ0ZW1pcy1sYXVuY2guaHRtbNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,How 3 NASA Missions Could Send Astronauts Back to the Moon (Published 2022),"A graphic showing the different paths of the three Artemis moon missions.

A graphic showing the different paths of the three Artemis moon missions.

Since the final Apollo mission in 1972 the moon has been undisturbed by human footsteps. But that may soon change. NASA plans to send astronauts back to the moon this decade in a series of spaceflights called the Artemis program.

The first mission which concluded Sunday was a test flight with no crew members aboard. Eventually though no earlier than 2025 NASA plans to send astronauts for a weeklong stay near the moon’s south pole. The crew will include the first woman and the first person of color to walk on the moon NASA said.

Instead of crew members the first Artemis mission carried three mannequins named Helga Zohar and Commander Moonikin Campos. Helga and Zohar contain plastic models of radiation-sensitive organs such as the uterus and the lungs so that scientists can study how radiation in space may affect future astronauts.

The three mannequins traveled inside a spacecraft called Orion specially designed to protect human crew members and experiments in space.

The polar region is home to mysterious permanently shadowed craters that have not seen sunlight in billions of years. The chemicals frozen inside could help scientists understand more about the history of the moon and the solar system.

If the Artemis III mission succeeds NASA plans to regularly send crews to the moon. Its plans include a lunar base camp and an outpost spacecraft called Gateway stationed in lunar orbit."

(Express photo)

India will require an economy-wide investment of $10.1 trillion from now if it is to achieve its net-zero emissions target by 2070 according to a report released by former Australian prime minister Kevin Rudd and others in New Delhi on Friday.

According to the ‘Getting India to Net Zero’ report the investment required will be $13.5 trillion if the target is to be met by 2050. The report also says achieving net-zero by 2070 would boost annual GDP by up to 4.7% by 2036 and create as many as 15 million new jobs by 2047.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMieWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxpdmVtaW50LmNvbS9tYXJrZXQvaG93LWRvZXMtdGhlLW9wZW4tb2ZmZXItcHJvdmlkZXMtYW4tZXhpdC1vcHRpb24tZm9yLXRoZS1zaGFyZWhvbGRlcnMtMTUxNjYxMzM5NjMwNDA5Lmh0bWzSAX1odHRwczovL3d3dy5saXZlbWludC5jb20vbWFya2V0L2hvdy1kb2VzLXRoZS1vcGVuLW9mZmVyLXByb3ZpZGVzLWFuLWV4aXQtb3B0aW9uLWZvci10aGUtc2hhcmVob2xkZXJzL2FtcC0xNTE2NjEzMzk2MzA0MDkuaHRtbA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Open offer: What is it and how does it provides an exit option for the shareholders | Mint,"An open offer is a secondary market offering that enables current owners in a firm to buy new shares in the company on a pre-emptive basis at a price lower than the prevailing market value.

Okay wait but what is pre-emptive basis?

Pre-emption is a concept that is often implemented by ensuring each current shareholder's minimum entitlement which is based on their existing investment in the company prior to the offer.

If any promoters of a company choose to expand their stake if non-promoters wish to increase their stake to 15% or if the company wishes to delist from the stock exchange an open offer may be made.

Let us understand it with an example.

Imagine you are a shareholder of company X and own 100 shares. Now the company announces an open offer and for every five shares you already own you can purchase an additional one. So that equals 20 shares.

Let's say the company decides to sell the shares for Rs. 10 each rather than the prevailing market price of Rs. 20. As a result you can acquire 20 shares for Rs. 200 in total saving you Rs. 200 compared to the market price.

In India an open offer is often activated when a company buys up to 15% of the shares of another listed company. In such circumstances an open offer to buy an additional 20% of the company's shares will be made to the current shareholders.

In the event that current shareholders of the acquired company anticipate potential hazards as a result of changes in the management and business they are also granted the benefit of an exit option.

Now that you are clear on what is an open offer another important question is how is it done.

How is an open offer made?

An acquirer must make a public announcement before making an open offer. This announcement must include the offer price the number of shares that will be purchased from the public the reason for the acquisition the identity of the acquirer future plans information about the target company the process for accepting the shares and the timeframe for this.

Within 15 days of the offer's closure the purchaser must pay the consideration to the shareholders. The acquirer is liable to pay interest on the amount for any delays.

Having learned the fundamentals of an open offer can you remember where you most recently heard about it?

Yes the ongoing saga of acquisition of NDTV shares by the Adani Group Company. As required by regulations Adani Group announced an open offer to purchase an additional 26% from the company's public shareholders for Rs. 294 per share after acquiring 29.18% of broadcaster NDTV.

Bank Maha Pack includes Live Batches Test Series Video Lectures & eBooks

Committee Members:

The commission has four members — former Australian prime minister Kevin Rudd former United Nations secretary general Ban Ki-Moon former vice chairman of Niti Aayog Arvind Panagariya and global head and director of Climate Business International Finance Corporation Vivek Pathak. The commission launched the “Getting India to Net Zero” report on Friday which said India achieving net zero by 2070 would boost annual GDP by up to 4.7 per cent by 2036.

The Other Benefits:

Net zero will also bring notable benefits for Indians. The transition will see a net increase in employment opportunities creating 15 million jobs beyond a baseline scenario by 2047. Households could save as much as $9.7 billion in energy costs by 2060 it said. Yet achieving net zero emissions will require India to grapple with a series of challenges the foremost being finance: according to the modelling India will need around $10.1 trillion in cumulative economy-wide investment to meet its 2070 target. While India could de-carbonise using carbon revenues or other domestic tax-raising mechanisms to fund green investments leveraging international support would free up domestic finance for development poverty reduction and management of social impacts helping mitigate the negative impacts on households from higher prices and taxes the commission said.

Key Recommendations:

The report comes ahead of a pivotal moment for Asian and Indian leadership especially with India assuming the G20 presidency in 2023 and the Asia Pacific Group hosting COP28. At the 26th Conference of Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change in Glasgow last year Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced that India will achieve net zero emissions by 2070. Net zero means achieving a balance between the greenhouse gases put into the atmosphere and those taken out. The commission said policies especially to boost renewables and electrification could make net zero possible by mid-century. “Ending new coal as soon as possible by 2023 and transitioning from unabated coal power by 2040 would be particularly impactful for reaching net zero emissions closer to mid-century” it said.

What The Members Pointed:

Rudd said “India’s net zero ambitions are not just important for the global fight against climate change they can also be a boon for the country’s own sustainable and inclusive development.”

Ban Ki-moon the current president and chair of the Global Green Growth Institute said “The time is ripe for India to formalise and implement its 2030 and 2070 emission targets and to continue to strengthen them. India is already feeling some of the worst impacts from emissions and pollution with extreme heat floods premature deaths and more.”

Panagariya said India promises to emerge not only as a model for healthy sustainable and strong economic growth but also as a global manufacturing hub for the global net-zero economy. As the host of the G20 in 2023 India can showcase its action and encourage other countries to follow suit cooperate and invest he added.

What Is Net Zero:

Net zero refers to a state in which the greenhouse gases going into the atmosphere are balanced by removal out of the atmosphere. The term net zero is important because – for CO2 at least – this is the state at which global warming stops. The Paris Agreement underlines the need for net zero. It requires states to ‘achieve a balance between anthropogenic emissions by sources and removals by sinks of greenhouse gases in the second half of this century’.

In his speech at the ceremony PM Modi said that by blending ethanol with petroleum the nation has saved Rs 50000 crore in foreign exchange outflows over the past seven to eight years. He added that this facility will offer a long-term solution to the issue of farm stubble burning.



What is 2G Ethanol?

A renewable fuel derived from diverse plant resources referred to as biomass ethanol is an organic chemical molecule. First generation (1G) ethanol is made from raw resources such as cereals sugarcane juice and molasses but second generation (2G) ethanol plants use extra biomass and agricultural residues.

Carbon dioxide emissions are decreased when ethanol is blended with petrol. The increase in car fuel volume and consequent decrease in dependence on foreign oil helps India get closer to its objective of energy security.

In June of this year India met its goal of a 10% blending average nationwide five months earlier than expected. The National Biofuel Policy 2018 was later modified by the government which among other things moved the 2030 target date for the 20% ethanol blend target in petrol to 2025–2026. The government has also changed regulations to enable more feedstock for biofuel production in an effort to increase production.

Why 2g ethanol plant?

The plant based on innovative technology is close to the Panipat refinery and was constructed by the Indian Oil Corporation at a cost of more than Rs 900 crore. It plans to use roughly 2 lakh tonnes of agricultural waste (rice straw) per year to produce about 3 crore litres of ethanol.

According to the Indian Express by restricting the burning of rice straw the project will eliminate GHGs by about 3 lakh tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent emissions per year (crop residue). Simply put according to the government this is the same as taking 63000 cars off the country's roads annually.

The plant's main source of raw materials for ethanol production would be paddy straw. It will facilitate paddy straw management and lessen the requirement for on-site administration.

How is it going to be beneficial for farmers?

Blending ethanol provides advantages beyond lowering emissions particularly when using 2G ethanol. Stubble can be disposed of at the biofuel plant without burning it.

Farmers will now have a profitable alternative to burning stubble which has been raising pollution levels every year to dispose of the waste. It gives the agricultural crop waste a purpose and might provide extra revenue for farmers.



Along the entire value chain the ethanol production facilities will also generate employment.

According to the government finding a purpose for agri-crop residue would provide farmers more leverage and give them a chance to generate additional income. It also states that the project would create indirect employment across the supply chain for the cutting handling and storage of rice straw in addition to direct employment for those involved in the running of the factory.

In his list of five advantages for the plant the PM stated that the first benefit would be a reduction in stubble burning.

The second benefit is that new transportation infrastructure biofuel plants and mechanisms for cutting and disposing of stubble will all create new job possibilities in these areas. The third benefit would be that the farmers' burdensome stubble would become a source of additional income for them"" said PM Modi cited by the Indian express.

The fourth benefit is that pollution will be lowered and farmers' involvement in environmental protection will grow. According to the Indian Express he added ""the fifth benefit will be that the country will also obtain an alternate fuel.""

Buying the Slowest Tesla

The Model 3 started off at $35000 when it was announced in 2016. That's still a lot of money for most people. We have a video from someone who bought the slowest Tesla and this was his experience.

Tailosive EV show his experience getting gas in his car and then he drives to the Tesla service center after waiting for a few years to order his Tesla Model 3 RWD. Nobody knows he is getting this car and he went to go pick it up. Ironically he had to get gas in order to go to the delivery center.

He was hoping that the vehicle doesn't have any major issues. When I went to get mine it had no issues and I think that is the experience most people are having. You only hear the odd story of someone the rare case who has issues with their new Tesla.

He drove up to the service center and went to find a place to park. He was looking at all the Tesla's parked and knew that one of them was going to be his. He found the car with 18 inch wheels and found out that it was his. He saw that the car had an excellent build quality there were no major gaps. The glass looked nice on top. This was all the same experience I had with my car.

Driving for the First Time

They looked over everything and found one very slight panel misalignment. It was nothing major though. They bought extra wipes for the inside of the car and a screen protector for the center console screen. After getting in they adjusted the steering wheel and mirrors.

Everything is setup from the center console. The car had 5 miles on it at delivery most likely because at the factory they drove the car a bit to make sure it was working. They could upgrade to Tesla FSD from the center console screen.

He and his wife found the romance setting and checked everything connected their phones and went for their first initial drive. You just shift and put your foot on the accelerator and go. The car is very quiet and smooth.

He let off the accelerator and the regenerative braking was very strong. The car still accelerates very strongly. He was expecting the RWD to feel lighter and the regenerative braking not to be as strong. It felt very similar to the long range Model 3.

The base model still picks up speed very fast and is a comfortable drive. It's very quiet inside the car. This was my experience as well.

What did you think of this guy's first purchase and drive of his Model 3? Would you get a Model 3?

If you can't quickly move out of the way or somehow alert the driver your car is likely to get damaged and that's precisely what happened here. In fact this bus ended up backing right up over the front of the Tesla Model 3.

The video above has a number of interesting clips that can teach drivers valuable lessons. This is because it includes footage from Tesla's built-in dashcam (TeslaCam) and camera-based Sentry Mode security system. As you'll see the footage can prove helpful for teaching drivers what to do and more importantly what not to do.

As the story goes Tesla Model 3 owner Kane pulled up behind a school bus at a stop sign. He didn't leave much space and he had nowhere to go when the school bus driver started backing up. Clearly the bus driver had no idea the Tesla was right behind it which may not have been the case if Kane wasn't pulled up so close.

Since Kane couldn't back away from the situation and he was too close to the school bus to sneak out by moving forward he had to watch as the bus drove right up onto his Model 3's frunk. The whole front end of the car and the windshield were crushed by the impact and the weight of the bus.

According to Kane's story the bus driver realized the bus wasn't in the correct lane to make a left turn. Rather than proceeding forward or going right and turning around the driver decided to back up and move into the left lane.

Fortunately no one was injured but the Model 3 was deemed a total loss. Kane ordered a Tesla Model S Plaid to replace it and now he's waiting for his new car.

Aside from the school bus footage there are 25 other crazy incidents to watch in the video above. Wham Baam Teslacam notes that Tesla drivers are put to the test in a number of ways in this episode which puts an emphasis on Tesla Autopilot bad drivers and hit-and-run crashes.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZvb2wuY29tL2ludmVzdGluZy8yMDIyLzA4LzI3L3dpbGwtdGVzbGEtYmUtd29ydGgtbW9yZS10aGFuLWFwcGxlLWJ5LTIwMzAv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Will Tesla Be Worth More Than Apple by 2030?,"The electric vehicle specialist's growth has outpaced that of the world's largest company in recent years.

Shares of Tesla (TSLA -2.04%) have shot up by nearly 15000% over the past decade as the disruptive company established itself as the leading player in the electric vehicle (EV) space.

That remarkable upward run has brought Tesla's market capitalization to $930 billion as of this writing making it the sixth-largest public company in the world. Apple (AAPL -0.69%) meanwhile is the world's largest company with a market cap of nearly $2.7 trillion. Tesla has a long way to go if it's going to catch up to the iPhone maker. Could the EV leader manage it by 2030?

Tesla is growing at a faster pace than Apple

Starting from a far smaller base Tesla's market cap has increased at a much faster pace than Apple's over the past decade.

The eye-popping growth of Elon Musk's company isn't too surprising as it operates in a market that is still taking off. Apple on the other hand reaps nearly half of its revenue from selling smartphones the market for which has already matured.

For instance in 2021 sales of EVs doubled year over year to a record 6.6 million units according to the International Energy Agency. The impressive growth has continued in 2022 when 2 million EVs were sold in the first quarter alone -- a 75% jump over the prior-year period. On the other hand according to research firm Gartner smartphone sales increased by 6% in 2021. On the one hand that small increase brought unit sales to 1.43 billion devices. On the other the industry has run into trouble in 2022 with sales down 9% year over year in the second quarter due to a combination of oversupply and inflation.

The respective health of the EV and the smartphone markets is naturally reflected in Tesla's and Apple's latest results. Tesla's total revenue shot up 43% year over year to $16.9 billion in the second quarter. Adjusted earnings jumped 57% year over year to $2.27 per share driven by fatter margins. Tesla's non-GAAP operating margin was up 358 basis points over the year-ago quarter to 14.6% thanks to an increase in the average selling price of its vehicles.

Apple's growth was nowhere near that rapid but that's not surprising given its massive scale. For its fiscal 2022 third quarter which ended June 25 Apple's revenue increased 2% year over year to $83 billion. That was nearly five times Tesla's revenue. With a sales base that huge even a multibillion-dollar top-line gain would translate into a small increase in percentage terms.

But at the same time it is also worth noting that the pace of growth in Tesla's end market is far greater than is occurring in Apple's end markets. That's where Tesla's advantage lies.

Can the EV specialist eclipse the world's largest company by the end of the decade?

Sales of EVs are expected to grow at a rapid pace through 2030. AlixPartners estimates that a third of all vehicles sold by 2028 will be EVs with the proportion increasing to 54% by 2035. That would be a big jump over the first quarter of 2022 when EVs accounted for 10% of global vehicle sales. With overall vehicle sales expected to jump to 122.8 million units in 2030 from 85.3 million units in 2020 Tesla's addressable market is set to increase rapidly.

Meanwhile the global smartphone market is expected to clock 7.6% annualized growth through 2030. That pales in comparison to the 29% annualized growth expected in EV sales through the end of the decade. Tesla therefore is in a solid position to grow its revenue and earnings at a faster pace than Apple through 2030.

Not surprisingly analysts expect Tesla's earnings to grow at an average of 45% annually over the next five years a pace that it could sustain beyond that given the market opportunity ahead of it. Apple is expected to clock annual earnings growth of 9.5% over the next five years. This explains why The Future Fund an Australian wealth fund anticipates that Tesla's market capitalization will hit $4 trillion in 2030.

All this indicates that Tesla could keep growing its market capitalization at a faster pace than Apple over the next eight years as it has done in the past and that could make this electric vehicle play more valuable than the iPhone maker by 2030.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMia2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNhcnNjb29wcy5jb20vMjAyMi8wOC90ZXNsYS1zcGFjZXgtbW9kZWwtci1pbWFnaW5lZC1hcy1hLTI5NTAtaHAtaHlwZXJjYXItd2l0aC1yb2NrZXQtYm9vc3RlcnMv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Tesla SpaceX Model R Imagined As A 2950 HP Hypercar With Rocket Boosters,"The article contains renderings by Maximilian Schneider that are neither endorsed by nor related to Tesla.

Elon Musk has had a lot to say about the second-generation Tesla Roadster over the last five years but as it stands it remains some way off reaching the production line. However the delay in the Roadster’s launch hasn’t stopped one skilled designer from imagining what the ultimate version of a Tesla hypercar could look like.

The finished creation is dubbed the Tesla SpaceX Model R and comes from the mind of Maximilian Schneider a German designer who has previously worked at Audi Mercedes-Benz Volkswagen Mitsubishi and HiPhi and just launched the Design to the Max channel on YouTube. The wild hypercar expands on Musk’s claim that the Roadster could be offered with rocket boosters but takes things to even more extreme heights.

First is the design. The shape of the Tesla SpaceX Model R shares nothing in common with the Roadster and looks far more radical as a result. Indeed it has a shape more akin to a prototype racer than a traditional street car and has LED headlights neatly incorporated into the bulging front wheel arches.

The glass cockpit has been positioned quite far forward in the car and aerodynamic wheel covers also catch the eye. Continuing the radical bodywork and shape of the SpaceX Model R are massive aerodynamic fins on the rear quarter panels.

Schneider’s dream Tesla hypercar would just run an electric powertrain but would also feature rockets with liquid-hydrogen propellant resulting in a combined 2600 hp for the ‘standard’ car alongside a 467 km/h (290 mph) top speed and 2950 hp for the race-focused variant with a 526 km/h (327 mph) top speed.

It’s not just in a straight line where the SpaceX Model R could be extraordinarily potent. The rocket boosters positioned above each axis would push down independently on each wheel resulting in cornering forces of up to 4Gs.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMihgFodHRwczovL3d3dy5hdXRvZXZvbHV0aW9uLmNvbS9uZXdzL3Rlc2xhLWN5YmVydHJ1Y2stcHJvdG90eXBlLXNwb3R0ZWQtb24tdGhlLXJvYWQtaG9wZWZ1bGx5LWdpYW50LXdpcGVyLXdvbi10LWJlLXN0cmFuZGFyZC0xOTcwOTIuaHRtbNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Tesla Cybertruck Prototype Spotted on the Road Hopefully Giant Wiper Won't Be Strandard,However until we can see it in the showroom someone spotted a Tesla Cybertruck prototype on the road. Being a static image we can't tell if the pickup was preparing to drive out into traffic or if it was captured while just being loaded back into the special truck for transport.We see that the prototype has various devices mounted on the hood and side and it's interesting to see how the cameras and sensors are tested but what also stands out is the huge wiper. Hopefully Tesla's engineers will come up with another solution when the model goes into mass production because this wiper looks pretty primitive especially for a car designed by a man who set out and succeeded in building rockets that can reach space.Jokes have also started to be made on Reddit about those googly eyes on the hood that are said to be the laser devices that would take the place of wipers. That remains to be seen.On the other hand the rearview mirror is also quite huge. Next to it is a device that could be a camera. We would have been happy to see those spectacular wheels but for now we'll have to settle for some rather boring rims.Being a prototype these will probably disappear as well at the time of market release and hopefully Cybertruck will look very similar to what we've seen in press photos.

Young

State House News Service

PLAINVILLE — Gov. Charlie Baker helped cut the ribbon last week on a new life sciences facility but it wasn't near Boston or along Route 128. Instead Thermo Fisher's new viral vector manufacturing center is a stone's throw from the Rhode Island border.

The new Plainville facility is the latest example of how Massachusetts is growing a ""giant ecosystem"" of life sciences and biotech companies that support each other and develop breakthroughs that save lives around the world Baker said and a sign of the maturation of the industry that has helped propel the Massachusetts economy especially over the last two decades.

""There have been a lot of days like this where people have been breaking ground and cutting ribbons on mostly manufacturing facilities that are all sort of (Route) 128 and beyond. And I think for many folks in this industry there's a lot going on there. The first is that Massachusetts has a terrific workforce no matter what level you're playing at in the biotech and life sciences space but in addition to that this is an industry where change is relatively constant and where the ability to have your manufacturing operations located somewhere near where you're doing a lot of your basic and applied research is important"" the governor said citing work his administration has done mostly through the Life Sciences Center to convince companies to expand their footprints beyond ""the traditional places in Cambridge and Boston.""

Baker added: ""And I do think you're gonna continue to see it grow and expand beyond what people thought of as its traditional geography and part of that is just because it's reached the point where it's big enough now that it just needs the room.""

Life sciences industry continues Massachusetts expansion

Manufacturing in particular has been going through a serious growth spurt here. The Mass. Life Sciences Center said in its latest annual report that more than $1.9 billion has been invested developing new or expanding existing biomanufacturing facilities here over the last five years and that the roughly 20 million square feet of new lab space in the pipeline ""will create demand for up to 40000 net-new employees by 2024.""

Cédric Volanti Thermo Fisher's vice president for viral vector services in its pharma services business said the company has already hired 135 new employees in the last year for the new 300000 square foot complex in Plainville and that Thermo Fisher plans to hire about 200 more people to support the development testing and manufacturing of viral vectors. With the jobs expected to be added in Plainville Thermo Fisher will have more than 3500 employees at more than 15 sites supporting various businesses in Massachusetts officials said.

The company said it has produced more than 130 viral vector products essential components in the development and commercialization of gene therapies that were used to develop treatments for cancer blood disorders and other genetic diseases. Volanti said the company's products help 1 million patients each day.

""The new Plainville facility is part of an investment strategy to provide customers with fully integrated capabilities that connect the entire cell and gene therapy value chain — from early development and clinical scale-up to commercial manufacturing"" Thermo Fisher said in a press release. ""These include translational sciences labs for early-stage development; plasmid DNA manufacturing; viral vector services; cell therapy manufacturing; and integrated commercial packaging and distribution services.""

Baker: Industry improves peoples' lives

Before touring the new facility Wednesday Baker said that one of his favorite parts of events like the one at Thermo Fisher is getting a ""front-row seat to the miracles that are produced day after day after day"" by Bay State companies.

Amid all the talk of capital investments jobs created and research and development ""we forget about the fact that peoples' lives every single day are either improved or saved because of the work of so many here in the commonwealth of Massachusetts and it's work that never stopped all the way through the pandemic"" Baker said.

Employees of the new facility filled its sunny lobby and lined up on an overlooking staircase to hear remarks from the governor the area's congressman and others. Plainville town officials declared Wednesday ""Thermo Fisher Day"" in their town. After the speaking program Wednesday Baker U.S. Rep.

We played with combination of plasmids expressing M N E or S (under the same CMV promoter) transfected individually by pairs or with a plasmid ratio of 3:3:3:5. Transfections were performed on the highly productive HEK293T cell lines widely used in VLPs production356710. At 48 h post-transfection VLPs released in cell supernatants were purified by ultracentrifugation over a 25% sucrose cushion in TNE buffer (Fig. 1A). Viral proteins in cell lysates and in the purified VLPs were next analyzed by western blot and the percentage of protein released was calculated (Fig. 1B). The results show that only the combination of M N and E proteins was able to efficiently release VLPs 48 h post-transfection. None of the single or dual combinations generated particle production. Without E some MNS particles were pelletable but the efficiency dropped by 2.5 fold. Without M or N no VLP was produced in our conditions (Fig. 1B). Thus it appears that the interaction between M and N is absolutely required for VLP production. The combination of M N E and S could also produce VLPs incorporating S (Fig. 1B central panel) but with a reduction of N proteins in comparison with the MNE combination. In all conditions cell viability was not impacted (Supplemental Fig. 2) indicating that the released particles are not coming from dead cells and are indeed secreted VLPs. The VLPs production occurred only upon the combination MNE with or without S indicating that S is dispensable for SARS-CoV-2 VLPs production (Fig. 1B right panel). Contrary to other recent reported studies578 ME or MES combinations were not sufficient to form VLPs in our condition. We next evaluated VLPs production using plasmid ratios mimicking the wild-type SARS-CoV-2 mRNA ratio (extracted from RNAseq data of infected cells1718) coding for the 4 main structural proteins. For that the expression of M N E and S is under the same CMV promotor with a respective 3:12:2:5 ratio. This transfected plasmid ratio was compared with the arbitrary MNES ratio 3:3:3:5 (Fig. 1C). Interestingly the ratio MNE 3:12:2 was found optimal for the production of SARS-CoV-2 VLPs with a 1.5-fold increase of M incorporation (Fig. 1C in the graph compare the % of M release 50 ± 4—lane 2—with 72 ± 9—lane 4) but no change in N incorporation (compare the % of N release 54 ± 30 with 55 ± 9) as compared to the MNE 3:3:3 ratio (Fig. 1C graph). The expression of S decreased the amount of N and M proteins incorporated in VLPs by 1.5 fold (Fig. 1C graph compare the % of M release 72 ± 9 versus 54 ± 15 with S and for N compare 55 ± 9 versus 33 ± 12 with S) suggesting that S modulates the incorporation of N or M most probably due to its own incorporation. Altogether these data establish that the minimal system for SARS-CoV-2 VLPs production is composed of M N and E structural viral proteins. The presence of S for VLPs production is optional but when expressed S may be incorporated in the VLP accompanied by a diminution of N and M proteins incorporation. However the incorporation of S on the pellet VLPs is greater when the transfected plasmid ratio was 3:12:2:5 rather than 3:3:3:5 (see graph Fig. 1C compare the % of S release 55 ± 9—lane 3—to 45 ± 10—lane 1 respectively). Furthermore the striking difference was coming from S maturation: the maturation of S into S2 was much more efficient when the ratio was respecting the 3:12:2:5 proportionality (Western Blot Fig. 1C compare S2 in lanes 1 and 3 “VLP”). This suggests that the production of mature SARS-CoV-2 particles is most probably fine-tune regulated by viral RNA ratios during infection17 and thus viral protein assembly.

The purified MNE and MNES VLPs were next imaged by AFM in the buffer for size and shape characterization (Fig. 1D) in the conditions previously used for the wild-type virus19. MNE and MNES VLPs appeared as spherical particles with shapes similar to those of WT-SARS-CoV-2 particles. As seen previously reported with the wild-type virus AFM in liquid in standard scanning mode did not resolved the S proteins at the surface of the MNES VLPs which has been attributed to the fast dynamics of S in the envelope. The mean height of the VLP was 112 ± 48 nm for MNE and 126 ± 17 nm for MNES showing a ~ 25% increase in size as compared with wild-type SARS-CoV-2 particles analyzed by AFM1925 and electron microscopy (EM)2627. Recent literature on SARS-CoV-2 VLPs reported a size around 100-200 nm in diameter either using AFM7 or EM5679.

Production of fluorescent SARS-CoV-2 VLPs by tagging M and N proteins

We next aimed at producing fluorescent SARS-CoV-2 VLPs from transfected HEK293T cells by co-transfecting a M(Cter-GFP) fusion protein together with M N and E with a ratio M/M(GFP) of 2:2 supplemented or not with S. That way M(GFP) incorporation into VLPs was possible and the protein incorporation was verified by Western Blot in both MNE and MNES conditions (Fig. 2A Supplemental Fig. 2). Results indicated an incorporation of M(GFP) in the MNE and MNES VLPs. The purified fluorescent VLPs fraction was deposited on glass coverslips and fluorescent particles were successfully detected using Total Internal Reflexion Fluorescence (TIRF) Microscopy (Fig. 2B) for either M(GFP)NE or M(GFP)NES VLPs. Fluorescent spots were not detected in the control (Mock) purified from cells only transfected with M(GFP) suggesting that M(GFP) is indeed incorporated in VLPs. Furthermore correlative fluorescence/AFM imaging confirmed that these fluorescent dots (Fig. 2C) are VLPs of shape and size similar to the unlabeled VLPs (Fig. 1D); therefore demonstrating the production of M(GFP)NE or M(GFP)NES VLPs incorporating M(GFP). It is worth noticing that not all the particles found by AFM were GFP(+) indicating that a fraction of the VLPs produced are not labeled or that the smaller size particles are not VLPs but rather extracellular vesicles (Fig. 2D). In comparing particle size distribution by AFM we can notice that all the particle of size superior to 90 nm in height were GFP(+) and that below 90 nm in height smaller particles were never GFP(+) and similar in size to the extracellular vesicles secreted from the cells that do not express any SARS-CoV-2 proteins (Fig. 2D compare MNES/MNE with Mock conditions).

(E) The size and concentration of M(GFP)NE and M(GFP)NES VLPs are determined by FCS. (F) Images and quantitative size distribution of MN(mEOS2)E VLPs and N(mEOS2) particles using super-resolution PALM microscopy. All these experiments were done twice with more than several hundred of particles analyzed in each condition. Full size image

We then determined the M(GFP)NES and M(GFP)NE VLPs size and approximate concentration using Fluorescence Correlative Microscopy (FCS) (Fig. 2D). GFP(+) particle concentration of 5.1012 to 7.1012 particles/ml were found respectively for M(GFP)NES and M(GFP)NE VLPs suggesting a very efficient production considering that not all the VLPs are labeled with GFP. Interestingly we were able to differentiate VLPs sizes measuring diameters of 120 ± 10 nm (mean ± sd) for VLPs without S and 140 ± 20 nm for VLP with S (Fig. 2E). The latter particle size might correspond to the VLPs with Spikes. This result is also nicely consistent with the average diameter of VLPs obtained by AFM.

To accurately measure particle size with single-molecule localization microscopy we next designed and produced mEOS2 photoconvertible fluorescent protein SARS-CoV-2 VLPs using a fusion N(Nter-mEOS2) protein. These photoconvertible VLPs were used to perform Photo-Activated Localization Microscopy (PALM) to provide another estimation of their size1415. We directly compared these sizes with the particles released into the cell supernatant from cells only transfected with N(mEOS2). The results are shown in Fig. 2E. MN(mEOS2)E VLPs exhibited a 108 ± 1 nm (mean ± sem) diameter with a high number of particles observed in the field of view (N ~ 1300) while the N(mEOS2) particles were much less numerous (N ~ 60) with a significantly smaller diameter (78 ± 3 nm). This result confirms that SARS-CoV-2 VLPs are on average 100 nm diameter in size no matter the technic used thus slightly bigger than the wild-type virus. Secondly the fact that N alone is being released inefficiently (20 fold less) than the MNE combination confirms that MN(mEOS2)E is efficiently producing photoactivable VLPs (Fig. 2F graph of particle size distribution). Overall our results show the successful incorporation of fluorescent M or N tagged proteins in MNE and MNES VLPs with a ratio of labeled/unlabeled viral proteins of 1:1 or 1:3 respectively suggesting that this incorporation does not impair VLPs assembly as it was previously reported for the generation of fluorescent HIV-1 Gag VLPs13141516. Dual color fluorescent labeled VLPs were next tried to challenge the limit of fluorescent tags incorporation into the VLPs. Dual color VLPs were produced by co-expression of M(Cter-mCherry) and N(Nter-GFP) with M N and E supplemented or not with S in transfected HEK293T cells (Fig. 3). M(mCherry) and N(GFP) incorporation into VLPs collected 48 h post-transfection was verified by Western Blot (Fig. 3A Supplemental Fig. 2). Figure 3A exhibits 2 bands at molecular weights of approximately 80 and 105 kDa corresponding to respectively fluorescently (GFP or mCherry ~ 26 kDa) tagged M (~ 55 kDa) and tagged N proteins (~ 80 kDa). Two color TIRF images of these dual color VLPs showed the presence of a mix of GFP(+) or mCherry(+) single labeled VLPs as well as particles containing the two fluorescent labels (Fig. 3B). A total of 250–300 fluorescent particles were counted over 13 images (frames) on which we evaluated the percentage of particles only mCherry(+) or only GFP(+). The results showed that half of the fluorescent VLPs were N(GFP)(+) and half were M(mCherry)(+) in the case of MNE VLPs but only one-third were N-GFP(+) in the case of MNES VLPs indicating that upon S incorporation in the VLPs less N(GFP) was incorporated. The colocalization of the dual color GFP/mCherry VLPs was also quantified which allowed us to monitor the relative incorporation of M(mCherry) and N(GFP) in a VLP (Fig. 3C). We quantify that only 20 ± 3% and 11 ± 7% of the VLPs are dual color containing M(mCherry) and N(GFP) in the same MNE and MNES VLPs respectively (Fig. 3C) when mixing label and unlabeled proteins. This indicates that VLPs could incorporate the two fluorescent labeled M and N proteins without impairing assembly. We also tried to produce M(mCherry)N(GFP)E VLP i.e. in the presence of both tagged M and N but this was totally preventing VLPs production (data not shown). Since the fluorescent protein tag is located at the C-ter of M and N-ter of N it should be located inside the VLP. Only when mixing both label and unlabeled proteins at a ratio of 1:1 for M or at a ratio of 3:9 for N(GFP) versus N then production of labeled particles was possible. However in both cases we can notice that the incorporation of S in the fluorescent VLPs was mainly in its immature uncleaved form (Supplemental Fig. 2DE) as compared to VLP without fluorescent proteins (Supplemental Fig. 2C) indicating that the intra-lumenal GFP or mCherry of the N- or M-tagged proteins do not interfere with S incorporation in VLP but prevent its correct maturation impairing S/S2 cleavage site and probably its conformation questioning the correct assembly of these particles in that case. Thus in order to produce fluorescent MNES-VLPs with an optimal maturation and cleavage of the Spike we evaluated the best ratio between unlabeled N and labeled N(GFP) to produced fluorescent VLPs. Western blots show that at a ratio of 3:1 or 4:1 of N/N(GFP) the Spike is efficiently incorporated and matured as in unlabeled MNES VLPs (Supplemental Fig. 3).

Quantitative imaging of S incorporation in fluorescent VLPs

Furthermore to estimate the Spike incorporation on fluorescent VLPs we used the M(GFP)NES fluorescent VLPs to quantify the percentage of GFP labeled VLP incorporating S by immuno-spotting coupled to TIRF microscopy using an anti-S neutralizing antibody and an AlexaFluor555 secondary antibody (Fig. 4A). Non-specific binding of the anti-S antibody/secondary antibody was 6 ± 6% on the M(GFP)NE VLPs while the absence of VLP did not show any significative background (less than 1% for “no VLP”). Quantification of fluorescent red/green dot spots colocalization indicated that 27 ± 12% of the M(GFP)NES VLPs incorporated S (Fig. 4B). Although since some VLPs were not GFP labeled “red” dots also appeared. To prove that these dots were more likely VLPs rather than exosomes/extracellular vesicles (EVs) containing S we checked the colocalization between these “red” S dots and CD81 with an anti-CD81 exosomal marker (Supplemental Fig. 4) using the same immuno-spotting assay. Less than 10% of the “red” dots containing only S were colocalizing with CD81 and none of the M(GFP)NES VLPs were CD81 positive suggesting that M(GFP)NES VLPs are a mixture of GFP(+)VLPs and unlabeled VLPs containing S but not CD81 EVs. Our results show that the Spike S is well incorporated on MNES VLPs with or without M-GFP (Fig. 4B) suggesting that S incorporation is mainly driven by MNE confirming the results seen by immunoblotting (Fig. 1B). We also checked that these VLPs were distinct from CD81(+) extracellular vesicles (Supplemental Fig. 4). On the other hand not all the VLPs-(M-GFP) were carrying the Spike suggesting that part of the fluorescent VLPs assemble without S.

(B) Percentage of S incorporation in M(GFP)NES versus M(GFP)NE and the control (no VLP). For each condition 125 fluorescent particles were counted over 10 images (frames). One dot in the graph represents the % of S incorporation in the fluorescent VLP(M-GFP) i.e. % of colocalization in each frame. The t-test was calculated and the p-value between VLP M(GFP)NES and VLP M(GFP)NE is 0.0001 and p-value between VLP M(GFP)NES and No VLP is < 0.0001. (C) Images of SARS-CoV-2 M(GFP)NES and MN(GFP)ES VLPs as revealed by immuno-spotting coupled to TIRF-M showing N or M incorporation in the MN(GFP)ES or M(GFP)NES VLP respectively with an anti-N or anti-M antibody coupled with an Alexa555 labeled secondary antibody as indicated. The scale bar is 10 µm. (D) Quantification of the incorporation (%) of S M or N on respective GFP-VLPs. N = 2 11 images per sample and the number of particles counted was between 500 and 650 for each condition. Full size image

In order to estimate the incorporation of the other viral proteins N and M with the N(GFP) and M(GFP) tagged proteins respectively we performed the same immuno-spotting assay with anti-N and anti-M antibodies on MN(GFP)NES and M(GFP)MNES VLPs (Fig. 4C) and quantified the incorporation of N and M in the respective fluorescent VLPs (Fig. 4D). Results show that 73 ± 5% of M is colocalizing with M(GFP)VLPs and 95 ± 1% of N with N(GFP)VLPs in contrast to S (20 ± 4% in N(GFP) VLPs). Overall these results suggest a better incorporation of N/N(GFP) tagged protein rather than M(GFP) in fluorescent VLPs and that not all the fluorescent VLPs contain the Spike.

Internalization of the fluorescent SARS-CoV-2 VLPs in host pulmonary cells

In order to study the functionality of the Spike incorporated in the fluorescent VLPs we performed an internalization assay of the SARS-CoV-2 M(GFP) or N(GFP) tagged VLPs. To do so M(GFP)MNE VLPs versus M(GFP)MNES VLPs were incubated with pulmonary A549 cells expressing the human receptor hACE2 (Supplemental Fig. 1). The internalization of both fluorescent VLPs M(GFP)NE versus M(GFP)NES was monitored at 37 °C (active endocytosis) or at 4 °C (partially blocked endocytosis). A difference in internalization between M(GFP)NES VLPs and M(GFP)NE VLPs was observed and revealed using quantitative confocal microscopy (Fig. 5A). To quantify this difference we measured the distances (d 1 d 2 …d n ) of VLPs identified as GFP bright dots to the center of the cell (Fig. 5B) this cell center being the intercept of the major and minor axis (r 1 and r 2 ) established for each cell. As these radii represent the mean longest (r 1 ) and shorter (r 2 ) distances between the cell border and the cell center it suggests that every VLP distance that will be found in between these two radii corresponds to a VLP located at the border of the cell. On the opposite every cell center-VLP distance found below r 2 indicates that the VLP is inside the cell. We then plot the distribution of the distances (n > 100) for each different condition and plot the average value of the major axis r 1 = 17.6 ± 3.7 µm (mean ± sd) and the minor axis r 2 = 11.6 ± 3.6 µm (mean ± sd) of the different cells (n = 16) (Fig. 5C). In Fig. 5C it is immediately seen that in absence of S the average M(GFP)NE VLP-cell center distance is found between r 1 and r 2  both at 4 °C (d = 13.4 ± 3.2 µm mean ± sd) and at 37 °C (d = 13.5 ± 3.5 µm) these mean values being not statistically different (p = 0.98 Mann Withney U test). For MNES VLP-M(GFP) at 4 °C we observed a slight but statistically significant (0.01 < p < 0.04) decrease in the mean VLP-cell center distance (d = 11.8 ± 5 µm) when compared to M(GFP)NE VLP. From Fig. 5C it can also be seen that in this case the distance distribution is widened and that some VLPs start to exhibit distances at values much below r 2  suggesting entry of these VLPs. This is confirmed when observing the M(GFP)NES VLP-cell center distance distribution at 37 °C. In this case the mean distance value is approximately divided by two (d = 6.1 ± 3.0 µm) and is statistically strongly different from all the other distributions (10–33 < p < 2.10–15) we established here. This clearly suggests that the presence of S on the surface of the VLPs induces a preferential endocytosis in A549-hACE2 cells carrying the hACE2 viral receptor.

(C) Violin plot of the distribution of the VLP-cell center distances for the different conditions (MNE vs MNES at 4 °C and 37 °C respectively).

(D) Confocal images of MN(GFP)ES VLPs (in green) on A549 or A549-hACE2 cells incubated at 37 °C or at 4 °C show the internalization of VLPs.

(E) Quantification of the number of MN(GFP)ES VLPs per cell in each condition in the presence and the absence of the receptor hACE2 (+ or − hACE2) and at 4 °C (partially blocked endocytosis) or 37 °C (activate endocytosis and fusion). N = 2 24 cells analyzed per condition. **p < 0.01; ***p < 0.001. Full size image

To confirm that this endocytosis was mediated by hACE2 we expressed in A549 cells a mScarlet1 tagged version of ACE2 and repeated the same experiment of M(GFP)NES VLPs internalization for 15 min at 37 °C on live cells. After fixation z-projection imaging of M(GFP)NES VLPs in A549-hACE2mScarlet1 cells showed the internalization of the M(GFP)NES VLPs on the receptor ACE2. Z-projection imaging at 4 °C showed reduced internalization of the M(GFP)NES VLPs decorating the cell surface on the hACE2mScarlet1 receptor (Supplemental Fig. 5). The mScarlet1 versus GFP fluorescence emission is shown as a control (Supplemental Fig. 5A). Quantification of confocal images reveals that more than 65% of the GFP(+) dots were associated with the mScarlet1(+) dots (Supplemental Fig. 5B) reinforcing the idea that all the VLPs containing S were able to load on the ACE2 receptor at the cell surface of pulmonary cells mimicking hACE2-dependent SARS-CoV-2 endocytic entry. A colocalization of ~ 80% of the M(GFP)NES VLPs on the receptor hACE2mScarlet1 was observed (Supplemental Fig. 5C). In the absence of VLP the cellular distribution of hACE2mScarlet1 remains diffuse (Supplemental Fig. 5D).

However these above results are not indicative on the ability of the fluorescent (M-GFP)-VLP to mimic viral entry up to the fusion step of the VLP upon cell internalization. In order to explore that question we used the fluorescent (N-GFP)-VLP internalization assay in A549 pulmonary cells with or without hACE2 receptor (Fig. 5D). The number of fluorescent VLP (ie “green” dots) per cell suggested that VLP-(N-GFP) docking on the cells (at 4 °C) and VLP internalization (at 37 °C) were both significantly better in A549-hACE2 than A549 cells (respectively at 4 °C compare ACE2(+) 77.7 ± 33.3 versus ACE2(−) 13.2 ± 5.5 and at 37 °C compare ACE2(+) 29.6 ± 7.6 versus ACE2(−) 6.4 ± 4.1 VLP per cell). Thus efficient endocytosis of SARS-CoV-2 VLP containing S is highly hACE2 receptor-dependent. Secondly the advantage of N-GFP is that it labels the viral core and not the viral membrane as for M-GFP allowing to monitor the disappearance of the VLP dots upon VLP internalization if viral fusion would occur. We thus compare the number of GFP dots (VLP) in A549hACE2 cells at 37 °C and 4 °C (mean value of 29.6 ± 7.6 at 37 °C versus 77.7 ± 33.3 VLP per cell at 4 °C respectively): results show that more than half of the (N-GFP)-VLP dots «disappeared» upon entrance in the cells and N-GFP fluorescence concentrated near the nucleus; this difference between 37 and 4 °C suggests a possible fusion of the endocytosed (N-GFP)VLP within the cell (Fig. 5D) that would need to be proven by other complementary technics.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiT2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZpbnNtZXMuY29tLzIwMjIvMDgvZXRoZXJuYS1yYWlzZXMtZTM5bS1pbi1zZXJpZXMtYjItZmluYW5jaW5nLmh0bWzSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,eTheRNA Raises €39M in Series B2 Financing,"eTheRNA a Niel Belgium-based mRNA technologies company raised €39M in a Series B2 financing.

To understand the genome-wide regulatory roles of NDX we first analyzed its genomic distribution. For this we performed chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing (ChIP-seq) in 10-day old Arabidopsis seedlings expressing N-terminally and C-terminally tagged NDX fusion proteins (flag-NDX/ndx1-1(FRI)/flc-2 and NDX-GFP/ndx1-1(FRI)/flc-2 respectively) expressed from their endogenous promoter2132. The two ChIP-seq profiles were highly correlated (Pearson r > 0.85 Supplementary Fig. 1) and 2243 flag-NDX and 583 NDX-GFP binding sites were identified (Fig. 1a) showing a statistically significant overlap compared to random overlaps (p < 0.0001 prop.test). Enrichment of NDX was validated by ChIP-PCR at selected genomic loci (Fig. 1b). Importantly binding of NDX to both the ABI3 and ABI4 downstream regions19 and the FLC 3′-terminator21 was also confirmed (Fig. 1c) indicating that our analysis is robust and reliable. We then visualized the density of ChIP peaks along the entire length of Arabidopsis chromosomes and revealed a significant colocalization of NDX with centromeric and pericentromeric regions (Fig. 1d) in marked contrast to the five chromosomal arms and telomeres where the density of peaks was much lower (16 peaks/Mb in arms vs. 84 peaks/Mb in pericentromeres). This non-random distribution suggests that NDX is mainly associated with gene-poor heterochromatic regions and is rare in transcriptionally active euchromatin.

To confirm the genomic binding of NDX by a sequencing-independent approach we applied confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM) coupled to fluorescence correlation spectroscopy (FCS) and fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP). CLSM performed in live root tips (expressing NDX-GFP) showed strong green fluorescence near the nuclear periphery (typically associated with perinuclear heterochromatin) and in the nucleolus (Fig. 2a and Supplementary Fig. 2). Nucleolar staining was visible in <20% of cells and it is currently unclear whether this fraction represents a functional or non-functional population that acts as a “storage depot”. In contrast peripheral nuclear localization was consistently observed and was further reinforced by the overlap between NDX binding sites and NUCLEOPORIN1 (NUP1)-enriched chromatin33 which marks nuclear periphery (Supplementary Fig. 3). Of the NUP1 peaks classified as pericentromeric and arm-associated only the former group showed significant colocalization with NDX. Pericentromeric enrichment was confirmed microscopically in a subset of cells that showed a typical chromocenter structure (Fig. 2b) which represents a small fraction of root tip cells in which chromocenters can be visually detected. The NDX signal was weak in the nuclear interior which typically coincides with euchromatin.

The experiments were repeated four times with similar results. a The GFP signal is enriched in the nuclear periphery and in the central (DAPI-negative) region corresponding to the nucleolus.

We then used the FCS approach to calculate the effective diffusion coefficient of the mobile fraction of NDX (Fig. 2c). From the FCS parameters the time-dependent autocorrelation function was derived (G(τ) or ACF; Fig. 2d e) from which we calculated the average diffusion coefficient at the nuclear periphery (16.72 ± 7.1 µm2/sec) and the nucleolus (5.00 ± 0.9 µm2/sec; Fig. 2f g). Since the diffusion parameters did not differ significantly between nuclear and nucleolar NDX these compartments are likely to have closely related NDX-binding properties. In the FRAP setting (Fig. 2h left) GFP fluorescence was bleached within the nuclear periphery and nucleolus and then fluorescence intensities were tracked (i) in the bleached region (F bleach ) (ii) in total nuclei (F total ) and (iii) in randomly selected regions outside the nucleus used for background subtraction (F bckgr ). Recovery curves were obtained by normalizing the background-subtracted signal to the mean prebleach signal and at the same time considering the decrease of total fluorescence due to the initial high-intensity laser pulse and bleaching upon post-bleach imaging34. For the mobile fraction of NDX we obtained a very slow recovery rate that recapitulates the slow kinetics and tight chromosome binding of nuclear core histone (H3/H4) proteins35. GFP fluorescence did not return to the initial pre-bleach value leaving 40–60% of NDX in the slowly exchanging (static) fraction (Fig. 2h area above the horizontal red line). The latter immobile fraction most likely represents NDX molecules that bind directly and permanently to chromatin. Taken together the above quantitative microscopic data obtained in living cells are consistent with our ChIP-seq results and extend them to different spatial resolutions and timescales indicating that NDX is a chromatin-binding factor that is stably incorporated into chromosomes.

NDX shows opposite genomic distribution to R-loops

To address the possibility that NDX is a general R-loop regulator we compared the chromosomal distribution of NDX binding sites with the genomic profile of R-loops. For this RNA-DNA hybrids were immunoprecipitated with the S9.6 antibody3637 and mapped by DNA-RNA hybrid immunoprecipitation (DRIP) sequencing3839. The specificity of S9.6 immunoselection was monitored by RNaseH treatment which degrades the RNA strand of RNA-DNA hybrids (Fig. 3a–c). Our peak prediction identified 14124 R-loops in Col-0 seedlings that followed an antagonistic distribution to NDX (Fig. 3a c) as 97% of DRIP peaks (n = 13798) and 85% of NDX peaks (n = 1910) showed no overlap (Fig. 3b c). Differential association of NDX and R-loops was also analyzed in gene-rich euchromatic regions by a peak-independent (metagene) approach: strong DRIP signal enrichment was found over promoters and 5′-UTRs while NDX was enriched at transcriptional termination sites (Fig. 3d). The predicted R-loops were validated by DRIP-qPCR at selected loci that appeared as positive (enriched) and negative (depleted) sites according to our analysis (Fig. 3e). The R-loop structure previously described at the 3′-end of FLC21 was also detected and further validated by qPCR (Supplementary Fig. 4) confirming the quality of our DRIP-seq data. Importantly despite the opposite genomic distribution of NDX binding sites and R-loops 15% of NDX peaks (n = 333 green) and 2.3% of DRIP peaks (n = 326 red) still overlapped (Fig. 3b c “common peaks”). This overlapping fraction is statistically significant compared to random enrichment (*p < 0.001 prop.test) and suggests that the NDX-stabilized R-loop model described for the FLC locus21 may still be true in some cases though not in general. Accordingly secondary ssDNA structure prediction showed that NDX binding sites have a lower propensity to form ssDNA than DRIP peaks or common NDX/DRIP binding sites (Fig. 3f) which tend to adopt a single-stranded conformation. In other words NDX binds primarily to double-stranded DNA regions and to a lesser extent to the classical R-loop structure containing ssDNA (represented by the common DRIP/NDX peak set). This is consistent with previous reports demonstrating a strong binding affinity of NDX for dsDNA templates1922. However mechanistic understanding of NDX binding to dsDNA ssDNA and R-loop structures remains unknown.

NDX binds to het-siRNA loci associated with pericentromeric heterochromatin

Functional annotation of the identified ChIP and DRIP peaks revealed a significant enrichment of flag-NDX and NDX-GFP in pericentromeric regions and transposable elements (Fig. 4a). The Knob region a constitutive heterochromatin domain located on the short arm of Chr4 rather than the pericentromere4041 also showed preferential NDX enrichment suggesting that NDX is generally associated with this type of chromatin. Of the annotated TEs some of the families showed significant NDX-enrichment characterized by diverse transposition mechanisms internal structure and chromosomal distribution (Fig. 4b). NAD transposons which are localized cytologically in the nucleolus and participate in forming so-called ‘nucleolus associated chromatin domains’ (NADs)42 also showed NDX association (Fig. 4a) consistent with our microscopic data. We also performed a family-independent transposon analysis based on TE targeting by non-CG methylation pathways43 and compared TE groups controlled by RdDM (RdDM TEs) to those targeted by the CMT2 pathway (CMT2 TEs) or both pathways (intermediate TEs) (Fig. 4c). The above TE categories were further classified by chromosomal location as pericentromeric and arm-associated. The results show that NDX is primarily enriched at TEs regulated by the CMT2 pathway as well as the common pathway and is depleted from RdDM-targeted TEs regardless of pericentromeric or arm location. These functional relationships link NDX to non-CG methylation mediated by CMT2 and/or the CMT2/RdDM common pathway. This conclusion is reinforced by the association of NDX with repressive chromatin modifications (H3K9me2 H3K27me1) required to silence TEs (Fig. 4a b). Of note there was no colocalization between NDX and H2A ubiquitination (H2Aub) mediated by PRC1 which is not unexpected as this repressive mark is constantly removed by ubiquitin proteases to drive PRC2-catalyzed H3K27 trimethylation44.

The nine chromatin states were defined by the combinatorial pattern of epigenetic modifications and transcription50. Full size image

R-loops were mostly associated with 5′-UTRs but also with promoters specific transposons (e.g. NAD/En-Spm/MuDR/Copia) and euchromatic histone marks located in active chromatin (Fig. 4a–d). It is noteworthy that NAD TEs and “canonical” TEs (located outside the nucleolus) show differential R-loop association as the former group is enriched with DRIP peaks while the latter show depletion (Fig. 4a). Thus R-loops appear to associate with nucleolar TEs and have less preference for extranucleolar TEs. These associations are consistent with previous research that found high R-loop abundance in the nucleolus4546474849. Interestingly NAD TEs associated with NDX and DRIP peaks overlap significantly (p < 0.001 prop.test) suggesting their possible functional interaction on a subset of nucleolar transposons.

Next we correlated the localization of NDX and DRIP peaks with nine different chromatin states of Arabidopsis (Fig. 4e left) reconstituted from the combinatorial pattern of epigenomic landscapes and transcriptome maps (based on ref. 50). NDX binding sites showed preferential associations with transcriptionally silent heterochromatin (states 8–9) enriched in H3K9me2 H3K27me1 CG/CHG/CHH methylation transposons and transposon genes (Fig. 4e right). In contrast RNA-DNA hybrids mainly localized to transcriptionally active euchromatin which corresponds to state 1 (high levels of transcription H3K4me2/3 H3K36me3 H2Bub H3.3 H2A.Z and H3K9ac) state 2 (high levels of H3K4me2/3 H3.3 H2A.Z and H3K27me3; moderate levels of active chromatin marks)50. Notably NDX binding sites were highly anticorrelated with states 1–2 (where R-loop structures are typically enriched). Interestingly states 1/2 and 8/9 the most extreme chromatin states lie furthest apart on the linear scale of the genome50 consistent with the reciprocal chromosomal distribution of NDX peaks and R-loops (Fig. 5a top panel).

Functionally distinct small RNAs (sRNAs) were previously classified into nine functional groups and linked to different chromatin states51. Utilizing this sRNA database NDX-binding sites showed a particularly strong colocalization with class 6–9 sRNA loci (Fig. 5a b) that code for centromeric and pericentromeric 21–24nt siRNAs participating in CHH/CHG methylation via the CMT2/3 pathway (classes 689) or the RdDM pathway (class 7)51. However NDX peaks were anticorrelated with class 1–3 euchromatic sRNA loci that tend to associate with genes. Nevertheless NDX enrichment at class 6–9 sRNA loci was rather heterogeneous as NDX bound strongly to a subset of targets (Fig. 5c). Our metaanalysis shows that NDX does not bind to sRNA #1–5 loci (as expected) nor does it bind to sRNA #6–9 loci located on chromosomal arms however pericentromerically localized sRNA #6–9 loci bind significantly but heterogeneously to NDX (Fig. 5c). NDX enrichments were validated at selected class 6–9 sRNA loci using ChIP-qPCR (Fig. 5d). In contrast to NDX RNA-DNA hybrids were mainly associated with sRNA classes 1–2 that are related to protein coding ORFs and promoters51. The genome-wide enrichment of NDX over het-siRNA loci is fully consistent with previous data that identified two sRNA molecules at the FLC locus (24 nt and 30 nt) that colocalized with NDX in a heterochromatic patch of H3K9me22152.

Loss of NDX function results in increased het-siRNA expression and R-loop formation

To gain functional insights into the association of NDX with het-siRNAs we performed sRNA deep sequencing (sRNA-seq) in an ndx T-DNA insertion line (ndx1–4) to assess global changes in the production of sRNAs (Fig. 6). Our analysis revealed significantly higher sRNA abundance in the ndx1–4 mutant than in wild-type (Col-0) however the size distribution and the ratio of dominant sRNA fractions (24nt/21nt) were similar (Fig. 6a left). Of the nine functional groups of sRNA loci only class 4–9 showed increased sRNA levels in ndx1–4 whereas class 1–3 did not differ from the wild type (Fig. 6a right). These heterogeneities are in accordance with the primary division between sRNA loci that occurs between classes 1–3 and 4–9 determined by their associations with protein coding ORFs and promoters (sRNAs 1–3) and with epigenetically activated small interfering RNAs (easiRNAs) and non-CG methylation pathways (sRNAs 4–9)51. Differential expression analysis identified 286 upregulated and 165 downregulated sRNA loci (n = 451) that showed significantly increased or decreased sRNA levels in the ndx1–4 mutant (Fig. 6b). About 85% of these sRNAs belong to classes 4–9 and thus depend on Pol IV activity (Supplementary Fig. 5) such that the proportion of classes 4 and 5 was doubled compared to non-differential ones. These associations demonstrate that Pol IV-derived/dependent siRNAs are specifically altered in the ndx1–4 mutant.

Regarding the expression of annotated microRNAs (that are known to act post-transcriptionally) we found only 10 up- and 2 downregulated miRNAs from all known 326 precursor hairpin RNAs53. The small effect of ndx1–4 mutation on miRNA transcription and the lack of association between NDX ChIP peaks and miRNA loci preclude the possibility that NDX is a central regulator of miRNA expression. In contrast differential expression of class 6–9 siRNAs is probably due to the direct binding of NDX to these sRNA loci which follows from their particularly strong association (Fig. 5b). Representative sRNA loci upregulated in ndx1–4 and their validation by stem-loop rt-qPCR54 are shown in Fig. 6c d.

Regarding transposon-derived siRNA production TE siRNAs also showed a clear increase in the absence of NDX independent of their pericentromeric Knob or arm association (Fig. 6e). We observed a significant increase in siRNA levels over RdDM TEs and CTM2 TEs such that higher expression was detected in the ndx1–4 mutant relative to Col-0 (Fig. 6f; ndx1–4 vs. Col-0 comparison). (We note that siRNA levels from RdDM TEs were substantially higher than those from CMT2 TE both in Col-0 and ndx1–4 backgrounds which is expected from the known mechanism of sRNA control in agreement with published data55.) When siRNAs were sized into 21 22 23 24 nt classes 24 nt siRNAs (representing het-siRNAs generated by Pol IV) were specifically upregulated in the ndx1–4 mutant at both RdDM TEs and CMT2 TEs as opposed to 21–22 nt siRNAs (so called epigenetically activated siRNAs easiRNAs) that are related to TE expression (Fig. 6g). These associations further reinforce the link between NDX and Pol IV-dependent siRNA expression from TEs. The above siRNA changes were confirmed by stem-loop rt-qPCR at two representative transposons (Fig. 6h) suggesting that NDX is involved in transcriptional silencing of these loci. Interestingly the pericentromeric ncRNA siR1003 expressed from the silenced 5 S rDNA array on chr3 (cytologically in the chromocenter) showed mildly increased siRNA levels by northern blot hybridization (Supplementary Fig. 6). This suggests that NDX not only affects the sRNA expression profile of transposons but may also silence other gene types in pericentromeric regions.

To elucidate whether the observed siRNA changes are associated with similar (or opposite) changes in the abundance of R-loops we globally mapped RNA-DNA hybrids in the ndx1–4 mutant (Fig. 7a). The DRIP-seq signal detected in both ndx1–4 and Col-0 samples was reduced to background by RNaseH treatment indicating the specificity of RNA-DNA hybrid detection. The amount of R-loops showed a moderate but statistically significant increase in the absence of NDX (fold change: >1.5; p < 0.0001) as evidenced by the higher intensity of DRIP peaks in the ndx1–4 mutant calculated by AUC analysis (Fig. 7b). Elevated genomic R-loop levels were also confirmed by slot blot hybridization (Fig. 7c d) and DRIP-qPCR at selected genomic regions (Fig. 7f). Based on these data NDX appears to prevent rather than stabilize or stimulate the formation of R-loops in the Arabidopsis genome. Moderately increased R-loop levels in ndx1–4 could be due to an indirect consequence of the mutation rather than the direct effect of NDX binding since R-loops and NDX follow opposite genomic distributions.

Loss of NDX results in global transcriptional changes that may directly or indirectly affect heterochromatin status

To assess the global effect of NDX loss on nuclear transcription including euchromatin- and heterochromatin-derived transcripts we performed an mRNA transcriptome analysis.

This analysis identified 1984 differentially expressed protein coding transcripts (p < 0.01) involving 864 up- and 1120 downregulated genes in the ndx1–4 mutant compared to Col-0 control (Supplementary Fig. 7). GO term analysis showed that upregulated genes were primarily involved in the formation of ribonucleotide complexes cold-response flowering and organ development while downregulated genes were implicated in general stress response post-embryonic development lipid storage and binding of ribonucleotides (Supplementary Fig. 8). Our results were highly correlated with previously published data19.

We also analyzed the activity of transposons at a global level. The NGS results show that loss of NDX had a mild but significant effect on TE activity: 28 and 21 transposons were up- or downregulated in the ndx1–4 mutant (DESeq2 analysis; p < 0.05; Supplementary Fig. 9). This may be an underestimate since mRNA-seq captures only a portion of active TEs due to poly(A) selection56. Notwithstanding the number of reactivated transposons is comparable to the number of upregulated TEs detected in cmt2 and drm1/drm2 heterochromatin mutants9.

In addition we sought to find chromatin regulators that are differentially expressed in ndx1–4. Indeed we identified a group of genes that may play a direct or indirect role in the regulation of heterochromatin status. Overexpressed genes involve known RNAi factors such as (1) NRPD1b NRPE3b and NRPB/D/E9a which represent the structural and regulatory subunits of Pol IV and Pol V the core trans factors of RdDM; (2) RDR1 which participates in non-canonical RdDM57; (3) IDN2 required for siRNA accumulation and binding to dsRNA and lncRNA58; (4) AGO9 which is normally expressed in the ovule to interact with siRNAs transcribed from pericentromeric retrotransposons59; (5) ROS1 which demethylates several genomic targets to restrict non-CG methylation activity60. These RdDM genes are typically silent in seedlings (or expressed at low level) but become induced at high levels in the ndx1–4 mutant. Downregulated chromatin factors include HTA4 (histone H2A) HON4 (linker histone like protein) and HMGB1 (high mobility group B1) which are involved in the assembly of nucleoprotein complexes. RT-qPCR validation of representative genes is shown in Supplementary Fig. 10. Misregulation of the above heterochromatin regulators are likely to contribute to the molecular phenotype of ndx1–4 however causative relationships remain to be explored.

NDX is required for proper non-CG methylation levels

Since loss of NDX influences heterochromatin behavior (siRNA accumulation at hundreds of genomic loci and TEs) we performed bisulfite sequencing (BS-seq) to reveal the involvement of NDX in DNA methylation (Supplementary Figs. 11 12). Comparison of ndx1–4 and Col-0 samples revealed 2449 hypomethylated and 1597 hypermethylated regions (DMRs) in the CHH/CHG sequence context (Fig. 8a) of which hypo-CHH/CHG sites were co-localized with NDX (Fig. 8b c). In the CG context 1353 hypo- and 1624 hyper-CG DMRs were detected showing no enrichment for NDX binding (Fig. 8b). As expected CHG/CHH DMRs significantly overlapped with TEs located in pericentromeric regions (Fig. 8d) and with chromatin states 8-9 that mark constitutive heterochromatin (Fig. 8e). In contrast CG DMRs followed a more even distribution between the different annotation categories and chromatin states (Fig. 8d e). These associations suggest that NDX influences transposon CHH/CHG methylation in pericentric heterochromatin regions. Grouping transposons by their regulatory classes and genomic positions highlighted decreased CHH and CHG methylation in CMT2 TEs in the ndx1–4 mutant regardless of pericentromeric or arm association (Fig. 8f). However RdDM TEs showed reduced DNA methylation only in the CHG context located in chromosomal arms (mCG levels did not change in either class). Since NDX binds directly only to CMT2 TEs (Fig. 4c) the above changes are likely due to the direct effect of NDX whereas CHG methylation changes observed in RdDM TEs may be the indirect effect of ndx1–4 mutation. Importantly sRNA expression changes detected at hypo CHH/CHG DMRs appear to be independent of NDX binding since there was no difference between hypo CHH/CHGs classified as “NDX-enriched” and “non-enriched” (Supplementary Fig. 13). This suggests that the ndx1–4 mutation plays an indirect role in the production of siRNAs at hypomethylated CHH/CHG sites and that the DNA methylase and RNAi systems can function without NDX binding (underscoring their epistatic relationship).

Metaplots show average DNA methylation levels in CHH/CHG/CG contexts in Col-0 (black) and ndx1–4 (red) plants. CHH and CHG methylation is significantly decreased CMT2 TEs regardless of their arm- or pericentromeric location (mCG levels do not change). CHG methylation levels show reduction at RdDM TEs located in chromosome arms. (mCHH and mCG levels do not change.). Full size image

To explore hierarchical relationships between the DNA methylome changes of ndx1–4 and heterochromatin mutants we analyzed BS-seq data from a collection of mutants using the hcDMR pipeline61. The identified high-confidence DMRs confirmed well-known genetic interactions (e.g. between mutants operating in the RdDM and CMT2 pathways; Supplementary Fig. 14) and also identified new associations between ndx1–4 drm2 and met1 as these groups were clustered together. However we could not clearly determine if NDX influences non-CG methylation via the CMT2 or RdDM pathways or more possibly by a less characterized independent pathway (e.g. Knot linked silencing). As DNA methylation pathways show significant redundancies appropriate classification is not obvious in terms of NDX function. For instance MET1 (the main CG methylase) and DRM2 (the main RdDM methylase) are both required to maintain CHH methylation in CMT2 targeted heterochromatin. The potential crosstalk between DRM2 MET1 and NDX remains to be explored by combining classical and molecular genetics.

Loss of NDX results in rearrangement of chromatin organization in pericentromeric regions

Given the marked changes in siRNA accumulation RNA transcription R-loop formation and DNA methylation in the ndx1–4 mutant we asked whether the observed molecular phenotype is related to underlying chromatin structural changes. We therefore examined the genome-wide chromatin conformations of ndx1–4 and Col-0 plants using in situ Hi-C and sequenced ~200 million valid reads for each genotype. Normalized contact matrices resembled published Hi-C maps626364 and showed similar patterns for ndx1–4 and Col-0 at first glance (Supplementary Fig. 15). This indicates that loss of NDX does not lead to extensive restructuring of three-dimensional chromosome architecture in Arabidopsis. Nevertheless we found remarkable quantitative changes between the two Hi-C maps during differential analysis of contact matrices (Supplementary Fig. 16). Several genomic regions were intensified (red) or diminished (blue) in the ndx1–4 mutant indicating a global rearrangement of spatial interactions in the absence of NDX. Circos plot analysis of the identified differential contacts revealed the topography of weakened (blue) and enhanced (red) Hi-C interaction network highlighting that intrachromosomal contacts are mostly decreased while interchromosomal contacts tend to increase in the ndx1–4 mutant (Fig. 9a). Another striking change was the rearrangement of the Knot structure which consists of an entanglement of ten genomic regions in wild-type plants6265. Knot-forming regions showed increased interchromosomal contact frequencies in ndx1–4 with the entry of new regions and parallel loss of other intra- and interchromosomal connections (Fig. 9b). Interestingly the T-DNA insert inactivating the NDX locus was also anchored to the Knot in ndx1–4 plants consistent with recent Hi-C data showing that transgene integration can induce novel Knot interactions65. We also analyzed Hi-C data from available epigenetic mutants (met1 ddm1 clf28 swn7) and compared them to ndx1–4. The results show that the Hi-C pattern of ndx1–4 was similar to that of the met1 and ddm1 mutants however overall interaction frequency changes were milder in ndx1–4 (Fig. 9b and Supplementary Fig. 16b c). Several new regions joined the Knot in all three mutants that do not appear in Col-0 (Fig. 9b); however in the ddm1 and met1 mutants additional regions also interact with the Knot that are not present in ndx1–4 (Fig. 9c). Therefore chromatin structure changes observed in ddm1 and met1 are more severe than in ndx1–4. The clf28 swn7 mutant lacks all H3K27me366 and previous Hi-C analysis showed that spatial interactions of H3K27me3-enriched minidomains were reduced in clf28 swn7 however no Hi-C change was found in the Knot63. Our analysis gave similar results as the Hi-C pattern of the clf28 swn7 mutant was different from all three mutants (Supplementary Fig. 16d) and the de novo Knot interactions were absent from clf28 swn7. Therefore in terms of genome organization clf28 swn7 appears to operate in a different pathway than ddm1 met1 and ndx1–4 which all showed somewhat similar Knot interaction patterns. These associations reinforce the link between NDX and DNA methylation pathways. Another important Hi-C change in ndx1–4 occurred at pericentromeric regions with a general decrease in local intra-centromeric interactions (Fig. 9e upper panel) and an increase in inter-centromeric interactions (except for CEN chr1/CEN chr4 Fig. 9e lower panel). The same trend was true for all intra- and interchromosomal interactions of centromeres that were significantly weakened (blue) or enhanced (red) in the ndx1–4 mutant (Fig. 9f). We propose that reduced intracentromeric interactions in the absence of NDX results in chromatin decompaction at pericentromeric regions (where NDX is enriched in wild-type plants) which strongly correlates with the location of sRNA expression changes and CHH/CHG methylation changes observed in the ndx1–4 mutant. Whether the above chromatin changes are directly or indirectly mediated by NDX remains unclear. Nevertheless chromatin compactness analysis67 suggests that NDX has a direct effect on the condensation state of hypomethylated CHH regions (Supplementary Fig. 17) as NDX-enriched hypo-CHHs show significantly higher Hi-C compactness than hypo CHHs not bound by NDX (in wild-type plants). This indicates that NDX binding at these sites can directly promote chromatin condensation which is inversely changed in the ndx1–4 mutant due to the loss of NDX (see Hi-C data).

Finally it should be noted that the chromatin binding of NDX does not scale with 3D chromatin compactness i.e. NDX shows preferential enrichment in pericentromeric heterochromatin that is not due to the condensed state or high local DNA concentration of this chromatin type. To demonstrate this we compared the Hi-C compactness of pericentromeric Knob and chromosomal arm regions in terms of NDX binding (Supplementary Fig. 18). The analysis showed that the compactness of all three regions differ significantly such that the most condensed is the heterochromatic Knob region followed by pericentromeres and chromosome arms. Pericentromeric and Knob regions appear to bind more NDX per unit length than chromosome arms however the Knob showed similar NDX enrichment as pericentromeric regions despite its greater compactness. This suggests that NDX binding is disproportionate to compactness. When comparing regions with similar compactness (by random sampling from the above regions) chromosome arms still showed significantly lower NDX enrichment despite their same condensation state (Supplementary Fig. 18c). It follows that NDX preferentially interacts with constitutive heterochromatin regardless of local chromatin density."

That’s why TNC’s relationships with ranchers like Bruchez are so important. For years Bruchez has worked with university scientists government experts and nonprofit groups on river restoration installing riffle structures that create habitat for fish and insects cool the water and raise the water level so that it continues to reach irrigation pumps. Bruchez is now working with TNC on a multi-year research project to understand the impacts of different irrigation regimens on grass fields and hay meadows the dominant irrigated crops in western Colorado.

“We need to not be afraid right now to try stuff” he says. “If we do nothing that’s failure. We don’t have 20 more years to do this. It’s time to throw the bowl of spaghetti at the wall and see what sticks.”

As a community leader Bruchez is the liaison between many other local ranching families and TNC. TNC’s ongoing work with the community to develop better ways of growing crops involves multiple ranches whose participation is key. “It wouldn’t be possible without someone like Paul in the community” explains Derwingson. “He’s the point person for our on-the-ground projects.”

Learning how to get by with less water won’t be easy. The ecological impacts of the changing climate are complex as are the political aspects of sharing water fairly among different states industries and populations—all while leaving enough water in the river for nature.

“That’s why we need partners in the ranching community with the state and federal governments with the universities and more” Derwingson says. “It will take everyone with a stake in the system to solve this puzzle.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiU2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnByb3Rvb2xyZXZpZXdzLmNvbS9ncmVlbndvcmtzLTI0di1icnVzaGxlc3MtZHJpbGwtZHJpdmVyLXJldmlldy1kZGc0MDEv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Greenworks 24V Brushless Drill Driver Review DDG401,"Greenworks 24V Brushless Drill Driver Works on the Same Batteries as Lawn Care Equipment

You may be familiar with Greenworks as a lawn care manufacturer but they also have an emerging line of power tools to complement their 24V and 48V (2 x 24V) lawn care products. We decided to take a closer look at the Greenworks 24V brushless drill driver to see what it has to offer.

Editor’s Note: Think you know everything? Our How to Use a Drill article might still manage to show you a thing or two. Also check out our best cordless drill article for our top picks.

Greenworks 24V Brushless Drill Driver Performance

Running on a 24V system has advantages. Technically 24V max the tool runs at 21.6V nominally thanks to a 6-cell battery system. Most cordless tools run on a 5-cell system that makes them 20V max and 18V nominal. So there is more energy stored in the batteries compared to 18V/20V max tools because there’s an extra cell in there to draw from.

Greenworks takes that 24V max battery and pairs it with a brushless motor and 2-speed gearbox to hit speeds up to 380 RPM at low and 1450 RPM at high. For torque you get up to 310 in-lbs to work with.

That level of performance can do a lot of different jobs. We were even able to use 2 9/16-inch self-feed bits in studs without bogging the motor down.

For those lighter jobs 18 clutch settings help you dial in the torque you need to properly set fasteners without overdriving them.

Greenworks 24V Brushless Drill Driver Design Notes

Ergonomics

Greenworks’ motor selection helps keep the drill pretty narrow and it comes across as compact and lightweight in your hand. Bare the tool weighs just 2.3 pounds and only jumps to 3.19 pounds with a 2.0Ah battery attached.

Clark a 19-year-old bald eagle was recorded going through TSA with his handlers for his return flight home to Missouri. The footage and photos caught the attention of Twitter.

Clark is a flying ambassador of World Bird Sanctuary in south St. Louis. The scales on his talons never developed properly and he would eventually get pneumonia and die if he were to hunt in the wild the nonprofit's executive director Dawn Griffard told NPR over the phone.

Griffard said Clark's job is to spread a message about conservation and raise money to support the sanctuary. He does this by attending events to fly to songs like The Star Spangled Banner or You Raise Me Up.

Griffard said that Clark who is named for William Clark – and yes there is another eagle named Lewis at his sanctuary – is hired to fly between four to six times a year. Over the course of 12 years this frequent flier has taken more than 100 commercial flights.

Eagles may not have shoes or belts to remove but they have their own version of being patted down. A TSA search of a bald eagle involves investigating its crate and under the carpet inside it.

People at airports often want to touch or see Clark and his stewards have to deny their requests to stick their fingers through the window in his crate. But usually they're respectful Griffard said.

Much to World Bird Sanctuary's appreciation Southwest Airlines lets Clark travel in the main cabin. Other airlines don't allow this and Griffard has had to put him in cargo in the past – once she said an airline misplaced him this way.

Despite standing 30 inches high and weighing 7.5 pounds Clark gets two seats and three seat-belt extenders. That's because of his crate which gets strapped in at the plane's bulkhead. A member of World Bird Sanctuary's eagle team sits beside the crate to keep an eye on him and give him snacks — typically bits of rat Griffard explained.

In each stage of travel World Bird Sanctuary's team the airport staff and often even the Southwest pilots are careful to keep Clark's trip as bump-free as possible. He hates turbulence.

When the group arrives at their destination Clark gets his own hotel room. They move the furniture and throw a large tarp over the floor. He gets a perch in the middle of the room from which he watches TV. Griffard said he prefers cartoons and nature shows.

Scarecrows with creepy faces are seen in a former school building in Amakusa Kumamoto Prefecture.

AMAKUSA Kumamoto — A building that used to be a school is now a haunted house for summer only using kakashi scarecrows with creepy faces.

The former elementary school building in Amakusa Kumamoto Prefecture is now used as a roadside rest area called Miyajidake Kakashi no Sato. The facility’s management company launched the project to give visitors a fright with about 200 scarecrows.

Scarecrows are erected in corridors and in the corners of classrooms with windows and walls covered by blackout curtains.

The Miyajidake district in Amakusa where the event is taking place is known for a scarecrow festival held from March to May every year. The company drew eerie-looking faces on pieces of cloth and put them over the scarecrows’ heads.

The haunted school is open from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. and runs until Sept. 4. Admission is ¥200 for junior high school students and older and ¥100 for elementary school students and younger. If you make purchases in the roadside rest area’s stores and restaurants you will receive one admission ticket for every ¥1000 spent.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMifGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmluZGlhLmNvbS9uZXdzL2luZGlhL2tlcmFsYS10cmF2ZWwtcGxhbnMtcnVpbmVkLWZvci1iZW5nYWx1cnUta2VyYWxpdGVzLWhlYWRpbmctaG9tZS1mb3Itb25hbS1oZXJlcy13aHktNTU5ODU3Mi_SAYABaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuaW5kaWEuY29tL25ld3MvaW5kaWEva2VyYWxhLXRyYXZlbC1wbGFucy1ydWluZWQtZm9yLWJlbmdhbHVydS1rZXJhbGl0ZXMtaGVhZGluZy1ob21lLWZvci1vbmFtLWhlcmVzLXdoeS01NTk4NTcyL2FtcC8?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Travel Plans Ruined For Bengaluru Keralites Heading Home For Onam.

Travel Plans Ruined For Bengaluru Keralites Heading Home For Onam. Here’s Why.

Travel Plans Ruined For Bengaluru Keralites Heading Home For Onam. Here’s Why.

With the Railways announcing only one special weekend train and there not being enough buses travel plans of Keralites in Bengaluru wanting to head back home for Onam festivities have been ruined.

Bengaluru Keralites heading back home for Onam face difficulties.

Bengaluru: Situation of transport non-availability has left the Keralites in Bengaluru in quite a lurch as those thousands of people plan to travel back home for Onam festivities to begin from August 31. The Indian Railways has disappointed the travelers by announcing just one weekend special train. Taking a road trip via buses is also not an option as the Kerala State Road Transport Corporation (KSRTC) too has not equipped itself to cater to the whopping demand despite arraying new long-distance buses under KSRTC-Swift earlier this year reported The Hindu.

Taking advantage of the situation private buses that have become the only option for travelers now have tripled their per person fare to around ₹4500. Travelers have been left at the mercy of travel companies that operate approximately 300 private buses. The fare is expected to rise higher to even ₹5000 as the Onam festival nears. As a result many people have dropped plans to travel to Kerala for the festive season reported The Hindu.

Narrating her recent ordeal with a private bus operator running services to Thiruvananthapuram from Bengaluru Devi Biju a lawyer based in the IT hub told The Hindu that many operators delay or do not refund the ticket fare even if the cancellations are made well in advance. “They make a fortune selling the same seat to others. A few popular online travel portals are hand in glove with this. I lost ₹2000 recently and would shortly send a legal notice to the firms seeking a refund.”

“The best alternative is to operate more trains and buses on the route. It is a pity that only a single special train has been announced so far while KSRTC is dragging its feet. That the Indian Railway Catering and Tourism Corporation (IRCTC) website is terribly slow is yet another woe” she added.

Commuters many of whom were forced to drive the entire route in cars have been demanding that the government also step in to rein in private bus operators and fix an upper slab on the fare.

The Hindu reported that there is potential to operate more trains in the Bengaluru route since the Sir M. Visveswaraya Terminal station has been developed in the city. “Commuters could book well in advance so that special trains can be operated when the waiting list exceeds 240. On their part both Southern Railway and South-Western Railway must agree to accommodate more trains in the sector” The Hindu quoted sources.

Rubis Energy Uganda one of the leading oil and gas companies in the country on Thursday announced the rebrand and launch of its convenience stores tailored to serve both long-distance travelers and those within the cities. The rebrand of the stores to ENJOY countrywide is in line with the investment agenda of Rubis since its inception in the country.

The 24-hour stores will have a fully operational café to cater for walk-in clients seeking to grab a quick bite before embarking on their trips. The retail stores will also provide customers with an array of commodities ranging from soft drinks snacks groceries liquor and coffee to mention but a few.

In a move to reposition the RUBiS Energy brand Olivier Gatera the RUBiS Uganda Country Manager revealed that the new RUBiS stores dubbed ENJOY have state-of-the- art facilities to cater for their customers.

“Today we launch our rebranded stores ENJOY a one-stop center to the public designed to ensure that travelers are in a position to refresh and reboot for the continuation of their journeys” Gatera said.

Furthermore while speaking about the current trend of fuel prices in the country Gatera cited the various incentives and ways in which RUBiS has purposed to ease the burden of acquisition of fuel and commodities on their customers. And he further mentioned that a reduction in pump prices shall be seen in the market following the recent international oil prices drop.

“Despite the past rise in prices to acquire oil and gas worldwide we have aimed to mitigate and minimize the increase while at the same time keeping the business afloat and able to serve Ugandans” Gatera said. He added that: “All our customers that purchase fuel and items with the RUBiS card automatically get a discount off their purchase. This was instituted to enable our customers enjoy acquiring our services.”

In addition to the discounts given at every purchase with the RUBiS card customers for the next seven weeks will also stand a chance to win instant goodies from the stores countrywide

Rubis Energy is committed to continue providing convenience to its customers the number of our convenience ENJOY shops shall continue to grow from current 15 shops to approximately 50 in the next 18 months and more in the near future.

The night included fan-favorites from her extensive discography such as “Bad Romance” “Poker Face” and “Born This Way” a number of selections from the tour’s titular album 2020’s Chromatica and even a rendition of her A Star Is Born collaboration “Shallow” along with her famous flurry of costume changes and elaborate production.

Even with 13 pyrotechnic flame-heads shooting 60 feet into the air from multiple stages and an array of towers Lady Gaga’s larger-than-life stage presence seemed to burn brightest of all throughout the performance. Her magnetism was perhaps most apparent during the show’s third of four “acts” when she emerged on a stage at the center of the park for a run of powerul solo piano numbers.

The “Little Monsters” in the crowd matched the singer’s energy all night long roaring along to each hit song each off-hand musing each bold statement on the state of the world (from the fallout of COVID to her implied disapproval of Georgia’s regressive reproductive laws).

That award goes to a player from the Atlanta Mascots team that played against a peewee football squad at halftime. Blooper the Atlanta Braves’ mascot left it all out on the field in a wildly entertaining performance.

Blooper didn’t take it easy like his fellow mascots. He was stiff-arming kids left and right as he made his way to the end zone showing no mercy despite the noticeable size difference.

We’re not entirely sure what the final score of this contest was but Blooper made sure that he was the most valuable player for his team when all was said and done. Maybe the Falcons will give him a call soon too.

The Falcons would go on to defeat the Jaguars 28-12 when they took the field after Blooper and his Atlanta team for the second half.

Not GNB Voc-Tech’s Tyler Tavares.

“It was like a dog trapped in a cage and I’m trying to get my way out and finally they let everything down” he said. “Masks off this and that. Next thing you know it’s almost like the world is crashing in on you. I was kind of lost. I didn’t know what to do.”

The thought of being around large groups made Tavares sick.

“I couldn’t go to school” he said. “Before school I would throw up. I felt so sick to my stomach. I couldn't get through class. I couldn’t do anything.”

Tavares knew it couldn’t keep going on like this.

“I was looking for help” he said. “I was too scared to say it. One day I finally let it all out to someone. I think it was my mother. After that I sought the help that I needed.”

It took six months on a waitlist for Tavares to get help at Butler Hospital a private non-profit psychiatric and substance abuse facility in Providence.

As he focused on improving his mental health Tavares stepped away from football a sport he had played since he was little.

“I’m definitely a lot more mentally stronger this year than last year” said the junior running back. “Personally I suffered with a lot of depression and anxiety last season. Toward the end of last season I had to take it off and take time for myself and I went to a mental hospital.”

Tavares said he also benefited from mental performance training workshops GNB Voc-Tech hosted earlier this year for student athletes in the school.

“When she started up the program that’s when everything clicked” said Tavares noting that Dr. Heather Larkin was instrumental in his progress. “Laura Wilde came to our school and she had a program for mental health. She pretty much touched base on everything. The main thing that stuck with me was staying where your feet are.

“For example right now I’m at practice. I’m where my feet are. I’m on the turf. I’m focused on this exact minute. I’m not worried about what is going to happen in five minutes or what happened five minutes ago. I’m not worried about any of that.”

Staying mentally healthy:Pros are doing it. Now GNB Voc-Tech athletes say mental performance training helps.

GNB Voc-Tech head coach Justin Cruz said that in years past the Bears have struggled with the mental side of football.

“Sometimes we’d get down on ourselves if a play didn’t go our way and we wouldn’t be able to recover” said Cruz who also participated in the mental performance training. “You talk to coaches and they talk about how we get guys mentally tough. How do you teach that and train that? It’s another tool in the toolbox for us.”

Senior running back Joseph Brightman said the training has given him a new outlook.

“I remember last year I had a lot of mistakes and I was always stuck on that moment but the mental training helped me” he said. “We need to focus on the next play. Don’t worry about what happened last play. You can’t keep on thinking about what happened last. Football is a sport that you have to keep on going forward and go 100% every play.

“Last year whenever someone scored on us we would always get down on ourselves. We were getting down on each other. I think this year we’re going to be better with that.”

With the graduation of several players Tavares knows he’ll have a much bigger role out of the backfield and he’s ready for it.

“There’s definitely a lot more pressure on me this year” said Tavares who lives in Fairhaven. “I just want to do the best this season I can. A lot of people are depending on me to do big things that I’ve set myself to do and I haven’t been able to accomplish that because of what I’ve had going on. I’m trying to lead the team and do my part.”

After reaching the State Vocational Large School championship a year ago expectations are high for the Bears this fall.

“We’d like to get back to the vocational state championship game and we’d like to win that this time” said Cruz. “Beyond that we’d like to make the (MIAA) playoffs again. We did that the year before COVID.”

The Bears reeled off three straight wins to reach the 2021 Vocational championship but lost to Northeast Metro 30-7.

“Every time I worked out in the weight room in the offseason that’s what I was thinking about” said GNB Voc-Tech senior linebacker/wide receiver Jerry Vasconcelos. “It was a long ride home and it was cold. We got blown out and it was heartbreaking. It was terrible.”

Junior quarterback Jhaiden Reis agreed “We really wanted that championship. It was tough for us but that gave me motivation for this season. I’m going to work as hard as I can to get back there and help others along the way.”

Reis is battling for the starting QB spot with sophomore Nick Boucher after the graduation of Cam Lynch.

“We’ve got some talented younger players” Cruz said. “No matter who we lose it’s high school football and we rebuild and we’re rebuilding strong.

“We talked about building a program to a point where guys aren’t playing by default. They’re playing behind a senior who has earned his spot and we’re right on track for that. We’ve got [Joseph] Brightman and [Tyler] Tavares who both have some varsity experience but they had to earn their time in the backfield.”

Senior wide receiver/outside linebacker Michael Murphy said a strength of this year’s team is its closeness.

“Since the COVID season we haven’t had a lot of bonding time but this summer we’ve all been doing 7-on-7 weightlifting in the gym and hanging out with each other” he said. “The bond we’re building up over the summer is building up chemistry.”

Junior lineman Isander Algarin added “A lot of us put in the work. I think we’re ready.”

The renderings that were dropped at the time of that announcement were pretty great. They showed bell towers the Double-T scoreboard and two jumbotrons.

The previous renderings also showed the football facility and were filled with two-dimensional ghosts roaming the grounds. When the graphics came out Texas Tech fans went wild with their imaginations about what this might look like in real life. At the Red Raider Club Kickoff lunch Texas Tech Athletics gave us a better idea.

The video above shows provides some much better views of what the project will look like and they're absolutely incredible.

The screenshots below show the team running out from the center of the field behind the goal post with the Masked Rider leading the way. The top right photo shows from the outside of the stadium with the Womble Football Facility and the sky bridge in full view. The bottom right shows an aerial view with the landscape of Lubbock looking great.

The coolest photo in my opinion is the bottom left one. The team coming out through the brand new south endzone is going to look so cool.

The construction on the south endzone is scheduled to start following the 2022 season and is expected to be completed by the 2024 season. The football facility will be started after spring practice in 2023. There will be some creative solutions for the football team in the meantime but it will all be worth it in the end.

Texas Tech Will Go 5-7 if the FPI is Correct The ESPN FPI or the Football Power Index is a mathematical formula like they have in any other league. It claims to ""measure a team's true strength on net points scale; expected point margin vs average opponent on a neutral field."" according to ESPN. The projected results are based on 20000 simulations of the rest of the season using the FPI as a model. The preseason projections are incomplete because a large piece of the puzzle is results that have already happened impacting the remaining schedule. So based on half the puzzle Texas Tech is projected to get wins in five of their games. These projections change daily once the season starts but it's good to get a baseline on what is analytically expected of you heading into the season.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMijQFodHRwczovL2tpdGNoZW5lci5jdHZuZXdzLmNhL3JldHJvLWNvbXB1dGluZy1leHBvLXRyYW5zZm9ybXMta2l0Y2hlbmVyLWZhcm0taW50by10ZWNoLXRpbWUtY2Fwc3VsZS0xLjYwNDYyMDQ_Y2FjaGU9eWVzJTIzdG9wJTNGY2xpcElkJTNENjQyNjjSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Retro computing expo transforms Kitchener farm into tech time capsule,"If you like bulky keyboards and two-inch screens Kitchener’s Steckle Heritage Farm was the place to be Sunday.

The World of Retro Computing Expo featured computers video games and type writers dating back to the 1970s.

About 100 machines from brands including Commodore Tandy and MacIntosh were on display at the one-day free interactive event.

“From the 70s you really had to tell [the computer] what you wanted it to do” said World of Retro Computing founder Justus Jurica. “Now they’re beginning to know what you want it to do.”

Nostalgia was the name of the game on Sunday and Jurica doesn’t see that disappearing from the sphere anytime soon.

“The evolution of computers is growing all the time and there will always be nostalgia in computers” Jurica said.

While some machines at the expo on Sunday were in their original condition others had serious upgrades.

“This is a 1981 Commodore PET 2001” explained one person in attendance. “I decided to put an entire new computer inside of it it’s my main computer. Anything I can do on my laptop I can do on my desktop.”

As retro computing enthusiast Kirk Rietveld explained old computers can still have modern uses.

“We can connect old computers and the internet we can talk to people online using computers from 40 years ago. So even just because it’s old doesn’t mean it has to be thrown out” Rietveld said.

Others at the event were looking for parts for their devices.

“I need a floppy drive maybe a graphics card would be great” said Taylor Allen. “This table is perfect for me this is what I’m looking for. You can’t really get this stuff anymore.”",,,

The Board of Education approved the negotiation process for the potential sale of the property in a 5-1 vote recently. Stacie Mills was the lone dissenter.

Mills said she voted against the item after a community member voiced her concerns about the potential sale to one of the proposed buyers – Tyson Foods. Both Tyson and the city of Elk Run Heights showed interest in the property at 316 McCoy Road in July during a Waterloo Community Schools’ facilities meeting.

Tyson is proposing to use the building as a preschool for employees of the company which has a meatpacking plant three miles away in Waterloo. Elk Run Heights Mayor Lisa Smock said the city would use the land for housing.

The action taken by the board Monday didn’t result in the sale of the land or property to any buyers. Rather it was a “procedural” step to begin negotiations with interested parties according to Michael Coughlin board treasurer and the district’s chief financial officer. He said no offers have been made.

Laura Benson of Evansdale spoke against selling the property to Tyson.

She noted residents pay taxes to the district “and you’re taking things away from us. We want to see you replace that building just like you did for Jewett Poyner and Bunger.” Jewett was actually replaced by Poyner Elementary School and Bunger Middle School is still in use.

The Elk Run building is being replaced by a new 12-classroom preschool wing at Lowell Elementary School that students will begin attending Monday.

Benson also said she’s concerned for small communities near Waterloo such as Raymond Gilbertville Elk Run Heights and Evansdale because of a lack of schools in those areas. She noted Elk Run Heights and Evansdale no longer have a preschool or a Head Start program.

“If our kids are being shipped into Waterloo … that excommunicates a lot of parents from their school activities” Benson said. “Driving into Waterloo is a hindrance and if you don’t have transportation what do you do?”

She noted she isn’t against Tyson’s proposal but said creating a preschool is “something our school district should be doing.”

With Benson’s comments board member Mills’ interest was piqued and she wanted more information.

“I didn’t know some of the things that had been brought up with the community member” Mills said. “There wasn’t time for me to ask questions and (voting no) was my only recourse to pump the brakes.”

Mills said she is going to look at Poyner Elementary and gather more information.

There is no formal offer on the table and no dollar amount has been discussed. The city of Elk Run Heights has asked Waterloo Schools to transfer ownership to it which is possible because both are entities that levy local property taxes Coughlin said.

Elk Run Heights also voiced a preference that the district demolish the building before giving it to the city due to the cost of demolition and asbestos abatement.

Superintendent Jared Smith was appointed to be the agent to talk to interested parties. The discussions will take place in closed session so offers will not be made public – similar to putting offers on a house Coughlin said. Once Smith makes his decision it will go to the full board which will make the final decision in an open session.

Coughlin said there are no deadlines for the sale process so other interested parties could join negotiations at any time.

“The board is not bound to the highest bidder – it’s for best use” Coughlin said. Rather it’s based on “what the party wants to do with the facility and (the committee would) determine from that what they would recommend to the full board.”

The first public hearing to gather input on how people view the sale and disposal occurred in April. Community members have the option of making public comments at every board meeting Coughlin noted and people can express their feelings on any issue.

Kuelo a rising union organizer who came to the United States from Congo won election as president amid criticism that the local's previous leadership had been too accommodating of Tyson Foods. The local represents employees at the company's giant meatpacking plant in Waterloo and many felt it hadn't done enough to urge Tyson to adopt safety measures in the early days of the COVID-19 pandemic when thousands of workers on the packed production lines fell ill and seven died.

But decades before the COVID-19 pandemic the Davenport-based local had a complicated and contentious history.

“Local 431 has received a vast amount of criticism"" former Local 431 President Dick Edwards once told oral historian Shelton Stromquist. ""We’ve been called whores and everything else.”

With 4250 members Local 431 is not the largest UFCW in Iowa ranking behind Local 1155 in Marshalltown (4305 members) and Local 222 in Sioux City (4690 members).

But Local 431 straddles the line with Illinois a closed-shop state where members have to pay dues. The local's JBS plant in Beardstown gives the group more firepower than most in the state. For the last 20 years Local 431 has received an average of $6.1 million in annual membership dues more than the two bigger UFCW locals combined.

As industry shifts employment wages drop

Local 431 began in 1936 as part of the Amalgamated Meat Cutters and Butcher Workmen of North America the less militant of the two major meatpacking unions. While its counterparts organized locals around big plants and went on strike frequently Local 431 organized as many businesses as possible — no matter how small.

The local didn’t push for wages as high as other labor groups did Edwards said. But as meatpackers modernized and took harder lines against unions he argued the local’s members were less likely to lose their jobs.

Local 431 leaders faced uncomfortable challenges after a series of mergers between unions seeking to offset layoffs and plant closings that cost them members. The shift began when industry veterans formed a new company IBP in 1960.

The company also known as Iowa Beef Processors installed a system that allowed managers to “de-skill” the labor of a packing plant. While individual workers at the time made several types of full meat cuts IBP sent carcasses down a production line that required workers to make simple repetitive cuts.

IBP processed meat faster than competitors did. As opposed to the old practice of sending retailers larger quarters of meat IBP cut the product into smaller portions and packaged the product ready for sale at grocery stores. The new system allowed retailers to shed their skilled butchers.

IBP executives took a hardline stance against unions while paying lower wages than competitors. The company refused to sign master agreements with unions covering multiple locations which would give labor leaders some leverage. An eight-month-long Dakota City strike included fire bombings smashed windows and the murder of the sister of a suspected company informant Western Michigan University historian Wilson Warren wrote in “Struggling with ‘Iowa’s Pride’” a history of the Ottumwa meatpackers who saw their lives upended during the shift in the industry.

In 1974 IBP co-founder Currier Holman was convicted of conspiring with a Mafia leader to pay off meat and supermarket officials brokering a labor peace agreement to get his product into the New York beef market. Roger Horowitz a University of Delaware labor historian said union leaders later caught IBP filing false injury logs with inspectors in 1985 covering up workplace dangers. The discovery led to a $2.6 million fine from the Occupational Health and Safety Administration.

IBP thrived and competitors imitated its labor methods. From 1972-80 Warren wrote about 5600 meatpackers in Iowa lost their jobs.

Union mergers bring clash of styles

Against this backdrop unions of different philosophies merged. The AMCBWA which included Local 431 merged with the United Packinghouse Workers of America in 1968. The latter more militant union had represented workers at plants in Ottumwa Fort Dodge and Waterloo.

Unlike the AMCBWA the UPWA organized single big plants. Local leaders became community cornerstones weighing in on local political races and helping desegregate businesses. Unions moved Iowa from a deeply Republican state in the 1940s to a moderate state 20 years later Warren wrote.

But the meatpackers kept losing members. The union merged again in 1979 this time with an organization representing retail clerks creating the UFCW.

Edwards the former Local 431 president said company managers at times welcomed the union as leaders tried to organize workers. He acknowledged that the group's work may have undercut more militant locals affiliated with the UPWA.

“We’ve had companies that have contacted us when they have heard that the UPWA was starting to organize them and allowed us to come right into the plant and maybe right into their lunchroom and hold a captive-audience meeting with their employees” Edwards told Stromquist in 1983. “We’ve done that. Whether it’s quite legal or not I don’t know. But we still think we’re doing a job for our people. That’s what we’re concerned about.”

Local 431 reached such an arrangement in 1976 before Hormel Food Corp. opened a pork processing factory in Ottumwa said Dan Varner a former leader with the local.

More:Unfounded shortage claims led to lax guidance 'unsafe conditions' for meatpacking workers report says

Varner said Hormel executives were wary of Ottumwa because the former UPWA local there had a reputation for militancy. The union then known as UPWA Local 1 had conducted work stoppages as much as once a week when John Morrell & Co. operated a plant in Ottumwa. The local's members also threatened non-union members with violence flooded managers’ offices with up to 100 employees to force changes in working conditions and once lifted an engineer's car off the ground when he tried to shuttle replacement workers into the plant during a strike.

To prevent the old radical workers from unionizing the new operation Varner said Hormel struck a deal with Local 431. He said the local would get easy access to dues-paying members while the company would get a union that “didn’t cause too much trouble.”

Local 431 leaders told Varner who had been a night steward at the Oscar Meyer plant in Davenport to move to Ottumwa. He was among the first 10 workers the company hired and managers gave him a relatively cushy job driving a forklift. He said they let him organize workers on company time without resistance.

Varner became the unit’s chief steward. But he slowly became radicalized.

He said Local 431 leadership didn’t respond to complaints about the company making him a target among the rank-and-file. From March to May 1984 according to Warren the company laid off about 560 employees draining the factory until members agreed to a contract that cut hourly wages from $31 to $25 in today’s dollars.

Varner said the cuts angered workers. A year later Austin Minnesota-based UFCW Local P-9 — filled with former UPWA members — went on strike against Hormel. The action split the union. UFCW International officers cautioned the workers against the strike eventually cut off their weekly strike pay and replaced the local's leaders with other members who crossed the line.

In Ottumwa Varner said most members sided with the P-9 leaders. When the company hired replacement workers in Austin P-9 members exerted pressure by picketing other unionized Hormel plants.

They asked union members at those plants to stay out of work citing clauses in their contracts with Hormel that allowed them to honor valid picket lines. Hormel executives argued that the picket lines outside Ottumwa were invalid. The local leaders sided with the company issuing a statement saying “431 is not on strike and under its contract it may not go out at this time.”

Varner said Local 431 President Louis DeFrieze urged him to talk the members out of going on strike. Varner declined joining about 500 Ottumwa members who honored the line and stayed off the job.

“Local 431 and Hormel felt that they were both going to be injured on this whole thing” Varner told the Des Moines Register in a recent interview. “Their cozy understanding agreement whatever you want to call it it fell apart on them.”

Hormel fired the Ottumwa strikers and about a year later closed the plant. Varner said DeFrieze who had become a UFCW International officer denied his request for a job at another local.

“Within the labor organization that Louis had any clout with I was blackballed” said Varner who picked up a job with the American Federation of State County and Municipal Employees. “I was not going to get any type of union position within UFCW.”

Excel a subsidiary of Cargill bought the Ottumwa facility soon after and hired workers for the equivalent of $14 an hour — about 44% less than what Hormel had paid. Local 431 tried to organize the Excel plant. Ottumwa workers refused successfully lobbying for their own charter Local 230. Ousted P-9 president Jim Guyette filed an assault charge against DeFrieze telling police DeFrieze tried to punch him when they ran into each other at a Miami labor convention.

Horowitz the University of Delaware historian said the failed actions in Austin and Ottumwa were a “devastating blow” for militant meatpackers.

“The lesson that the UFCW took from that is ‘Those meatpacking workers are a pain in the neck’” he said.

UFCW takes stance on immigrant issues

Despite the black eye Local 431 remained one of Iowa's most powerful unions.

Its resources from the Beardstown plant in Illinois allowed Local 431 to extend its reach to blue-collar workers around the state — even those who aren’t members. DeFrieze was an active board member of the local United Way in the 1980s successfully urging members to donate funds a pool of money that became especially important when five local farm implement plants closed from 1984-87 sending the unemployment rate in the Quad Cities near 9%.

After the makeup of the workforce shifted toward immigrants Local 431 tried to organize Agriprocessors a kosher meatpacking plant in Postville. The local publicly called the company out for food safety violations. Organizers worked with federal and state inspectors on investigations into child labor and minimum wage law violations.

A week before U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents raided the Postville plant in May 2008 leading to 400 arrests and mass deportations of undocumented workers to Guatemala UFCW International leaders unsuccessfully urged the federal directors to back off. They said a raid would disrupt the investigations into the company’s owners.

A year later the UFCW published a research paper advocating against immigration raids arguing that federal officials round up many legal workers and deny employees access to lawyers. The Obama administration ultimately moved away from the raids that had characterized the previous administration’s approach to immigration enforcement.

Some Local 431 leaders have defended DeFrieze’s concessionary stance toward companies at the time of the Ottumwa strife arguing that his approach helped preserve the local.

Jerry Messer who went on to serve as Local 431’s president told an oral historian that DeFrieze prevented the closing of an Oscar Meyer plant in Davenport by convincing members to take contract concessions. He added that DeFrieze kept him out of Ottumwa during the 1986 standoff trying to keep Messer’s name clean for his future as a union leader.

“The local would have survived the closing of the Oscar plant” Messer said. “But it wouldn’t be what it is today.”

MINNEAPOLIS — Saturday was a first for U.S. Bank Stadium housing their largest-ever pyrotechnics display. The German metal band Rammstein brought 1350 tons of stage equipment into the stadium to build a stage fit with fire cannons and its own elevator.

The equipment was flown in on seven 747 planes from Europe before being transported to each city on 90 semis. Minneapolis was the first U.S. stop in the bands 12-city North America tour. It's also the first time Rammstein has played in an NFL stadium.

Nick Pain the audio crew chief says the scale of the production sets it apart from most. The stage was 200 feet wide 100 feet deep and 120 feet tall.

""Some of these people it's the first time they've worked on a big show. They look at it with wide eyes"" Pain said. ""It can be a shock for some people!""

This has been a sticking point for sellers — several told Reuters that the recommended method would include providing financial technology platform Plaid with their banking username and password.

Etsy also reportedly provided an option to self-verify though some found it “tedious.”

Plaid last year agreed to pay $58 million to settle a case alleging it had used peoples’ financial information without consent. But the company has said it’s looking to provide a “secure experience” for users.

One seller critiqued Etsy for having a “history of less-than-stellar communication and customer service contributes to a general lack of trust in Etsy.” A transaction fee increase at the site also provoked negative reactions earlier in the year. And some users have said they may quit the platform over the various issues.

Etsy didn’t immediately respond to a PYMNT request for comment.

Even with the derision though Etsy reported 6 million new buyers in Q2 and a 10% increase in revenue in spite of the current economic conditions PYMNTS wrote.

The company said the rate of new buyers was “meaningfully elevated” from pre-pandemic levels. CFO Rachel Glaser said the revenue for the quarter had come from changes the company made such as the transaction fee increase along with adding Depop and Elo7 to its brand portfolio.

And CEO Josh Silverman said the results from that quarter showed that Etsy had kept up with the gains it made during the pandemic.

“Despite facing headwinds caused by macroeconomic and geopolitical factors we believe the improvements we’ve driven in customer experiences across the Etsy marketplace and our House of Brands coupled with continued focus on our ‘Right to Win’ strategy will enable us to unlock the enormous long-term opportunities we see ahead” he said.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiKmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJiYy5jb20vbmV3cy9idXNpbmVzcy02MjcxMDY0NtIBLmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJiYy5jb20vbmV3cy9idXNpbmVzcy02MjcxMDY0Ni5hbXA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Asia stock markets slide on US interest rate fears,

DEERFIELD BEACH Fla. -- An Uber driver and mother in south Florida is thankful to be alive.

She said a man who she picked up stabbed her several times and tried to kill her.

""This is blood right here; this is all blood on me"" Brittany Evans told WSVN.

There was blood on her jeans shirt and cut-up hands.

Evans an Uber driver walked out of the hospital Friday morning after a terrifying night.

""After I just made a delivery Uber gave me a ping to go ... pick up a guy"" she said.

Jonathan Hartman wearing a hoodie sat in the back seat around midnight Friday.

Like many Uber rides he began with friendly conversation.

""He was asking me what school I go to. He was asking me if I'm a single mom how many nights do I Uber"" she said.

The single mom who drives for Uber to pay for college and her 8-year-old child said the drive almost killed her.

""He hunched over from the back seat to the front with a steak knife and put it up to my neck and he said that he was going to kill me. He said that he was going to make my son an orphan he said that he was going to hijack the car and he said I only wanted to kill you that's all the reason why I got into Uber"" Evans said.

Hartman she said became ruthless when he pulled out the steak knife.

""When he put the knife up to the steak knife up to my neck he realized it was on the dull side pushing into my neck. So when I grabbed it he kept trying to turn it to actually cut me. I was screaming at the top of my lungs and I was crying and I said I said 'not today'"" she said.

She began to fight back stopping her car on the road.

""(He) stabbed me so many times. You know I was just like 'oh my God I'm going to die right here'"" Evans said.

She said people just kept driving until one woman stopped and she said saved her life.

""Whoever she is I just want to tell her thank you because she's the only car that stopped from me and she stayed until the police came and I don't know her name but I just want to give her the biggest hug and thank you because if she didn't stop this guy would definitely he would have killed me"" Evans said.

She's grateful for the good Samaritan and grateful she's alive but unsure of what she'll do next.

""He basically took my bread and butter away from me and I don't know where I'm going to go from here"" Evans said.

(KCTV) – A Kansas City Uber driver named Laticia Urton said after she accepted a ride request in the northland Saturday morning she got a strange phone call.

“The phone number that showed up on my Bluetooth in my car was a 415 number. I answered the call and they told me they were with Uber with the corporate office” Urton said.

She said the person on the call claimed that she was letting other people use her account. By that time she realized a rider wasn’t coming.

“When you’ve been waiting on someone more than five minutes then you’re eligible for a cancellation fee. and the person that was on the other end of the phone told me to take the fee off. So I was a little bit startled” Urton said.

Next they asked for her checking account information to verify her Uber account. After that they sent a suspicious text message. Urton said that raised a red flag for her.

“I told the person if they would like to hold on I would call my bank to confirm that they’re sending me an email asking for my personal information which didn’t make sense to me” said Urton.

At that point the person on the phone hung up.

Urton said she’s grateful she caught this and she wants to make sure others know to be careful.

“I wanted to share the information with other drivers because I know that there are a lot of older people who drive Uber part-time like and they may have been intimidated by the caller and give their information” she said.

KCTV5 reached out to Uber for comment. According to a spokesperson they said Uber would never call or text to ask anyone for their personal information. They also ask that if your account is ever compromised to reach out so they can investigate.

He is in this writer’s very humble opinion one of the greatest comedians of his generation.

Schulz’ comedy is brilliantly irreverent and his unorthodox path to success flies in the face of the established industry–the same industry that has often capitulated to the whims of the woke mob.

In July his newest special Infamous was set for release on a popular streaming platform the name of which no one knows because the hour-long special never came out … at least not as planned.

As fans eagerly counted down the days until the special’s premiere Schulz was being delivered some bad news: the platform would not be releasing his work unless he agreed to edit out jokes that were deemed to be too controversial and “wild.” In this modern day witch hunt that we call cancel culture executives feared the potential backlash they might face if Infamous was allowed to air in its original form.

Schulz refused. But since he had already sold the special the only way to preserve it in its entirety and maintain his artistic integrity was to buy it back—and he used his life savings to do so.

Schulz built his brand on the foundation that he answers to no one. And unlike other comics the route he chose to take with his comedy has ensured that he’s never had to.

The Road Less Traveled

In the marketplace consumers love when a stagnant industry gets disrupted by new ways of being.

For decades the outdated and corrupt cab companies were the only option for someone who needed a ride across town—until Uber came along. Similarly the hotel industry was able to charge pretty much whatever it wanted because there were no other options for people who needed short term lodging—until Airbnbs popped up all over the U.S.. And after years of privacy issues and a distrust in the traditional monetary system Bitcoin and blockchain technology completely disrupted financial “businesses as usual.”

Andrew Schulz is in many ways the Bitcoin of comedy.

The road to comedic success is not for the faint of heart. To have a shot at fame a comic has to be willing to play the game. They have to do open mics in empty rooms and perform countless shows in dive bars where none of the patrons expected nor wanted to see a live comedy show.

And once you have several years of performing under your belt you have to be willing to quit your day job go on the road and hope that one day you capture the attention of an established comic or a booker.

Even if all this goes well your odds of being a famous comedian are still pretty slim.

But that was before the internet. Now the traditional barriers to entry that were there for older generations don’t exist.

Schulz started his career like many other young comics he performed at local clubs. In 2017 he spent $25000 to film his first special—one that no networks wanted.

Without a network to back him he decided to do it by himself.

The Startup Comedian

After asking his friends what made them want to watch a comedy special he came to the conclusion that length played a huge role for viewers. People loved comedy but in the fast-paced world we live in they didn’t want to watch the whole hour.

Schulz trimmed his hour special down to 16 minutes and uploaded it to Youtube. Today it has nearly 3 million views.

Throughout 2018 and 2019 he focused on his YouTube channel uploading 125 of his best live comedy bits. As he put it “100 clips is 100 ways of discovering me. An hour on Netflix is one.”

During the pandemic he kept up his momentum by uploading late night show-style monologues. And without a network to answer to he wasn’t obligated to censor his content and this unbridled delivery only made him more popular.

At a time when comedians all over the world were suffering without audiences to perform for Schulz was averaging 2 million views for each of the 17 monologues he released in 17 weeks.

When it came to social media Schulz knew what he was doing. Every piece of content was catered to whatever platform he was using.

Schulz is to comedy what startups are to outdated market industries. And just as consumers flocked to Airbnb and Uber in droves for their innovative services fans have followed Schulz wherever his comedy takes them because it’s new exciting and most importantly hilarious.

His fan base has continued to grow with the rise of his podcast Flagrant 2 which is one of the most popular podcasts on Patreon with about 20300 paid subscribers.

When the unnamed streaming platform demanded that he censor his content Schulz knew he couldn’t disappoint the fans who loved him for his edgy content. He also knew he could rely on them for support.

‘Ultimately It’s Up To You’

In an Instagram post Schulz explained the situation and told fans of his decision to buy back the special.

Instead he would be releasing it on his own platform and fans would have a limited window to purchase the digital special for about $17 which they would own in perpetuity.

“I don’t know if this is going to work” he said “Ultimately it’s up to you guys.”

Schulz was turning lemons into lemonade.

Not only did people love his comedy but they were also eager to hear the content that was so “wild” it wasn’t allowed on streaming platforms. The demand for his special was through the roof.

But was it enough to make his decision to pull the special worth it?

In yet another Instagram post Schulz looked at the camera solemnly as he explained that he did not recoup the money he spent buying the special … he tripled it.

With the cheesiest of grins he then says in the most New York way possible “f*** editing jokes. Put your faith in the people not logos.”

And the people had spoken.

If networks and big time streaming companies want to continue censoring comedians who don’t subscribe to the woke line of thinking they should by all means go ahead.

But Schulz just disrupted the entire comedy industry the way Uber made hailing a cab nearly obsolete.

If streaming companies want to survive they would do well to let comedians say what they want and let individuals decide what they want to watch.

The three and two-wheeler services called Uber Auto and Uber Moto were introduced in 2019 and have seen a rise in demand after the opening of the Indian market post the coronavirus pandemic. This is also in line with Uber’s strategy to move into tier-2 and -3 cities as part of its growth plans to reach 100 million riders in the country.

Diversified portfolio

""Uber has a journey on its diversified portfolio and only in the last three years that we have diversified into three- and two-wheelers and they are now the products that are growing at an accelerated growth rate. Today we do more trips in terms of volume in three-wheelers and two-wheelers than we do on four-wheelers. These are large supply pool and large consumers who like the service. There are more autos in the Indian ecosystem than there are commercial cars"" Prabhjeet Singh President Uber India & South Asia told BusinessLine.

Both the products Uber Auto and Uber Moto have witnessed a 3x fold increase in business in the country. Talking about getting the next 100 million consumers to use Uber the company has shifted its focus to localised mode of transport that are comfortable with the riders.

""We are long-term in India and want to serve to a very large part of our address base. As a part of that we have now started really focussing on three-wheelers two-wheelers high capacity vehicles rentals and intercity. These are some of the new growth beds which have shown traction in the last two to three years. Three-wheelers and two-wheelers are a huge part of our overall game plan. We have our internal target of getting 100 million consumers who use our platform. It is a deliberate choice that we are making as we are doubling down on new category of products in the existing cities and scaling operations in the new cities"" said Singh.

Win-win strategy

Singh stated that both the products are a win for consumers and drivers. ""The autorickshaw drivers are driving on the street and are also using the Uber application wherein the auto driver can have higher earnings of 15-20 per cent and choose the trips he can do in a day. A consumer who was used to get an autorickshaw on the roadside can now get the autorickshaw on their doorstep"" added Singh.

“As we interacted with consumers in many cities it was clear that many of the people would want the solution on a three-wheeler or a two-wheeler. Pre-pandemic we had 80 cities and now we have launched from 30 to 40 cities and many of them are actually three-wheeler and two-wheeler first markets. The first product they experience on the Uber app is three wheeler” said Singh.

The 17-year-old dirt bike rider remarkably escaped serious injury after the crash at an intersection in Perth's south about 6.15pm on Saturday.

The bike was caught on CCTV zooming along the residential street doing what police allege was a wheelie stunt before the collision - with the rider's driving a central focus of the police investigation.

The 23-year-old Uber driver in a white Toyota Camry was not injured but witnesses said he was so badly shaken up after seeing the rider flung from his bike that he vomited and had to be helped away by relatives.

The off-road dirt bike being driven by the teenager was left split in two (pictured) after hitting the car and sending the rider flying 30-meteres

'He went flying about thirty metres down the road' witness and resident of the street Rob Rowles told 7News.

Mr Rowles said the rider suffered cuts and severe road rash to the skin along his ribs.

'His mouth was bleeding... I'm pretty sure the helmet saved his life.'

He stayed with the rider until paramedics arrived and the boy's parents 'came running down the road they were pretty upset obviously'.

The teenager was rushed to Royal Perth Hospital but did not suffer life-threatening injuries.

Two other locals Seb and Nick who coach a children's soccer team on an oval off the same road said motorbike riders speeding along the street and doing stunts was common in the area."

Why Trust Us?

Hyaluronic acid is a prevalent skincare ingredient that dermatologists and beauty editors love for its incredible moisturizing powers — but did you know this clear liquid ingredient is also fantastic for your hair?

Applying skincare ingredients and technology to scalp care is a trend that has been getting more popular over the past few years and according to board-certified dermatologist Dr. Hadley King M.D. “The trend makes total sense because the scalp although specialized is skin. And there is the bonus that a healthy scalp can help support healthy hair growth.”

To help you understand why hyaluronic acid for hair will legitimately upgrade your beauty routine our beauty editor Nic ole Saunders consulted experts about its benefits and their go-to product recommendations.

Best Hyaluronic Acid for Hair Products

What is Hyaluronic Acid?

As a quick reminder hyaluronic acid is a moisture magnet that can hold up to 1000 times its weight in water. King considers hyaluronic acid a powerful humectant meaning it loves water and your scalp and hair will be hydrated AF when you incorporate it into your routine.

Benefits of Hyaluronic Acid for Hair

Hyaluronic acid for hair is particularly helpful for anyone with a dry scalp or dry hair because it draws moisture — but that's not its only amazing benefit. We asked two of our favorite hairstylists about the many pros of using hyaluronic acid for hair.

Works for all hair types: Aaron Grenia cofounder of  says everyone can use hyaluronic acid for hair regardless of their hair density (fine medium or thick) and hair texture (sleek straight to 4C coils on the natural hair chart). ""It will definitely work best on drier hair types but it will not damage other hair types"" he says.

Strengthening hair: “Hyaluronic acid is good for the overall health of the hair and scalp. It will help with damaged and dry hair and make the hair more resilient which helps prevent breakage” says Grenia.

Side Effects of Hyaluronic Acid for Hair

Hyaluronic acid for hair is incredible but King says products without emollients and occlusives may deplete moisture from your hair and scalp. She suggests using hydrating hyaluronic acid hair products such as hair masks and leave-in conditioners to prevent dry scalp and dry hair. ""Moisturizers ideally contain a combination of humectants to hydrate emollients to support the barrier and occlusives to lock in moisture"" adds King.

Hyaluronic acid is a humectant  but panthenol glycerin glycogen xylitol elastin collagen and silk keratin are other sought-after humectants.

KOURTNEY Kardashian has shaded Kylie Jenner after she failed to notice her sister’s tribute to her at a cosmetics launch party.

It comes after the famous family gathered in Los Angeles on Wednesday to celebrate the launch of 25-year-old Kylie’s new Lip Kit products.

Taking to her Instagram Stories on Friday Kourtney 43 shared a photo of the cocktail menu from the event which included a drink named Kourtney What The F**k Are You On.

Dedicated to the Poosh founder the curious concoction consisted of Kendall Jenner’s brand 818 Tequila grapefruit juice lime juice hibiscus tea agave soda and smoke bubbles.

However Kourtney confessed that she had originally failed to notice the drink made in her honor although it was the only cocktail on the menu to bear the name of a Kardashian.

“Oh my god how did I miss this the other night?!” wrote the reality star.

The snub came after Kourtney skipped out on Kylie's recent 25th birthday party and failed to mention the special day on social media.

Other offerings on Wednesday included a reposada tequila-based beverage named You’re Cute Jeans and Rise and Shine a vodka and pink lemonade option.

Kylie pulled out all the stops for the lavish party at Ulta Beauty in the Westwood area of LA.

The venue was decked out in the brand’s signature pastel pink with rows-upon-rows of Kylie Cosmetics products on display.

Kourtney attended with her husband Travis Barker 46.

She wore a black corset with matching black pants and a cardigan while her rockstar beau turned up in dark wash jeans and a blue graphic-print vest to show off his sleeves of tattoos.

ALL TOGETHER NOW

Travis’ son Landon Barker joined the party bringing along his girlfriend Charli D’Amelio and her sister Dixie D’Amelio.

Also in attendance were all the KarJenner women including Kendall and Kris Jenner and Khloe and Kim.

WHY KY?

But the star-studded event wasn’t without its controversy.

Kylie was slammed by fans for allowing her four-year-old daughter Stormi to wear an “inappropriate” one-shoulder minidress.

The Hulu star was also slated online for the “dismissive” way she reacted to a fan on the red carpet.

A video posted to TikTok showed her avoiding eye contact with a Kardashian-fanatic as they posed for a photo together.

Travis Scott who is the father of Kylie’s daughter Stormi and their infant son- name currently unknown- did not attend the event.

His absence has led to rumors that he’s secretly split up with his baby mama.

Ariana Grande is always a welcome presence at the VMAs so obviously some of us (very much me) were bummed not to see her walk the red carpet. Even though to be clear this photo from 2018 occupies a permanent place in my mind:

Photo credit: Nicholas Hunt - Getty Images

Ariana skipping the VMAs is kind of a surprise considering she is nominated for Best Metaverse Performance (help) so...what was she doing instead of walking the red carpet? TBD but Ariana has a lot going on lately including the release of her new God Is A Woman Body collection which consists of of four products: a body scrub soufflé a body oil a hand and body cream and a travel-sized version of her fragrance. She announced the video (fully makeup free) on TikTok:

And Ari actually hit back at a critic who commented “pls remember that you’re a singer” replying “I have actually never felt more at home in my voice or like more of a singer.” (Um...yeah she’s literally working on Wicked right now!)

FYI Ariana’s new line is available at Ulta and she told Allure “We’ve been looking forward to this and working on it quietly for so long so I’m so beyond excited and thankful to launch this with Ulta Beauty who continues to be such an incredible retail partner and for my fans who can go there to explore all of our yummy God Is a Woman product in our little home we’ve made at Ulta Beauty. These products are some of my favorites we’ve developed so far and I can’t wait to share them with the world.”

UNP,Union Pacific Corporation,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnVwLmNvbS9jdXN0b21lcnMvdHJhY2stcmVjb3JkL3RyMDkyNzIyLW1vZGVybml6ZWQtbG9jb21vdGl2ZXMtcmFpbHJvYWQtaGlzdG9yeS13YWJ0ZWMuaHRt0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,UP: Modernized Locomotives Are Making Railroad History,"Imagine you own a 20-year-old vehicle and are tasked with bringing it up to modern-day technology and safety standards. Those who aren’t mechanically inclined are likely see that as a tall if not impossible order.

Now imagine a similar job being performed on a six-axle heavy-haul freight locomotive. That’s a far bigger undertaking considering locomotives weigh an average of about 200 tons (400000 pounds) whereas the weight of an average passenger vehicle rings in at 4156 pounds. The job gets more complicated when you learn the locomotive can have as many as 210000 internal parts including more than six miles of wiring.

Now multiply that effort by 600 and you’ve arrived at the work ahead for Wabtec Corporation. The company is charged with modernizing 600 Union Pacific locomotives to improve performance in ways that ultimately benefit the railroad its customers and the environment. The $1 billion investment to upgrade these existing locomotives represents the largest-ever rail industry investment in an existing locomotive fleet.

The Work: Upgrading Existing Locomotives in the Union Pacific Fleet

The goal of the agreement between Union Pacific Railroad and Wabtec a leading global provider of equipment systems digital solutions and value-added services for the freight and transit rail industries as well as the mining marine and industrial markets is to revitalize existing locomotive fleets by refreshing and renewing core locomotive components while installing the latest technologies to improve reliability and fuel efficiency as well as reduce emissions.

Comprising the 600 Union Pacific locomotives to be modernized are 525 AC4400 and AC6000 locomotives as well as 75 Dash-9 locomotives. Once rebuilt these locomotives will be equipped with a suite of digital solutions and innovations including next-generation controls technology and the next generation FDL Advantage fuel solution.

The improvements are expected to extend locomotive life improve fuel efficiency by 18% increase reliability by 80% and increase haulage ability by 55%.

Wabtec will modernize the locomotives at its plants in the United States and plans to deliver beginning in 2023. This deal is the third major modernization order from Union Pacific since 2018; by 2025 Wabtec will have upgraded more than Union Pacific 1030 locomotives.

The Benefits: Customers the Environment and the Circular Economy

Locomotives that are more reliable fuel efficient and can haul more weight yield wins for Union Pacific customers and the environment while supporting a circular economy.

Environmental Benefits of Locomotive Modernization

The modernizations will provide approximately 350 tons of carbon reduction per locomotive per year. The total order will enable Union Pacific to realize approximately 210000 tons in annual emission reductions — the equivalent of removing emissions from nearly 45000 passenger cars per year.

It also helps Union Pacific on its path to reducing absolute Scope 1 and 2 greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by 26% by 2030 from a 2018 baseline and ultimately reach net zero emissions by 2050.

Benefits to Rail Shippers

Installing state-of-the-art technology makes locomotives more dependable. This improves their capability to support the growing demands on the rail network and provide more reliable consistent service for customers. The modernizations also support UP customers’ efforts to meet their own carbon reduction targets.

Circular Economy

The modernizations also support the circular economy with more than half the locomotive’s weight being reused. Over the course of the order approximately 70000 tons of steel will be reused and recycled – the equivalent of more than 51000 passenger cars.

More Improvements Ahead

A modernized locomotive gets finishing touches

Upgrades to existing locomotives aren’t the only improvement Union Pacific is making to its locomotive fleet. Union Pacific recently purchased 20 battery-powered electric engines that will serve to reduce GHG emissions and help address climate change. The company is also testing the viability of powering locomotives with 100% biofuel a renewable energy source. Likewise locomotives are becoming more fuel efficient through the use of energy management systems in addition to renewable diesel and battery electric power.

Currently railroads can move one ton of freight more than 480 miles on a single gallon of fuel already making rail the most fuel-efficient way to move freight over land. Increasing locomotive fuel efficiency has the potential to boost this number even higher. As it stands trains generate a carbon footprint up to 75% less than trucks; better fuel efficiency will result in even greater emission reductions.

Efforts to use less fuel will also help reduce dependence on fossil fuels and promote energy security.

During the first week of August UPS Teamsters organized rallies across the country with thousands of workers to kick off their 2023 contract campaign. From now to July of next year when the current contract is set to expire UPS workers will be fighting for their demands and preparing to strike if they are not met. Among those demands are: air-conditioned trucks no more excessive overtime an end to the two-tier system of “22.4s” higher part-time pay more full-time jobs an end to harassment and an end to outsourcing. If UPS Teamsters don’t reach a suitable agreement with the company over 340000 workers could go on strike bringing UPS — which moves 6% of the U.S. GDP — to a grinding halt.

It is no surprise that the bosses are afraid. Since the contract campaign began UPS has ramped up its union busting tactics particularly targeting activist workers. The company’s goal is clear: to instill fear and weaken the collective power and organization of UPS Teamsters. On Wednesday August 24 in an act of blatant retaliation UPS fired Ben Douglass and Rob Becker both alternate shop stewards at their respective workplaces.

Douglass has been a driver for almost two years and an alternate shop steward for one during which time he has consistently fought for his coworkers. Ben pushed for workers to take up the fight for COVID-19 safety measures such as on-site testing and temperature checks. During the heatwave he fought for fans and AC encouraging workers to take breaks to cool off hydrate and stay safe. Ben along with many coworkers and other union activists has also taken up broader struggles for racial gender and sexual equality sometimes organizing coworkers to march together as Teamsters in movements beyond the workplace. The official reason given by management for firing Douglass was that he was unable to complete a challenging route in the midst of a heatwave.

Yesterday in an act of complete retaliation @UPS fired me from the job on bogus charges. But this isn't just about me — what UPS is doing is part of a larger retaliation against union organizers and sympathizers especially as the @Teamsters ramp up our 2023 contract fight. — Ben Douglass (@BenFredericks) August 25 2022

Becker has been working for UPS for eight years and works out of the Nassau building on Long Island in New York. Despite having worked through the whole pandemic the company is treating him as totally disposable. Becker has been targeted in particular because he helped sign his coworkers up to join the “9.5 list” a contractual agreement that limits forced overtime. Becker was dismissed for stopping to buy green tea in the midst of a heat wave. This retaliation is particularly stark as it happens against a backdrop of increasing attention on UPS for not providing air conditioning in trucks even in the midst of oppressive summer heat which has resulted in drivers experiencing heat strokes and even dying.

As Douglass recently pointed out on Twitter this retaliation is happening “while [workers] are forced to work in the brutal summer heat without AC often without even a fan. Many are seeing the horror stories of UPS workers collapsing from heat exhaustion. Esteban Chavez Jr. died because management refuses to prioritize safety.”

Once again @ups shows it’s true colors. Yesterday a Long Island driver was FIRED because he stopped for 2 minutes for a green tea during a HEAT WAVE. Management says it was an unauthorized break. We say it was retaliation against a UNION ACTIVIST. The fight is on. pic.twitter.com/001WeGSrqV — Teamsters Local 804 (@804_local) August 25 2022

The retaliation isn’t just happening in New York it’s occurring all across the country. According to Sean Orr a UPS worker from Chicago “management tried to crack down on us wearing union hats while on property” as a way to intimidate workers and hide the massive support from the workers. The UPS workers at that facility answered the intimidation by moving their Teamsters meeting on Thursday inside their facility setting an example for workers across the country. As Sean said “Not one inch to the company!”

UPS is a multi-billion dollar company. Throughout the pandemic and even now the company is posting record profits — profits which have come off the back of workers like Douglass and Becker. Yet instead of providing workers with safe working conditions or even basic air conditioning in trucks in the crippling heat UPS targets workers who stand up for their basic rights.

UPS to maximize its profits is constantly searching for different ways of exploiting its workers. In the last contract for example UPS imposed a two-tier system which created a new “second-class” of drivers. These “combo workers” classified as “22.4s” do the same job as long-term drivers but are paid up to eight dollars per hour less with fewer benefits. The bosses also create a dangerous work environment demanding a high volume of packages to be delivered at nerve-wracking speed and hours-long shifts in traffic-jammed cities. But this isn’t limited to drivers alone — UPS also imposes grueling conditions on the warehouse workers who start their days as early as 1a.m. to guarantee that the trucks will be ready to deliver their packages across the state.

From Amazon to Starbucks to Trader Joe’s and even UPS bosses have ramped up their union busting because they are afraid. Workers know they are essential that they make everything run and when they stand up and fight together they can win. It is essential that we show solidarity with workers who are facing harassment and being fired.

Easily one of the biggest shipping companies on the planet UPS runs a fleet of more than 120000 vehicles—all done up in their trademarked Pullman brown color—in upwards of 200 global regions. It's pretty hard to steer clear of this ubiquitous service but there are some things you should know before ordering or mailing your next package. Read on for a slew of warnings to keep in mind straight from those who know best: former employees.

1 Delays might be the shipper's fault.

Everyone's had something stuck in package purgatory—that liminal space where it's in transit for weeks or months on end. When this happens the instinct is to blame the shipping company but issues like this often stem from the original shipping source. If they don't provide all of the necessary shipping information UPS can't get the box to its final destination.

""What usually happens is we will hold onto the packages and try to contact the shipper first but if they don't respond within a few days then we have to return the package"" one employee said on Reddit. ""Imagine what happens when the same shipper does this over and over again.""

If you're continually not getting a package you've ordered you can try checking in with UPS directly but it couldn't hurt to double-check with the original sender—whether a retailer or an individual—to make sure all of the shipping information has been provided.

2 Your package is definitely getting tossed around.

It's nice to believe your packages are getting handled like a Fabergé egg at every turn but the truth isn't quite as cushy. As the same UPS employee pointed out on Reddit your packages take a long journey across ""a system of belts that spans miles."" Along the way it's bound to bounce around. The basic idea is that bubble wrap protects any of the internal contents. Hopefully.

""As far as the delivery guy throwing your stuff goes there is no real preventative measure against that"" the employee added. ""Workers are supposed to place packages not throw them but when you have a schedule that is invasive as hell and the pay doesn't make the jobs worth it people start to not care.""

3 Missed deliveries could be a driver issue.

You specifically designated that your package be delivered without a signature or someone to receive it and yet it never arrived. Even worse you were actually at home when the package was marked as a failed delivery. The first time it happens is annoying. The second? Frustrating. Even more maddening is it all could be because your driver has misread misunderstood or straight-up ignored the instructions.

""It sort of sounds like your driver doesn't really know what [they're] doing"" one UPS driver said in a Reddit Ask Me Anything session. ""If the driver is getting instructions on the DIAD (the handheld delivery computer) to leave the package they're supposed to just leave it. All responsibility and liability is left to you so why would they care? They need to be talked to about this.""

There are two exceptions however: alcohol and firearms. ""Those need a signature in person no matter what.""

4 Keep your animals away from the truck.

Maybe you think it's cute or maybe you think it's a harmless nuisance but few things are more dangerous to your pets than allowing them to wantonly chase after a UPS truck—or even according to one driver allowing them to jump in the cab.

""When the animals follow or chase the vehicle we have a chance of potentially hitting them"" another driver wrote in a Reddit Ask Me Anything session. ""For all the owners of cute fur babies I highly recommend that if you see a UPS driver put them inside or have them on a leash so we don't get anxiety of potentially getting hurt by or hurting your pet.""

Don't worry—it's not to snoop. If UPS employees do end up opening any packages it's mostly to find and double-check shipping documents an employee revealed on Reddit. That said if they do find anything illegal—for instance according to a story this employee recanted ""two basket-balled sized bags of cocaine""—it'll get seized on the spot.

Dillon’s triumph launches him into the postseason for the first time since 2020 snapping a 78-race winless streak that dates back to Texas Motor Speedway in 2020.

As a result Ryan Blaney scored the final position in the playoff grid edging Martin Truex Jr. by just three points for the 16th spot. Both drivers were involved in accidents in Sunday’s event and Blaney seemed to suffer the more significant damage at Lap 31 that hampered his No. 12 Ford. But with numerous cars eliminated from earlier carnage Blaney rose through the running order to finish 15th despite sitting six laps down. Truex fell to eighth at the checkered flag.

At Lap 138 leaders broke loose as wet weather quickly approached Turn 1. As the lead pack of Denny Hamlin Daniel Suárez Daniel Hemric and Justin Haley broke apart Dillon swerved left to the apron and avoided the chaos to emerge with the lead.

Others involved in the calamity were Kevin Harvick Harrison Burton Ricky Stenhouse Jr. Aric Almirola Tyler Reddick Chase Elliott Ty Dillon Chris Buescher Kyle Busch Erik Jones and Todd Gilliland.

Rain began to pour over the 2.5-mile superspeedway as the field worked under caution for the crash. The field was brought to pit road and the race was red flagged for over three hours.

Completing the top five behind race winner Dillon was RCR teammate Reddick Austin Cindric Landon Cassill and Noah Gragson. Cody Ware BJ McLeod Truex David Ragan and Busch rounded out the top 10.

The event was pushed to Sunday morning after rain washed through Daytona Beach on Saturday night. The chaos began early when Blaney and others collided on Lap 31 at the exit of Turn 2 putting a sharp early focus on the points battle. Blaney was sent right-front-first into the outside SAFER barrier and was significantly slowed for the remainder of the race.

At Lap 102 Truex suffered damage in another multicar crash receiving left-side contact from Ross Chastain after Michael McDowell spun near the head of the field. Truex was able to remain on the lead lap and scored 15 stage points to Blaney’s none.

Kyle Larson a winner last week at Watkins Glen International exited early after an engine failure at Lap 14.

GENEVA – The Global Fund to Fight AIDS Tuberculosis and Malaria praises Japan for its outstanding leadership in global health with a strong commitment of up to US$1.08 billion to help end the three diseases by 2030 and build stronger and more resilient and sustainable systems for health with a view to achieving universal health coverage (UHC).

Prime Minister KISHIDA Fumio announced Japan’s commitment of up to US$1.08 billion to the Global Fund’s Seventh Replenishment at the Eighth Tokyo International Conference on African Development (TICAD8) held in Tunisia.

Prime Minister KISHIDA said “The spread of COVID-19 has made it clear the importance of dealing with infectious diseases. I announce today that Japan will contribute up to US$1.08 billion to the Global Fund's Seventh Replenishment over the next three years. This is based on the idea of human security and to contribute to supporting measures against the major infectious diseases such as HIV and AIDS tuberculosis and malaria and to strengthening health systems especially in Africa.”

Japan’s pledge represents an up to approximately 30% increase when compared with the previous three-year period in line with the increased proportion of the total resources needed for the next three-year cycle. This is with a strong intention of Japan to leverage its technology expertise and innovation to contribute to the people in need through the Global Fund. TICAD is an international conference that brings a variety of partners together to focus on development in Africa – a continent of vital importance for ending HIV tuberculosis and malaria.

“By pledging up to US$1.08 billion the government of Japan is truly demonstrating its commitment to ending these epidemics by 2030 and building stronger and more resilient systems for health that would enable countries to be better prepared for future pandemics and advance towards UHC” said Peter Sands Executive Director of the Global Fund. “We are extremely grateful to Prime Minister KISHIDA for this strong leadership and to the people of Japan for this extraordinary support to accelerate the end of HIV tuberculosis and malaria with a view to achieving UHC.""

Japan introduced infectious diseases to the agenda of the G8 Kyushu-Okinawa Summit in 2000 paving the way for the establishment of the Global Fund in 2002. Since then Japan has been a strong supporter of the Global Fund and is its fifth largest public donor helping the partnership to save 44 million lives over the past 20 years and to invest US$1.5 billion per year to build more resilient and sustainable systems for health. A long advocate for UHC Japan will be hosting the G7 Summit in 2023.

The Global Fund’s Seventh Replenishment Conference hosted by the United States government will take place in New York on 19 September and aims to raise at least US$18 billion to fund its next three-year cycle of grants. The Global Fund estimates that the funding of US$18 billion would save 20 million lives cut HIV tuberculosis and malaria deaths by 64% and strengthen health and community systems to reinforce pandemic preparedness.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJ1enpmZWVkLmNvbS9pc2hhYmFzc2kvYW1lcmljYW4tY3VsdHVyZS1hc3BlY3RzLWF1c3RyYWxpYW5zLWdsYWQtZG9udC1leGlzdC1pbtIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Aussies Are Sharing Aspects Of American Culture They're Glad Don't Exist In Australia And It's So Insightful,"5.

Zimbabwe is following the recommendations of the 72nd session of the World Health Organisation regional committee for Africa that ended yesterday Vice President and Minister of Health and Child Care Dr Constantino Chiwenga has said.

The main facilities now being built in Zimbabwe are to fill the gap between clinics and provincial hospitals with a number of hospitals that can cope with the non-communicable diseases that are now being more common.

The annual meeting brings together 47 ministers of health in the WHO Africa region and is the highest health decision making body of the continent which determines priorities and formulate policies that improve people’s health and livelihoods.

Issues discussed at this meeting include the resurgence of polio on the continent after Africa was previously certified polio free health security and emergencies and management of environmental determinants of health.

The adoption of the regional strategy to address severe non-communicable diseases at first-level referral health facilities and form of the universal health coverage anchored on ensuring low income earners are guaranteed of these services.

According to the centres for disease control and prevention the non-communicable diseases such as heart disease cancer chronic respiratory disease and diabetes are the leading cause of death worldwide and represent an emerging global health threat.

Such deaths now exceed deaths of all communicable diseases combined.

Speaking after leading Zimbabwe’s delegation during a marathon of health engagements VP Chiwenga said the proposed agreed and endorsed strategies to improve the continent’s health system were already being implemented in Zimbabwe.

He said they were being implemented under President Mnangagwa’s mantra of leaving no one and no place behind as the country journeys towards the attainment of an upper middle-income society by 2030 which calls for best international practices in the health sector.

As there was a gap been clinics and hospitals but this gap was being filled allowing a lot more people to be treated at district levels rather than having to go to central and provincial hospitals.

“As Zimbabwe we have now recognised these issues and we have now developed between the clinic and the district hospital they are now two levels” said VP Chiwenga.

“The one with 20-bed hospital there are two theatres for instance the one which was opened by His Excellency the President in Harare South. So the individual do not now have to go to the provincial hospital. They will get most of their requirements there.”

Previously controlling conditions like cancer diabetes among other NCDs were afforded by a few but under President Mnangagwa’s vision of transforming the health sector which ensures best international practices at all levels even low income earners will be able to receive best healthcare.

VP Chiwenga noted that prior to the restructuring of his ministry the referral system was not working properly thereby exerting pressure on central and provincial hospitals which had a negative impact of minimising quality.

He said Zimbabwe was working on reorienting the health systems and infrastructure to ensure quality services were distributed across the board for the benefit of the entire citizenry.

“We are also going to be constructing the 60-bed hospital which again is a facility before one gets to the district hospital” said VP Chiwenga.

“Therefore these non communicable diseases like diabetes cancer hypertension they will be able to get the medication before going to the provincial hospital.

“As you are aware we are putting up 30 of those facilities those sort of hospitals in the country.

“These will mainly deal with non communicable diseases before one can go to the provincial hospital or the referral hospital.

“What we were having in the past was to have somebody going straight from the first point to the referral hospital and it was giving pressure and we were not putting our structures properly and so this is what we are now going to do.”"

Uno de los sectores que mantuvo a flote la economía estadounidense durante los peores tiempos de pandemia del coronavirus y luego en el 2021 ha sido el inmobiliario. Sin embargo las cosas cambiaron en el 2022 al punto de que analistas y economistas debaten ahora si EEUU se encuentra también en una recesión inmobiliaria o resulta inminente su entrada.

La respuesta está en las estadísticas de [los últimos seis meses]: las ventas de viviendas de uso y nuevas descendieron de forma consecutiva durante ese período bajo recesión lo que indica que el movimiento de compraventa se ha estancado tras cuatro alzas de tasas de interés de la Reserva Federal.

La Asociación Nacional de Agentes de Bienes Raíces denomina este descenso continuado como una [recesión inmobiliaria].

Seis meses consecutivos en caída

En julio las ventas en general cayeron un 6% por sexto mes consecutivo y cada vez menos personas pueden comprar una vivienda con intereses que se dirigen al 7% después de que la tasa federal de referencia subió a 225%-250% desde cero y 025% a principios del 2022.

Los analistas esperaban un decrecimiento en las ventas de apenas un 25% lo que revela el acelerado giro que ha dado el mercado inmobiliario en los últimos meses.

En el caso de las propiedades nuevas la cifra se elevó a 126% respecto a junio y casi un 30% en comparación con igual período de 2021. Es el registro más bajo desde el 2016.

Según datos del Departamento de Comercio se vendieron 511.000 casas el mes pasado muy por debajo de las proyecciones de algunos analistas: 575.000 compraventas.

El stock de viviendas nuevas subió de 92 meses en junio a 109 meses en julio. Se aborda en meses porque representa la estimación de lo que tardaría en “absolverse” esta oferta en el mercado. Es el mayor índice desde marzo del 2009 y equivale al alza del stock de viviendas (incremento del inventario) algo que no ocurría desde principios del 2021.

Las estadísticas hablan

¿Una recesión inmobiliaria? Sin declararse oficialmente como ha sucedido con la recesión económica en EEUU las mediciones y los datos muestran un mercado con síntomas evidentes de estancamiento.

“La demanda sufrirá más todavía porque los intereses subirán nuevamente a finales de septiembre” afirma el economista Isaac Cohen.

“Una mayor cantidad de compradores han quedado y quedarán fuera del mercado en los próximos meses lo que conlleva a un reajuste pronunciado de precios” puntualiza Cohen.

El mercado inmobiliario viene de una ganancia anual histórica en 2021 con récords de alquileres de viviendas unifamiliares muy bajos niveles de ejecuciones hipotecarias y el mayor número de compraventa desde 2007.

¿Las causas? Casi todas creadas por la administración de Joe Biden.

La historia reciente

El altísimo costo de vida para los consumidores y la inmigración ilegal descontrolada promovida por la Casa Blanca y que se calcula en más de 4 millones de personas en año y medio contribuyeron a la subida estrepitosa en los precios de rentas de viviendas que dispararon a su vez entre otros factores la compra de propiedades.

Millones de personas se lanzaron al mercado en busca de un techo propio con muy bajos intereses hipotecarios (3%) y una inflación histórica sostenida (hasta 91%) que presagiaba en cualquier momento la acción de la Reserva Federal después de más de 12 meses a la espera de un reajuste automático de los índices inflacionarios que nunca ocurrió.

Las compras impulsivas provocaron que los vendedores aprovecharan la notable desesperación de los compradores para elevar los precios a una categoría nunca vista en la historia del país y en medio de una limitada oferta que se redujo cada mes durante un año. A partir de ese momento las cotizaciones del valor de las propiedades también iniciaron su ascenso hasta sobrepasar los 500.000 dólares como promedio.

Las ejecuciones hipotecarias por su parte se aguantaron gracias a una orden presidencial -por la crisis sanitaria- del exlíder de la Casa Blanca Donald Trump que fue renovada en varias ocasiones dos veces por Biden en el 2021. Pero desde octubre del 2021 perdió su vigencia por un dictamen de la Corte Suprema de Justicia en Washington.

Un giro de 90%

Todo este panorama favorable a la economía a los prestamistas urbanizadores y empresas de bienes raíces se [está desmoronando] y se encamina a una situación diferente con indicativos claros de [una recesión inmobiliaria].

El [enfriamiento del mercado] dejó de ser un vaticinio y [es un hecho] en estos momentos.

Los dueños de propiedades por su parte se acostumbraron a ver precios inigualables a circunstancias normales y se aferran a la idea de poder vender al mismo rango del 2021. Pero la realidad indica que es demasiado tarde para quienes no aprovecharon el “boom” de precios en los últimos dos años.

Por ahora la bajada entre un 9% y un 13% en el valor de venta no es significativo comparado con el incremento descomunal del año pasado.

Según CoreLogic Phoenix encabezó en 2021 las subidas con más de un 38% mientras las Vegas San Diego Miami entre otras el alza era entre un 22% y 30% cuando desde el 2018 los aumentos ya se hacían evidentes.

Florida y el sur de Florida se convirtieron en los últimos 6 años en lugares muy atractivos para inversionistas empresas y compradores con precios que ascienden de forma continua desde ese entonces.

Se estima que la industria inmobiliaria tiene un impacto de un 17% o más sobre el Producto Interno Bruto (PIB) de EEUU. La falta de dinamismo en este renglón representa una incidencia sustancial en la economía norteamericana.

Desde principios del 2022 las principales promotoras inmobiliarias se desvanecen en el mercado bursátil: Aimco American Tower Prologis Equity Residential y AvalonBay Communities han caído con fuerza en Wall Street entre un 12% y un 23%.

Las previsiones no son halagüeñas

Los pronósticos no pueden ser favorables cuando el Banco Central va por otra subida de interés entre el 0.50% y 0.75% a finales de septiembre en su próxima reunión.

La agencia de informes crediticios (Fitch) considera que con una reducción de la actividad inmobiliaria de aproximadamente un 30% o más los precios se desplomarían de forma abrupta junto a la entrega de propiedades nuevas incluso con mayor velocidad que las históricas subidas.

El sector de la construcción marcado por los altos precios de los materiales desde el 2020 sufrirá también el impacto negativo de la industria inmobiliaria.

“Los constructores que no acumulan suficientes reservas de efectivo en una recesión probablemente necesiten emitir deuda para reconstruir las posiciones de inventario en una recuperación de la vivienda lo que estiraría las métricas crediticias” explican los expertos.

La baja confianza actual de los consumidores y la incertidumbre económica en el país por las políticas erradas del gobierno de Biden funcionan como otros elementos orgánicos en el freno del mercado de bienes raíces.

La confianza de los consumidores (por debajo de los 99 puntos) se ubicó en junio como la menor en más de un año según el índice del Conference Board.

Mientras la prensa disfraza la realidad para los estadounidenses y se suma al optimismo sin sentido de la administración Biden los próximos meses encaran una realidad más escarpada en la vida diaria de los estadounidenses y su poder adquisitivo. Nada halagüeño para los demócratas en su desesperado intento por mantener su reducido control del Congreso y desmontar a Trump por su gran liderazgo del escenario político republicano.

Sin embargo también es uno de los medios en los que más estafas se cometen. Por ello es importante estar atento para evitar caer en engaños y en ese sentido vamos a decirte de qué debes cuidarte si quieres comprar a través de Facebook.

Si tienes un perfil en Facebook seguramente te has topado con Marketplace  la pestaña en la que se ofertan diversos productos usualmente cerca de tu ubicación. Quizá alguna vez ha llamado tu atención algo de lo que se anuncia pero te ha dado miedo ponerte en contacto con el vendedor.

La realidad es que la red social puede ser una gran opción para comprar y vender siempre y cuando se tengan presentes algunos puntos importantes para evitar caer en estafas .

Las estafas de venta más comunes en Facebook Marketplace

Marketplace de Facebook es una plataforma gratuita y fácil de usar que permite a los usuarios buscar productos y filtrar de acuerdo a la zona geográfica en la que se localizan lo que facilita la entrega.

Esta opción ha tenido un gran recibimiento pues tan solo el año pasado superó los mil millones de usuarios globales. Una de las razones de ello es que los usuarios se sienten más seguros cuando ven los perfiles de los vendedores.

No obstante la compañía de ciberseguridad ESET descubrió que hay una serie de estafas que ponen en peligro a los usuarios de esta plataforma lo que desafortunadamente no es poco común pues una encuesta reveló que 1 de cada 6 participantes fue engañado en Facebook Marketplace .

Si bien vale la pena señalar que gran parte de lo que se ofrece en este sitio es legítimo como ocurre en cualquier otra plataforma hay ladrones esperando estafar  y cuando se trata de productos muy populares o de alta demanda las probabilidades de caer en una trampa aumentan.

“Es realmente importante que los usuarios conozcan cuáles son las estrategias más comunes que usan los estafadores en línea ya que de esta manera estarán mejor preparados para reconocer acciones sospechosas y anticiparse ante cualquier intento de fraude ” dijo Camilo Gutierrez Amaya Jefe del Laboratorio de Investigación de ESET Latinoamérica.

No caigas en trampa estas son las estafas de venta más comunes a través de Facebook:

Leer también: ¿Qué información guarda tu tarjeta SIM?

Artículos defectuosos

Puede ser que en las imágenes publicadas en la red social veas que un producto está en perfectas condiciones pero una vez que está en tus manos te encuentres con que está roto desgastado o le faltan piezas.

Ten mucho cuidado en especial cuando se trate de artículos electrónicos. De ser posible solicita una conferencia para que en tiempo real te puedan demostrar que todo funciona correctamente.

Artículos falsos

Quizá el producto si te llegue en buenas condiciones y con todas su piezas pero desafortunadamente podría ser falso.

Esta estafa se aplica más en ropa de diseñador perfumes joyas y cosméticos pues al igual que en el caso anterior es difícil determinar su estado solo con una foto.

En este caso es mejor desconfiar de ofertas que parezcan demasiado buenas para ser verdad.

Estafas de Google Voice

De acuerdo con ESET Facebook Marketplace también es aprovechado para cometer otro tipo de fraude  y uno muy común es el robo de cuentas de Google Voice un servicio que otorga al creador de una cuenta un número de teléfono para realizar llamadas o enviar mensajes desde un smartphone o el navegador de la computadora.

Lo que hacen los estafadores es contactar a un vendedor utilizando como excusa el interés por un artículo y luego piden salir de Facebook para continuar la conversación en otra plataforma no monitoreada como WhatsApp. Ahí solicitan al vendedor que comparta un código que le enviarán a su teléfono para verificar que es una persona legítima. Pero el código pertenece a la verificación en dos pasos (2FA) de Google Voice que luego utilizan para realizar llamadas fraudulentas.

Sobrepago

En este caso el estafador reclama a un vendedor que pagó de más por un artículo y envía una captura de pantalla donde se muestra la supuesta transacción solicitando que le reintegren la diferencia.

Por supuesto en ningún momento se realizó un pago y si el vendedor cayó en la trampa habrá perdido el dinero por el supuesto reembolso.

Compras que nunca llegan

Otro engaño consiste en vender un artículo y cobrar el dinero pero nunca entregar el objeto. Obviamente esto solo se aplica a los productos enviados fuera del área local del comprador así que lo mejor al menos en un inicio es que adquieras solo con vendedores cercanos.

Falsos sorteos

No creas en correos sobre supuestas ofertas y sorteos en Facebook Marketplace  si haces clic en un enlace deberás completar un formulario con algo de información personal y estarás dando datos que después pueden utilizar para prácticas como suplantación de identidad.

Estafa de los seguros

Quienes venden artículos muy costosos en Facebook Marketplace son contactados por estafadores que se hacen pasar por compradores dispuestos a pagar el costo por el envío del artículo y envían una factura falsa para “probar” que lo han hecho pero que necesitan que el vendedor pague un pequeño cargo por el seguro como suele ser una cantidad relativamente pequeña en comparación con el precio del artículo es común que los vendedores caigan.

Ofertas engañosas

En este caso los estafadores anuncian un producto de alta calidad a un precio muy tentador pero cuando la persona se decide a comprar el producto ya “no está disponible” por lo que se le ofrece un artículo similar por un precio mucho más elevado o una alternativa inferior.

Consejos para no caer en las estafas de Facebook Marketplace

Inspecciona los artículos antes comprando solo a vendedores locales.

Establece como punto de encuentro en un lugar público y no una casa. Preferentemente un área bien iluminada durante el día.

Revisa los perfiles de compradores/vendedores para conocer las calificaciones de los usuarios y no confíes en los que se han creado recientemente.

Verifica el precio de los artículos y si hay una diferencia significativa puede tratarse de un objeto falsificado robado defectuoso etc.

Ten cuidado con las ofertas y obsequios y nunca ingreses datos personales para acceder a ellos.

Solo utiliza métodos de pago confiables como PayPal ya que ofrecen una forma de disputar un pago. Los estafadores suelen solicitar tarjetas de regalo así como transferencias bancarias y pagos a través de diferentes servicios.

Deja la conversación en Facebook . A los estafadores les gusta mudar la conversación a otra plataforma donde les resulta más fácil estafar a las personas.

Y si eres vendedor nunca envíes los artículos antes de que se haya realizado el pago.

Si se excluyen las ventas de gasolina las ventas totales habrían caído 4.8%.

Por Luisa García Pelatti

Las ventas empiezan a mostrar el efecto de la inflación. En el mes de junio las ventas al detal totalizaron $3319.3 millones un descenso de 0.5% respecto al mismo mes del año pasado después de una inusual caída de 7.5% en el mes de mayo según datos del Departamento de Desarrollo Económico y Comercio (DDEC).

Son las primeras caídas en ventas desde noviembre de 2020. La inflación se situó en 7.2% en el mes de junio la más alta en 14 años.

“Los altos precios de la energía y los alimentos (entre otros) y la paulatina reducción en las ayudas post-pandemia ya han comenzado a tener efectos adversos sobre las expectativas de los consumidores. Los problemas en las cadenas de suministros a nivel global ya están afectando la disponibilidad de mercancías y productos para los productores y consumidores elevando aún más los precios. Además los precios de la gasolina han aumentado significativamente entrando la temporada de verano lo que afecta aún más la capacidad de ingreso personal disponible” asegura la división de Inteligencia de Negocios del DDEC.

En junio las ventas disminuyeron principalmente en tiendas de calzado (-29.8%) tiendas de artículos electrónicos (-13.4%) tiendas de piezas de autos (-12.7%) tiendas de cosméticos (-12.3%) concesionarios de autos (-11.0%) farmacias (-10.3%) y joyerías (-10.1%). Las ventas en tiendas por departamento que representan el 35% de las ventas totales se redujeron un 3.6% en junio.

Las fuertes subidas en las ventas de distribuidores de gasolina (55.7%) gasolineras (46.6%) y restaurantes (12.3%) lograron compensar parcialmente las caídas en el resto de los sectores. Si se excluyen las ventas de gasolina las ventas totales habrían caído 4.8%.

En los primeros seis meses del año las ventas han subido 0.5%. Por su parte en el año fiscal 2022 las ventas crecieron 5.9%. Las ventas al detal registraron un alza de 22.0% en 2021 el primer aumento en ventas tras un descenso de 1.4% en 2020 y una caída de 8.5% en 2019.

El DDEC había publicado el 22 de agosto las ventas al detal del mes de marzo. Una semana después se publican simultáneamente los datos abril mayo y junio. Desde el DDEC explican que el retraso en la publicación se debe a problemas en la entrega de datos a pa agencia para totalizar las ventas.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMitAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5zb29tcGkuY29tL2VzL2FydGljbGUvNTI4OTAxd3BwL2l2ZS1sb2dyYS1lbC1zZWd1bmRvLWx1Z2FyLW1hcy1hbHRvLWVuLXZlbnRhcy1lbi1sYS1wcmltZXJhLXNlbWFuYS1kZS1jdWFscXVpZXItYXJ0aXN0YS1mZW1lbmluYS1lbi1sYS1oaXN0b3JpYS1kZS1oYW50ZW8tY29uLWFmdGVyLWxpa2XSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,IVE logra el segundo lugar más alto en ventas en la primera semana de cualquier artista femenina en la historia de ...,"¡IVE es ahora el artista femenina con el segundo lugar más alto en ventas de primera semana en la historia de Hanteo!

La semana pasada IVE realizó su comeback con su tercer álbum sencillo “After LIKE” el 22 de agosto – para el final del día el álbum sencillo había logrado superar el anterior récord de ventas en primera semana de IVE de 338141 (establecido por “LOVE DIVE“) en solo su primer día de ventas.

Hanteo Chart ahora reportó que “After LIKE” vendió un impresionante total de 924363 copias en la primera semana de su lanzamiento (del 22 al 28 de agosto) triplicando el récord personal de IVE.

Con este logro IVE supera a BLACKPINK para convertirse en el artista femenino con el segundo lugar más alto en ventas de primera semana en la historia de Hanteo superadas solo por aespa.

IVE es también el segundo artista femenino en superar 900000 ventas con un álbum en la primera semana de su lanzamiento: en este momento los dos álbumes que han vendido esa cantidad de copias en la primera semana son “After LIKE” y “Girls” de aespa.

¡Felicidades a IVE por su gran logro!

En las últimas horas el gobierno de la provincia de Holguín dio a conocer la adopción de nuevas regulaciones en la venta de alimentos cigarros y bebidas en los establecimientos del MINCIN y en las unidades de Tiendas Caribe y la Corporación CIMEX.

El gobernador de esa oriental provincia Julio César Estupiñán Rodríguez estableció una primera pauta hace 10 días atrás con el objetivo de controlar la comercialización de algunos productos de primera necesidad. Una medida que ahora se profundiza y afianza con 11 iniciativas concretas según reseña el periódico provincial Ahora.

Medidas en Holguín

De acuerdo a la regulación 84 del sistema del Comercio en Holguín la venta de cigarros y tabacos solo se realizará “en la red de bodegas por núcleo y los per cápita se decidirán cada mes de acuerdo con disponibilidades en los municipios y se dará un término de hasta 10 días para su compra a partir de iniciado el expendio” .

De otra parte trascendió que la venta de ron “solo se ofrecerá en establecimientos de la Gastronomía pero en el servicio de coctelería y por tragos nunca por botellas; de similar manera sucederá con los vinos”.

Igualmente se decidió “mantener el expendio de los productos controlados es decir de los cárnicos aceite y detergente de forma regulada en puntos de venta o desde las propias unidades siempre previa anotación en la libreta de abastecimiento como se realizó en el periodo de la covid-19 con estos tres productos básicos”.

Según deja claro el periódico holguinero estas medidas son de estricto cumplimiento en los 14 Consejos municipales que conforman la provincia la tercera más poblada del país.

Los artículos de aseo como el jabón de tocador la crema dental de producción nacional y el detergente líquido mantendrán su diseño de distribución actual o sea a través de la red de bodegas y mercados estatales en los barrios. En estos casos los criterios de distribución se basan en la composición de los núcleos familiares.

El pan de la bodega

Yunia Pérez Hernández vicegobernadora explicó que se vienen presentado dificultades con renglones tan esenciales como el pan de la bodega la leche y el yogurt debido al déficit de materias primas como la harina de trigo o los cortes del fluido eléctrico entre otras causas objetivas.

“Los organismos productores de alimentos enclavados en los 14 territorios deben cumplir las indicaciones del Gobierno así como el Grupo Empresarial de Comercio y las cadenas de Tiendas Caribe y Cimex” añadió Pérez Hernández."

(A screenshot from a Verizon ad.) Chris Matyszczyk/ZDNET

Have you tried getting customer service lately?

Any sort of customer service from any sort of company?

It's not been easy has it? Especially when it comes to say airlines. Or Facebook.

I though constantly wonder what's happening with phone carriers. Visiting carrier stores and talking to the salespeople is a long-time passion of mine one that the pandemic largely curtailed.

So what's been happening in those stores -- and in carriers' customer service offerings overall?

Thankfully the large brains at J.D. Power have constantly been monitoring customer sentiment among the likes of Verizon AT&T and T-Mobile.

And the general sentiment seems to be: ""Ugh.""

The latest J.D. Power Wireless Purchase Experience Study offers a somewhat somber view. J.D Power's managing director Ian Greenblatt put it like this: ""The study finds that respondents believe they're paying more and receiving less.""

There are few more pungent feelings than getting nothing for something. You're spending money and you're getting not much of anything at all. Not even a smile.

With these wireless carriers though there seems to be a particular -- and familiar -- problem.

Said Greenblatt: ""Staff retention constraints shorter representative tenure and less training are leading to a longer time to complete the purchase more perceived effort from the customer and ultimately a decrease in satisfaction.""

One can't help feeling that carriers would prefer to close their physical stores entirely and move every interaction online. When that happens you can be sure of one thing -- the customer has to do even more of the work.

You might wonder though about specifics. Which carrier still manages to offer some sort of customer service and which appears to have abdicated?

Well T-Mobile came top -- not so difficult I suppose when you have only two competitors -- with a score of 797 out of 1000. I've often had the impression that T-Mobile has offered peculiarly human levels of customer service when the likes of say AT&T have not.

Talking of AT&T it's not the worst. This survey of more than 14000 customers gave it a score of 754. Yes this is below the category average. But it's still a fulsome 16 points above Verizon which finished at the very bottom.

Could it be that Verizon has an especially troublesome time pleasing its customers? Or could it be that its customers -- always being told that Verizon is the best and has the finest coverage -- are simply more demanding?

The pandemic certainly wasn't kind to Verizon employees. They complained about customers' behavior. They complained about well Verizon too. Their experience wasn't though isolated.

Customer service ought to be part of a premium offering and it seems Verizon customers currently believe they're not getting it.

Also: The company that's covering for AT&T's failures (Verizon's and T-Mobile's too)

I contacted Verizon for its view and will update you should I hear.

For its part J.D. Power describes an essential dynamic occurring in today's carrier market.

""As consumers increase their device usage and reliance"" said Greenblatt ""the purchase experience becomes that much more important.""

That's surely the crux. The more people depend on a particular device the more they expect to be supported by the company that sold it. Which doesn't always seem to be happening.

But just in case you think any of these carriers is really all that good at customer service this survey paints a little perspective.

Cricket Metro by T-Mobile Spectrum Mobile and Consumer Cellular all enjoyed higher satisfaction scores than T-Mobile.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMie2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZXZlcmdlLmNvbS8yMDIyLzgvMjcvMjMzMjQxMjgvdC1tb2JpbGUtc3BhY2V4LXNhdGVsbGl0ZS10by1waG9uZS10ZWNobm9sb2d5LWFzdC1seW5rLWluZHVzdHJ5LXJlYWN0aW9ucy1hcHBsZdIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,How Elon Musk SpaceX and T-Mobile are helping the satellite-to-cellular business,"On Thursday Elon Musk got on stage with T-Mobile CEO Mike Sievert to announce that SpaceX is working with the carrier to completely eliminate cellular dead zones. The companies claim that next-generation Starlink satellites set to launch next year will be able to communicate directly with phones letting you text make calls and potentially stream video even when there are no cell towers nearby. What’s more Musk promised all this is possible with phones that people are using today without consumers having to buy any extra equipment.

It’s a bold proclamation from the carrier — Verizon and AT&T don’t offer anything like it. However SpaceX and T-Mobile aren’t the only companies looking to use satellites to directly communicate with cell phones using existing cell spectrum. For years a company called AST SpaceMobile has promised that it will beam broadband to phones from space and a company called Lynk Global has already demonstrated that its satellite “cell towers” can be used to send text messages from regular phones. It’s easy to imagine that these companies would be afraid that two giants were suddenly looking to get in on a similar game — but it turns out that’s not the case at all. They actually seem delighted.

Who’s competing with SpaceX and T-Mobile in satellite-to-phone tech?

“We love the validation and the attention that this is bringing to this technology” said Lynk’s CEO Charles Miller in an interview with The Verge. “We’ve been getting all kinds of calls of carriers today who are like ‘help us!’”

Earlier this year Lynk deployed its first commercial satellite which was ferried into orbit by a SpaceX Falcon 9. Image: Lynk

Lynk’s initial goal is similar to SpaceX’s — it’s partnering with a number of carriers around the world to let their customers send texts using a satellite network it’s currently in the process of building. Like T-Mobile’s presentation Miller especially stressed the tech’s importance during emergencies and natural disasters where things like hurricanes wildfires flooding or earthquakes can take down traditional cell networks. “It’s resilience. It’s instant backup working for everybody on Earth. Your phones even though the towers are down can communicate” he said. “This will save lives.”

Miller’s pitch is very similar to Sievert’s and Musk’s but he doesn’t seem particularly worried about competing in the same space (pun intended) as them. Part of his confidence comes from Lynk being an early leader in the market — it claims that in early 2020 it became the first to send a text message to an unmodified cell phone from space. “We think there’s going to be more big companies jump in. They have years and years to go. They’re years behind us” he said. “We’re going to be like ‘wonderful! Educate the world that this technology is done.’ And when we start rolling it out at the end of this year people are going to go ‘I want it.’ They’re not going to want to wait years for it.”

Lynk SpaceX and AST all promise varying levels of connectivity

Scott Wisniewski the executive vice president and chief strategy officer at AST echoed a similar sentiment. “Our CEO actually tweeted and he said we’re happy that they’re focusing on this real big market and this real big need. And it was comforting to hear folks say things like the technology works for them” he said. He also predicted that the market for satellite-to-phone communication likely wouldn’t be winner-take-all. “In terms of the overall market it will be multiple winners in our view.”

AST’s service is perhaps more ambitious than what T-Mobile announced. Sievert said that he hopes T-Mobile will someday be able to deliver data via SpaceX’s satellites where AST’s express goal is to operate 4G and 5G networks. It’s betting that the idea of broadband will be more appealing than just being able to text and make calls from remote locations. “We all really understand that phones can go out of service quite frequently or coverage can be poor. And that was a point that was highlighted by T-Mobile. So our solution is really attractive in that regard” Wisniewski said.

Where SpaceX and T-Mobile’s plan is largely limited to the US and its territories — the wireless spectrum SpaceX is using for its service is owned and operated by other carriers and agencies internationally so additional deals are necessary for it to work anywhere outside the US — AST and Lynk have global aspirations. AST has gotten investment and a five-year exclusivity deal with Vodafone one of the world’s largest cell providers and has also received investment from Rakuten a mobile carrier in Japan. Miller says that Lynk’s testing its service in 10 countries “as we speak” and is capable of providing it in dozens more.

Even the timing of T-Mobile and SpaceX’s announcement is perfect for AST and Lynk as they tell it. The former is getting ready to launch a test satellite in just a few weeks (with five more slated for 2023) and the latter is planning on launching its commercial service with 14 network operators by the end of the year. If there was ever an ideal time for consumers to become very interested in exactly the thing you’re working on right as you're about to take a big first step might be it.

How Apple and iPhone 14 rumors fit into this puzzle

Tim Farrar an analyst at satellite and telecom-focused consulting and research firm Telecom Media and Finance Associates however thinks T-Mobile’s timing could be because another huge competitor is about to enter the market — one that could have advantages that AST SpaceX and Lynk don’t. “The issue is going to be what happens with Apple next week” he said referring to rumors that the next iPhone may be able to communicate with the Globalstar satellite network for emergency purposes.

If that happens he says iPhone users might get this feature very soon and in a version that includes international support from the start. “I think what’s likely is if Apple does announce something next week it will be something that’s ready to go as soon as the phone’s available. Because if they’re partnered with Globalstar Globalstar already has 24 satellites operating in space that you can communicate with and they have the licenses with the FCC and many other international jurisdictions.”

That last part is particularly important. All Apple has to do according to Farrar is get equipment authorization from the FCC through a “simple and well-defined” process and it’s off to the races. For the other companies — including SpaceX — who want to transmit from space using spectrum that’s licensed by cell carriers it’s not so easy. Historically satellites used satellite spectrum and cell towers used terrestrial spectrum. But Farrar says that satellite-to-cell tech mixes the two in a way that the rules currently don’t really allow for. “It’s a big regulation change for the FCC to make. And it’s something they’ve been considering for two years and not really reached a resolution.”

T-Mobile’s carrier competitors may even try to look for a way to prevent SpaceX from using the carrier’s spectrum which could complicate things further. “There’s going to be a lot of fighting over use of terrestrial spectrum on satellite” Farrar said. “There have already been interference concerns expressed when AST was looking to partner with AT&T to trial their system. None of the major wireless carriers want their rivals to gain the advantage. So clearly people will protest any application for use of T-Mobile spectrum on satellites. And the FCC will have to make a decision that which may not be reached very quickly.”

“Regulatory’s a process all of telecom is regulated.” - Scott Wisniewski

Indeed Miller wouldn’t really talk about spectrum saying that Lynk has “an open issue” with it. Wisniewski said that one of AST’s plans for dealing with spectrum issues is to work with carriers to get approval from regulators. He also said that the nature of providing service where there currently isn’t any could make things a bit easier. “We share the spectrum with mobile network operators on a noninterference basis in places where they don’t have towers.”

While AST has regulatory approval for commercial operation in seven countries according to Wisniewski the FCC has only authorized it to test its satellite to provide service to the US on an experimental basis.

As for SpaceX and T-Mobile their plans are quite a ways out giving the companies time to try and work things out with regulators — they don’t expect to even start testing their service until the end of next year.

If one company can break through with a phone that connects to satellite networks though it could potentially help all the other companies out. For example if Tim Cook gets on stage on September 7th and announces that you can send emergency satellite messages from the iPhone 14 a lot of people who don’t use iPhones are going to get real jealous real fast. That could add to pressure on the FCC to authorize the satellite-to-phone tech for carriers and their satellite communications partners. And if T-Mobile has it you know AT&T and Verizon will be making some calls. (Farrar thinks that other handset makers that don’t have as much clout as an Apple or a Samsung would have a difficult time introducing a similar feature — carriers could fight them arguing that their phones should just use the carrier’s satellite capabilities instead.)

Verizon specifically does actually already have an agreement for satellite connectivity though in a different form. It’s partnered with Amazon’s Kuiper project which aims to create a satellite constellation similar to SpaceX’s. Instead of doing direct satellite-to-phone communication though Verizon’s plan is to feed remote cell towers with satellite service instead of having to run fiber or cable to them. During the event on Thursday Sievert did say that T-Mobile was open to the possibility of doing something similar with SpaceX.

Neither Verizon nor Amazon responded to The Verge’s request for comment on whether they’d be modifying their plans based on T-Mobile and SpaceX’s announcement.

As for AST and Lynk neither company is particularly interested in competing on that front. “You don’t need to build these remote cell towers if your phone’s already connected by the satellite” said Miller.

Elon Musk let the satellite-to-phone cat out of the bag

At this point there’s really only one thing that seems totally clear: T-Mobile and SpaceX have let a genie out of the bottle. They announced loudly that soon your phone will be able to connect to satellites letting you have at least some level of communication even when you’re in areas that have traditionally been completely isolated.

There are a lot of ways things could play out from here — AST’s tests could show that yes you really can beam relatively fast internet to phones from space and raise the bar for what consumers want higher than where T-Mobile and SpaceX have set it. Or maybe regulators could suddenly figure things out letting Lynk swoop in before T-Mobile gets out of beta. And of course there’s always the possibility that everyone gets caught in a huge regulatory mess letting Apple come in and do its own thing with a completely different kind of technology.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnBob25lYXJlbmEuY29tL25ld3MvdmlzaWJsZS1jdXN0b21lcnMtaGF2aW5nLWlzc3Vlcy1hZnRlci11cGRhdGVfaWQxNDIxMzXSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,If you lost service upgrading to Visible's new plans try this fix,"Verizon's all-digital wireless service Visible doesn't have any retail stores and any changes to your account are made via the company's website or app (available for iOS or Android devices). A little more than a week ago we told you that Visible launched a couple of new plans  both with unlimited talk text and data 5G coverage and roaming options. Of course the more expensive $45 a month plan includes access to Verizon's faster Ultra Wideband 5G.

Some Visible subscribers became in-Visible after switching to the company's new plans







powruser : ""I have a Moto G Pure (LTE only) that i got direct from Visible. Ordered the new SIM everything activated completely smoothly for me. I went from old plan to Visible+ my LTE phone was nigh unusable with insane latency and deprioritized like hell. Now with visible+ im getting great latency and speeds."" On Reddit  Visible subscribers ran through the gamut of possible experiences since the new plans were put into service replacing the old ones. Some are much happier with the new options as expressed by this post from a Redditor using the handle: ""I have a Moto G Pure (LTE only) that i got direct from Visible. Ordered the new SIM everything activated completely smoothly for me. I went from old plan to Visible+ my LTE phone was nigh unusable with insane latency and deprioritized like hell. Now with visible+ im getting great latency and speeds.""





Not every Visible subscriber experienced such a smooth transition. In fact quite a few had no service at all although a fix was posted on Reddit. If you are not getting service from Visible try these four steps:







Pop in new sim and follow Visible activation instructions. No service at all after restart. Put old sim back in and reboot phone. Put new sim in again and reboot phone again.





While some found success eventually others had to make a drastic move such as the Reddit subscriber known as hondaaccords who wrote ""I have an eSim and an iPhone 12 Pro and I tried to upgrade to Visibile+ the first day. (I didn't know it was the first day). Activation failed I contacted support. 48 hours later support said the problem had been fixed my iPhone said that my phone had not been activated. I contacted support again they refused to let me talk to a human.



I switched to Mint mobile after the last support chat. Mint mobile was able to get me running and port my number from visible in less than 15 minutes. Unbelievable. Verizon should have stopped the rollout immediately after it was apparent that it wasn't working."" While some found success eventually others had to make a drastic move such as the Reddit subscriber known aswho wrote ""I have an eSim and an iPhone 12 Pro and I tried to upgrade to Visibile+ the first day.

At least some Visible subscribers had a sense of humor about what happened even if they weren't able to get any service. Read this follow-up post from hondaaccords . ""I signed up for Visible+ using eSIM and tried to port my number over. I was never able to redownload the eSIM after my port went through and despite reaching out to chat several times I was without service entirely for 24 hours before deciding to port back out to another provider. Fortunately between the referral bonus and a Chase credit card offer I effectively paid $0 for that month of service so I can safely say I got what I paid for.""

Visible offers 24/7 support via chat tweet or Facebook Messenger



While Visible doesn't have phone support or retail stores that you can pop into it does offer support 24/7 via chat (on the web and app) tweet (via @visiblecare) and through Facebook Messenger. The two new plans start at $30 a month for unlimited data talk text and hotspot. It also features unlimited talk and text to Mexico and Canada. The plan works with Verizon's slower nationwide 5G service and 4G LTE. If traffic is heavy over the nationwide 5G and 4G LTE networks your data speeds can be throttled.

If you want faster Verizon Ultra Wideband 5G (which delivers download data speeds averaging 300Mbps) you will want to spend $45 per month for Visible+. This service also features unlimited data talk text and mobile hotspot. After consuming more than 50GB of premium mobile data over the month you could find your data speeds throttled if there is heavy traffic on the 5G or 4G networks.

Or enter the iPhone's IMEI number into an online service like IMEI Check and see if your device is unlocked.

This article explains how to find out if your iPhone is unlocked and therefore isn't tied to any one phone company. Methods include checking the iPhone Settings using a new SIM card and using an IMEI service.

How to Check if an iPhone Is Unlocked in the Settings Menu

The easiest way to see if your iPhone is unlocked is to check your Settings menu. This method isn't always accurate but it's a good place to start.

Open the Settings app on your iPhone. Tap Cellular > Cellular Data Options. Look for an option called ""Cellular Data Network"" or ""Mobile Data Network."" If you see either one of these options your phone is most likely unlocked. If you don't see these options your phone is most likely locked.

If you travel overseas your phone isn't going to work unless you have a truly excellent service plan. The easier and more affordable option is to swap your existing SIM card for a local SIM. This will give you a new phone number to use in that country but will grant you the ability to use your phone and data on the road.

The first step is to power off your iPhone. Removing a SIM card while the device is powered on can damage the phone and the SIM. Locate the SIM card on your iPhone. Look for a small circular opening about the size of a pinhole. Use a SIM card ejector tool to remove the iPhone's SIM card. These tools simplify the process of removing a SIM card but you can also use a safety pin or a paperclip. Look at how your existing SIM card fits into the tray. Set it to the side in a safe location and place the new SIM card into the tray in the same fashion. Re-insert the tray into the iPhone. Press until you hear a soft click. nerosu / Getty Images Power the iPhone back on. Try to make a call. If your iPhone is able to connect to the network with a new SIM then it's unlocked. If your phone is unable to connect to the network then your device is locked. There are several ways to get around this such as contacting your carrier and asking them to unlock the device or using a third-party service. Some carriers may charge to unlock a device. However certain areas have legislation requiring companies to unlock mobile devices free of charge. You're done!

How to Check if an iPhone Is Unlocked Using an IMEI Service

Your phone has an IMEI (international mobile equipment identifier) number that is a tell-all for any information relating to the device.

There are multiple online services that will scan databases of IMEI numbers and tell you whether your iPhone is unlocked or not. However most are paid services the free services aren't always reliable and both are sometimes inaccurate.

Find the service you want to use. One of the most reliable services is IMEI Info which does a basic check for free with paid options for more information. Another free option is IMEI24 but your results may vary; the service might even time out before it can return results. On your iPhone and tap Settings > General. Tap About and scroll down to the IMEI number. This appears just below the serial number Wi-Fi address and Bluetooth information. Enter your IMEI number into the search bar of the IMEI service you chose. Select Check and fill out any verification information the website requires. It will then attempt to match your IMEI number again those stored in the databases. If you entered your number correctly you'll be able to see a lot of information about your phone including the production date the carrier it's attached to whether it's locked or not and more. The IMEI number will also reveal whether or not a device is stolen."

Joanna Demarco/Getty Images)

Bali and Costa Rica launched their highly anticipated ""digital nomad visas"" this summer.

They join dozens of countries hoping to attract virtual workers to boost the local economy.

Three digital nomads from Ghana the UK and Canada gave Insider an inside look at the application process.

Bali and Costa Rica recently joined the growing list of countries that offer residence visas specifically for remote workers also known as ""digital nomad visas.""

Prior to the pandemic the term digital nomad was fundamentally at odds with the corporate 9-to-5 crowd. Now tourism-dependent countries are hoping the new wave of remote workers with consistent paychecks will create a more reliable source of economic activity.

That's the case for Sean McNulty the CEO and founder of asset management firm XIB International. The 38-year-old Canadian has been living and working remotely from Bermuda with his wife Jana through the island's digital nomad program since November 2020. He told Insider they plan to live on the island for at least three more years and are considering raising a family there.

After applying through the program website the couple was approved ""within a week"" McNulty said adding that working in finance likely aided his application as Bermuda looks to diversify the economic activity on the island.

Applicants must pay a $263 fee provide proof of employment outside of the island and demonstrate they can afford the local cost of living.

""The lifestyle and the work life balance here I don't think you could beat that anywhere in the world"" McNulty told Insider. ""If you just be a good human and have fun then it's hard not to be happy here.""

Benjamin Rogers a 23-year-old marketing specialist from the United Kingdom told Insider he's in the process of applying to Mexico's temporary residence visa. He said he plans on working abroad without the permission of his current employer but hopes to keep his position at the company. Applicants must make around $2600 a month in order to apply.

Once in Mexico Rogers said he plans to stay in Airbnbs in different areas of the country and create content for his travel blog The Lonesome Wanderer.

""It feels like we're on the edge of the swingin' sixties but with less acid and more Microsoft Teams"" he told Insider adding that he views the digital nomad community as a ""movement"" that values creativity.

For 35-year-old music blogger Osei Kojo Enoch working remotely from abroad was more an economic necessity than a lifestyle option.

""You really don't have a choice because unemployment in Ghana is a very serious thing"" he said. ""The reason I started [a virtual business] was a result of not finding a job after graduating from school.""

After launching his website from Ghana Enoch said he wanted to work from a country with better electricity internet access and potable water. However his travel options were severely limited by his West African passport he told Insider.







""Unlike people from the West who can just take their passports and travel to any part of the world people coming from places like in Asia and Africa most everywhere you go you will need a visa"" Enoch said.

Last year Enoch applied for Dubai's remote worker visa a program that launched in 2020. He said he chose Dubai due to the city's infrastructure safety weather and lack of a personal income tax.

In order to qualify applicants need to submit proof of employment for the one-year duration of the visa with a minimum monthly salary of $5000. The entire application process took a total of six weeks according to Enoch.

""I needed better opportunities in life so that is what brought me to Dubai and I also love to travel"" he said. ""It's like killing two birds with one stone.""

Even with a Dubai work visa Enoch said he was still unable to travel outside of the UAE due to his Ghanaian passport which he said led to a UK tourism visa being denied.

The experience prompted him to apply to Malta's digital nomad visa which allows for travel within the Schengen area — a region containing 26 European Union member countries where travelers can move freely without dealing with border control. For this he enlisted the help of Citizen Remote a start-up that offers digital nomad visa consultations and assistance.

Enoch said he paid a total of €2800 fees throughout the application process which he described as much stricter in terms of vetting compared to Dubai. However Malta's digital nomad program only requires a monthly income of €2700 — approximately €2300 less than Dubai's monthly income requirement.

Despite the growing overlap between digital nomads and influencer territory Enoch warned that the lifestyle isn't always as great as it seems on social media.

""It gets very lonely"" he told Insider. ""The one year that I've been working at a co-working space I really haven't been able to make many friends … a lot of people come and they don't tend to live in that place for a long time.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNyYWluc2NsZXZlbGFuZC5jb20vYXdhcmRzL2hhcmRpay1kZXNhaS1ub3RhYmxlLWltbWlncmFudC1sZWFkZXJzLTIwMjItY3JhaW5zLWNsZXZlbGFuZC1idXNpbmVzc9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Hardik Desai: Notable Immigrant Leaders 2022 | Crain's Cleveland Business,,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiSWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnN0YXItdGVsZWdyYW0uY29tL25ld3MvbG9jYWwvZm9ydC13b3J0aC9hcnRpY2xlMjY0ODA1OTg0Lmh0bWzSAUlodHRwczovL2FtcC5zdGFyLXRlbGVncmFtLmNvbS9uZXdzL2xvY2FsL2ZvcnQtd29ydGgvYXJ0aWNsZTI2NDgwNTk4NC5odG1s?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Hundreds of Afghans settled in Fort Worth after Taliban takeover.

Among the thousands of residents of the island who each year need an appointment to request a visa of any kind or legalization procedures the shared memory on this institution is linked to its inaccessible and macabre system for obtaining appointments and the permanent complaints about their illicit sale.

Users of a group of more than 29000 nationals on the Facebook social network have described it concretely: getting an appointment at the embassy in Havana is practically impossible. So much so that according to Internet users commenting on the official account of the headquarters itself on Twitter some have spent up to three years trying to get an appointment to materialize their procedures.

Getting an appointment: a Cuban fight against demons

On the odyssey of Cubans who need to carry out procedures at the Mexican headquarters there are at least since 2018 press records that account for the anguish of those seeking an appointment. Through digital media social networks and official channels Cubans have made known their testimonies and experiences about “the problems” to get an online appointment.

The platform arranged for the appointment process received the name of Mexitel until March 1 of this year when it became Citas Cuba. With one name or another the disagreements around the system have been the same over the course of the last five years.

Cubans have complained for years about the difficulties in accessing the platform due to connectivity problems on the island and the usual oversaturation of the page which prevents even completing the data and validating the registration even if the steps at the bottom of the page are followed to the letter.

And although in response to the systematic concerns of users the online appointment service has been updated with the inclusion of new authentication steps in order to “avoid” transgressions in no way has access to appointments been guaranteed in simple way “free and legal” as established.

The procedure for getting appointments has not been constant either. It has gone from a weekly to a quarterly system. But it has not managed to be more efficient for it.

In 2018 the Mexitel system was regularly activated every Friday around 9:30 a.m. (Cuban time) and each week “a certain number” of appointments were made available to Cubans for document legalization and visa application procedures.

Alternately online appointments were activated for one week exclusively for document legalization and visa application procedures with permission from the National Migration Institute and the following week only for visa applications without permission from the National Migration Institute. In this way users entered the week that corresponded to their procedure and tried to schedule their interview.

In 2019 although the system continued to open on Fridays the appointment scheduling time was extended fortnightly. Currently what is established is the quarterly opening.

Meanwhile the opening notice by the consular headquarters which was previously carried out on Wednesdays when the system was activated on Fridays is now carried out imminently (on the same day). This is an element that contributes to the disorientation of users who according to what they state on the networks remain in constant uncertainty.

It is valid to clarify that in 2022 the annual number of appointments increased. Between January 4 and March 31 just over 4000 appointments were opened. Meanwhile on April 23 of this year the diplomatic headquarters announced the opening that same day of 16000 new appointments for the period between May and December.

However according to users on the networks the appointments for all those months of 2022 were sold out almost immediately. Therefore it is obvious that the number of appointments available is still insufficient given the real demand.

In this scenario the combination of the need to carry out a procedure and the almost impossibility of obtaining an appointment through the only established route leaves Cubans in a very bad situation. Or what is the same in the hands of those who promise to “resolve” by other means and always with money involved.

In troubled river… complaints of illicit sale of appointments

At least since 2018 there have been complaints of people dedicated to selling appointments. And the trend has been proportional between the increase in demand and the complaints of the rise in “parallel costs.”

Thus when the appointments were scheduled weekly a press report stated that “the safest way (to obtain one) was to pay 300 or 350 CUC (Cuban convertible pesos) to a person who lived near the embassy that guaranteed you an appointment and a ten-year visa to Mexico.”

Only a year later in 2019 a press release already mentioned that the costs reached around 800 CUC.

The demand for visas that shot up these numbers grew in a context in which Mexico became one of the most preferred countries among Cubans for shopping tourism to later resell on the island the merchandise purchased at competitive prices in that country.

During the years 2018 and 2019 Guyana Panama Mexico and Russia became the most visited destinations for these purposes by Cubans.

However although Panama established its Tourist Card in October 2018 to expedite this type of travel and Guyana and Russia maintained a visa-free agreement with the island Mexico one of the most attractive options for nationals both for its cheap merchandise and its geographical proximity never implemented similar facilities.

The fundamental reason for this lies in its northern border with the United States. Which turns a Mexican visa into an almost expedited path towards the “American dream.” However not only those who wish to emigrate have required a visa in recent years.

Within the current scenario of economic crisis and in particular after the opening of borders in November 2021 the demand for appointments for consular procedures has increased. And with it the complaints of illicit management of appointments which in December 2021 amounted to between 400 and 1000 USD.

The scandal in the media and networks at the end of the previous year was such that it led the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (SRE) of Mexico to issue a statement to underline that “MEXITELCUBA is the only way for the public to request consular interview appointments for visa processing. The appointments are distributed automatically by the system in accordance with a limited quota.”

The SRE itself acknowledged a few months later already in March of this year that it was “aware of the complaints about the availability and alleged sale of appointments to carry out consular procedures at the Mexican Embassy in Cuba which have been exposed in the media networks and through the Comprehensive System of Citizen Complaints of the Ministry of Public Administration.”

Although according to what it stated “in February 2022 SRE personnel carried out a visit to the Mexican Embassy in Cuba to evaluate the general functioning of the consular section” and in “said visit no indication of corruption or suspicious activity related to the attention of appointments by the staff of this representation.”

In practical terms beyond the systematic complaints expressed by residents of the island in different ways there is no evidence to prove these illegal procedures and who is implicated.

This is why the worst part continues to be carried by the Cubans. They cannot overcome the technical requirements of the appointment system they must settle for a number of appointments that continues to be less than the demand and when trying to “solve” obtaining an interview they often find themselves involved in scams in which they lose hundreds and even thousands of dollars without being able to achieve their goal.

It is true that the Embassy recommends that nationals “not be fooled and avoid being part of illegal acts” but the need to solve their procedures and the helplessness of not being able to achieve it even in years leaves those who need visas on this island neither more nor less in the deep blue sea.

Digital nomads combine remote work with travel - often for extended periods.

It's a trend accelerated by the pandemic that dates back to the 1980s.

Countries continue to court digital nomads - who often have to pay fees or demonstrate that they have enough cash to support themselves - to bolster economies.

There's one clear winner for South Africans looking for a working island escape without shelling out a fortune. But several European countries and Georgia also have appealing propositions.

Digital nomads are people who work remotely while travelling. And increasingly countries are offering digital nomad visas to foreigners to attract wealthy long-term visitors and bolster economies.



Although Covid-19 reinvigorated digital nomadism it's a trend that's been around for some time. Popular Computing magazine referenced the term in the early 1980s. As technology has improved and corporate policies relaxed it's become the domain of more than just the rogue startup founder or restless writer.

The internet is awash with not-so-humble brags of people who left office jobs to tick off countries while working remotely in paradise. But its rapid acceleration and popularity in the wake of Covid-19 is not without controversy. Full-time residents of popular digital nomad destinations are pushing back against outsiders clogging up coffee shops and lamenting the joys of cheap rent - often in cities where many residents can't afford the same luxuries.

Even so governments continue to woo digital nomads by offering specific visas that allow visitors to earn an income from their home country - and then in between Zoom calls and Slack updates - inject some of that foreign currency into the local economy.

And although the South African passport is notoriously weak some countries are still open to local digital nomads who can meet specific requirements. Central to most applications is a standard visa for the country or region on top of which you can stack a long-stay temporary residence or digital nomad visa.

Although terms conditions and eligibility change frequently here are some destinations worth investigating if you fancy the idea of making your fellow employees back home despise you even more:

Anguilla

Anguilla is an idyllic British Overseas Territory in the Eastern Caribbean that includes the main island and several islets. The destination was one of the first to introduce a digital nomad visa programme in 2020 called ""Lose The Crowd Find Yourself. Work. Life. Bliss."" It allows eligible visitors who meet a raft of requirements and pay a fee of R34000 to live and work from Anguilla for three to 12 months.

The Bahamas

The Bahamas offers an extended stay visa called BEATS which allows digital nomads to work remotely from its 16 islands for one year. Applicants must be eligible to enter the Bahamas or have the requisite visa pay a small application fee and provide medical insurance and employment proof. Successful applicants must then pay R17000 to receive the digital nomad visa.

Bermuda

Bermuda allows those who meet specific requirements to apply for a Work from Bermuda certificate. Remote workers must demonstrate employment or company registration funds to support them for one year and pay a R4500 application fee.

Costa Rica

Costa Rica offers a temporary residency visa called Rentista. Application fees are low and allow visitors to stay for up to two years. Successful applications must meet various requirements - including a demonstration of a monthly income of R43000.

Croatia

Croatia is a popular tourism destination for South Africans and some options are available for those wanting to stay longer and work remotely. You'll need to meet Croatia's visa entrance requirements for South Africans and then submit an application for a temporary stay that meets specific requirements. You can expect to pay upwards of R3500 in submission and administration fees.

Czech Republic

The Czech Republic offers an entrepreneurship visa for those ""who intend to run a business or be self-employed statutory organ or member of a statutory organ of a company"". There are several hoops for applicants to jump through - including an in-person consulate interview and proof of financial means. This allows digital nomads and other freelancers to remain in the country for up to one year.

Dubai

It's possible to live and work from Dubai for up to one year under its new virtual working programme. Applicants must have health insurance valid in the UAE employees must submit proof of employment of R85000 per month and business owners proof of a company one year or older with a minimum income of R85000.

Estonia

Estonia's digital nomad visa allows successful applicants to remain in that country for up to one year. Applicants must have valid health insurance supply proof of at least R60000 and pay visa fees of R1700.

Georgia

South Africans have for some time been able to enter Georgia without a visa and remain there for up to one year. Although Georgia launched its Remotely From Georgia digital nomad programme during the pandemic this appears not to have any significant benefits or changes to the existing relationship with South African visitors.

Germany

Germany offers a three-month residence permit to self-employed workers and freelancers often called the German freelance visa that can be extended by up to three years. South Africans must apply for a visa at a local German consulate travel to the country and then submit additional paperwork for a residence permit.

Greece

Greece now offers a new digital nomad visa that allows people including the self-employed to live and work in that country for up to one year. Applicants must submit proof of at least R60000 income per month. If the first year goes well digital nomads can apply for a digital nomad residence permit valid for two years.

Malta

Malta launched a Nomad Residence Permit that allows digital nomads to live and work within the archipelago for up to one year. The permit is open to people who typically require a visa to enter Malta. It requires proof of a gross monthly income of R46000 valid travel documents health insurance a background check and a property rental agreement.

Mauritius

Mauritius offers a Premium Visa to encourage foreigners to visit the island as long-stay tourists. The visa is valid for one year is renewable and costs nothing. Successful applicants are not eligible to enter the Mauritius labour market primary income and profits should be outside the country and they must supply basic documentary evidence to support the application.

Mexico

Mexico's temporary resident visa allows successful applicants to live and work remotely in that country for up to one year. There are several requirements to be successful - including demonstrating economic solvency of R725000 earned over the previous 12 months or a monthly income of R44000.

Norway

Norway allows digital nomads to live in that country for up to two years under its independent contractor visa. Applicants must provide proof of a business outside of Norway and earn at least R610000 per year among other requirements.

Portugal

But when it comes to corporate giants such as Vulcan Materials Company and Waterloo Investment Holdings that often proves difficult.

BELIZE CITY Thurs. Aug. 25 2022

Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Natural Resources Petroleum and Mining Hon. Cordel Hyde says that the efforts of giant corporations to exploit the country’s natural resources for exportation abroad is very reminiscent of colonialism. The minister is one of a few Government officials that have publicly spoken out against Vulcan Materials Company’s interest in aggregate mining at White Ridge Farm in Gales Point Manatee. Today he once again expressed his strong views on the matter to the media.

According to Hon. Hyde as an independent nation Belize should have the power to reject developers that it has no interest in working with. Large multinational companies however often have a hard time accepting “no” for an answer.

“We should have the power to say to any company ‘you know what your money is not good here. You know what thanks but it is okay. We do not want that kind of investment. We are concerned about other issues and so you may want to move on to another country.’ We have that right. We’re an independent sovereign nation. If we can’t do that then we are not” he said.

Minister Hyde confirmed today that representatives from Vulcan have requested via the US Embassy in Belize to meet with him. And while he has not fulfilled that request the representatives have met with the Ministry’s CEO and the Mining Director.

“We are dealing with giant companies. We are dealing with multinationals that are used to getting their own way” added Hon. Hyde.

Despite repeated and staunch objections from the people of Belize developers have continued in their efforts to launch proposed projects in various communities. That includes Vulcan Materials.

This past Saturday residents of Gales Point a Kriol village. met with representatives from the company. There some villagers made their message clear: they want nothing to do with Vulcan. Despite that response the company has written a letter to the people of Gales Point stating that they have been “energized by the productive conversations” that they had with the residents.

According to that letter the company will continue to seek input from the village as well as from government leaders local NGOs scientists and regulators. Vulcan also notes that this week it plans to begin providing jobs to the people of Gales Point that will “pay a minimum of double the current minimum wage”. According to the letter some persons have already expressed interest in taking up those jobs.

“We understand that there are some who have already made up their minds about this project. But we also know—from both our conversations with the government and with village residents—that there are many others who support this project” wrote the Vulcan White Ridge Project Team.

Similarly Waterloo Investments Holdings a company believed to be owned by the Ashcroft Alliance has continued in its efforts to get its proposed port expansion and cruise tourism village project approved despite having been rejected by members of the public on at least three occasions during public consultations due to social and environmental concerns.

“For me this whole Vulcan situation kind of reminds me of Ashcroft. There are some people who are just too big for this country” noted Minister Hyde.

The people of Gales Point says Hyde are resolute in their no. He also said that the environmental damage likely to result from mining in the area is “unthinkable”.

“You’re talking about our animals. You’re talking about our marine life. You’re talking about our hicatee our manatees our turtles our fishes our trees our mountains that will never be the same. So why should we go down that road for a few jobs here and a few nickels there while the rich multinationals will exploit our raw materials and ship that abroad?” Hyde said.

“You know what that sounds like to me? That smacks of slavery. That smacks of colonialism. That’s the very same thing that the ancestors of the Gales Point community fought against—escaped from slavery hundreds of years ago because they could not deal with that. They shunned that kind of thing” Hon. Hyde further remarked.

Vulcan Materials Co. was recently ordered to cease its operations in Mexico allegedly due to environmental and labor abuses committed while operating in Quintana Roo. The company has subsequently brought numerous lawsuits against the country’s government including one for $1.5 billion.

The company’s representatives have requested to meet with the Ministry of Sustainable Development. Vulcan also plans to submit an Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) Report in the near future.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZGh0dHBzOi8vYW1hbmRhbGEuY29tLmJ6L25ld3MvdnVsY2FuLW1pbmluZy1zdGlsbC1mYWlsaW5nLXRvLXdpbi10aGUtaGVhcnRzLWFuZC1taW5kcy1vZi1nYWxlcy1wb2ludC_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Vulcan Mining Still Failing to Win the Hearts and Minds of Gales Point,"by André Habet

At 2:00 p.m. on Saturday August 20 2022 the residents of the Gales Point Manatee (GP) community and other concerned Belizeans met with representatives of the Vulcan Materials Company a mining company headquartered in Birmingham Alabama USA. They gathered in a field adjacent to the community’s school to learn more about the proposed limestone mining operation in the nearby Sugar Hill area presently under ownership by White Ridge Farms. Under three tents plus another with refreshments Vulcan representatives made themselves available to questions about the project outlining the potential community impacts; the proposed port; and their environmental impact mitigation strategies.

The meeting followed Minister of Natural Resources Hon. Cordel Hyde’s public opposition to the project earlier this month and was arranged so Vulcan could address Gales Point residents’ questions and concerns about the mine. The tents featured various posters and brochures and representatives attended to questions about the scale of the dredge the necessary port would require the training for a range of mining and support staff jobs and the extraction process the mine would use.

The last of those received some attention in an August 8 7News interview where Vulcan VP of External Affairs Janet Kavinosky made a distinction between strip-mining a term that often carries connotations of environmental destruction and Vulcan’s proposed method of ‘aggregate quarrying’ which Kavinosky described as “taking big rocks and breaking them down to little ones”. Asked to validate Kavinosky’s distinction hydrologist Dr. Ed Boles said that while the methods might vary their differences are ultimately negligible. Both methods require stripping the forest above the mining site and would negatively hinder the ecosystem services provided by the limestone hills and forest including managing the quality and flow of water through the area’s landscape.

A few attendees had no prior knowledge of Vulcan and others mentioned having conducted internet searches of their own and learning about the company’s contention with ten other countries for purported environmental harm. Some in attendance were curious about the possibility of steady employment once the mine began operation; others wanted to know the extent of the mine’s impact on the surrounding landscape and a small contingent voiced the possibility of Vulcan potentially supporting alternative industries in the area instead of mining. Dennika Bowen a Gales Point resident and tourism student opposed the mine calling it a threat to eco-tourism opportunities that would come with the completion of the Coastal Road’s present upgrade.

Gales Point resident Anton Andrewin Jr. said he did not want Vulcan to operate in Belize after previously working for the company last year expressing frustration about the company prohibiting marijuana users from work as well as a back injury received on the job. Gales Point village chairman Jay Altschaf and Nancy Bailey also in attendance recalled taking other residents to the hospital following back and groin injuries sustained while carrying Vulcan’s heavy drilling equipment up the hills during the initial survey phase conducted in late 2019 to early 2020—work that many described as ‘hard labor.’ In a follow-up Vulcan said that it was aware of one employee being injured and taken by them to Dangriga’s hospital and requiring stitches on his hand and that “in 2021 94% of their facilities had zero lost-time injuries.” Vulcan Materials and its subsidiaries have incurred 82 workplace safety and health violations for the years 2000-2022 according to the US national policy research center Good Jobs Still which aggregates information across US federal agencies.

The day’s event didn’t proceed as Vulcan hoped once it began. Community members almost immediately shared their exasperation with the meeting’s format to the Vulcan representatives and the media. Several described the separate tents as a “divide and conquer” strategy and voiced dissent to the representatives for what some felt was a manipulative tactic to deceive attendees. Meanwhile Vulcan representatives assured them that it considered the three information tents a means to limit a small number of personalities from dominating a ‘town-hall-style’ panel meeting. The community members offered to move the chairs and tents to alter the meeting format but Vulcan maintained their preference for their original plan later adding it had hoped to provide greater opportunities to address individual concerns.

Forty-five minutes after the meeting began a few of the village’s drummers including local legends Emmett Young and Bombay got out their instruments under the ‘Community Impact’ tent. They played while others danced and sang. For thirty minutes they transformed a small portion of the event into a gathering of joyful resistance with various elders stepping in for a dance. The musical protest started to disband once several in the crowd encouraged those playing to depart the field altogether rather than wait for Vulcan to change their mind. By 3:14 p.m. many who had arrived from the village left the field remaining at their vehicles across the road at the school grounds or at neigboring residents’ yards while a few continued to visit the tents and talk to Vulcan’s representatives.

Of those that departed the field Andrewin Jr. was among them. He stated he viewed the company’s resistance to changing the meeting format as another instance where the mining company was attempting to deceive the villagers and take advantage of their individual unawareness of mining to persuade them. Bailey owner of Manatee Lodge voiced agreement with that interpretation of the day’s event. She and several others wore shirts made for the day with the slogan “Nah Play We Fi Idyat.”

At the end of the meeting at 4:00 p.m. Jimmy Flemming of Vulcan Materials said that while he was somewhat disappointed by the meeting he and Vulcan were undeterred in commencing with the Environmental Social Impact Assessment (ESIA) and continuing in their talks with the people of Gales Point. The US company is committed to buying the White Ridge Farms property and is currently working through its shortlist of potential consulting firms that would prepare the document for review by the National Environmental Appraisal Committee (NEAC) who would then vote and make a recommendation to the Department of the Environment.

Since then CEO of the Ministry of Sustainable Development Kenrick Williams has told News5 that “[Vulcan’s mine] may not be an investment that has the support of the government” and that they would hold a preliminary meeting with them by week’s end. It is yet to be determined if Vulcan will succeed in rallying the necessary public support for its mining interests. For now those opposed in the village seem to outnumber its advocates and they are continuing in their efforts to preserve Gales Point’s unique ecologies and the sustainable life many have cultivated in this Kriol community.",,,,,,,,,

Wired2fish’s McKeon Roberts challenges this by showcasing his offense-focused walleye system using a responsive pedal kayak and a snap jig with plastics. Yes walleyes can be aggressive veracious feeders with predatory instincts and playing on those instincts can outperform live or dead bait.

KAYAK SETUP

FEATURED TACKLE & MISC. (retail links)

Roberts starts the process by pedaling around searching for prime walleye locations such as main lake humps weed edges and current seams around islands and narrows. He activates AutoChart Live on his Humminbird HELIX to create custom HD maps of the structure while laying down waypoints and tracks for bookmarking spots and safe navigation.

Reaction-style baits come in many forms but few are more versatile than a snap jig. A snap jig consists of a single hook jig head with a fin that allows it to sink fast but hang in the water longer with quick rod snaps — similar to wings on a glider. A scented slim profile forked-tail plastic pairs excellently with a snap jig as it provides scent and profile attraction without hindering the action.

Roberts loves a stable and maneuverable pedal kayak with an instantaneous reverse system which excels at boat control in wind and current situations. Utilizing the pedal system allows him to hover which helps to stay off the fish and make accurate casts.

A high gear ratio spinning reel is handy for picking up slack while fighting the fish from a kayak. Roberts opts for a stiff but sensitive medium power fast action rod equipped with a braided — this setup helps prevent fatigue and allows for maximum feel of bottom contact and strikes.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMikwFodHRwczovL3d3dy5rY3VyLm9yZy9ob3VzaW5nLWRldmVsb3BtZW50LXNlY3Rpb24vMjAyMi0wOC0yNy9yaXZlcmZyb250LWJvdXRpcXVlLWhvdGVsLWRldmVsb3BtZW50LXJhaXNlcy1xdWVzdGlvbnMtYWJvdXQta2Fuc2FzLWNpdHktdGF4LWluY2VudGl2ZXPSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Riverfront boutique hotel development raises questions about Kansas City tax incentives,"With help from controversial tax exemptions a new boutique hotel is coming to Kansas City’s Berkley Riverfront.

The Port Authority of Kansas City (Port KC) voted in late July to issue bonds for the Origin Hotel. It will be constructed across the street from the Union Apartments and will offer 118 hotel rooms as well as a full-service restaurant a bike library and a fitness center. Port KC estimates it will bring at least 70 jobs to the neighborhood to staff the hotel and restaurant.

The project’s developer The Thrash Group is receiving a total of $6.8 million in tax exemptions over 20 years. Port KC has exempted the hotel from 75% of its property taxes for the first 10 years and 50% for the second 10 years.

Some public entities including Kansas City Public Schools and the Community Mental Health Fund have voiced frustration with the tax exemptions. They believe that Kansas City gives developers larger tax incentives than necessary at the expense of taxing jurisdictions that depend on property tax revenue.

Origin Hotel will bring mixed-use development to the riverfront

Up until this point development at the Berkley Riverfront has been primarily residential. The two major developments are the completed Union apartment complex and the Core apartment complex which is still being constructed.

Port KC CEO Jon Stephens said the agency has prioritized bringing a mixed-use development into the neighborhood.

“While [housing is] wonderful and you always want to have places where citizens live … you have to have more than that if you’re going to really build community” he said. “We know that to really be successful we need those jobs and we need people spending money down there. So this is that next step.”

The Thrash Group is a Mississippi-based developer that has built hotels in Austin Texas; Lexington Kentucky; Raleigh North Carolina and two in the Denver area.

Although Port KC leaders have said they’ve had difficulty recruiting developers for a riverfront hotel project Stephens said The Thrash Group meets important benchmarks.

“They have stated and we will be holding them to it that a large percentage of the construction and operations will be prevailing wage” and union he said. “All public improvements for this project will be 100% prevailing wage.”

Stephens also noted that the project does not contain a parking structure which has been tough to negotiate with some other developers. The project has surface parking for 50 vehicles.

“We know that’s usually one of the most expensive components of projects and one where people are rightfully critical and say ‘Why should the public pay for all of this parking?’” Stephens said.

Local taxing jurisdictions have concerns about tax exemptions for a boutique hotel

Tax exemptions in Kansas City have long been contentious and some government agencies are displeased with the use of this tool for a luxury project that they do not believe offers public benefit.

“While the school district does not oppose every incentive ask we do have serious concerns about a quarter-century of abatement for a hotel project” Kathleen Pointer senior policy strategist at Kansas City Public Schools said at a Port KC development committee meeting in May. “It’s an inappropriate use of potential public funds especially in the current market.”

Port KC’s primary tool for incentivizing projects is tax abatement which reduces the amount of property tax that developers are required to pay.

Its rationale is that the undeveloped land that Port KC owns is empty and not producing any property tax revenue so any property tax revenue from a new development is a net positive with or without abatement.

But taxing jurisdictions question the degree to which Port KC needs to incentivize its projects if at all.

A large portion of property tax revenue funds the school district and KC Public Schools has not been shy about its view on tax incentives.

The school district has a web page devoted to the impact of tax abatement on its revenue. In 2021 the district lost $37 million due to tax abatement. In the 2018–2019 fiscal year tax abatement losses amounted to $1069 per student. By comparison this number was $379 per student in North Kansas City and $95 per student in Raytown.

The Community Mental Health Fund which supports agencies that provide mental health services is another taxing jurisdiction whose revenue is affected by property tax abatement. Its executive director Bruce Eddy is less than enthusiastic about the Origin Hotel.

“We give it a ‘meh’” Eddy said. He said Port KC hasn’t demonstrated that there is a market for a boutique hotel at the riverfront or hired a third-party analyst to critique the project.

Concerns about how Kansas City uses tax exemptions

Nathan Jensen a political science professor at the University of Texas in Austin has studied the use of tax incentives in Kansas City — particularly how they have been used to move economic development back and forth across the state line.

“There’s a lot of criticism of the overuse of economic development incentives” Jensen said. “Most scholars have identified that they’re overused in the sense that often they’re given to companies that don’t need it or they’re excessively generous.”

Support for tax abatement often relies on a “but for” argument: The idea is that “but for” incentives a development might not occur. Jensen questions whether this argument holds water especially when the incentivized development is a retail project such as a hotel.

“There’s been a movement over the last 20 years to not incentivize retail” he said. “The idea is that it just displaces other retail.”

Although a project like the Origin Hotel advertises about 70 new jobs Jensen said these jobs will likely be displaced from another hotel or restaurant in a different part of Kansas City.

“If it’s not generating a lot of jobs — or if it’s generating jobs but probably displacing jobs — the only real value is the tax benefit that you get to tax this hotel” Jensen said. “But often that’s exactly what the governments give up.”

KC taxing jurisdictions ask for transparency and independent analysis

After a developer presents its financial analysis for a project Port KC works with the developer to see what kind of tax incentive would make the project suitable for bank financing Stephens said.

While some development agencies in Kansas City obtain independent studies of a project’s financial viability Port KC relies on its own financial analysis. Stephens said the Port KC staff has financial expertise and uses third-party data in its analyses. He questions whether a third-party analyst would have the expertise necessary for the variety of projects that Port KC handles.

“I am absolutely not opposed to third-party analysis” Stephens said. “We show our work. We show all the data we show where it changed where it was headed which is exactly what the other parties do. But we are exploring if we could use an auditor.”

Port KC’s reliance on internal expertise has become a point of contention for tax incentive skeptics.

“Jon’s lovely but ultimately it’s a secret sauce and it’s very disturbing” said Eddy from the Community Mental Health Fund. “When you’re doing public investments then I don’t understand how anybody can allow that to happen other than the fact that the environment is ultimately developer-driven.”

NWT Insider Report: Hoyer holds the line ‘Dewey’ delivers AOY drama

Modified Aug 27th 2022 at 1:00 AM

By Brett Carlson

DUNKIRK N.Y. – Day two of the 2022 National Walleye Tour Championship presented by Bass Pro Shops and Cabela’s saw uncharastically calm waters allowing anglers to run around on the relatively calm Eastern Basin of Lake Erie. While no one neared 40 pounds two bags over 30 pounds were weighed. One came from day-one leader John Hoyer who held (and slightly increased) his 10-pound lead and the other came from Duane “Dewey” Hjelm the hottest stick in walleye fishing who unofficially took the lead in the Lucas Oil Angler of the Year race.

Hoyer and Hjelm sit first and second after two intense days of competition. Hoyer and Hjelm are also friends travel mates and the two are fishing a similar yet unconventional Erie pattern.

“People might not believe this but I’m ripping a Berkley plastic to trigger strikes with a heavy jig” said Hoyer the Orono Minn. pro. “It is my No. 1 favorite way to fish for walleyes. I haven’t trolled and I haven’t caught a fish deeper than 15 feet in two days. I was marking them again with my Lowrance ActiveTarget and then picking and choosing.”

While his morning was slower than yesterday Hoyer still boated a dozen walleyes.

“I had another one of those unicorn 29-inchers that weighed over 8 pounds. Then I had a 6 1/2 a 6 a 5 and a 4 1/2.”

Altogether those five walleyes weighed 30.79 pounds. On day one the Berkley/Simms pro registered 39.81. With a total weight of 70.60 pounds Hoyer has accumulated an unthinkable 10.55-pound lead.

“It’s awesome; I’m exactly where I want to be. It would be a lot cooler if my partner who is the hottest guy in fishing wasn’t on the same class of fish.”

This morning Hoyer was so confident with how his pattern and the forecast aligned he removed all the trolling equipment from his Ranger.

“I’m probably going to put it back in tomorrow just in case. It’s a strong pattern but it’s not a sure thing for either of us. When it’s flat calm and sunny they post up and they’re sitting ducks. On day one I caught two giants out off the edge. If the weather takes a turn for the worse I’ll probably spend more time out off the edge.”

Hjelm rallies to second leads AOY

The Angler of the Year picture became more clear as it’s down to two pros – Hjelm and Max Wilson. While Hjelm caught 35.68 pounds today the second-heaviest stringer of the championship he only has a 2-point lead over Wilson. Wilson sits in fifth overall and has room to move up while Hjelm would have to unseat Hoyer to move up.

“I trolled the first day but I never trolled today” said Hjelm who won both the final NWT qualifier of the year on Green Bay and the Bass Pro Shops and Cabela’s National Team Championship on Lake Oahe. “John’s the one that found this deal. I didn’t know how many fish there were to go around so I played it safe on day one. After a mediocre day I knew that I had to have a huge bag and I didn’t feel like I could do that trolling.”

Hjelm said he caught 12 to 15 keepers today and that he too is intentionally targeting big fish on his Lowrance ActiveTarget. After two days his cumulative total sits at 60.05 pounds.

“I had two fish today that were around 28 to 29 inches. Then I weighed two 27s and the smallest I weighed was 26.”

Hjelm now finds himself in the rare situation of attempting to simultaneously win the biggest event in walleye fishing and AOY the most prestigious title in walleye fishing.

“I don’t know if it’s possible to catch John. I do know that I’m not going to take my foot off the gas. He’s got a huge lead though; I don’t think he needs that much to seal the deal. After my day one I would be ecstatic to take second place and secure Angler of the Year. I’m going to fish as hard as I possibly can tomorrow.”

Today’s bright and calm conditions were ideal for Hjelm’s casting program. Tomorrow’s forecast is in stark contrast.

“My trolling deal and casting deal are in different directions. At this point I’m committed to casting. If I could pick I wish tomorrow was just like today. It was the perfect day for doing what we like to do.”

Andersen retains third

In an otherwise dynamic tournament Amery Wis. pro Adam Andersen continues to demonstrate remarkable consistency. After catching 30.03 yesterday he managed 27.87 today to retain third place.

“A guy always wants more but I’m happy especially to stay in third” said Andersen who took second on Lake Oahe in 2021.

Unlike the two pros above him on the leaderboard Andersen is committed to trolling in water 75 to 82 feet deep.

“Yesterday was mainly deep-running cranks on leadcore and today was mainly shallow runners on Dipsys. I have an area they are in and the right fish are grouped up to some extent. The name of the game is to get what you can get as fast as you can get it. Today I actually caught a few more fish than yesterday.”

This is the elder Andersen’s third top 10 out of the last four NWT Championships.

Przekurat fourth Wilson fifth

Rounding out the top five are Wisconsin sticks Jason Przekurat and Wilson. Przekurat improved his weight on day two and rallied to fourth with a 28.46-pound stringer. Combined with his 27.71 from day one the two-time NWT Championship winner has a total of 56.17 pounds.

While this marks Przekurat’s third consecutive top-10 at the championship his son Jay is the one who has garnered most of the headlines lately. In July the 23-year-old became the youngest angler to ever win a Bassmaster Elite Series event. He also became the first Elite Series angler to enter the Bassmaster Century Club (for catching more than 100 pounds) with solely smallmouths and he’s currently leading the Rookie of the Year race.

Wilson the Campbellsport Wis. pro improved his weight from 25.83 on day one to 28.25 on day two. In the process he rallied from 16th to 5th with a cumulative weight of 54.08 pounds. With one day left Wilson sits 2 points behind Hjelm in the AOY race.

“Dewey has the tiebreaker so I have to basically beat him” said the Blackfish pro who won the 2018 NWT Championship on Lake of the Woods. “I’m all over the place right now. On one hand I just had my best day on Lake Erie in years. But on the other hand I thought I had enough to win AOY and then I found out Dewey had 35 pounds. I kind of got the rug pulled out from under me. I’ve been obsessed with AOY all year and now I feel like it’s out of reach.”

Wilson described his Erie pattern as “jigging the abyss” in 100 feet of water where boat control is extremely difficult.

“I’m emotionally and physically beat up and tomorrow the weather is supposed to be much worse. I will say that if anyone is going to beat me I’m glad it’s Dewey. He’s one of the nicest guys out there.”

Rest of the best

Rounding out the top 10 pros after day two on Lake Erie:

6th: Austin Ragotzkie of Edgerton Wis. 10 walleyes 53.97

7th: Drake Herd of Alexandria Minn. 10 walleyes 53.53

8th: Craig Sleeman of Victor N.Y. 10 walleyes 53.28

9th: Keith Kavajecz of Deerbrook Wis. 10 walleyes 53.00

10th: Bill Shimota of Northfield Minn. 10 walleyes 52.98

The third and final day of competition begins today at 7 a.m. Eastern time as the top 10 takes off from Holiday Harbor at Chadwick Bay Marina located at 30 Central Avenue in Dunkirk. The final weigh-in will take place at the Dunkirk Pier which is located at 2 Central Avenue beginning at 3 p.m. Eastern time.

The goal of the agreement between Union Pacific Railroad and Wabtec a leading global provider of equipment systems digital solutions and value-added services for the freight and transit rail industries as well as the mining marine and industrial markets is to revitalize existing locomotive fleets by refreshing and renewing core locomotive components while installing the latest technologies to improve reliability and fuel efficiency as well as reduce emissions.

Comprising the 600 Union Pacific locomotives to be modernized are 525 AC4400 and AC6000 locomotives as well as 75 Dash-9 locomotives. Once rebuilt these locomotives will be equipped with a suite of digital solutions and innovations including next-generation controls technology and the next generation FDL Advantage fuel solution.

The improvements are expected to extend locomotive life improve fuel efficiency by 18% increase reliability by 80% and increase haulage ability by 55%.

Wabtec will modernize the locomotives at its plants in the United States and plans to deliver beginning in 2023. This deal is the third major modernization order from Union Pacific since 2018; by 2025 Wabtec will have upgraded more than Union Pacific 1030 locomotives.

The Benefits: Customers the Environment and the Circular Economy

Locomotives that are more reliable fuel efficient and can haul more weight yield wins for Union Pacific customers and the environment while supporting a circular economy.

Environmental Benefits of Locomotive Modernization

The modernizations will provide approximately 350 tons of carbon reduction per locomotive per year. The total order will enable Union Pacific to realize approximately 210000 tons in annual emission reductions — the equivalent of removing emissions from nearly 45000 passenger cars per year.

It also helps Union Pacific on its path to reducing absolute Scope 1 and 2 greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by 26% by 2030 from a 2018 baseline and ultimately reach net zero emissions by 2050.

Benefits to Rail Shippers

Installing state-of-the-art technology makes locomotives more dependable. This improves their capability to support the growing demands on the rail network and provide more reliable consistent service for customers. The modernizations also support UP customers’ efforts to meet their own carbon reduction targets.

Circular Economy

The modernizations also support the circular economy with more than half the locomotive’s weight being reused. Over the course of the order approximately 70000 tons of steel will be reused and recycled – the equivalent of more than 51000 passenger cars.

More Improvements Ahead

A modernized locomotive gets finishing touches

Upgrades to existing locomotives aren’t the only improvement Union Pacific is making to its locomotive fleet. Union Pacific recently purchased 20 battery-powered electric engines that will serve to reduce GHG emissions and help address climate change. The company is also testing the viability of powering locomotives with 100% biofuel a renewable energy source. Likewise locomotives are becoming more fuel efficient through the use of energy management systems in addition to renewable diesel and battery electric power.

Currently railroads can move one ton of freight more than 480 miles on a single gallon of fuel already making rail the most fuel-efficient way to move freight over land. Increasing locomotive fuel efficiency has the potential to boost this number even higher. As it stands trains generate a carbon footprint up to 75% less than trucks; better fuel efficiency will result in even greater emission reductions.

Efforts to use less fuel will also help reduce dependence on fossil fuels and promote energy security.

Officers with the Rocky Mount Police Department responded to the Walmart at 1511 Benvenue Road around 11 a.m.

They found Alice Drake 61 who police said had been struck by a man with a machete. Drake was treated at the scene and transported to UNC Nash Hospital for non-life-threatening injuries. She was later released from the hospital.

Investigators found the suspect 33-year-old Brian Torman inside a nearby Taco Bell restaurant in the Cobbs Corner Shopping Center. According to police ""Torman was still armed with the machete and was suffering from a mental crisis.""

Police officers talked with Torman and took him into custody.

Investigators determined Torman had robbed a person inside the business before officers arrived. The man he robbed 57-year-old Levon Applewhite was not injured during the robbery.

An involuntary commitment order was obtained for Torman along with a warrant for assault with a deadly weapon inflicting serious injury and robbery with a dangerous weapon. Torman was transported to UNC Nash Hospital. The warrants will be served once Torman is released from the hospital.

Police said the officers who talked to Torman had all been trained in de-escalation.

According to Rocky Mount ""Handling calls for service with individuals who are in a crisis is a very volatile situation for the officers and citizens involved ... this case serves as an example to the importance of the countless hours that the men and women of the Rocky Mount Police Department put in on a yearly basis as it pertains to de-escalations and CIT training.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiiAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5rZW5zNS5jb20vYXJ0aWNsZS9uZXdzL2NyaW1lL3RocmVlLWRldGFpbmVkLWZvbGxvd2luZy1zaG9vdGluZy1hdC13YWxtYXJ0LWJjc28tc2F5cy8yNzMtNmMxNzg4NTEtMzEyYi00NDZmLWExMjktYTA3MzFjYzAxYWRk0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Four teens facing charges after shots were fired at Converse Walmart BCSO says,"It was the second shooting incident in less than 24 hours in the area of the store Converse police said.

CONVERSE Texas — The Bexar County Sheriff's Office charged four people after the second shooting in less than 24 hours in the neighborhood near the back loading area of a Walmart store in Converse Sherriff Javier Salazar said.

Those facing charges in the incident include two 15-year-olds an 18-year-old and a 17-year-old according to BCSO.

Numerous law enforcement personnel were sent to the Walmart located at FM 78 and Crestway around 2 p.m Saturday.

According to the Converse Police Department a shooting happened Friday night in a neighborhood near the Walmart no one was injured.

Then on Saturday afternoon another shooting incident happened at the same location with one suspect running through the back loading area of the Walmart officials say.

Everyone in the store was evacuated Saturday afternoon according to Converse police.

""I'm like going in and then all I hear is get out! Get out! And I was like what's happening"" said Angelie Monroy a customer.

Monroy was walking into the Walmart with her 2-year-old daughter when people told her there was a shooting inside the store.

""Then I grab my daughter and I'm holding her and I'm running back to my car"" said Monroy.

Monroy said she drove to where employees were evacuated in the parking lot. Then she began filming the scene as it unfolded.

""Then [I started] speaking with the other employees. I went around like 'Hey are you okay"" she said.

Monroy said employees told her they heard gun shots inside. Even responding officers thought bullets popped off on radio scanner saying shots were coming from the pharmacy. However Sheriff Javier Salazar said they later found no evidence of shots fired in the store.

""It sounded pretty chaotic and I'm surprised we have no injuries"" said the sheriff.

The sheriff said deputies found the man in the store and without a gun.

Salazar said five juvenile suspects and three adult suspects were initially detained. Out of those juveniles two 15-year-olds are now charged with evading arrest. Additionally an 18-year-old is charged with evading arrest and unlawful carrying of a weapon. A 17-year-old is also charged with evading arrest.

The tiny theme park opened five years before Disneyland in 1950. It features a collection of fairy tale-inspired rides exhibits and performances that seem Disney-esque in their style and stories but in a much smaller setting.

Walt Disney's visit to Children's Fairyland in 1954 and perhaps a few other times likely gave him a couple of ideas for the mood features and operations for his Disneyland project in development at the time.

Today you can still visit the quaint park to enjoy its retro charms and decades-old rides and judge for yourself whether Disney borrowed some of its ideas. You may declare as Disney did that Children's Fairyland remains a ""swell"" place to visit for adults and their kids.

Disney drew inspiration from Children's Fairyland

The 10-acre Children's Fairyland property by the shores of downtown Oakland's Lake Merritt was the brainchild of local businessman Arthur Navlet.

It opened after the Oakland parks program raised $50000 for Navlet's proposal to create ""a storybook theme park featuring fairy-tale sets farm animals and live entertainment"" according to the park's website.

The theme park offered visitors a fun escape from everyday life through interactions with costumed characters rides and various storybook dioramas.

Walt Disney visited Children's Fairyland in May of 1954 when Disneyland was still under development. ""With his own enterprise in mind he studied design cost of operations and technical aspects"" of the park according to an Oakland Tribune news story from the time.

""The man who has delighted millions with the charm he has built into motion picture cartoons was in turn delighted with Oakland's Children's Fairyland. Walt Disney readying to build his own Disneyland in the Southland visited Oakland to see firsthand the playland operation which has given this city one of its great tourist attractions"" read the Oakland Tribune story.

During his visit Disney rode the park's Jolly Trolly a colorful miniature train launched in 1954 and still open for rides in 2022. Other areas he likely saw while at the park include The Alice in Wonderland Tunnel (which was created a year before the release of the Disney animated film) and the Peter Pan-themed Jolly Roger Pirate Ship.

After spending the day in the park Disney was hooked. So much so that he hired Children's Fairyland's then-director Dorothy Manes to become Disneyland's youth director. He also recruited the park's chief puppeteer to work for him.

The concept of Disneyland was created prior to Disney's visit to Children's Fairyland. However it's clear he gained some inspiration from what he saw in Oakland. His experience at the park combined with Dorothy Mane's nearly two-decade tenure at Disneyland helped pave the way for the magical world he'd build at his Anaheim California park.

Even after seven decades of operations Children's Fairyland remains popular with local Bay Area families and visitors. The park runs summer camps theater programs sleepover events and even adults-only parties.

Beyond its various events the park continues to be a haven for younger kids. While nobody will mistake Anansi's Magic Web (Children's Fairyland's miniature Ferris wheel) for Space Mountain or its small petting zoo for Disney's Jungle Cruise its array of kid-appropriate rides and animals make it an ideal place to bring little ones.

In addition to The Alice in Wonderland Tunnel and The Jolly Roger Pirate Ship which remain at the park today kids can play like cowboys in Old West Junction clamber through the Fairy Music Farm Tunnel and zip down the park's sizable Dragon Slide. The puppet programs of yesteryear are still present too so adults and kids alike can continue to see fairy tales come to life at Children's Fairyland's intimate outdoor theater.

The old-school charm of the park's offerings provides a pleasant break from the high-tech attractions of Disneyland giving kids the opportunity to embrace their youth and act on their imaginations in a simple way. Plus the entrance fee of $15 per person is much lower than what you'll pay in Anaheim making the park a budget-friendly way to pass the time.

You may not see Mickey and Minnie while at Children's Fairyland but all the park's vivid sets play spaces and critters are bound to spark some creativity in your kids. Perhaps they'll even gain some inspiration of their own and one day outdo Disney's fantastical concept.

The business unit that includes the theme parks recorded record revenue of $5.42 billion and a record operating income of $1.65 billion in the quarter ending on July 2 the Wall Street Journal reported.

One change that has helped the company increase profits is its Genie+ phone app which costs $15 per person a day on top of admission and allows guests to skip lines for some attractions according to the report.

However the app cost doesn’t cover all attractions and parkgoers will have to pay an additional $10 to $17 to skip standby lines to experience some rides including Star Wars- and Guardians of the Galaxy-themed rides.

The strategy is helping the company stock price and financial results at a time when the other company properties are struggling the report adds. The changes have taken root in the two years since the waning of the coronavirus pandemic and have resulted in record sales and profits for the theme parks even as attendance is below pre-pandemic totals.

A key to the strategy is increasing the amount of money each visitor spends the WSJ reports. Helping that is the introductin of a smartphone app Genie+ that costs $15 per person each day on top of admission. It allows users to skip lines fo some but not all attractions. Excluded are the Star Wars and Guardians of the Galaxy rides.

Adding to the totals are the end of freebies such as parking and charging for things that used to be given away. Disney has also raised prices on hotel rooms food and merchandise over the past year.

The strategy has been highly successful. The WSJ reports in the quarter that ended Jan. 1 Disney’s domestic parks set records in both quarterly revenue and operating income then broke both of them six months later.

Chelsea Guffy

Chelsea Guffy recently began a side hustle as a travel agent who specializes in Disney vacations.

""I thought to myself 'Okay this could be something really cool' Guffy said when a friend she helped advise on a Disney vacation suggested she do it as a job.

This is Chelsea Guffy's story as told to writer Jamie Killin.

This is an as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Chelsea Guffy who recently began a side hustle as a travel agent who specializes in Disney vacations. It has been edited for length and clarity.

Last year I noticed on social media that one of my sorority sisters had started working as a travel agent on a lot of Disney vacations and working for a travel agency called ET Family Travel.

I had a Disney vacation coming up that November and I had already booked the whole thing but I had asked her if she could get me dining reservations because those are the hardest thing to get at Disney World and she agreed. She helped me get all the dining reservations that I wanted.

Then she said to me ""Chelsea you know Disney in and out. You should come on as an agent."" So I thought about it and come the new year I thought to myself ""Okay this could be something really cool."" I joined the team and I fell in love with it.

Travel is just in my blood and I love booking vacations for my family so it was a no-brainer.

I grew up in Florida about two hours away from Disney World and grew up going.

Chelsea Guffy recently began a side hustle as a travel agent is seen here at Epcot Center with the iconic ""golf ball"" after starting a side hustle as a travel agent..isney vacations Chelsea Guffy

The first time I went I was probably three weeks old. I've always had a love for travel – I studied abroad in college and when I was growing up my family would take trips at least once a year to different places all over the country.

Travel is just in my blood and I love booking vacations for my family so it was a no-brainer that I'd like doing it for other people.

The agency I work for focuses on Disney and family-friendly trips so most agents focus on theme park vacations. However we do all kinds of travel. I mainly focused on Disney at first but then I got requests from my friends so I decided to branch out.

I did a United Kingdom trip for a friend of mine in June and now I'm doing another UK trip as well as a New York trip. I've also helped with California trips and even staycations.

My clientele is primarily my friends and people in my network but now I've had two clients who I did not know previously – one reached out to me through my social media and another was a referral through the agency.

Chelsea Guffy who has started a side hustle as a travel agent says that ""travel is just in my blood and I love booking vacations for my family so it was a no-brainer that I’d like doing it for other people."" Chelsea Guffy

I'm able to help my clients save a lot of time. I have a lot of knowledge; while they might need months to plan a trip I can do it for them in three weeks. Sometimes I also find lower prices for them.

I also make sure to tell my clients that this is my second job and that I have a full-time job. I try to give as much time to my clients as I can – but I make sure to set expectations.







I do also get benefits like free Disney tickets and discounts at hotels.

As a side hustle it's nice to have the extra cash. I am an independent contractor who makes money based on commissions from the theme parks and hotels. The amount of time I spend on the job varies but I average 12 to 15 hours a week in addition to my full-time job. I start as soon as my son goes to bed so 7:30 p.m. and 10 p.m. are my prime.

I do also get benefits like free Disney tickets and discounts at hotels. I have to meet a certain commission within a year to qualify for some benefits. One of these is the CLIA card which is focused on cruise travel and once you've met their commission minimums you're able to get special travel agent rates. For example there are Disney cruises this October that would be available for about $20 a person per night.

I'm really looking forward to having access to those perks.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiX2h0dHBzOi8vdGhlZGlzaW5zaWRlci5jb20vMjAyMi8wOC8yNy9sZWFrZWQtdGFuZ2xlZC1zcGlubmVyLXJpZGUtZm9yLXdhbHQtZGlzbmV5LXN0dWRpb3MtcGFyaXMv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,'Tangled' Spinner Ride for Walt Disney Studios Paris - Daily Disney News,"As Disneyland Paris continues to gather more and more dust in regards to attractions (nothing new since 2006!) construction continues to flourish over at Walt Disney Studios with The Kingdom of Arendelle and the park’s lake. And now we have some information on another new attraction coming to the park.

Originally released in 2010 Tangled was a big hit and Rapunzel-retelling quickly gained representation within the Disney parks with bathrooms in the Magic Kingdom and character meet and greets at all of the Disneyland parks around the world. However Tangled is only just starting to get its own attractions starting with a mini-land within Tokyo Disney Sea’s Fantasy Springs.

A Tangled attraction has been rumoured for Disneyland Paris for years and thanks to OutsideEars we have our first look at the upcoming attraction.

READ: Disney+ Movie and Shows Arriving in September

The Tangled spinner ride will be an off-the-shelf spinning attraction manufactured by Italian ride manufacturer Zamperla. Although similar to the classic Mad Hatter’s Tea Cups this version will have boats instead of cups. The ride building will be filled with hundreds of lanterns and it will overlook a pond which is sure to be a popular photo location at nighttime.

The attraction will be placed beside Toy Story Playland and will be joined by some new bathrooms possibly a replica of those found at the Magic Kingdom in Florida. The off-the-shelf nature of the attraction is disappointing but rather fitting for the area since Toy Story Playland is filled with them.

Although not officially confirmed we can probably expect an announcement during the parks panel at D23. Hopefully with some more exciting news for the only European Disney resort?

WBD,Warner Bros Discovery,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMicGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZXZlcmdlLmNvbS8yMDIyLzgvMjcvMjMzMjMzMDUvaGJvLW1heC13YXJuZXItYnJvcy1kaXNjb3ZlcnktZGF2aWQtemFzbGF2LXJlYWwtaG91c2V3aWZlLW9mLWhiby1tYXjSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,HBO Max and Warner Bros. Discovery seem to be on fire and that's on purpose,"Zaslav’s plan is to focus on making as much money as cheaply as possible. When he joined Discovery in 2006 it was a small collection of education-oriented cable channels. Zaslav turned it into the reality TV monster we know today. He’s made his money catering to audiences that don’t pay for streaming but instead flip the channel on the TV — and when they don’t find something to watch pack up and head to the movie theater.

So while what we’re seeing could be the fumblings of an egoist with no grasp on the properties he’s purchased what feels much more likely is that Zaslav just doesn’t care about the stuff a lot of us care about such as “a big spread of readily available content that speaks to smaller groups often underrepresented in popular media all at a fairly affordable price.” Zaslav isn’t here to better enrich our entertainment landscape — he’s here to make money.

Zaslav’s plan is to focus on making as much money as cheaply as possible

That means he’s got to shift a company that’s spent two years focusing its energies elsewhere. In the years leading up to the Warner Bros. and Discovery merger Warner Bros. underwent a pretty radical transformation. COVID altered the way people operated in 2020 (and in much of 2021 and even 2022) and Warner Bros. went all-in deciding to focus on streaming at the cost of its other businesses.

As a person with a very nice home theater setup and a love of quick and easy access to content this was very appealing to me — and I bet it was to you too. Instead of risking illness to see the biggest movies in theaters we could sit at home and watch King Kong body Mothra over Mexico or Paul Atreides whisper-talk his way into legend in Dune. As people’s concerns over COVID waned (though it’s still very much a pandemic and you should be testing regularly and masking up indoors!) HBO Max maintained a steady stream of content designed to compete not with traditional Warner Bros. rivals like Disney and Universal but with Netflix whose movies go straight to the streamer and only make pit stops in theaters for awards eligibility.

“Why” I’m sure Zaslav says to himself “should we throw away all that potential money just to boost the $15 a month subscriptions we sell for HBO Max?”

And Zaslav’s appeal to theaters is mutually beneficial. Direct to streaming makes a lot of sense for Netflix a company with a very small distribution arm. Warner Bros. Discovery has a whole apparatus built up to make lots of money off films in theaters. “Why” I’m sure Zaslav says to himself “should we throw away all that potential money just to boost the $15 a month subscriptions we sell for HBO Max?” Instead the company can put the movies in theaters and then move them to the streaming service and double-dip on us the consumers.

I personally am not a fan of that! I don’t want to pay a billion times for the same content. But I’ve done it with books software movies and TV for a while now. Zaslav knows there are plenty of rubes just like me probably willing to pay.

We don’t know how the shocking cancellation of Batgirl plays into Zaslav’s grand plan to reverse streaming courses and turn Warner Bros. Discovery into a much more traditional entertainment behemoth. Reports on the film have ranged from “it’s so bad it should never see the light of day” to “it wasn’t bad and had a really great message.” It might have been canceled because it looked a little too CW to appear after the Warner Bros. Discovery logo on the big screen. Or it might have been canceled to help eke out a few extra tax break dollars as Zaslav & Co. work to make the $3 billion in savings promised by the merger.

The move to cancel Batgirl for tax reasons was weird

When I spoke to Francine McKenna a lecturer in accounting at The Wharton School and author of the newsletter The Dig she noted the move to cancel Batgirl for tax reasons was weird. “There are tax benefits to writing down the assets now if you are the kind of company who likes losses because they offset current or future tax liabilities” she said via email. “WB is a loser to begin with so not sure why incremental losses based on trash canning finished films is that helpful.”

In its Q2 filings Warner Bros. Discovery didn’t reference the cancellation specifically but did outline its overall plan in very accountant terms:

Content impairments for the three and six months ended June 30 2022 of $496 million and $501 million respectively and content development write-offs of $329 million for the three and six months ended June 30 2022 were due to the abandonment of certain content categories in connection with the strategic realignment of content following the Merger and are reflected in restructuring and other charges in the Studios Networks and DTC segments.

All of the above is accountant speak for “WBD has a lot of content it doesn’t think makes sense for the new business and will get rid of it to write it off on the company’s taxes.”

Batgirl wasn’t the only thing to apparently fall victim to the accounting department’s very sharp pen. In the past few weeks the company has quietly removed dozens of shows and films from HBO Max — often without even warning their creators. One showrunner The Verge spoke to only learned of their show’s removal from Twitter.

The reason for the culling seems to be that the content wasn’t hitting a big enough audience

The reason for the culling seems to be that the content wasn’t hitting a big enough audience and much of the content catered to an audience the new Warner Bros. Discovery just has no interest in: kids. Sources told CNBC that “Warner Bros. Discovery has decided to move away from the category with its future investment budget.” Earlier this week The Daily Beast reported that much of this culling including the layoffs of the divisions overseeing HBO Max’s unscripted kids and family and international content was in part to reorient the service and the company to better pursue Zaslav’s real money cow: Middle America.

“If David Zaslav had his wish he would just program Chip and Joanna all day long” one unnamed executive told The Daily Beast. “There was just a massive ‘We don’t need you. You’re not offering the things we’re focused on.’”

And that’s what he’s doing to Warner Bros. Discovery. But Zaslav’s goal to craft a company that can make money hand over fist by catering to the largest possible audience with a predictable (and cheap) slate of content isn’t really what any of the rest of us want.

The glut of content has by its nature produced a diversity of content

The last few years we’ve enjoyed a renaissance of TV. So much TV has been made so quickly and for so much money that there’s now a shortage of qualified showrunners. So much TV has been made as every company scrambles to populate their new streaming services with stuff to watch that a wide variety of people who have rarely — if ever — had the opportunity to see their lives represented on TV have gotten that opportunity.

Ten years ago lesbians frantically watched queerbaiting fare like Rizzoli & Isles for just the idea of two women being close enough kinds of friends that they might be romantic. Two weeks ago Amazon Prime gave us A League of Their Own a TV show featuring almost an entire cast of queer women and their stories.

Movie Removed From Warner Bros. Release Schedule,"At any given point in time there are about a dozen Stephen King adaptations in various stages of production. After all he is the King of Horror whose numerous novels and short-stories have proven to be a goldmine for TV and film. With so many adaptations currently in development it’s easy to lose track. Howeverthe latest adaptation of Salem’s Lot has fans wondering what exactly is going on.

Recommended Videos

For those unfamiliar with ‘Salem’s Lot it was King’s second novel published in 1975. The novel follows writer Ben Mears as he returns to his childhood hometown Jerusalem’s Lots (or ‘Salem’s Lot for short) to work on his next book. However he soon discovers a terrifying phenomenon – the people in the town are turning into vampires. ‘Salem’s Lot has been adapted twice first as a two-part miniseries in 1979 by Tobe Hooper then as a 2004 TV miniseries by Mikael Salomon.

In 2019 another ‘Salem’s Lot adaption was confirmed to be in the works with New Line Cinema producing and Warner Bros. distributing. Gary Dauberman who has written several horror films including It and It: Chapter 2 was confirmed to be directing the film in 2020. The cast features Lewis Pullman Bill Camp Spencer Treat Clark John Benjamin Hickey Makenzie Leigh and Alfre Woodard. Filming began in October of last year and the film was initially slated for release September 9 2022 but has hit some hiccups along the way.

What’s going on with Salem’s Lot?

Fans were disappointed when COVID-19 delays did away with the initial release date in 2022 and pushed it back to April 21 2023. Now however the film has been pulled from Warner Bros. Discovery’s release schedule for 2023 entirely. Warner Bros. has been undergoing a shake-up since their merger with Discovery. Recently Warner Bros. Discovery changed their movie line-up swapping Salem’s Lot out in favor of Evil Dead Rise. Initially Evil Dead Rise was suppose to be an HBO Max-exclusive release. However Warner Bros. Discovery chose to give it a theatrical release slating it for release on April 21 2023 and leaving Salem’s Lot with no release date.

Now that the Evil Dead Rise has taken Salem’s Lot’s place the future of the King adaption is unclear. Warner Bros. Discovery has not officially cancelled the film and it may yet receive a new release date. With fans still reeling over the shocking cancellation of the Batgirl film though many fear for the fate of Salem’s Lot. Right now all we know for sure is that it is up in the air. It no longer has a release date and it is up to Warner Bros. Discovery to decide what to do with it next. Salem’s Lot still could very well receive a later release date or it could mark another film cancelled by Warner Bros. in post-production.

During the Aug. 16 ceremony at the landfill Mayor Keith Mashburn commended the project and its impact on the city.

The new plant which will be operational in 2024 will reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 100000 tons per year and create enough gas to fuel 2000 waste and recycling vehicles.

Use of the renewable energy is a substitute for fossil fuels and can be used for heating electricity and fueling vehicles.

The facility will process biogas collected from the landfill into pipeline quality gas for injection into the nearby gas distribution grid.

“We value this type of environmental innovation in Simi Valley” Mashburn said. “This investment here in our community is a positive step in the direction of alternative energy that beneficially uses existing landfill gas and could eventually fuel the trucks that service our neighborhoods.”

The renewable gas is created when waste is deposited into the landfill and covered. As it decomposes biogas is generated and then collected and sent to a processing facility where a pipeline-quality biomethane product is created. The gas is then supplied to transmission systems distribution systems and vehicle fueling stations.

WM plans to invest more than $825 million in its renewable energy footprint over the next three years by expanding its renewable natural gas infrastructure.

Council comments

All five councilmembers attended the Aug. 16 groundbreaking for the renewable natural gas facility.

“We need to recognize that it really put Ventura County on the forefront of greenhouse gas emission reduction technology” said Mayor Pro Tem Elaine Litster noting WM’s $100 million investment to build the facility in Ventura County.

Waste Management has 16 such plants across North America through a mix of third-party developers and WM plants.

Councilmember Ruth Luevanos said the project will take the equivalent emissions of 25000 cars off the road.

“So when people ask what is being done about climate change Waste Management is one of our pivotal partners in dealing with that issue” said Luevanos who encouraged residents to continue to place their food waste into green bins at their homes to help reduce the amount that ends up in the landfill and leads to greenhouse gas emissions.

Councilmember Dee Dee Cavanaugh said that her dad was a trash man for over 10 years for the City of Glendale and always said “We need to use that gas up at the landfill for something one of these days.”

“Dad they’re doing something. He’s happy I’m sure” Cavanaugh said.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXWh0dHBzOi8vdHJhdmluZHkuY29tL25ld3MvMjAyMi8wOC93YXN0ZS10cmVhdG1lbnQtb24tdmlldG5hbXMtcGh1LXF1b2MtaXNsYW5kLXJhaXNlcy1jb25jZXJuL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Waste treatment on Vietnam's Phu Quoc Island raises concern,"Phu Quoc Island off the coast of Kien Giang Province in southern Vietnam is mired in a garbage crisis and waste treatment solutions seem ineffective.

he island city discharges some 180 metric tons of solid waste and 17500 cubic meters of wastewater daily.

By 2025 the pearl island among top-rated tourist destinations in Vietnam will need to treat 400-650 metric tons of garbage per day.

Open-air waste dumps

Garbage in Phu Quoc is dumped at a temporary landfill in the Dong Cay Sao area in Cua Duong Commune.

Tuoi Tre (Youth) newspaper reporters found that the volume of garbage at the landfill has tripled in the last two months. The odor from the garbage and leachate is terrible.

Meanwhile a waste treatment plant in Bai Bon Hamlet Ham Ninh Commune whose investor is Minh Thuan Thanh Construction Investment Co. Ltd. will be operated on a trial basis over the next two months.

A project assessment report will be released after the trial operation period.

If the plant’s waste treatment results are promising the investor will receive official investment approval from local authorities.

However even when the plant is in place it can treat only part of the garbage on the island. The remaining garbage will still be gathered in the Dong Cay Sao area.

In reality refuse can be seen everywhere in the city due to the habit of littering in public places by local residents and tourists. A large volume of litter has drifted out to sea.

On weekends when tourists flock to tourist sites such as restaurants hotels and beaches in Phu Quoc trash piles up there.

“Cau Palace Vem Canal areas along Tran Phu Street and the international seaport fishing village in Phu Quoc are beautiful but choked with trash” said Nguyen Canh Quan a tourist from Ho Chi Minh City who went on a three-day-two-night trip to Phu Quoc.

Quan and his friends spent an afternoon collecting waste on the beach near the international seaport.

Residents voluntarily collect waste

Completely in love with Phu Quoc Quan always chooses the island as his destination whenever he gets a chance.

During his trips to the pearl island after the COVID-19 pandemic he spends time collecting waste on beaches.

According to Lieutenant Colonel Vu Dinh Nga head of the Propaganda and Training Commission of the Coast Guard Region 4 High Command in response to the ‘Day for Phu Quoc Environment’ campaign some 500 guards volunteer to collect waste on beaches on the first Saturday of every month.

“We have collected and treated dozens of metric tons of garbage including plastic bags cups and bottles and other kinds of garbage” Nga said.

“The collected garbage is classified and treated properly in association with the Ho Chi Minh Communist Youth Union in Phu Quoc City and environment companies.

“With this practical act we expect to contribute to preserving and protecting the marine environment in Phu Quoc.”

Spending more than seven years working as a volunteer to clean up waste in Phu Quoc Tran Van Sanh leader of the Phu Quoc Green and Clean group and an environmental ambassador of Phu Quoc shared that he his friends and volunteers started collecting garbage in Phu Quoc in 2015 with an aim to protect the marine environment.

Details of the alleged activity are included in a civil lawsuit filed in early August in a case where a Waste Management employee is alleging civil rights violations and violations of the Virgin Islands Whistle Blowers Act.

The plaintiff in the case Nadine Noorhasan says she was placed on administrative leave after she complained to environmental enforcement agencies about soil taken from the Donoe public housing reconstruction site on June 23 being dumped at the Bovoni Landfill. According to court documents the disclosure came during a conversation with an official from Planning and Natural Resources.

Donoe was a public housing community until it was heavily damaged during Hurricane Marilyn in the mid-1990s. The Virgin Islands Housing Authority is building a new housing community on the site as a partial replacement for Tutu Hi-Rise which was damaged during Hurricanes Irma and Maria in 2017.

The soil is believed to be contaminated by asbestos and heavy metals detected during sampling tests at the reconstruction site.

The plaintiff was hired by Waste Management in 2013 as a compliance officer and later promoted to compliance management director. In her 25-page civil complaint Noorhasan described her efforts to get a contractor to obtain required permits for properly removing the soil from the Donoe site.

Noorhasan claims the change in her work status is part of a pattern of workplace harassment and retaliation taking place since 2019. In the lawsuit she described the potential hazard that contaminated soil might cause to groundwater in the area of St. Thomas’ municipal landfill.

If any asbestos or heavy metal contamination of the water occurs as a result she said it would violate a federal consent decree over the handling of solid waste by the Virgin Islands government and Waste Management. Noorhasan expressed those concerns to Environmental Protection Agency scientist Leonard Grossman in mid-June.

“Mr. Grossman and Ms. Noorhasan discussed that formal complaints needed to be made as it pertained to VIWMA’s environmental violations of DPRN and EPA regulations by issuing the (VI Housing Authority) permits to dispose of contaminated soil at Bovoni landfill” the Aug. 3 complaint said.

Prior to the email exchange with Grossman in mid-June the plaintiff said she spoke with a top manager at Waste Management advising that they not allow the contaminated soil to be sent to Bovoni. Later Noorhasan said she found out the manager she spoke to allegedly produced a document allowing the contractor to do so.

Four days after learning that the soil had been moved in spite of warnings and declaring that a violation had occurred Noorhasan said she was confronted by the manager who authorized the transfer. According to the complaint the compliance officer was told to collect her belongings drop off all of her government-issued materials and leave the building.

Government House spokesman Richard Motta Jr. was asked to comment on the allegations contained in the complaint on Sunday. Motta said he had only heard of the accusations through media reports and otherwise had little knowledge about the matter.

Waste Management Authority spokesperson Lorna Minkoff referred a report to the agency’s general counsel Florence Kahugu for comment. A phoned-in inquiry was left on Kahugu’s voicemail but received no reply.

Comment was also sought from EPA Region 2 Public Information Officer Elias Rodriguez. The inquiry was met with an email auto-reply saying Rodriguez was not available. The inquiry was redirected to agency spokesman John Senn.

The Virgin Islands Whistleblower Protection Act became law in 2019 as an amendment to Title 10 of the Virgin Islands Code. It prohibits employers from retaliating against employees because they request investigations into violations of government rules and regulations."

The EPA’s proposed rule will require that releases of perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl compounds into soil or water be reported to federal state or tribal officials if they meet or exceed certain levels which could facilitate cleanup efforts.

While the two compounds PFOA and PFOS part of a larger class of PFAS “forever chemicals” have been voluntarily phased out by U.S. manufacturers the substances don’t degrade in the environment and instead accumulate in humans and animals over time and are believed to be in the blood of 99 percent of Americans.

PFAS have been linked to multiple diseases including types of cancer. The man-made synthetics were used in consumer products and industry since the 1940s including in stain- and water-resistant fabrics and carpeting cleaning products and even non-stick cookware.

“We have all paid for decades — in the forms of higher health care costs and higher drinking water bills — for one of the greatest environmental crimes in history” Ruffalo said according to a statement obtained by the New York Times which Ruffalo also tweeted. According to The Times Ruffalo said the move would hold chemical polluters accountable.

Ruffalo helped to spotlight the issue of PFAS through his role as real-life attorney Rob Bilott in the 2019 environmental legal thriller Dark Waters directed by Todd Haynes. Following the release of the film Ruffalo and other advocates joined forces on Dark Waters production company Participant Media’s Fight Forever Chemicals campaign urging companies to remove forever chemicals from their products and consumers to not support these products. The campaign also supported labeling such chemicals as hazardous substances and setting an enforceable drinking water standard.

Speaking to The Hollywood Reporter ahead of Dark Waters‘ release Bilott was hopeful the film would bring the public health issue to a wider audience.

Bilott told the Associated Press Friday that the EPA’s proposal “sends a loud and clear message to the entire world that the United States is finally acknowledging and accepting the now overwhelming evidence that these man-made poisons present substantial danger to the public health and the environment.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMimAFodHRwczovL20uZWNvbm9taWN0aW1lcy5jb20vaW5kdXN0cnkvZW5lcmd5L29pbC1nYXMvb3ZsLWdldHMtYW5vdGhlci0yLXlyLWV4dGVuc2lvbi1mb3ItdmlldG5hbWVzZS1vaWwtYmxvY2staW4tc291dGgtY2hpbmEtc2VhL2FydGljbGVzaG93LzkzODMyMjIwLmNtc9IBnAFodHRwczovL20uZWNvbm9taWN0aW1lcy5jb20vaW5kdXN0cnkvZW5lcmd5L29pbC1nYXMvb3ZsLWdldHMtYW5vdGhlci0yLXlyLWV4dGVuc2lvbi1mb3ItdmlldG5hbWVzZS1vaWwtYmxvY2staW4tc291dGgtY2hpbmEtc2VhL2FtcF9hcnRpY2xlc2hvdy85MzgzMjIyMC5jbXM?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,OVL gets another 2-yr extension for Vietnamese oil block in South China Sea,"Find this comment offensive?

Reine Yazbeck Hamilton senior vice president Wells Fargo

BACKGROUND: Reine Yazbeck Hamilton serves as senior vice president at Wells Fargo. As a child Yazbeck Hamilton grew up in war-torn Beirut. After moving to the U.S. at age 11 and only speaking Arabic and French she soon became fluent in English and continues to immerse herself in various cultures and languages to better connect with others and build a deeper understanding of social and human values in unfamiliar places.

SOURCE OF PRIDE: “My proudest professional accomplishment was building and bringing together a diverse team of exceptionally talented community-focused professionals who helped execute an impactful vision. Together we built a unique Business Banking model for our Arizona market — creating a dedicated full-service Nonprofit Banking Division. I was able to support and create new initiatives for our clients. Through this work I developed strong community partnerships to help weave common threads and work together on social issues to impact meaningful change for our customers and the community.”

SURPRISING FACT: “Growing up in Beirut Lebanon as a child I was not exposed to learning nor speaking English until I moved to the U.S. at age 11 and tested into 8th grade. I was the youngest in my class and only spoke Arabic and French. My dad would often joke and say as talkative and loud as I was I sure learned to listen a lot more! Luckily my 8th-grade French teacher would often take time after class to tutor me and teach me English grammar. As a pre-teen I found myself watching a lot of music videos soap operas and reality TV to help me learn conversational English. In less than a year I became fluent in English.”

SOURCE OF INSPIRATION: “I have had many inspirational figures throughout my career but a particular woman leader whose impact stands out to me is Peggy Chase president and CEO of Terros Health. I have known Peggy for over a decade and she embodies the meaning of servant leadership. Her inspiring work strong values humility and her ability to genuinely connect with others to drive impactful change in my opinion puts her in the “remarkable leaders” category. She not only inspires me but she also inspires her organization her team and those working alongside her community leaders and partners alike.”

On July 7 2017 Brian Brown Easley entered a Wells Fargo bank with a mission. He handed a note to the bank teller. It read “I have a bomb.” The film Breaking shares a story of a Marine Veteran who wants his Veteran Affairs check of $892.

Breaking is based on a true story that not many people would know about unless they lived in the state of Georgia. The majority of what happened on screen took place in real life.

About a year after the incident Aaron Gell reported the life and death of Easley. The article was titled “‘They didn’t have to kill him: The death of Lance Corporal Brian Easley.” It also recounted everyone involved and the steps leading to Easley’s ultimate demise.

It opens with Easley’s final moment of dignity before setting off a plan to get his money from the VA. After talking to his daughter Kiah (London Convington) and promising her a dog he decides to start his end. His point wasn’t to rob the banks nor was it to hurt anybody. He simply wanted to be heard. The setup of the film starts very quickly. One moment we are in a hotel room where Easley is contemplating his next step. The next he is in Wells Fargo holding two women hostage demanding a negotiator.

Abi Damaris Corbin directed the movie. She also co-wrote alongside Kwame Kwei-Armah for an exhilarating experience. Corbin and Kwei-Armah capture the true meaning of tragedy but they don’t make it as a means of a cash grab or for tears. They made this film to educate people about what’s really going on with the VA.

The reason why this film works so well is John Boyega’s performance. In every aspect it felt natural. The pain behind each breakdown from Easley’s fits of frustration to the utter politeness he granted to everyone he interacted with undoubtedly displayed who Easley was as a person. His personality did not change to show him as a hero or a villain. Rather a person who lost hope. He had PTSD and other mental problems that caused him to behave differently. When watching John Boyega will no longer be there; instead Brian Brown Easley took over his body. His acting capabilities have sky-rocketed him to new lengths. If Boyega does not get nominated for an Oscar that would be a crime within itself.

As the story unfolds we see the crumbling police force working alongside the FBI GBI and the News reporters to sway what will happen to Easley and his hostages. Nothing was dramatized for the Hollywood effect which made this even more haunting. Every law enforcement that was on-screen felt real. The uncertainty behind Easley’s next move had everyone on edge.

Each character served a role in the storytelling. The two workers at Wells Fargo are Estel Valerie (Nicole Beharie) and Rosa Diaz (Selenis Leyva). Both women displayed bravery and humility; each step they made pulled the audience into their shoes. Both women at different times wanted to help Easley but at the end of the day it wasn’t the money he wanted. He wanted the VA’s attention– it was a form of an apology. He wanted their money. What would you do in that situation when you begin to hear the story by Easley?

The late Michael Kenneth Williams played Sgt. Eli Bernard the negotiator. He was the only one from law enforcement who wanted Easley to come out of this alive. Through the conversations between the two it’s discovered that Bernard has had similar run-ins with the VA. These issues are not something new and that’s why these scenes will touch the hearts of many. There are many ways to relate to Easley’s journey and it’s not limited to Veterans. It will connect with people that deal with mental health issues daily who are homeless when it wasn’t something they could have done differently and even people that are trying to make the most of things and still not getting the outcome they deserve.

Breaking will open up conversations about the failures with the VA. When true stories are made correctly and with good intentions it can cause a spark of conversations. There’s a clear message to Easley’s story. After many attempts to get his voice heard it doesn’t work out. The VA doesn’t help veterans when they are needed the most.

It touches on all aspects of themes: family heartache isolation mental health and the failed American dream. And in each of them the audience will see through the eyes of Brian Brown Easley.

Rating: 5/5

It’s not often movies are given perfect scores but the story itself along with the complimentary cast director and writers alike shows what true art could do. This is a tear-jerker especially in the final moments of the movie. It shows who Easley is deep down. He was a veteran yes. He was also a father who needed help and no one could give him what he deserved.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiR2h0dHBzOi8vdWsuc3R5bGUueWFob28uY29tL3dlbmR5LXdpbGxpYW1zLWxlZnQtZGllLXdlbGxzLTE5MDAwMDk0Mi5odG1s0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Wendy Williams was 'left to die' by Wells Fargo bank,"Wendy Williams was ""left to die"" by Wells Fargo bank her lawyer has claimed.

The 58-year-old star - who fronted 'The Wendy Williams Show' for over a decade until 2021 when she stepped down due to her ongoing issues with autoimmune condition Graves disease - is embroiled in a legal battle with Wells Fargo who have frozen her assets and claimed she is ""incapacitated"" - and now her attorney LaShawn Thomas has claimed that they have even denied her the ""right to check her bank balance.""

LaShawn told PageSix: ""The real issue is that Wells Fargo through their adviser refused to grant Wendy access to her own accounts this includes the right to check her balance. No bank should have the authority to do that. No one attempted to gain access to any of Wendy’s accounts. The Wells Fargo adviser and [former manager Bernie Young] were the only people with access. … They left Wendy to die.""

The lawyer added that Wendy - who has 21-year-old son Kevin Jr. with her ex-husband Kevin Hunter but recently tied the knot with New York Police Department officer named Henry - has had to use an American Express credit card for ""all of her living expenses"" and explained that recent reports that her son had charged an ""unauthorised"" $100000 to her card were unfounded because he has been co-ordinating all of her appointments.

He added: ""He coordinated all of her appointments made sure she attended all appointments cooked and cleaned for his mother. He absolutely loves his mother without question and no one should place any blame or allegations of wrongdoing at his feet.""

Back in May Wendy was assigned a financial guardian in order to gain ""access to her millions"".

Wendy previously said: ""Wells Fargo has no questions and answers regarding my money. This is not fair. And Lori Schiller and Wells Fargo

have this guardianship petition about keeping me away from my money. This is not right and this is not fair.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmtidHguY29tLzIwMjIvMDgvMjkvbG9jYWwtYnVzaW5lc3Mtb3duZXItc2hhcmVzLWhvdy1zaGUtd2FzLXNjYW1tZWQtb3V0LW5lYXJseS0yMDAwMC_SAXBodHRwczovL3d3dy5rYnR4LmNvbS8yMDIyLzA4LzI5L2xvY2FsLWJ1c2luZXNzLW93bmVyLXNoYXJlcy1ob3ctc2hlLXdhcy1zY2FtbWVkLW91dC1uZWFybHktMjAwMDAvP291dHB1dFR5cGU9YW1w?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Local business owner shares how she was scammed out of nearly $20000,"COLLEGE STATION Texas (KBTX) - A College Station small business owner says she was scammed out of nearly $20000 and was getting nowhere with her bank until she reached out to KBTX.

Now she’s sharing her experience in hopes of preventing it from it happening to someone else.

“It was on Monday March 7th. I remember it was on a Monday and I opened up my computer at 8:30 a.m. and I saw the e-mail” said Linda Harvell owner and operator of Texas Trading Post an online shop that sells Texas-themed merchandise.

“It was an email from Best Buy’s Geek Squad saying they had renewed my annual subscription for $400.00 and I had already decided I wasn’t going to renew that because I had not used them in several years” said Harvell.

So she called the number in the e-mail and this is where the trouble begins. She was told by a representative named Calvin that he would need access to her computer in order to receive the refund.

Thinking it was legit she said okay.

“All of a sudden the screen starts going 90 miles an hour black black black. All these different levels and then it came on and here’s my bank statement which I did not give him permission. I did not but because I had my password automatically saved on my Wells Fargo account he was able to go in and right in there I saw $19500 being transferred out of my account and I said Calvin what have you done?” Harvell said.

Calvin claimed the transfer was a mistake and asked her to be patient while he corrected it but after several hours passed Harvell began to realize she may have been scammed so she called her bank’s fraud line and that’s where the challenges began with Wells Fargo.

“I waited for an hour and a young lady came on and she said I would need to do a voice verification. I have no idea what that means. What is voice verification? So she said she couldn’t help me unless I had voice verification. I asked to speak with someone else and this went on for quite a while. I waited on the phone for another hour and went through the whole story again and this agent said I needed to go to the local branch. Well by this time it was 5 p.m. and the local branch was closed” said Harvell.

The next morning Harvell went to the Wells Fargo bank on Rock Prairie Road and she said the local staff was very helpful.

“Don Dickinson who was an amazing advocate for this whole process I explained to him what happened. He went in and looked at my account and the wire transfer was still showing as pending. He immediately called the Wells Fargo Corporate Fraud Division and said to put a stop to the pending transfer and they said they would but later in the day I checked my checking account and showed that the transfer had been made” said Harvell.

Harvell showed KBTX e-mails from Wells Fargo that showed the company admitting the wire transfer was “ultimately processed in error” on their end but because Harvell had allowed scammers access to her computer the company said she would be responsible for the money loss. She appealed the decision and each time she did she would receive an e-mail in return saying her case was in review. This went on for five months and each time Harvell said she would speak to a different bank representative who was reading notes about her case that lacked details about what happened.

“I think I had four different claim numbers at one point” she said.

KBTX’s Rusty Surette reached out to Wells Fargo to inquire about the case and ask about the company’s policy in reimbursing customers who had fallen victim to scams.

Within days of us reaching out Harvell had the $19500 reimbursed back into her checking account.

Ty Morrison Assistant Vice President and Lead Communications Specialist for Wells Fargo sent KBTX the following statement: “When a customer notifies us of an issue we conduct a thorough investigation. We regret the inconvenience and stress our customer encountered and apologize for the experience she had. We are pleased that this issue has been resolved for our customer.”

Harvell knows where she messed up and wanted to share her experience to warn others. She says she learned a valuable lesson but was disappointed in the way her longtime bank had treated her case.

“I told them that once this was all over I’d be looking for a new place for my mortgage and my business and bank account” said Harvell.

Wells Fargo sent us additional tips and advice on how to avoid being scammed:

“It’s important for everyone to be vigilant and aware of common scams to avoid falling victim. Be wary of unexpected calls texts social media posts or emails from scammers impersonating tech support companies banks and government agencies. Don’t be afraid to end communication with the person who contacted you and take time to research.”

· Scams are an industry-wide concern and we never want to see anyone become a victim.

· We are actively working to raise awareness of common scams to help prevent these heartbreaking incidents.

· If you send money to a scammer you may not be able to get it back. Wire transfers are an immediate form of payment that deposits money directly into another person’s account and are typically irreversible even if fraud is involved.

· In the case of imposter scams a scammer may impersonate a company representative or a government official and ask the customer to complete a series of steps to authorize an online wire transfer.

· Don’t send money or give your account information to anyone you don’t know or a company you can’t verify as legitimate.

· Don’t allow anyone else to use your device and make sure you have extra layers of security added to your banking and payment apps.

· Wells Fargo has various resources practices and strategies in place to help protect our customers and their accounts. To send an online wire transfer there are multiple authentication steps required before the customer can authorize and then execute the transaction that sends the money to the scammer.

· While we’re seeing success with enhancements we’ve put in place this year to prevent common scams from occurring customer education is still essential to prevent them.

· Our work to prevent scams is a priority and we’re increasing our education efforts through alerts in online banking sessions customer communications and our Online Security Center

Set in a post-apocalypse where humans are besieged by wild robots that very closely resemble dinosaurs and other wildlife Horizon Zero Dawn turned out to be a massive hit in a year full of other excellent games to compete with. Being a new IP it had a lot of work to do between establishing a new world characters gameplay mechanics and more.

Horizon Zero Dawn‘s story is broken into two major components: There are the events that lead up to the world becoming the way it is in the game and the actual plot revolving around protagonist Aloy and her quest. Keeping everything straight is complicated on its own but if you missed some key audio logs got distracted by all the extra activities to do in the open world or just forgot the important beats over the years it might be confusing by the time you get to Horizon Forbidden West. And if you’re confused starting that game you will be totally lost by the end of it so let’s set the record straight by explaining the entire story of Horizon so far.

Note: This should be obvious but we’re about to spoil the entire story of Horizon Zero Dawn and Forbidden West. All major plot points including the ending will be discussed in full.

Project Zero Dawn

Before we get to the present day at least as it is known in Horizon Zero Dawn we first need to go back to the middle of the 21st century to learn what actually happened to turn the world into the state we encounter it in. These lore details are discovered as Aloy explores the world and finds various ancient facilities notes audio logs and other messages to piece together the events of the past.

This is the way the world ends

Our history lesson begins with a man named Ted Faro founder and CEO of the Faro Automated Systems company that specializes in creating A.I. and robots. These robots are not the animal-like ones roaming the world but specialized war robots from a Chariot production line called Peacekeepers. These Peacekeepers were exceptionally effective at killing but Faro a man with no foresight also designed them to run on biomatter for fuel which they could provide for themselves from the environment. Even worse the Horus line of robots could even self replicate indefinitely as long as they had fuel. Oh and he also thought it would be super smart to make sure they had no emergency shut down device and even made their OS nearly unhackable.

In a twist no one could’ve possibly seen coming one of these killer robots glitched in 2064 and stopped accepting commands. From there an entire swarm as they called them of bots stopped taking orders. Faro called in a former partner named Dr. Elisabet Sobeck (who will be very important) to help. Being a bioengineer and roboticist she was able to identify that this swarm had become fully independent beings and were replicating fast.

Now that they were sentient these robots wanted as any creature would to replicate and survive. As we covered as long as these Peacekeepers had fuel they could make more of themselves and as long as there was biomass to consume they could keep expanding their numbers. Dr. Sobeck calculated that the swarm which was already too big a force to combat traditionally would consume all the biomass on the planet in 15 months.

Now dubbed the “Faro Plague” the plan had to shift from stopping it to how life might be preserved at all. That’s when Dr. Sobeck came up with the titular Project Zero Dawn. This project centered around creating a new A.I. named GAIA to live on after the Faro Plague eradicated all life and to cultivate new life in the aftermath. GAIA would have nine subsystems all named after Greek Gods to handle specific aspects of the project. Dr. Sobeck in a move almost as baffling as Faro’s made one called HADES that was in charge of restarting the entire project if anything went wrong.

I’m sure that won’t be a problem later.

Project Zero Dawn was barely finished by the time Faro’s bots had essentially wiped all life off the planet and there wasn’t enough oxygen left to support the few people in hiding. Only the corporate elite Faro Dr. Sobeck and other scientists were able to essentially preserve themselves inside a special bunker. Due to a malfunction though a latch wasn’t secured properly and the Faro bots would be able to locate them. Dr. Sobeck made the ultimate sacrifice and closed the hatch from the outside to make sure the project would survive.

Inside Faro went a little nuts over you know wiping out all life on Earth. In his madness he deleted all the archives of humanity they kept inside the APOLLO subsystem so that when humanity restarted they wouldn’t repeat the same mistakes. Guess he never heard the saying about those who forget the past. After that for good measure he killed off all the surviving members of the Zero Dawn team.

A.I. trouble

Once life was completely wiped out the Faro robots were forced to go into a kind of hibernation state since there was nothing left to use for fuel. For the next century or so GAIA worked on hacking the Peacemaker A.I. and finally was able to shut them down for good. Once that was done the Zero Dawn Project was started and life was seeded back onto the planet’s surface via raising clones. But as things with A.I .always go a problem just kind of appears and GAIA loses control of HADES. HADES decides that the project shouldn’t be started yet and takes over the terraforming controls. To stop him GAIA has to blow up the facility that it and HADES are in.

The terraforming process by the way was making the animal-type machines you encounter in the game. They’re actually the good robots believe it or not.

HADES wasn’t about to go down so easily though. It managed to transfer itself into one of the old Peacekeeper robots which did trap it but at least kept it “alive.” It formulated a new plan to bring back the Faro Plague but stuck as it was couldn’t do it alone and sent out a signal that someone years later would answer.

Welcome to the 31st century

Humanity has come back though it is still in early tribal cultures. Aloy was found as a newborn without parents and deemed an outcast by the Nora tribe’s matriarchs. A man named Rost volunteered to outcast himself as well to raise Aloy becoming her father figure and teaching her all the skills necessary to survive in this wild and dangerous world. While still a child Aloy stumbles — or rather tumbles — into an ancient facility where she finds a device called a Focus. The Focus can let her see in a kind of AR mode communicate with other Focuses and interact with computers.

Rost never told Aloy why she was an outcast or anything about her mysterious origins and only knows that if she can win the Nora coming of age tradition called The Proving she can kind of exploit a loophole around being an outcast and become a Brave. The Proving is basically an obstacle course and combat test. To achieve this goal Aloy trains until she is the right age for the Proving and for the first time is allowed to enter the community. She meets the other teens participating in the Proving most of whom are scumbags and try to sabotage her but that doesn’t really end up mattering since the event is interrupted when another tribe called the Eclipse attacks and kills all the other kids. They’re about to kill Aloy too but Rost comes in and saves her at the cost of his own life.

It turns out the Eclipse are somehow able to control the wild robots and all were wearing Focuses of their own but also were specifically trying to kill Aloy because she looks almost identical to Dr. Sobeck who she gets a glimpse of when she recovers from the attack inside the alter of the All-Mother which is actually a computer system that will only open a passage once all corruption in the land is cleared.

This begins Aloy’s quest to figure out who Dr. Sobeck was what her connection to her is what’s up with the Eclipse controlling machines and what’s behind that big door in the altar. Instead of becoming a Brave or returning to her outcast status Aloy is given the title of Seeker which is one of the few people who are able to freely leave and return to the Nora’s land. Thus the adventure begins.

Aloy’s quest

Two important characters that Aloy meets and teams up with on her journey both wear Focuses. One is named Olin who she meets first after noticing he had a Focus just before the Proving. When she tracks him down after recovering they are ambushed after their Focuses tweak out and she overhears the Eclipse plotting another attack on her. She manages to survive and learns that Olin was responsible for helping the Eclipse ambush the Proving. He did this because they are holding his family hostage but tells Aloy that they’re all taking orders from HADES who recognized Aloy and made her the primary target.

The other character of import is named Sylens. He starts out by guiding Aloy via her Focus through one of the Faro machine stations where she learns all about the world we went over before. After a bunch of lore dumps Aloy goes to multiple locations that Sylens guides her to eventually discovering that Aloy is actually a clone of Dr. Sobeck which is why she is granted access to so many of these facilities that no one else could enter. This is also why HADES is so intent on killing her.

After all this Aloy also learns some hard truths about Sylens. He was not only the former leader of the Eclipse but had been working directly with HADES. Remember that signal it sent out after trapping itself in a robot? Sylens was the one who eventually answered it. Their relationship soured when HADES tried to kill Sylens and he’s since decided that stopping the genocidal A.I. is a better plan.

Because of her genetic code Aloy is the only one who can access something called the Master Override. This is the only thing that can defeat HADES located in a place called GAIA Prime. She gets the final bits of lore exploring this site eventually getting the Master Override and has Sylens fashion it onto her staff so she can stab HADES with it before it now reactivated by Eclipse can reach an antenna called The Spire to reawaken all the old Faro killer robots again.

The climactic battle includes all the different tribes and groups Aloy met through her adventure which we completely glossed over since they weren’t super essential to the plot taking down HADES and the Eclipse. Aloy kills the Eclipse leader uses the Master Override to deactivate HADES and prevents all the bad robots from waking up. The day is saved!

Going west

Once the world is no longer in immediate danger and now knowing who she is Aloy decides to start traveling west to where the original Dr. Sobeck died. She finds her body (don’t ask how it’s still there after hundreds of years) in a spacesuit. Touching the helmet projects an image of her face and Aloy takes a locket she wore before sitting in silence for a while.

Meanwhile post-credits we get a scene of some people picking around the old HADES corpse. While they’re gathering scrap a light shoots out of the body. It travels across the sky and … arrives at Sylens who has some sort of A.I. receptacle that HADES is now stored in. He says he still has things he wants to learn from HADES including who or what was caused HADES to go rogue.

Six months later Aloy has been looking for any signs of a GAIA backup to help continue restoring the planet’s ecosystem. Having no luck Sylens gives Aloy a tip to go to the Forbidden West to look there which doesn’t sound at all like a trap. Not seeing a reason not to go to a place called the Forbidden West Aloy heads over to find a whole new set of warring tribes. While getting involved in all the new politics Aloy actually manages to find HADES delete it and recover a GAIA backup. Score!

That is until another new group of future humans with sci-fi tech including another clone of Sobeck named Beta who is identical to Aloy also grabs a GAIA backup for themselves. This GAIA Aloy got isn’t complete though and she has to go around recovering its subsystems. In the process she finds Beta and learns that she’s part of the Far Zenith who are a group of colonists that escaped Earth during the robot uprising and have the technology to basically live forever. They’re back on Earth to use GAIA to recolonize.

Some more tribal politics go down with Aloy taking down one leader to end the kind of annoying war and then focuses on stopping Far Zenith. Aloy and her new friends attack their base with even Sylens lending a hand to disable their tech and she learns that Far Zenith were actually running from something else called Nemesis. This was a botched experiment they had to upload their consciousnesses into digital form that like everything it seems went rogue. But Nemesis is also on the way to Earth to destroy it so there’s that problem now too. Even Sylens is super scared of Nemesis and decides to join up with Aloy to try and stop it and they all spread a warning about the coming threat.

Akshaya Patra a non-profit organization runs the world’s largest mid-day meal program in collaboration with 14 state governments in India. It serves nutritious mid-day meals to 1.8 million government school kids six days a week.

Siva Sivaram chairman of Akshaya Patra USA told India Currents: “ Its good to see people back in 3D. Both in India and in the US we are doing a lot. In US Akshaya Patra is going from being a concentrated West Coast-East Coast oriented high network individual based to truly a grassroots organization. We have over 60 chapters across the US. We are seeing young people getting involved and its very gratifying to see that Akshya Patra is truly becoming a grassroots organization.”

Sivaram is president of Silicon Technology of Western Digital Corp Technology and Strategy.

“During the Covid pandemic we could not serve in the kitchens in India but we continued to distribute boxes of uncooked meals to the children and their families” said Sivaram. “Now the existing kitchens are ramping up rapidly and new kitchens are expanding everywhere. From Andhra Pradesh to Assam a whole spade of kitchens are coming up. We will have the capacity of reaching two million children very very quickly.”

“The concern from commitment to the cause is that we cannot fail a child and we have to ensure that there is ongoing funding for the various initiatives” he added.

Experimentation on the size of the kitchens is in the works and smaller sized kitchens that are hybrid in their functioning is happening noted Sivaram.

Local people especially women partaking in the final part of meal preparation to cook to cater to local palates is the principle behind this pilot. Greater demand from state governments in India also shows the success of the program. And the recent inauguration of the Varanasi kitchen by Prime Minister Modi is a big accolade for the non-profit that prides in maintaining highest quality standards in meal preparations.

Speaking about another pilot in the state of Tamil Nadu where it was not easy for the non profit to penetrate because of politics Sivaram said that it is very gratifying to see that not only has the state government opened to the non profit but has also endorsed a new program of providing nutritious breakfasts instead of lunch as the meal for young children.

“The mid day meal program in Tamil Nadu had become moribund and the breakfast pilot is an attempt to bring back the true spirit of providing a hearty and healthy meal to the youngsters before they can begin their school day” added Sivaram.

Later while addressing the gathering he said: “Akshaya Patra is a passion project for us. Its not just another charity where you can give but something that comes from the heart. With $20 you can feed a child for a whole year.”

“We aim to reach 5 million children by 2025 and we cannot fail the big asset that India has: its children. India is a nation of great contrasts. Akshaya Patra runs as an enterprise with the heart of a non profit.

“Outside of India the US is the biggest contributor of Akshya Patra and Bay Area is the biggest region in the US in terms of contributions. We wish to continue being that beacon of hope for the children of India” said Sivaram.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXGh0dHBzOi8vbXlicm9hZGJhbmQuY28uemEvbmV3cy9oYXJkd2FyZS80NTc4NzUtbW9zdC1yZWxpYWJsZS1oYXJkLWRyaXZlcy1pbi10aGUtd29ybGQtMi5odG1s0gFgaHR0cHM6Ly9teWJyb2FkYmFuZC5jby56YS9uZXdzL2hhcmR3YXJlLzQ1Nzg3NS1tb3N0LXJlbGlhYmxlLWhhcmQtZHJpdmVzLWluLXRoZS13b3JsZC0yLmh0bWwvYW1w?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Most reliable hard drives in the world,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://mybroadband.co.za/news/hardware/457875-most-reliable-hard-drives-in-the-world-2.html on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXGh0dHBzOi8vbXlicm9hZGJhbmQuY28uemEvbmV3cy9oYXJkd2FyZS80NTc4NzUtbW9zdC1yZWxpYWJsZS1oYXJkLWRyaXZlcy1pbi10aGUtd29ybGQtMi5odG1s0gFgaHR0cHM6Ly9teWJyb2FkYmFuZC5jby56YS9uZXdzL2hhcmR3YXJlLzQ1Nzg3NS1tb3N0LXJlbGlhYmxlLWhhcmQtZHJpdmVzLWluLXRoZS13b3JsZC0yLmh0bWwvYW1w?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNjcmVlbndlc3QuY29tLmF1L25ld3MvbGF0ZXN0LW5ld3MvMjBtLXdhLXByb2R1Y3Rpb24tYXR0cmFjdGlvbi1pbmNlbnRpdmUtbm93LW9wZW4tZm9yLWJ1c2luZXNzL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,$20M WA Production Attraction Incentive now open for business,"$20M WA Production Attraction Incentive now open for business

When we say tennis player it involves men and women.

Serena has 23 Grand Slams one more than Rafael Nadal two and three more than Nole and Roger Federer.

However Serena Williams announced she was quitting tennis to attend all her business ventures.

ho wouldn't want to be Steve Jobs or Earl Bakken building their Apple and Medtronic startups in garages and becoming the unicorns of their industries?

But in a day and age when founders must sell themselves more than ever — on social media in front of investors pitching customers — running a startup isn't as romantic as it may seem even when your business succeeds. And only about half of businesses started in Minnesota in 2013 were still active five years later according to Bureau of Labor Statistics data.

Still entrepreneurship is a challenge more and more people in the Twin Cities are taking on. Business formations are at a decade high. San Francisco's Startup Genome a policy and research organization ranks Minneapolis-St. Paul fourth on its list of the top 100 emerging startup ecosystems in the world and second in the U.S. behind Detroit.

Take Georgia Fort who went into business for herself because it was her best chance to stay in journalism in the Twin Cities. Or Elyse Ash who started a company because she saw a way to support couples going through infertility like her family did.

Even when you're successful it's hard and risky to continually push your own vision — especially when you're young.

""You hear about contracts or funding rounds but you don't hear about layoffs and stress"" said Stephanie Rich head of platform at Bread & Butter Ventures a Minneapolis venture capital firm. ""For every win there's a struggle to get there.""

When Ash started Fruitful Fertility a free mentorship matching network for couples with infertility issues the business took off. The St. Paul resident raised thousands of dollars in capital from angel investors as more than 6000 people started using the platform.

In the process she became somewhat of a darling on the local startup scene — featured on industry panels lauded for her innovation picked as a rising entrepreneur.

Then the pandemic hit colliding with dents in her business model. The business dissolved in 2021 and she returned 75% of investors' money.

""It was like ""If I'm not this person then who am I?'"" she said.

Ultimately Ash decided to stay in the entrepreneurial ecosphere but by working for Cloudburst a Minneapolis tech product and development services company for startups.

Her experience is a common one. Most entrepreneurs succeed after multiple tries and multiple mistakes buffeted by unexpected economic changes evolving business models or the doubts of naysayers and skeptics.

Reed Robinson — who now invests in startup companies in Minnesota through his early-stage investment firm Groove Capital and is the former head of the BetaMN startup organization — knows firsthand the uphill battle entrepreneurs face.

In 2011 at 27 and with a new MBA in his hand Robinson and his partners formed Heroic a marketplace that let homeowners share recommendations of local service providers. The process of building the company was a high.

Being an entrepreneur ""is a disease and I don't mean that in a negative way"" he said.

Over an 18-month period Reed and his co-founders built the website while raising nearly $200000 from investors.

Then the business started unraveling. Investors suggested ideas and new business models and the co-founders started moving in too many directions. Eventually enthusiasm faded and the company dissolved in 2013. But not before being sued by a rival company.

""You want to adjust to the market based on what you're learning but if it's too malleable and it changes over time people lose track of who you are and what you do and you might not be giving yourself the time that is required for the customer or market to understand who you are and why you're different"" Robinson said.

Elyse Ash works with Cloudburst a tech product and development services firm for startups after running a startup herself.

'I think I caught a bubble'

Jeremy Segal started his discount clothing and equipment business Proozy as Lyons Golf when he was a teenager. The idea has always been to find a marketplace for clothing and gear.

At first it was brick and mortar stores. Then at age 20 he started convincing clothing makers that had always sold to department stores to diversify and sell some merchandise online.

""I think I caught a bubble before it was about to happen"" Segal now 37 said. ""They never understood those types of quantities can be sold online.""

A few years later it was selling to customers using Amazon or Groupon.

Then he made another big decision in 2015 — and not a popular one Segal said. He decided Proozy needed to create a direct-to-consumer website.

""Nobody liked the decision because we already had a huge Amazon business"" he said. ""The only way to build a business at scale would be to do it on our own site with our own customers.""

But again the pivot allowed the Eagan-based business to grow. It now employs 100 and by the end of 2023 should hit $120 million in sales Segal said.

The confidence to take big risks and stand by your decisions worked for Segal but it does not mean it was easy especially when he was 20 and across the table from people two to three times his age.

Reed Robinson invests in startup companies in Minnesota through his early-stage investment firm Groove Capital.

Capitalizing on change

Atif Siddiqi co-founder and CEO of Minneapolis-based fintech company Branch can relate. He was working at Time Warner in Los Angeles when he felt an urge to do more than observe how smartphones were changing how people operated their lives.

""I saw these big paradigm shifts"" he said. ""I wanted to be able to capitalize on some of these shifts.""

At 28 Siddiqi started his first tech company which he sold less than two years after creating. He then launched and sold another.

He had some heady experience when he started Branch in 2015. Still he participated in a Minneapolis startup accelerator — and realized the best way for his newest company to grow was to move it to the Twin Cities. This company also took a longer-term commitment to build carefully adding new services that would attract bigger customers.

Branch allows companies to accelerate payments to their workers or receive tips digitally. It also now offers a zero-fee bank account through a partnership and a debit cards.

So far Siddiqi has raised $133 million from investors as Branch continues building a customer base that now numbers 400 including Uber Freights and Walmart's Spark delivery platform.

Like Segal with Proozy though Siddiqi had to develop a strong backbone because he not only was changing how people were getting paid but disrupting the pay cycle.

""We challenged the status quo of what it means to get paid and when"" Siddiqi said.

Jeremy Segal started his discount clothing and equipment business Proozy as Lyons Golf when he was a teenager.

'Here's the blueprint'

Branch has competitors in the space. And so does broadcast journalist Fort as she develops a model of telling news through social media.

Fort started Blck Press in August 2020 after she applied for broadcast jobs all over the Twin Cities and didn't get any. She had experience and she had confidence people wanted to see her stories.

Fort 34 started her own business to stay in journalism but she has found the freedom to build a company that reflects her values as a biracial woman who wants to tell stories about the Black community. She also want her company to be more equitable.

""You can publish your scripts in a way that's authentic to you and your culture and not conform to AP [Stylebook of] standard English"" she said. ""You can wear your hair the way it naturally grows out of your head and be on camera and not have your bosses tell you it's a violation of your contract and here's how you do it. Here's the blueprint.""

In the process her team has found all kinds of ways to be creative. Sometimes a photo tells the story. Sometimes it's raw video. Sometimes it's closer to a TV news segment. She now has roughly 200000 followers on channels like Facebook and TikTok.

The first year she operated on a shoestring having won some grants. She thought she had to create a whole new business model as she built a news business on social media and admits she wasted time doing so. In the end she has settled on a sponsorship/subscription model similar to newspapers and magazines and also would like to build a financial model to share stories with traditional TV outlets and get paid for them instead of freelancing for the stations.

The somewhat organized chaos of the first few years has given Fort and her team a seat at the table with sources. ""It [also] has given me the confidence to cultivate the next generation of independent journalists and say the game has changed.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFya2Fuc2Fzb25saW5lLmNvbS9uZXdzLzIwMjIvYXVnLzI3L3BhaW50LWV4cGVydHMtcHJlZGljdC10aGUtaW4tY29sb3JzLWZvci0yMDIzL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Paint experts predict the 'in' colors for 2023 | Arkansas Democrat Gazette,"



Pick a color any color. It's COTY Time. Every year about now top paint companies announce their Color of The Year their best guess at what the ""in"" color is about to be.

Start the drumroll.

While I don't believe for a minute that these announcements are much more than a public relations ploy to make consumers think about color and maybe buy paint which they do or these companies wouldn't keep doing this and while I have never actually gone out and painted a room in my home one of the anointed colors I love to look. The color experts' choices help me tune into how colors move in and out of style. And colors do move.

The first COTY announcement came earlier this month when HGTV Home by Sherwin-Williams picked ""Darkroom"" (HGSW 7083) a black with a purple undertone. Among the words the accompanying news release used to describe it were ""alluring"" ""classic"" and ""modernly retro for the throw-back inspired aesthetic."" My Darkroom reaction: Uhh maybe if I were doing a home for Morticia Addams.

A week later Glidden Paint by PPG pronounced Vining Ivy (PPG1148-6) a bluish-green tone as its 2023 COTY. ""Consumers are seeking to simplify in this post-covid era as the past two years have shed a new light on the importance of serenity and little moments"" said Ashley McCollum Glidden color expert in the news release. ""Vining Ivy embodies this vibe perfectly.""

I'm not sure what teal has to do with little moments but I prefer Vining Ivy to Darkroom.

A few days later the Sherwin-Williams 2023 Colormix Forecast came out. Don't confuse like I did HGTV Home by Sherwin-Williams a product line sold at Lowe's with the broader Sherwin-Williams brand which sells its paints through Sherwin-Williams stores and has its own COTY. As if color weren't complicated enough.

Sherwin-Williams named its 2023 Colormix Forecast Terra ""because it's about nature and our connection to earth as humans."" OK if you say so. The forecast features 40 colors divided into four curated palettes from which the company's COTY will emerge in late September said Sue Wadden the brand's director of color marketing.

Every year color forecasters from around the world meet to discuss what is going on globally ─ socially artistically politically ─ then predict what hues consumers will have a hankering for. For 2023 top picks include HGTV Home by Sherwin Williams Darkroom (HGSW 7083). (Courtesy of Sherwin-Williams)

I try to get her to spill which paint color she's leaning toward but all she'll say is that it's on the warm side. Well that narrows it down.

However what I really want to know from this woman who thinks about color all day every day and travels the world to observe color then talks to others who do the same besides how to get a job like that was not the color of the moment of the day or of the year but rather color trends for the long term like say the next 10 years.

In other words don't give me your flash-in-the-pan-fun-for-a-second color but colors we can count on reliably design around.

So I grabbed a cup of coffee and asked Wadden all the questions I selfishly wanted to know:

Marni: For those of us homeowners who want to make interior design choices that have staying power which colors should we walk away from and toward?

Wadden: Walk away from gray. I'm not saying gray is bad but it has had a really long cycle and the natural evolution is to move away. Walk toward warmer neutrals that have a little range like bone beige and greige. Go toward natural earth tones like terracotta and sand. Run toward brown.

Dark grayed-out purples and rich plums especially alongside super light tinted shades will be important. But the strongest color of the future is green.

Marni: What is having the biggest influence on color trends now?

Wadden: The opening up of our world post pandemic. After months of lock down and restricted travel we crave nature. We're moving toward darker colors. We're not painting everything white and gray anymore.

Marni: Kitchens are such an investment a place where you really want a look that lasts. What do you recommend there?

Wadden: On counters we're not seeing much outside of white or creamy white but we are getting away from kitchens that are white counters on white or gray cabinets. I always like the tuxedo look light counters over dark cabinets in timeless colors like carbon gray deep blue or forest green.

Marni: What color advice can you give all those who have gray on gray homes? How can they move on with color?

Wadden: They don't have to change everything out. They can look to the color trends as an opportunity to introduce a fresh color maybe a vibrant yellow in new seat cushions accent plates and fabrics to balance out the grays.

It’s not like Williams to leave the spotlight. She’s been involved in a ton of fashion/business/NFL and movie-production ventures. In her Vogue magazine announcement she said she would “evolve away from tennis’’ — not retire.

Richard Williams Serena’s father who is no longer is in the public eye because of his ailing health told The Post multiple times in the early 2000s that Serena and Venus would retire from tennis sooner than later because they had too many other ambitions. He said his girls were too cerebral to knock the tennis ball around into their 30s.

Papa Williams’ prediction on that one proved astray with Serena playing until weeks before her 41st birthday. The 42-year-old Venus whose Grand Slam production got stalled by Sjogren’s Syndrome is entered into this year’s Open draw.

“She’s never been one to be really into the politics of the game’’ tennis great Chris Evert of ESPN said of Serena. “So I don’t envision her really around tournaments. I think maybe having another child. I think she wants to spend more time at home with her husband. I think she’s into entrepreneurship. She has a lot of businesses away from tennis. I don’t think she’s going to be as visible in tennis as she is outside of tennis.’’

Serena pulled her Greta Garbo act and didn’t attend U.S. Open media day on Friday. Instead she appeared this week on a “Today’’ show panel where she gave herself a tiny out — perhaps in case she pulls a Queens miracle and wins a record-tying 24th Grand Slam title. Williams who hasn’t won a major since 2017 faces 80th ranked Danka Kovinic on Monday night at what will be a rollicking Ashe Stadium.

“I mean I don’t know I think so’’ Williams said when asked if she’s definitely done after Flushing. “But who knows. I don’t think [I’d play Australian Open] but you never know. I’ve learned in my career never say never.’’

Asked if it would be tough not to have broken the Grand Slam record as she seemed destined to do Williams said “I’ve already broken the record. I’ve never dreamt of having this many Grand Slam titles. I thought I‘d play tennis and win one Grand Slam or two. For me it’s a bonus.

“This whole journey is going to be emotional’’ Serena added. “I love what I do. It’s not about not loving my job. I’ve played it my whole entire life. It’s very emotional to evolve into something new.’’

Serena Venus and their sister Isha Price were executive producers of the award-winning “King Richard’’ movie that detailed their childhood. The movie ended as Venus turned pro at the 1997 U.S. Open 25 years ago. Serena has indicated a sequel is in store detailing the divergent pro careers of the iconic sisters.

That could be her only attachment to tennis in retirement.

“I just believe and hope that if she is able to stay around the sport in some way’’ Rafael Nadal said. “It’s going to be great for our sport because I always believe that the sports are bigger when the legends of our sport are around the sport no?”

She’s already been the driving force to so many of the young stars who talk being in awe and tongue-tied around her in the locker room.

Naomi Osaka said Saturday she cried the day before Williams’ Vogue announcement after watching her lose in Toronto earlier this month. Osaka sensed the end was near.

“For some reason I just started crying because I felt it’’ Osaka said. “Then she announced it the day later. I’m like ‘Oh my God this is what devastation must feel like.’ ”

A two-time Open champion Osaka recognizes Serena transcends tennis — which bodes well for her being visible after this tennis swan song.

She’s reportedly invested in 60 start-ups with her firm Serena Ventures. The Palm Beach Gardens Fla. resident is part-owner of the Miami Dolphins and women’s soccer team Angel City in Los Angeles. She said in Vogue investing in women-run companies is a priority and plans to come out with a new book about her daughter’s doll named Qai Qai.

“Business-wise she’s very into tech so whoever follows that I think it will clearly be under her influence’’ Osaka said. “Culturally and style-wise she was the first one to have her own line and stuff like that. There’s definitely been a lot of barriers that I’m sure she had to fight to break down.

“I know she didn’t call it a retirement she called it like an evolution which I think is really cool’’ Osaka added. “I feel like the term ‘retirement’ kind of means an end to something.

However based on the latest interview that Williams conducted it sounds like she may not be leaving the tennis court forever.

As reported by People Williams was a part of the “Conversation with Champions” panel alongside her sister Venus this past Thursday. And while there Williams was asked by the Today show's Sheinelle Jones if the US Open would be her final professional tournament.

“I mean I don't know” Williams admitted. “I think so but who knows?” She then added “You never know. I've learned in my career never say never. So that's important.”"

But there’s a catch that goes unmentioned. And it’s a big one. The land that’s up for sale on the Mystic River in Everett sits in a designated port area limiting what could go there to water-dependent industrial operations. Translation: None of the advertised uses are allowed there today.

The Mystic Station marketing brochure describes the 45-acre power plant property as a “transformational development opportunity” on Boston’s doorstep — with room for labs offices multifamily housing stores and maybe even a hotel or two.

With a possible New England Revolution soccer stadium in mind House leaders last month adopted language in their economic development bill to exempt the Mystic site from DPA restrictions. The Kraft Group has long sought a standalone home for the Revs in Greater Boston separate from Gillette Stadium in Foxborough and the Mystic site has been a rumored contender for several years.

The Conservation Law Foundation went to war after the “soccer stadium amendment” came to light lobbying against what the group called a last-minute backroom deal that could undermine the local maritime economy; CLF also blasted language that would exempt the property from construction limits under the state’s Chapter 91 law governing tidelands. Time ran out on formal sessions before the House and Senate could reach an agreement on the broader economic development bill.

The fate of that bill — a $4 billion-plus potpourri of tax cuts and economic-related program funds — remains up in the air. As a result so is this key piece of Everett’s riverfront renaissance. And the entire debate underscores pressing questions about our old industrial waterfronts and how they should evolve.

At Mystic a viable mixed-use project might be possible under Chapter 91 tidelands rules. But the DPA issue could be a deal breaker potentially preventing anything from getting built.

That wouldn’t sit well with Everett Mayor Carlo DeMaria. Along with Wynn Resorts executives DeMaria wants the site to become an entertainment and hospitality destination to complement the $2.6 billion casino that Wynn opened across the street in 2019 and the related development the company is pursuing along Broadway. A Revs stadium would fit perfectly with that vision. City officials last year gave themselves the authority to take this site from plant owner Exelon — now Constellation an Exelon spinoff — by eminent domain if necessary.

The eminent-domain threat forced Constellation’s hand prompting it to hire brokerage CBRE to market the 45 acres. It no longer uses its shuttered turbines there though Eversource has an easement to operate a switchyard; another section is essentially water undevelopable. Not included are two natural-gas fired units next door. Constellation gets special payments to keep those two going because of their importance to New England’s grid until the spring of 2024. Then what remains of this decades-old power plant closes for good.

All a Constellation spokesman would say is that the company hopes to conclude the sale by year’s end with Everett’s redevelopment plan in mind.

It’s in this context that the House leaders tucked the Everett language into the back of their economic development bill. Down-to-the-wire negotiations with the Senate got sidetracked by an unexpected revelation that the state may need to budget for nearly $3 billion in income tax credits. But the bill is not dead by any means.

Legislative leaders are waiting for clarity on the exact cost of those credits. They could choose to pass much of the bill in an informal session when roll calls can’t be taken. Controversial items like this Everett language are generally avoided in informal sessions because a single lawmaker can block a bill.

With CLF watching closely it’s unlikely the Everett language could survive in an informal session. From CLF’s perspective maintaining the state’s port infrastructure is crucial. Once an industrial port makes way for high-end development CLF’s Deanna Moran argues it’s gone for good. CLF doesn’t want oil tanks and dirty power plants either. But Moran said these properties could be ideal for “blue-tech” and clean-energy uses like the wind-farm work planned for Salem’s waterfront.

Legislators are only expected to meet in informal sessions until January but it’s possible they could be called back for a rare special formal session to wrap up the tax cuts bonding proposals and other goodies in the bill. In a formal session the Everett measure might very well make it through.

While there is precedent for removing properties from DPAs through legislation Mystic Station’s road to redevelopment becomes considerably longer without State House help. The next option: ask the state’s Coastal Zone Management office for a formal DPA boundary review. The agency is currently reviewing such requests for two different areas in East Boston. One is led by warehouse developer Jacob Citrin who wants to remove several industrial parcels on Route 1A from a port area. The second is being pursued by the Boston Planning & Development Agency and involves properties in and around Central Square.

This route can be lengthy — no less than six months and often much longer. Citrin said he applied more than two years ago and expects the final decision next month; BPDA initiated its request in early 2020. But in the case of the Mystic parcel land-use experts say DPA regulations probably wouldn’t offer enough leeway to remove it from its respective port area anyway.

Another possible path is even more circuitous but could prove beneficial in the long run: rewriting the DPA rules. The system established in the 1970s is seen by many as anachronistic. State environmental regulators would include many waterfront stakeholders in that process — environmental groups property owners municipal officials. Julie Wormser of the Mystic River Watershed Association sees this as the best possible outcome: a robust regional conversation about updating the DPAs instead of dealing with them on a piecemeal basis.

The fight for the future of this power-plant land might end up not only being about bringing relief to Revs fans who have long hoped for a soccer stadium to call their own. It could end up being about the kind of future we want for the industrial waterfronts in and around Boston and what it will take to get there.

August 27 2022 Matt Hansen Live Reporting Executive

The World Poker Tour (WPT) is in Los Angeles for one of the most prestigious stops on the poker calendar all year with the return of Legends of Poker at the Parkwest Bicycle Hotel and Casino. It’s the fifth leg on the 2022 Main Tour for WPT and the $5300 Main Event offers a $2.5 million guarantee with three opening flights.

Day 1a kicked off on Saturday at 12 p.m. local time and steadily grew to 136 players over the course of the opening flight. Some of poker’s biggest names were there early including Shawn Daniels Mike Liang John Smith and Giuseppe Pantaleo who went on a run to grab the chip lead at the end of the day.

Other players to jump in throughout the day included WPT Deepstacks champion Maria Ho Andrew Moreno Katie Lindsay and high-stakes regular Bill Klein. Phil Hellmuth also took his seat in the later stages of the evening.

The reigning champion is Aaron Van Blarcum who outlasted 520 players to win $474390 in 2019. That tournament featured a $2 million guarantee and the field generated a total prize pool of $2392000. The 2022 edition is the return of the Legends of Poker to Parkwest Bicycle Hotel and Casino.

Jordison’s Heater Continues

It has quickly turned into Angela Jordison’s year in poker and she showed no sign of slowing down in the opening flight. After chipping up and sitting among the leaders from the early portion of the day she finished with just over 200000 in her bag for Day 2.

Jordison has had several high points in 2022 the highest of which may have been when she took home over $150000 for her third-place finish in the $1000 Freezeout at the WSOP. It was her second of five live cashes in the series and she capped off her Summer with a run to 175th in the Main Event.

Meanwhile the red-hot run didn’t stop in Vegas and Jordison has continued to hit the payout window in a big way. She finished fifth at MSPT Iowa and picked up two more final tables at WSOPC North Carolina before she won the $1100 tournament here at Legends of Poker for a share of the $500000 guarantee.

The Colorado Public Utilities Commission approved Xcel Energy's plan to close Comanche 3 by 2031 earlier this month.

Tens of millions in annual property taxes will continue to flow to 25 local taxing entities for a decade after the plant closes offsetting the economic impact of the shuttered plant.

Xcel Energy will also be incentivized to build new energy facilities in Pueblo under the agreement: If the company builds new facilities the property taxes from the new projects would reduce the overall amount that the utility is obligated to pay under the settlement.

Pueblo already has the infrastructure and federal permits in place to support the development of new alternative energy production Pueblo County Commissioner Garrison Ortiz told The Chieftain.

The new facilities would supplement the Pueblo area’s tax base for decades beyond the timeframe of the settlement agreement; payments are only required through 2040.

Pueblo politics:Broadband question coming to Pueblo ballots in November

A spokesperson from Xcel Energy Michelle Aguayo said the company’s long-term goal is to transition away from coal-fired power generation over the next decade and use more wind and solar energy. The location of the new projects will be determined through a competitive bid process Aguayo said in an email to The Chieftain.

Ortiz said at a press conference on Wednesday that Xcel will need to file a just transition plan for electric resources by June 2024.

“This could mean over a billion of dollars of clean energy investment within our community” Ortiz said.

Pueblo County’s attorney Francis Koncilja mentioned at the press conference that the current technology for storing renewable energy on batteries is not adequate enough to power the entire grid.

“Battery storage is in its infancy right now. It doesn't store as much as you need to run a system that big. Comanche 3 has been the backbone of keeping the lights on in this state for a long time” Koncilja said.

Comanche 3 contributes to approximately 10% of the state’s power grid at peak hours Aguayo said.

Other fossil-fuel-free energy sources such as nuclear natural gas and hydrogen power have been discussed as alternatives to Comanche 3 but nothing has been decided.

All of the property tax revenue that would have been collected on Comanche 3 which is approximately $30 million per year will be paid to Pueblo County starting in 2031 Ortiz said. The county will redistribute the funds to the other local entities.

Xcel’s property taxes are the “lion’s share” of funding for the 1A ballot initiative voters approved in 2016 which is contributing to projects around the city and county from the extension of Joe Martinez Boulevard to planning for passenger rail service to Pueblo.

Xcel Energy first submitted a plan to the Colorado Public Utilities Commission in March 2021 to close Comanche 3. Pueblo County intervened in the process to offset the anticipated economic impact to the area with the loss of the property tax revenue.

“Climate change is an existential threat. You only need to look at the floods the droughts the extreme heat and know that we have a problem and we have to solve it” Koncilja said.

Ortiz mentioned that Gov. Jared Polis’ office was involved in the negotiations through the Colorado Energy Office.

“Ensuring that funds for Pueblo aren’t impacted until 2040 is critical to fund services in Pueblo and allow time for other successful businesses including renewable energy to create even more good jobs and grow revenue” a spokesperson from Polis’ office wrote in a statement.

The storms brought gusty winds over a wide area. One gust measured at 61 mph at the State Fair Grandstand — as well as torrential rain that caused street flooding.

Just before 9 p.m. fair officials tweeted that the Grandstand show — The Current's Music On-A-Stick featuring headliner Portugal. The Man — was paused as the storms approached. Officials urged fairgoers to seek shelter.

As downpours started to cause street flooding on the fairgrounds fair officials announced that the remainder of the concert had been canceled.

In a statement Sunday Fair officials said rides were operating normally and the grounds opened as usual. They said attendees should check the Fair’s Twitter account and website for updates.

Elsewhere in the Twin Cities there was a report of trees down and blocking a street near Maplewood as the storms passed through around 9 p.m. as well as a report of hailstones bigger than quarters in Little Canada.

There also were reports of trees and large branches down in Coon Rapids Lakeville Eagan and Apple Valley — where there was a report of a tree that fell on a home.

Xcel Energy reported more than 27000 customers without power in its Minnesota service area in the wake of the storms. That number was down to about 8500 homes and businesses as of 7:30 a.m. Sunday.

The Minnesota Valley Electric Cooperative reported more than 1000 customers without power immediately after the storms and the Dakota Electric Association reported more than 800.

A cold front forecast to sweep across the region may produce more showers and storms on Sunday afternoon and evening and the Weather Service says some of those may be severe.

The National Weather Service Twin Cities tweeted Sunday that there was evidence of tornado damage in southern Ramsey County. It said that additional brief tornadoes occurred in Dakota County in Burnsville Apple Valley Eagan and West St. Paul.

NWS said Sunday afternoon it was still trying to determine if there was any tornado damage from the storm in the southeastern portion of the Metro.

Some areas also received hail the weather service reported.

‘IT CAME IN A WAVE’

It’s no surprise that David Terry was at the fair Saturday night when the storm hit.

Terry a cross country coach for North High School in St. Paul looks forward to the fair every year and goes every day it’s open. He calls it the “Twelve days of Christmas.”

On Saturday night he was drinking his honey lemonade he said when word spread that there was a possible tornado heading their way. Up until that point there had been a few sprinkles of rain drops but nothing significant he said.

However when word spread of the severe weather threat he began to head for the exit.

But so did everybody else.

It was crowded and he quickly realized they were not going to escape the weather.

By the time he got to the area near the buses the storm hit.

“I saw it coming … I knew right away ‘We’re not going to outrun that’ ” he said Sunday. “It came in a wave. The rain hit you sideways.”

He was close enough to jump on a bus when he saw that a dozen people were huddled under a canopy that looked as if it was about to collapse.

“You wonder in certain situations how you would react” he said.

As a coach he said he is always trying to teach the kids he coaches the importance of having character. Because of that he knows he can’t just talk the talk but has to walk the walk.

His reaction was to run straight for the canopy and grab one of the metal bars supporting it. He was clinging to it with everything he had and the wind was trying to win the battle when another man whom Terry described as larger and taller and stronger came and grabbed the other metal bar supporting the canopy.

The two men stood in the rain getting soaked battling to keep the canopy from blowing away or collapsing he said. They also didn’t know if the storm was going to get worse so he knew the other people needed to stay under shelter.

“We were getting the full onslaught” he said. “You couldn’t let go.”

The wind was fierce but the two men managed to keep the canopy upright until the worst of the storm passed which was about 15 minutes.

The canopy had survived. And he did too he said joking “I didn’t fly off with it.”

‘JUST SECONDS’

Brook D. Carl and her group were on the Ferris wheel as the storm started.

“The phones showed us weather alerts just seconds before we got on so we thought we would have time” Carl pictured here in the middle said in an email to the Pioneer Press. “We were wrong.”

It was scary.

“The second go round I was trying keep calm as I pictured the whole works blowing over” she wrote.

After they exited the Ferris wheel it was time to find a safe place.

“We got off and ran to shelter next to a building under the roof overhang” Carl wrote. “Then when rain let up we went to the 4-H building to find my brother. Then to O’Gara’s for a drink and started the walk home.”

Fortunately their luck turned when a friend gave them a ride when they were halfway to her home near Como Park Carl says.

STORM CRASHES THE CONCERT

“We were in the Grandstand waiting for the headliner to come out” writes Steve Anderson in an email to the Pioneer Press. “Right as the opener finished their set they announced to the crowd that they had heard through their headset that the rest of the show had been canceled and they didn’t know any more info.

“Then the screens came on with a recorded severe weather warning and told everyone to immediately seek shelter in the Grandstand so we headed in just before the rain came pouring down.

“Most of the vendors in the Grandstand were just closing or had already closed but the ones that were still open got a busy final rush from the people that had to come in from the show. We ourselves spent over $100 on vendors there that we wouldn’t have if the show had continued.

“At the entrance to the Grandstand right by the fresh corn vendor the water had pooled and was at least knee deep which is where I recorded (this) video.

“Been going to the fair for 35 years and that was the first time I’ve been there during a storm so it was a pretty unique experience.”

‘GREAT MINNESOTA WET TOGETHER’

A KSTP meteorologist and self-described “tornado spotter” thought he saw a possible tornado according to a tweet.

Someone else tweeted he saw “a tree or two down” near that area.

Flooding created a small river at the Fairgrounds after lightning flashed nonstop overhead in what one person tweeted was the Great Minnesota Wet Together.

According to Xcel Energy the storm caused numerous power failures. The company spent the weekend restoring power to thousands of customers.

As of Monday afternoon just after 2 p.m. approximately 700 of Xcel’s customers were still without power in the extended Twin Cities metro according to the utility company. Look at Xcel’s power failure map at outagemap-xcelenergy.com/outagemap/?state=MN."

When it comes to food Kolkatans unanimously unite over their love for KFC and the brand pays an ode to everything that makes the city truly the City of Joy with their latest campaign. Aptly showcased as “Fried Chicken Chaile? Let’s KFC” the brand celebrates various everyday moments when KFC fans unite over a Bucket of Chicken. The 2 films of the campaign feature popular RJs and influencers - Somak Ghosh and Agnijit Sen - citing them in relatable situations and fun conversations. Whether it’s dressing up for a special occasion or coming together to enjoy a football match - Kolkata knows how it is done the right way just as their favourite KFC chicken is!

Talking about deepening brand love in Kolkata and the region a KFC Spokesperson said “The city of Kolkata holds a special place for us. Over decades we have strengthened the brand’s presence in the city and garnered much love from KFC fans. The brand with that unmistakable Bucket of Chicken and its signature taste is synonymous with everyday celebrations becoming an integral part of the city & its vivacious vibe. Whether it is pandal hopping during Pujo or getting together with friends & family over a weekend; cheering for your favourite sports’ teams or simply for some mid-week indulgence - KFC’s signature chicken indeed makes every occasion even more special. So ekdom unique fried chicken chaile to let’s KFC!”

The campaign includes 2 short films that capture some of the finer nuances of Bengali culture - the love for football and traditions – aptly brought alive by Somak and Agnijit. In the first film Agni is seen getting dressed in true Kolkatan style (in a dhuti) while Somak is drooling over KFC chicken oblivious to the world around him. While Agni is talking about the skillset it takes to tie the perfect dhuti Somak is indulging in the perfect piece of KFC Chicken agreeing that it indeed takes special skills to get fried chicken so right every time. It’s a seamless conversation all along until realization strikes that they’ve been talking about completely different things but in the end shared love for KFC triumphs as they settle down to enjoy KFC together. Likewise in the other film Agnijit is rattling off about an ongoing football match when he just about makes it braving rains and more like a true Kolkatan football fan but Somak the true KFC-lover is lost in delishland with his KFC Bucket in hand which too is one of a kind. Enjoy both the Football & Dhuti films here and while at it place an order for your KFC favs on the App or website https://online.kfc.co.in/ - and Let’s KFC!",,,,,,,,,

With the 2022 Zebra Putter range we have some brand new releases from the vintage brand.

Although this is not a brand that pops out of the shelves in the same way as TaylorMade Odyssey or Scotty Cameron their new line of putters is hugely impressive.

With high MOI and changeable weighting technology there is no reason why the new Zebra Putters can't immediately sure up your putting stroke and produce a fine roll.

All you need to know: Best Golf Putters

WATCH OUR ZEBRA PUTTER REVIEW:

Zebra Putter - Key Features

We reviewed the Zebra AIT 1 and the Zebra AIT 3 models. The AIT 1 is like the classic mallet head which was first released 47 years ago whereas the AIT 3 is a spider shape.

The new Zebra lines were one of our favourite additions to the new releases. They are distinctly white surrounded by a strong black charcoal main colour. This makes the alignment line extremely visible and this makes it easier to line up your ball.

There is a brand-new insert in the face throughout the whole set which is a modern update compared with the original releases all those years ago. This insert puts topspin on your ball.

We were huge fans of the Zebra Putter's performance. These putters are said to be rated between 4172 to 4786 MOI. This means that there is a lot of weight-based technology packed in to help you perform a consistent putting stroke.

Player Level

For £179.99 rising to £199.99 the Zebra Putter represents excellent value and this club could be used by any golfer who wants to improve their putting stroke and consistency from short range.

These putters would suit beginner golfers as opposed to established golfers because they are cheaper and they can set a foundation for your short game while you continue to improve.

Zebra Putter - Looks and Feel

The new insert in the centre of the clubface doesn't just put topspin on your ball but it also makes for a nice feel when you make a connection on the putting surface.

Zebra Putter - Performance and Forgiveness

Despite the insert providing a soft feel we didn't believe the feeling was that soft. You could find other putters on the market which feel nicer off the face than this.

The performance off the clubface felt clicky and unnatural. As we all know putters are down to personal preference and this connection may satisfy some golfers but it didn't satisfy us in this case.

However we were impressed with the roll of the ball that the Zebra Putters produced and this is because of the topspin that you get from the insert. If you can roll the ball better it finishes where you want it to on the green on a regular basis.

Despite the AIT 3 Putter still being impressive we preferred the AIT 1 Putter because it is a classic club. The look is vintage and the improvements are clear to see with the insert larger head and strong alignment guide.

We found a lot of confidence over short putts. You can overpower the hole from close range and the mallet head gives you the courage to knock in the tough ones that you could normally miss.

Zebra Putter Review | ""One of the most popular golf products ever!""

Should you buy the Zebra Putter?

In today's market with the likes of TaylorMade Scotty Cameron and Odyssey dominating with their world-class putters Zebra are holding their own with a mightily impressive release.

With the high MOI the changeable weighting and the roll off the face we think these putters have gone under the radar because they are not one of the mainstream brands.

You'll do well to find a new putter of better value. Although this type of putter would suit players at the beginning of their golf careers the AIT 1 and the AIT 3 models can be used by anyone.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNpbGljb25oaWxsc25ld3MuY29tLzIwMjIvMDgvMjgvMjUtYXVzdGluLWJhc2VkLXN0YXJ0dXBzLXRvLXdhdGNoLWluLTIwMjIv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,25 Austin-Based Startups to Watch in 2022 - SiliconHills,"25 Austin-Based Startups to Watch in 2022
