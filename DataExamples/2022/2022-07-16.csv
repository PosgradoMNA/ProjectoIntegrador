This was the only occasion when 3M bombers on quick-reaction alert (QRA) duty actually sat armed with nuclear bombs ready to take off at short notice.

When the Myasishchev design bureau was reborn in 1951 it was immediately tasked with creating a high-speed strategic bomber to balance the threat posed by NATO’s heavy bombers notably the B-52.

Designated M-4 and code-named “Bison” by NATO the new four-turbojet bomber was developed within an incredibly short time—just one year. It made use of many innovative features including a bicycle landing gear and was designed around the most powerful jet engine of the day. It became the progenitor of a small family of bombers and refueling tankers including the much-improved 3M and its versions.

Many of the intended versions never materialized and the Bison had its share of problems but it came at just the right time providing a valuable nuclear deterrent.

As explained by Yefim Gordon & Dmitriy Komissarov in their book Myasishchev M-4 and 3M: The First Soviet Strategic Jet Bomber despite the failure of the Bay of Pigs invasion (Operation Zapata) between Apr. 14 and 19 1960 the US did not give up the idea of toppling the Cuban Communist government of Fidel Alejandro Castro Ruz. Actually Castro feared that the US administration was planning a full-scale military operation. Knowing that the small Cuban Revolutionary Armed Forces were no match for the US war machine Castro requested military assistance from the Soviet Union. An agreement was soon reached whereby a 40000-strong Soviet military contingent was deployed on Cuba including three regiments of R-12 (izdeliye 8K63 NATO SS-4 Sandal) intermediate-range ballistic missiles and two regiments of R-14 (izdeliye 8K65 NATO SS-5 Skean) IRBMs. It was these weapons systems that triggered the infamous Cuban Missile Crisis of September—November 1962 which put the world on the brink of the Third World War.

Faced with the increasing probability of a hot war with the US the Soviet MoD regrouped its forces hastily. Among other things the 1096th and 1230th TBAPs making up the 201st TBAD were redeployed to a forward-operating location at Siauliai in order to reduce their 3M Bison strategic bomber’s target approach time. This was the only occasion when 3M bombers on quick-reaction alert (QRA) duty actually sat armed with nuclear bombs ready to take off at short notice (in contrast USAF B-52s prowling along the Soviet borders always had nukes on board in those days).

Two squadrons of each regiment were to strike at the continental US; the third squadron was equipped with hastily outfitted 3MS-2 tankers to support the operation. The bomber crews were issued sealed flight bags with route maps indicating their targets and sealed envelopes with the nuclear bombs’ activation codes.

They never got to see the nukes proper accepting the already bombed-up aircraft with security seals on the bomb bay doors. The Soviet air force’s tactical-aviation units and the DA’s Tu-16P Badger-J ECM aircraft (P = postanovshchik pomekh — ECM aircraft) were to help the bombers get unscathed past the NATO bases in western Europe but later the Bisons would be on their own. The airmen were subjected to immense psychological strain knowing that in the event of a nuclear war their own families would surely perish. Still morale was high; `Do what you have to do and come what may!’

However realising that an all-out war with the US would be a war of destruction the Soviet leaders had the common sense to back down and seek a political solution. On Oct. 26 Nikita S. Khrushchov acknowledged the deployment of Soviet missiles to Cuba (which he had hitherto denied) but stated they would never be used against the US. He offered to US president John F. Kennedy to withdraw all Soviet offensive weapons from Cuba in exchange for a pledge of nonaggression against Cuba; he also demanded that the US ballistic missiles deployed in Turkey which were causing great concern of the Soviet government be withdrawn. On Oct. 27 JFK replied that the USA guaranteed nonaggression and that the blockade of Cuba would be lifted on condition that the withdrawal of the Soviet offensive weapons be monitored by the United Nations. A day later the Soviet government accepted this offer making an appropriate statement. Between Nov. 5 and 9 all 42 IRBMs were shipped back to the USSR and the launchpads were demolished. Hence the of state of heightened alert was cancelled and the bombers of the 201st TBAD returned to their home base in Engels – much to the del relief of everyone concerned.

McIlroy couldn’t find his stroke with the putter.

He only made two birdies in the final round and finished with a 70 which probably would’ve won him the tournament if it weren’t for Smith’s eight birdies. McIlroy dropped to third place after Cameron Young recorded an eagle on 18.

The Northern Irishman talked with NBC’s Kathryn Tappen after the round.

""Just disappointment I guess"" he said when asked his thoughts on the round. ""I had a great opportunity to add to that major tally and I didn’t quite get it done. Didn’t feel like I did many things wrong. The putter just sort of went cold on me there pretty much throughout the round. I did what I wanted to do. I played a really controlled round of golf. I didn’t take advantage of some of the holes I had been taking advantage of this week.

""Both Camerons but especially Cam Smith went on that run on the back nine. I really had to try to dig deep and make some birdies and I just couldn’t. I got beaten by the better player this week. To go out to shoot 64 to win an Open Championship at St. Andrews is a helluva showing. Hats off to Cam he’s had an unbelievable week.""

McIlroy said he knew he could win the tournament which would have been his first major title in eight years. He won the Open Championship and PGA Championship in 2014.

""I knew that I could do it"" he said. ""I love this golf course. I play well here. The last two Opens I’ve played here I’ve finished third both times. It’s coming. I just think this whole major season — second at Augusta third here fifth at the U.S. Open eighth at the PGA — I’m knocking on the door. I just need to stay patient and keep knocking on the door and eventually one will open for me again.""

Though the major tournaments on the golf season are finished the FedEx Cup is still in play for McIlroy. He’s in fourth place after the Scottish Open. He has 1894 points in 12 events. Scottie Scheffler is the leader with 3514 after four wins in FedEx Cup tournaments.

There are six tournaments left on the 2021-22 PGA Tour schedule. The 3M Open is set for July 21.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiMmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LndvcmxkdGVubmlzbWFnYXppbmUuY29tL2FyY2hpdmVzLzIxMDM20gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Mardy Fish The Self-Described “Country Club Bo Jackson” Ready For PGA Tour Debut,"By Randy Walker

@TennisPublisher

Mardy Fish the former top 10 tennis star Olympic silver medalist and current U.S. Davis Cup captain is set to make some sports and tennis history on the PGA golf tour.

Fish will make his debut on the professional golf tour at the PGA Tour’s 3M Classic in Minnesota July 21-24 becoming a rare athlete to play professionally in more than one sport.

“I’m kind of a country club Bo Jackson” Fish said to Tennis.com last year of his excellence in both tennis and golf referring to the former Heisman Trophy winning football player Bo Jackson who played for the National Football League’s Los Angeles Raiders and Major League Baseball’s Kansas City Royals.

Fish was born in Edina Minnesota and while he grew up in Vero Beach Florida he always maintained his allegiance to Minnesota and Minnesota sports teams. As I wrote in January of 2021 in the story “Mardy Fish Deserves “Wild Cards” But Not In Tennis” here http://www.worldtennismagazine.com/archives/19495 “Fish was born in Minnesota and as you can see from his @MardyFish Twitter profile is a die-hard Minnesota sports fans. Thus an invite into the state’s PGA Tour event the 3M Championship would be appropriate and receive significant local attention.”

Hollis Cavner the 3M Championship Tournament Director agreed when he announced that Fish would receive a “wild card” (or sponsor’s exemption as it is known in the golf industry) into the event. “This guy can play. He will not embarrass himself” said Cavner. “He’s a great golfer and it provides an interesting storyline as we get closer to the tournament.”

After he finished his ATP Tour tennis career in 2015 Fish began to expand on his love and prowess at golf playing competitive events in lower-level pro tours – the All-American Gateway Tour and the Golden State Tour with mixed success but became the first alternate in U.S. Open local qualifying in 2014 and 2015.

He soon became part of the celebrity golf tour where he found resounding success. He has won the two most prestigious celebrity golf events the Hilton Grand Vacations Tournament of Champions three times and the 2020 American Century Celebrity Golf Championship at Lake Tahoe shooting a 63 en route breaking the course record set by Lee Trevino. He also beat former Dallas Cowboys quarterback Tony Romo earlier this year at a new ClubCorp Celebrity pro event in Dallas.

During a charity event in 2018 he had a chance to play nine holes with Jack Nicklaus who was amazed at the raw talent of Fish calling him “The best non-professional golfer I’ve ever seen play” (Read the full article here: http://www.worldtennismagazine.com/archives/16360)

Although he labels himself as the “Country Club Bo Jackson” Fish actually learned both sports at public facilities on the tennis courts at Riverside Park and the Sandridge public golf course in Vero Beach Florida. He returns annually to Vero Beach in January to host his Mardy Fish Children’s Foundation Golf Fundraiser at The Windsor Club where his father Tom is the head tennis pro.

While Fish won’t be the first pro athlete from another sport to play a pro tour golf event he will join a very select number of former top tennis players to also play mainstream pro tour level golf. The most successful top-flight tennis player to also play professional golf was Ellsworth Vines. Vines holds the distinction – along with a man named Frank Conner – of being the only men to play in the modern-day U.S. Open (or the U.S. Nationals pre-1968) and the golf U.S. Open. Vines abandoned his tennis career in 1940 to turn his attention to competitive golf. He not only was a competitor at the golf U.S. Open but in the Masters and the PGA Championship as well. His best finish in the golf majors being a tie for third at the 1951 PGA (he was a losing semifinalist in the match-play format.) In stroke-play majors his best finish was a tie for 14th at the U.S. Open in 1948 and 1949. His best finish at the Masters was a tie for 24th in 1947.

Frank Conner was a standout American tennis player in the amateur era competing in the U.S. National in 1965 1966 and 1967 reaching the second round in 1967. He went on to become a tennis All-American at Trinity University in Texas one of the top tennis schools at the time. However he had also picked up and excelled at golf as well and realizing he could make more money in pro golf than tennis turned into a golf professional qualifying for the PGA Tour in 1975. His best finish at a major came at the 1981 U.S. Open at Merion where he finished tied for sixth. He never won an official PGA Tour title but lost in a playoff to Tom Watson at the 1982 Heritage Classic on Hilton Head Island S.C. and to Dave Barr at the 1981 Quad Cities Open.

Former world No. 42 Scott Draper of Australia also played professional golf in Australia from 2005 to 2008. He won a “lower-tour” event the New South Wales PGA Championship in 2007.

Sherwood Stewart won 52 ATP doubles titles including three major doubles titles as well as two mixed doubles majors. He has excelled in competitive golf after his tennis career competing in five British Senior Open championships.

Althea Gibson the two-time U.S. and Wimbledon champion is credited of not only breaking the color barrier in tennis in 1950 but in professional women’s golf as well in 1964 when she joined the LPGA Tour. Gibson played professional golf until 1978 and despite being one of the top 50 money winners for five years her career earnings did not exceed $25000. Her best finish was a tie for second losing in a three-way playoff at the Len Immke Buick Open in Dublin Ohio. “Althea might have been a real player of consequence had she started when she was young” legendary golf player and commentator Judy Rankin once said of Gibson. “She came along during a difficult time in golf gained the support of a lot of people and quietly made a difference.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMikAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5raWRzbmV3cy5jb20uYXUvYW5pbWFscy9nb3Jnb3NhdXJ1cy1kaW5vc2F1ci1zZXQtdG8tZmV0Y2gtbWlsbGlvbnMtb2YtZG9sbGFycy1hdC1hdWN0aW9uL25ld3Mtc3RvcnkvMWY2YjRhYzA2OTI1ZGYxNDRhZDdlZDIyZWZkMDRiYWbSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Gorgosaurus dinosaur for sale,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.kidsnews.com.au/animals/gorgosaurus-dinosaur-set-to-fetch-millions-of-dollars-at-auction/news-story/1f6b4ac06925df144ad7ed22efd04baf on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMikAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5raWRzbmV3cy5jb20uYXUvYW5pbWFscy9nb3Jnb3NhdXJ1cy1kaW5vc2F1ci1zZXQtdG8tZmV0Y2gtbWlsbGlvbnMtb2YtZG9sbGFycy1hdC1hdWN0aW9uL25ld3Mtc3RvcnkvMWY2YjRhYzA2OTI1ZGYxNDRhZDdlZDIyZWZkMDRiYWbSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMimQFodHRwczovL2VudC5hYnMtY2JuLmNvbS9pZG9scGhpbGlwcGluZXMyMDIyL2FydGljbGVzLW5ld3MvaWRvbC1waGlsaXBwaW5lcy1ob3BlZnVsLXJ5c3NpLWF2aWxhLXN0dW5zLXZpZXdlcmEtd2l0aC1hbGlwaW4tcmVuZGl0aW9uLWdhcm5lcnMtM20tdmlld3MtMTc3MTjSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,"Ryssi Avila ""Alipin"" garners 3M views","Social media personality Ryssi Avila bagged the third platinum ticket of “ Idol Philippines ” last Saturday (July 9) after impressing judge Moira dela Torre with her heartfelt performance of Shamrock’s “Alipin” which has garnered more than three million views on YouTube.

“Parang ngayon lang ako naiyak at naka-connect nang ganon. I only have this one chance to do this for this whole season. I feel it in my bones na ikaw ‘to. Para sa’yo ‘to.

Ryssi shared that she stopped singing for a year after receiving backlash for being involved with a social media couple. Moira then told her that she loves stories about second chances and thought it was great that she kept doing what she loved which was singing and writing songs.

“I love redemption stories. Just because your past was broken doesn’t mean your future has to be"" Moira uttered.

Fellow Idol judges Regine Velasquez Chito Miranda and Gary Valenciano also commended Ryssi’s singing prowess. Ryssi will be joining Dominic Hatol and Kimberly Baculo in going straight to the solo round."

Just a day after earning six Emmy nominations Quinta Brunson’s breakout sitcom Abbott Elementary has been hit with a copyright-infringement lawsuit. Brunson and ABC are both named in a lawsuit from aspiring writer and performer Christine Davis who claims that Abbott ripped off a TV script she wrote in 2018 titled This School Year. Per the lawsuit Davis’s script which is set in New York City also follows an underfunded public school with a young idealistic teacher pushing for reform. Further Davis claims that Abbott copied the “look and feel of the inner-city school the mockumentary style unique plot synopsis set design and unique characters” from her script.

According to the lawsuit Davis wrote the script in 2018 and filed for copyright in March 2020. Davis allegedly passed the script to producers Cherisse Parks and Shavon Sullivan Wright at Blue Park Productions in July 2020 (Parks and Wright don’t appear to have any affiliation with ABC or Abbott Elementary). Davis claims that Parks and Wright then took the script to Hulu who evidently passed (Hulu and ABC are both majority-owned by Disney). A few months later in September 2020 per Davis filming on Abbott began. Davis’s lawsuit mandates that “Brunson and ABC turn over all profits they made from the show.” Brunson and ABC have yet to comment but in the meantime we can all reread Conan O’Brien’s thoughts on copyright lawsuits.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5lY24uY29tL25ld3MvbG9jYWwvbWFpbmUtd29tYW4tMjAta2lsbGVkLW1hc3MtbWFuLWZhY2luZy1tdXJkZXItY2hhcmdlLzI3Nzk4MDcv0gFiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cubmVjbi5jb20vbmV3cy9sb2NhbC9tYWluZS13b21hbi0yMC1raWxsZWQtbWFzcy1tYW4tZmFjaW5nLW11cmRlci1jaGFyZ2UvMjc3OTgwNy8_YW1wPTE?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Maine Woman 20 Killed; Mass. Man Facing Murder Charge,"A 20-year-old Maine woman was killed early Saturday morning and a Massachusetts man is facing a murder charge in connection to her death.

Maine State Police said local police received a 911 call around 5:39 a.m. Saturday from a man reporting an assault at a Canaan Road home in Skowhegan.

The Skowhegan Police Department responded to the home and found the caller had a head injury after being assaulted. He was taken to Reddington-Fairview General Hospital where he was treated and later released.

The Madison man whose name was not released was staying overnight at the home with his friend Alice Abbott who lived at the property with her parents. Officers found Abbott dead when they arrived.

State police detectives and evidence technicians worked throughout the day Saturday as they investigated the circumstances surrounding Abbott's death.

After conducting interviews Jason Servil 19 of Massachusetts was arrested around 3:20 p.m. Saturday at the Skowhegan Police Department and charged with murder. He was taken to the Somerset County jail. There was no immediate information on his upcoming court appearance or a defense attorney.

Police said Servil was an acquaintance of Abbott's but did not elaborate on how the two knew each other. Authorities also did not provide any information on a possible motive in the killing.

""The decision to charge Servil was made Saturday afternoon following a discussion between the State Police and the Maine Attorney General’s office"" state police said in a press release Sunday.

Following an autopsy Sunday morning the chief medical examiner ruled Abbott's death a homicide. The cause of Abbott's death was not released and police did not say what kind of injuries she sustained.

An investigation is ongoing.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiT2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZXdyYXAuY29tL3F1aW50YS1icnVuc29uLWFiYy1hYmJvdHQtZWxlbWVudGFyeS1jb3B5cmlnaHQtbGF3c3VpdC_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,'Abbott Elementary' Creator Quinta Brunson and ABC Hit With Copyright Lawsuit,"Days after ABC’s “Abbott Elementary” was nominated for seven Emmys the network and creator Quinta Brunson were both sued for copyright infringement with a lawsuit Tuesday that claims the hit comedy is a “knock-off” of the plaintiff’s own show.

Christine Davis an aspiring writer actress and performer claimed in a suit obtained by TheWrap that Brunson and ABC used the premise of her show “This School Year” to create “Abbott Elementary” and did so without Davis’ consent. Davis is seeking damages of an unspecified amount and a jury trial.

The suit says that the shows are “striking and substantially similar” and that the “look and feel of the inner-city school the mockumentary style unique plot synopsis set design and unique characters” were all modeled off of Davis’ original script which she wrote in 2018 and registered with the copyright office in 2020 one year ahead of “Abbott Elementary’s” debut on ABC in December 2021.

Reps for Brunson ABC and Blue Parks Productions did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Davis in the suit says that she contacted Shavon Sullivan Wright and Cherisse Parks at Blue Parks Productions in Los Angeles in mid-June and July of 2020 and that she had three different meetings regarding “This School Year.” She became aware that both Hulu and ABC were looking for “Black female-led comedies” and that she received notes on her scripts.

The suit goes on to say that the two scripts have young teacher characters whose “roles are nearly identical in type” and older main characters who are also “nearly identical.” It claims that even the plots to the opening episodes to both series are very similar in which the school’s principal usurps the central character by taking her rug.

“Abbott Elementary” in its first season on ABC was nominated for seven Primetime Emmy Awards including Outstanding Comedy Series and Brunson was also nominated for Outstanding Lead Actress in a Comedy Series and Outstanding Writing for a Comedy Series.

Kilkenny star TJ Reid is set to face off against Limerick in the All-Ireland hurling final Sunday.

While he is one of the team’s star players off the pitch TJ is a husband and father-to-be with wife Niamh De Brun.

The newlyweds tied the knot in a lavish wedding ceremony in the five star hotel Adare Manor in Niamh’s native Limerick.

The couple finally made it down the aisle in November 2021 after seven years together and several postponed wedding dates.

Last month the couple announced they were expecting their first baby and Niamh is already half way along in her pregnancy.

ACN,Accenture,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWmh0dHBzOi8vZmludGVjaG1hZ2F6aW5lLmNvbS9iYW5raW5nL2JhbmtzLW5lZWQtYmVzdC1wcmFjdGljZXMtdG8tZmlnaHQtcmlzaW5nLWN5YmVyYXR0YWNrc9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Banks need best practices to fight rising cyberattacks,"Cyberattacks on the financial sector have been steadily increasing. According to VMware financial institutions experienced a $238% increase in cyberattacks within the first six months of 2020 alone. In 2021 the trend continued with financial institutions/fintech being hit by ransomware phishing SQL injection social engineering and denial of service attacks among others.

Government agencies have sought to stem the trend with regulations resources and regular warnings. But has this been enough and can financial institutions/fintech companies do more to protect the sensitive data of their customers and their own proprietary information? The answer is yes and it involves executives’ gaining a better understanding of the progression of cyberattacks on the financial sector and responses to them along with implementing best practices for cybersecurity that address current threat vectors.

On September 14 2007 the online brokerage TD Ameritrade reported that it had experienced a data breach that resulted in the theft of 6.3 million customer account records. It was one of the first major wake-up calls for the financial sector and sadly would be followed by many others. A report by the Boston Consulting Group stated that financial services firms are 300 times more likely to experience a cyberattack than businesses in other industries. Their costs from a cyberattack are higher too. Accenture reported that the average cost of a cybercrime per financial services company in 2018 averaged $18.5 million compared with $13 million for companies in other sectors. It is likely that amount has increased. The good news is that there is greater awareness and measures in place to help combat cybercrime. This heightened awareness coupled with best practices can be extremely effective.

Serious cybercrime incidents in 2021

Since tracking and reporting of cyberattacks began there has been a long pipeline of various cyberattacks on banks credit unions credit card companies mortgage lenders investment firms cryptocurrency platforms etc. worldwide. Cybercriminals have included Russian hacking groups like the TA505 ransomware groups like DarkSide and Ragnar Locker international crime rings and botnet campaigns such as the SharkBot and UBEL. Some of the cyberattacks on financial sector firms that made headlines in 2021 include:

A stolen SSH key that caused the crypto trading platform Bitmart to experience major security breach which enabled hackers to withdraw almost $200 million in assets.

The hacking of Robinhood an American stock trading platform that gave the cyber thief access to approximately seven million customers' personal information.

A breach was experienced by the insurance tech start-up BackNine that exposed 711000 files containing customers’ sensitive personal information including medical histories.

A denial-of-service attack on a German IT firm that operates technology for Germany’s cooperative banks disrupted the operations of 800 financial institutions in the country.

A 300 % increase in phishing attacks from May to August 2021 was experienced by Chase as reported by Cyren research.

The ransomware attack on CNA Financial which disrupted its employee and customer services for three days.

Measures to mitigate cyber crimes

These are just some examples of the hundreds of cyberattacks that befell financial sector businesses in 2021. These incidences gave rise to increasing warnings from government agencies. In the United States cyber threat warnings are regularly issued by the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) the Department of Financial Services (DFS) and the Federal Trade Commission (FTC). The U.S. also has developed various laws and standards to improve cybersecurity within the financial sector. For example there have been cybersecurity components added to The Sarbanes-Oxley (SOC) Act of 2002 the passage of the Bank Secrecy Act the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act and the Payment Card Industry (PCI) Data Security Standards. More recently U.S. President Biden’s Administration instituted new cybersecurity rules for the financial sector.

The FTC made amendments to the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act requiring FTC-regulated financial institutions to develop and implement cybersecurity requirements as a component of their information security programs. Additionally the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) announced new enforcement actions against financial sector firms for deficient disclosure controls of their cybersecurity risks. It is expected also that other agencies such as the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation and the Federal Reserve System will also follow suit and issue new cybersecurity regulations.

Within the European Union there is the European General Data Protection Regulation (EU-GDPR) and since Brexit occurred the United Kingdom created its own version of GDPR (UK-GDPR).

In 2015 the “Financial Services Sector-Specific Plan” was issued jointly by the U.S. Department of Treasury and the U.S. Department of Homeland Security. It outlines a comprehensive cybersecurity plan for financial sector firms that covers a strategic framework goals information sharing policies best practices incident response recovery and benchmarking. It is a good basic guide but not enough. Financial sector businesses must deploy industry-driven best practices.

Best Practices for cybersecurity in fintech

Many financial institutions/fintechs have extensive Information Technology (IT) departments. They are well-staffed by computer engineers technicians network administrators etc. with oversight by an experienced Chief Information Officer (CIO). These organizations also rely on Managed Service Providers (MSPs) to perform various functions such as preventive system maintenance and software updates. In many organizations both internal IT staff and MSP staff often assume a role in cybersecurity however this is not the ideal situation and without question these individuals should not be performing certain critical tasks such as vulnerability assessments penetration testing and benchmarking.

These tasks should be outsourced to a third-party cybersecurity firm. These firms have experienced cybersecurity professionals on staff who hold important credentials such as Computer Hacking Forensics Investigator Certified Information Systems Auditor Certified Ethical Hacker Certified Information Systems Security Professional and Certified Information Systems Manager. Beyond their cybersecurity specializations they provide an objective evaluation of a financial firm/fintech’s systems which would not be compromised by their primary roles such as in the case of internal or MSP staff.

Measures to build a sound cybersecurity initiative

Detection – An organization’s cybersecurity should be driven by strong detection measures. That starts with having a third-party cybersecurity firm conduct a vulnerability assessment on all of the organization’s IT systems to determine weaknesses and risk levels. In addition penetration testing (i.e. ethical hacking) should be performed to assess the ease with which a cyber-criminal could enter and attack the organisation’s the network ports database emails etc.

Mitigation – Once the vulnerability assessment and penetration testing have been completed it is important to consider the remediation measures recommended by the cybersecurity firm. To mitigate threats and heighten system security the firm may recommend new firewalls anti-keylogging encryption software endpoint protection multi-factor authentication password and SSH key management and other measures to secure system access.

Cybersecurity Framework and Policies – A formal document should be developed to break out all cybersecurity-related policies procedures and best practices. They will include data back-ups and back-up data recovery implementing software updates regular vulnerability assessments and penetration testing which addresses the latest threat vectors limiting access to sensitive data to select authorized staff a password management directive and eliminating any unnecessary technology. This document should be shared with staff and vendors whose roles involve access to the organization’s technology. The document should also include a section indicating the organisation cybersecurity insurer and coverage which should be reviewed on an annual basis or more frequently if the organization has experienced an increase in cyberattacks.

Incident Report and Recovery Plan – A plan that includes all measures to be implemented in the event of a cyberattack. Much like a disaster recovery plan it should include key staff and their responsibilities a communications policy (i.e. what individuals and entities should be notified and in what order) documentation procedure and any crisis management and damage control measures to be taken.

Cybersecurity Staff Training – It is also critical that the awareness of all staff regarding the threat of cyberattacks be raised with training and education. Many cyberattacks start with an unsuspecting staff member who opens an email attachment or link that they should not have and in doing so exposed the organization to a major breach. It’s important that staff be familiar with common cyberattacks. These include:

Phishing attacks (i.e. cybercriminals send emails that appear to be issued by a credible organization (many times one with which there is a relationship) and requests proprietary data (e.g. financial account information passwords etc.)

Ransomware attacks wherein hackers place malicious software to encrypt a school district’s data and then demand a ransom in order for the organization to get access to its data back.

Malware is malicious software that is placed on computers or a network and enables the cybercriminal to take control of the computer to monitor the user’s keystrokes and actions and access confidential data. The malware gets into a computer when the user clicks on a link or opens an attachment.

Denial-of-Service attacks temporarily shut down a machine or network rendering it inaccessible to its intended users.

SQL (structured query language) Injection attacks that target servers that store proprietary/critical data and use SQL to manage their databases. A SQL Injection attack uses malicious code to target the server and cause it to convey privileged information.

Securing the financial sector

The American Institute of Certified Public Accountants (AICPA) reported that eight in ten US adult citizens are concerned that businesses are unable to secure their personal financial information. The high incidences of financial sector breaches have done nothing to quell those concerns. Nor does the security breach statistic from Positive Technologies that 92% of ATMs are vulnerable to hacks instill customer confidence. Financial sector firms should adopt the mantra that it is not a matter of if but when their organization will experience a cyberattack. By implementing effective precautions and best practices financial institutions/fintechs can know they are being proactive in the fight against cyberattacks.

But somewhere in this intersection there is the danger of technology leaving the human behind. (Illustration by Suneesh K.)

C-suite executives are a busy lot. Complex corporate issues have to be dealt with on a daily basis. Strategies have to be drawn up and fires have to be doused. So when do some of them find the time to write lengthy books? More pertinently why do they even engage in such pursuits?

Radically Human: How New Technology is Transforming Business and Shaping Our Future published in March 2022 may offer some clues; not in its content but in its construction. Written by two senior Accenture executives Paul R. Daugherty the consulting firm’s chief technology officer and James Wilson its global managing director the book is a kind of guide to emerging technologies like cloud and artificial intelligence with a clear message on the need to have a new human-centric mindset on innovation using these. It comes from extensive research which shows that a large majority of companies use these technologies only as a lifeline not as engines of innovation. The few that do the latter have reaped huge rewards.

While that is the intellectual dimension at a more prosaic level the book can be seen as a part of Accenture’s thought leadership efforts. The American company headquartered in Dublin is a global market leader in IT services bigger than many of its key competitors including the celebrated Indian quartet of TCS Infosys HCL and Wipro. Its growth rate has been scorching and its overall performance impressive. Yet there is one parameter on which Accenture lags its Indian peers. Its operating margin at 15 percent is well behind that of TCS and Infosys. It is the US firm’s stated interest to get companies across the world which are potential clients to embrace technology. But to differentiate itself and thereby earn higher margins on its business Accenture would like them to use technology in more and more sophisticated ways moving up from plain vanilla implementations. That’s Accenture’s turf since as a consulting firm it is better than most of its competitors and faces less pricing pressures when it comes to these services.

And what better marketing for such services than a book by senior professionals which turns the current framework for the existing building blocks of innovation—intelligence data expertise architecture and strategy—upside down. The central idea of the book is that humans have created the best of technologies and are constantly working on ways to better them. But somewhere in this intersection there is the danger of technology leaving the human behind creating a new set of crises. One such fear that has continued to assail us is whether with increasing adoption of AI jobs will disappear.

The redefined framework dubbed IDEAS may seem a bit too formulaic but set against the enormous success of firms that have followed it over the pandemic period its value is undeniable. What makes the book valuable and prevents it from falling into the trap of being a theoretical exposition replete with jargon is these examples of firms large and small private and public Royal Dutch Shell as well as Ukrainian ride-hailing service Uklon. The writers have clearly mined details about how dozens of such firms have deployed technologies to become leaders in their fields.

Which is not to say that Daugherty and Wilson are not accomplished authors who could easily build a successful writing career. An earlier book Human + Machine: Reimagining Work in the Age of AI too was well received.

But whether driven by a literary impulse or meant to enhance their reputation as management writers it is hard to miss the collateral gains that accrue to their employer Accenture from the publication. Given the quality of advice and the insightful writing it would be a brave CEO who wouldn't want to set up a meeting with an executive from the company immediately after reading this book.

After all the promise of quintupling profits which is the central premise of the book is the Holy Grail of all businesses. In quest of that the book recommends more natural artificial intelligence manageable small data machine teaching living systems trustworthy AI the unleashing of talent all of which will eventually make technologies more recognizably human.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiT2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnB5bW50cy5jb20vZXMvbmV3cy9yZXRhaWwvMjAyMi93aGF0LXdvbnQteW91LWRvLWZvci1hLWtsb25kaWtlLWJhci_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,What Won't You Do for a Klondike Bar?,"It only comes around once a year — National Ice Cream Day — it’s being celebrated on Sunday (July 17) and by happy coincidence it aligns this year with the 100th anniversary of an iconic frozen treat the Klondike Bar.

As if anyone needs an excuse to celebrate either.

For those taking a dim view of 2022 this may lend some perspective into what’s bad and what’s worse. Sure everybody’s saying there’s going to be a recession in 2022. That’s bad. On some level worse is the fact that Klondike Bars were sold only in Pennsylvania and Ohio … until 1978.

That’s cold even hard to grasp but so says Unilever which acquired the maker of these yummy chocolate-dipped slabs of ice cream in 1993 placing it into the Good Humor-Breyers portfolio of frigid delights. Sensing the moment Unilever said “This acquisition put Americans of every age within reach of the most comprehensive line of chilly treats in dessert history.”

If really you want to thank someone we refer you to the late visionary businessman Henry DeBrunner Clarke Jr. whose firm Clabir made its real money in defense contracts. He bought the rights to Klondike Bar in 1976 adding it to his food holdings — and possibly for military applications — reportedly bringing sales of the dessert from $800000 annually at the time of the acquisition by Clabir to more than $60 million when he sold it in 1989.

In the most recent sales figures we can find IRI data from 2019 said U.S. sales were over $309 million that year. That was also the year actress Anna Farris was the face of a Klondike campaign that dared people to legally change their name for a lifetime supply of said treat.

Confronted with the question herself there’s not much Farris won’t do for a K-Bar. See it here.

Back to Clarke who signed a noncompete when he sold but only covering the U.S. That takes us down the rabbit hole of his later exploits in the U.K. and Europe going lick-to-lick against archrival Häagen-Daz. But that’s a cool story for another National Ice Cream Day.

This one’s for the 100-year-old Klondike Bar which incidentally was not conceived as a treat for children. Inventor and dairy owner Henry Isaly believed sticks were for kids. “Isaly thought frozen treats with a wooden handle = kiddie” Delish reported. “He aimed for a more mature audience so he removed it and packaged the bars in a fancy silver foil wrapper.”

And don’t forget the polar bear. We don’t know the significance but it’s branding brilliance.

Meanwhile in Unilever’s Klondike division they’re not letting this centennial pass without all kinds of dairy doings. For starters “Cake Boss” star Buddy Valastro was commissioned to create a towering Klondike Bar cake. A sweepstakes winner will get to eat some (all if they’re fast).

Per the Klondike Bar website “To enter for a chance to win post a photo or video on Instagram of yourself completing one of our decade-themed challenges with #4aKlondike100Sweepstakes and tag @klondikebar. BONUS: one lucky winner also has a chance to win the Klondike Kard that comes with coupons and a check for free Klondike treats for one hundred years!”

Typically retailing for $3.99 and assuming one Klondike Bar per day for a century we’re talking almost $150000 in Klondike Kard kredit at current valuations. Issuers watch your backs.

In “but wait there’s more” fashion on July 17 look for Klondike Bar popups in Manhattan’s Washington Square Park Navy Pier in Chicago and along Santa Monica’s promenade.

The coated ice cream block that put Pittsburgh on the map has even more in store with a series of fun challenges from “Re-mix the WWYD jingle in the style of a barbershop quartet” to “Make a bow tie out of Klondike foil” all of which link out to Klondike’s Instagram page. We dare you.

We would be remiss not to touch on the legendary jingle and slogan “What Would You Do for a Klondike Bar?” made famous in this 1986 TV commercial. You’d be surprised.

In 2009 a man tried to shove two K-Bars down his shorts and exit without paying. As reported by the San Diego Union-Tribune in the ensuing parking lot confrontation he offered to pay $69 for the purloined goodies to be set free but they turned him in anyway. Talk about frosty.

Another guy went all out filling half a duffel bag with stolen Klondikes. Apparently a known serial shoplifter in the area he was facing seven years in prison at the time Lancaster Online reported on the incident. In riveting detail that story reads: “the assistant manager approached him. She felt the bag and felt it was ice cold. She could tell the ice cream was in there.”

Sounds like an episode of “NCIS: Ice Cream Truck” but clearly some people would call the police for a Klondike Bar (two packages of them in that case). The takeaway: Don’t steal ice cream — especially not this weekend. Have some respect for a commercial centenarian.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMia2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoYWlwYnN3b3JsZC5jb20vcGF0YW1hLWNoYW50YXJ1Y2stZGlzY3Vzc2VzLXdoYXQtaXMtaG9sZGluZy13b21lbi1iYWNrLWluLXRoYWlsYW5kcy1pdC1zZWN0b3Iv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Patama Chantaruck discusses what is holding women back in Thailand's IT sector,"Patama Chantaruck discusses what is holding women back in Thailand’s IT sector

“As a leader I don’t count how many followers I have. I’d rather count how many female leaders I have promoted. If I can do it so can they.”

Encouraging women to become leaders

In Thailand’s tech sector Patama Chantaruck is one of the most powerful female Thai leaders with extensive experience at global IT giants such as Microsoft in the United States and in Thailand IBM Thailand and currently as the Country Managing Director of Accenture Thailand.

Patama has seen the number of female leaders in tech companies increase in the last decade.

“For example Microsoft operates in almost 200 countries but there were only 8 female country managers in 2011. Now you get to see a lot of female leaders stepping up and running IT companies which is a good trend and a positive sign.”

Apart from leading the companies one of her missions is to encourage more women to take up senior positions as well as mentoring them to become leaders. While hoping that her story will inspire more women to step up the most common challenge Patama has noticed is that some are too scared.

“When we say that it’s a glass ceiling we often find it as actually a slippery floor” she says adding that women tend to focus on having all the required qualifications before applying for a leadership position.

“If there are five qualifications and they only have four they won’t apply for the job. Women have to make sure that they have all five qualifications lined up. Compare that to men even if they have only three qualifications they will sell the idea of why we should pick them even though they don’t have the other two.”

As to what is holding women back self-esteem remains a common issue. The former Microsoft country manager explains that women often perceive themselves as not being good enough for the leadership position.

When female candidates are challenged with the question “What would you say if somebody tells you that you don’t fit the norm” in a job-interview Patama feels that most people try to “fit into the mold” instead of trying to stand out.

“A lot of them keep talking about how “we will work hard” “we are good learners” and “we’ll try harder”. Rather than focusing on strengths that are not necessary and trying to fit into the mold [I think] there is nothing wrong with being different.”

Never be afraid of being different

Born in Thailand’s southern province of Songkhla and with an MBA in International Finance from Washington State University Patama told us humbly that for some people she may not be their ideal image of a female leader.

“I remember walking into the room and when I introduced myself as the country managing director the comment I got back was that I didn’t “look like” a country manager. So I asked them ‘What do you expect me to look like?’”

Overcoming people’s fixed perceptions along with any stereotypical prejudice against her was of course not at all easy. Not only that there weren’t any female leaders like her for her to look up to at the time.

“As a female it’s already hard enough to get people to listen to you. Being an Asian woman is not easy.”

Despite being told that she will never become a manager because she’s Asian speaks English with an accent or even because she is “too short” to be a leader none of these things bothered her. Patama is never afraid to be different and she would rather be the best version of herself. That inner self-confidence has kept her moving forward.

“This is who I am” she said firmly. In fact all of the characteristics which seem problematic for certain people can be enhanced. As Patama explains her height can be fixed with her 5-inch heels and she would rather focus on getting her message across than trying to perfect her accent.

Patama also recalled the moment when she was first promoted back in the States where a few men in the meeting room asked her to get them a cup of coffee mistakenly assuming that she was only a general member of staff possibly due to her ethnicity.

“I actually took the order of what coffee they wanted. I walked out and got the coffee I came back and I put the coffee down and told them ‘Please help yourself’ and I walked over to sit at the head of the table.”

Reflecting back on how she responded to those men Patama proudly described the moment when they found out that she was the boss without having to say anything as the “best two minutes of her life”.

Reverse mentorship

Considering that the IT and tech industries are naturally fast-changing with new technological developments popping up here and there Patama revealed that her leadership style has changed tremendously in order to keep up with the rapid changes.

“I often make jokes when people ask me what degree I have. I said I have “History of IT” because I graduated a long time ago with a computer engineering degree.”

Graduating that long ago means that you can’t use the knowledge you studied 10-20 years in the past as technologies nowadays are way more advanced.

Therefore the most important part even for tech leaders is to have a growth mindset and be willing to learn new things with Patama explaining that they used to have a “reverse mentorship” with the younger generation mentoring her instead.

“We can’t pretend that we know it all” she said. “You have to be open-minded and be willing to listen. So instead of being somebody who knows-it-all I have to make sure that I learn it all. I learn from the younger generation and that’s how I keep up with the changes occurring in the IT sector.”

Despite being a leader Patama still reads a lot listens to podcasts and attends summits in order to get inspired and to learn something new. At the same time she often reminds her younger employees to keep up with new knowledge.

“You just have to make sure that you open your heart and mind to learn something new” she said. “When you actually work for quite some time if you don’t learn new things all of the knowledge and skills that you have will be outdated one day.”

If I can do it so can you

When asked about changes she would like to see in female leadership especially after the Global Summit of Women Patama thinks that Thailand is doing well in terms of having female leaders. There are still however neither enough women in the boardroom nor at the decision-making level.

“I’m a firm believer that a company will be much better if you have a diverse group of people. We can disagree on some things but that makes the company better because we can then discuss debate and decide together. So I hope that in Thailand we can have more female leaders in the boardroom and that’s something we are pushing for.”

As for Patama’s final piece of advice to all women she says “Be the best version of you focus on your strengths not your weaknesses and it’s okay to be different.”

Now that our MacBook Air M2 review is live we wanted to share our benchmark results and show you how the new Air stacks up to the new MacBook Pro 13-inch in a range of tests including overall performance SSD speed graphics and more.

As you'll see below and in our MacBook Air M2 vs MacBook Pro M2 comparison the MacBook Air compares quite well to the MacBook Pro but the Pro pulls ahead when it comes to intensive tasks like video editing. And there's a significant battery life gap between these two laptops.

Editor's Note: Apple sent us a higher-end $1899 configuration of the Air with a 10-core GPU as opposed to the entry-level model with a 8-core GPU. The Pro has a 10-core GPU by default. We will update this comparison once we have results for the base model Air.

On Geekbench 5.4 which measures overall performance the MacBook Air M2 hit 1932 on the single-core CPU test and 8919 on multi-core. That’s 11% faster on single core and 17% faster on mutli-core than the MacBook Air M1. The MacBook Pro M2 was on par with the Air M2 albeit slightly behind reaching 1898 and 8911 on the same single- and multi-core tests.

We see an interesting contrast with the SSD inside each of these systems. In this case of the MacBook Air M2 it delivered a read speed that was a smidge faster than the Pro M2 at 2800 vs 2794 MBps.

But the MacBook Pro M2 turned in a significantly faster average write speed reaching 2953 MBps compared to 2210 MBps for the MacBook Air M2. Apple sent us the 1TB version of the Air so we will revisit when we test the 256GB model.

On our Handbrake video editing test which involves transcoding a 4K video clip the new MacBook Air M2 took 7 minutes and 52 seconds to complete the workload. The previous Air M1 needed 9:15 so that’s quite an improvement. However the MacBook Pro M2 which has active cooling for better sustained performance took a minute less than the new Air at 6:51.

Pugetbench for Adobe CC Photoshop

The Pugetbench Photoshop benchmark includes a wide range of general tasks including opening a 18MP file a RAW image resizing to 500MB rotating Magic Wand Select and more. It also includes several filter tasks such as Camera Raw Filter Lens Correction Reduce Noise and Smart Sharpen.

The Air M2 scored 821 to the Pro M2's 817 and finished slightly faster with a time of 4 minutes and 49 seconds compared to 4:54 for the Pro. However some of the above tasks benefit from GPU acceleration so the base model 8-core GPU MacBook Air M2 would likely perform worse than the results you see here.

Pugetbench Premiere Pro (video editing)

The Pugetbench Premiere Pro benchmark evaluates video editing performance using a wide range of tests. This includes applying a Lumetri Color effect to two 59.94 fps clips a 2x forward test with four clips to simulate performance when playing at 2x speed a 4x forward test with 8 clips and a MultiCam test.

The Standard sequence is also used to test export performance using the ""Youtube 2160p 4K Ultra HD"" preset (H.264 4K 40mbps) as well as exporting to 4K ProRes.

That sounds like a lot of heavy lifting and indeed the MacBook Pro M2 is the winner here with a score of 552 to 452 for the Air M2.

In the Rise of the Tomb Raider gaming benchmark the MacBook Air M2 scored a higher 27 frames per second at 1920 x 1200 resolution compared to 25 fps for the MacBook Pro. And there was a bit more of a gap once we stepped it up to a higher resolution with the Air hitting 15.2 fps to the Pro's 12.2 fps.

Once again though this is with a 10-core GPU so we're only showing you what the Air is capable of when you really max it out. We'd expect the entry-level 8-core GPU model to deliver lower frame rates than the Pro.

The MacBook Pro M2 pulled ahead in the Sid Meier's Civilization VI: Gathering Storm benchmark reaching 51.1 fps with the resolution set to 1440 x 900. The MacBook Air M2 turned in a decent 40 fps at a slightly higher resolution. (It's the closest to what the Pro offers).

Battery life (web surfing test)

This is where the MacBook Pro really stands out. On the Tom's Guide Battery Test which involves continuous web surfing at 150 nits of screen brightness the MacBook Air M2 lasted an excellent 14 hours and 6 minutes. Generally speaking anything above 10 hours on this test is very good.

However the MacBook Pro M2 lasted for a much longer 18:20 thanks to its larger battery. That's the longest lasting laptop we've tested ever at Tom's Guide.

Bottom line

The MacBook Air M2 is one of the best laptops as it can clearly hold its own against the MacBook Pro M2 when it comes to overall performance and tasks like photo editing. And at least with the pricier 10-core GPU the new Air can meet or beat the Pro M2 on graphics and gaming. However we will need to retest the entry-level configuration of the Air to see how it truly stacks up to the Pro.

Even with this advantage though the MacBook Pro M2 delivered stronger video encoding and video editing performance in the benchmarks we used. And the Pro M2 far outlasted the Air in our battery life testing.

Overall I think the MacBook Air M2 offers excellent performance and there are plenty of reasons to choose it over the Pro including its larger display sharper full HD webcam and MagSafe charging. But it's clear that the Pro has the edge on performance and endurance.

A third of looked-after children aged 16 and 17 were in unregulated settings last year Department for Education figures show.

Young asylum-seeking children and others in section 20 accommodation – rather than on care orders – were disproportionately represented in these settings while the sector was largely provided by the private sector according to the statistics released on Thursday (14 July).

The findings come ahead of the introduction next year of Ofsted regulation of these placements against new national standards in the wake of widespread safeguarding concerns including in relation to children being placed in settings such as caravans settings or barges.

However the policy has proved controversial because the services – unlike counterparts in children’s homes – will not be required to provide young people with ‘care’ and Ofsted will inspect providers as a whole not individual settings.

This has sparked accusations from children’s rights campaigners of a two-tier system under which 16- and 17-year-olds in these settings would receive inadequate provision and be placed at greater risk compared with those in foster care or children’s homes.

Fall in use of unregulated care following sharp rise

The number of 16- and 17-year-olds in unregulated care fell by 7% in the year to March 2021 to 5980 having more than doubled from 2013-20. Just over three-quarters were aged 17 in the settings which since September 2021 have been barred to children aged under 16.

There was a shift in provision from independent to semi-independent settings – which involve a greater level of support.

Of the 5980 4120 (69%) were living semi-independently nearly double the 2210 who were doing so in 2018. Meanwhile 1860 were living independently almost 1000 fewer than were doing so three years previously.

Unaccompanied asylum-seeking children made up a disproportionate number of those living in unregulated accommodation accounting for 32% of those living independently and 34% of those living semi-independently compared with just 18% of all 16- and 17-year-olds in care.

The majority – 69% in independent settings and 70% in semi-independent provision compared with 41% of all looked-after children aged 16 and 17 – were in section 20 accommodation. This involves cases where a child is in care with the agreement of those with parental responsibility (PR) or because no one has PR for them as with young asylum seekers or they have been abandoned.

The vast majority (77% for independent settings 84% for semi-independent) of children in unregulated accommodation were living in private provision compared with only 54% of all 16- and 17-year-old looked-after children. The proportion was similar to children’s home placements 79% of which were delivered by the private sector as of March 2022.

‘Unintended consequences’

While children’s rights campaigners have argued that these settings should not be subject to lesser regulation than children’s homes councils have raised concerns that regulation of so-called supported accommodation may worsen the insufficiency of placements for looked-after children.

Addressing council directors at last week’s Association of Directors of Children’s Services (ADCS) conference Ofsted national director for social care Yvette Stanley said: “We know that regulating this provision for the first time will lead to unintended consequences. I know you will be talking to your providers about whether they intend to register and forming contingency plans if they do not.”

She said Ofsted would take a flexible approach to regulating the sector which will be referred to as “supported accommodation”

While such settings are supposed to provide support not care Stanley stressed the two types of provision could not be easily separated.

“We absolutely don’t want providers to think that providing any kind of ‘care’ however temporary to young people will mean they are automatically operating illegally” she said. “High-quality supported accommodation should be caring kind and nurturing. We will make this clear in the inspection framework and guidance.”

And though Ofsted would be inspecting providers of supported accommodation as a whole Stanley said inspectors would be able to examine “poor or declining” settings.

Risks around delay in inspecting settings

While Ofsted will start registering supported accommodation providers in April 2023 it will not start inspecting them until April 2024 Stanley confirmed.

However Jonathan Stanley principal partner at the National Centre of Excellence for Residential Child Care (NCERCC) said the sector needed to be monitored sooner in the context of it being about the same size as the children’s home sector with some placements costing “five-figure sums per week”.

He added: “It needs urgent transitions arrangements for both regulation and procurement/commissioning. It cannot be left for two years.”",,,

Former Austin police detective Jesse Prado a private investigator will conduct the investigation.

The moves follow the Sunday release of a 77-page report by a Texas House committee charged with reviewing the action taken by law enforcement during the May 24 mass shooting at Robb Elementary.

Uvalde Mayor Don McLaughlin echoed the sentiment from the report’s findings that “systemic failures and egregious poor decision making"" were factors in the shooting and subsequently in the decision to place Pargas on leave.

Pargas was acting police chief on the day of the shooting.

""We feel like that was the right call until we get all of the facts'' McLaughlin said.

City officials did not say whether Pargas would continue to be paid.

Hewlett Packard Enterprise owns two buildings on the Fort Collins campus totaling 580000 square feet. Christopher Wood/BizWest

Sixty years after Hewlett-Packard Co. employees first began moving into Building A on the company’s new Loveland campus in October 1962 the company that once grew to employ more than 9000 workers in Loveland Fort Collins and Greeley does not have the presence that it once did.

Today HP’s successor companies — Hewlett-Packard Enterprise Co. (NYSE: HPE) and HP Inc. (NYSE: HPQ) — occupy 580000 square feet in Fort Collins with HPE employing 800 people. (HP Inc. did not respond to requests for information.)

But HP’s legacy extends far beyond that footprint from spinoff companies that continue to employ thousands of workers to the real estate that HP left behind.

SPONSORED CONTENT Business Cares: May 2024 As Mental Health Awareness Month unfolds in Colorado it serves as a reminder of the collective responsibility to prioritize mental well-being.

Much of the Fort Collins campus is now owned by Broadcom which essentially is a spinoff of a spinoff i.e. HP’s spinoff of Agilent Technologies Inc. which then sold its Semiconductor Products Group to an investment group creating Avago Technologies Inc. which acquired Broadcom in 2015.

No HP employees remain at the Loveland site where it all started but another spinoff of a spinoff — Keysight Technologies Inc. (NYSE: KEYS) which grew out of Agilent in 2014 — maintains an operation there.

In Greeley nothing remains of an HP operation that was once the center of the city’s nascent tech sector.

HP’s three Northern Colorado campuses have witnessed far different fates since the company began divesting local operations and selling local properties with tech remaining the driving force in Fort Collins and tech and manufacturing enjoying a resurgence at what was the Loveland campus. Greeley however has seen demolition of the long-vacant HP building with the bulk of the acreage transformed for residential retail and other uses.

Loveland

Hewlett-Packard Co.’s history in Northern Colorado began in Loveland but it almost didn’t start that way. Loveland had to compete with Boulder for an HP expansion but problems with potential Boulder sites — and a strong pitch from Loveland civic and business leaders — prompted Colorado native David Packard and other HP executives to select Loveland instead according to an HP Computer Museum post on the history of the Loveland plant.

The plant — with a temporary building opening in 1960 and the first permanent building in 1962 — initially produced power supplies but eventually began producing desktop computers and calculators. HP’s Loveland operation also produced a variety of computer peripherals including printers and instruments such as voltmeters.

The campus — on the northeast corner of South Taft Avenue and 14th Street Southwest — remained a bastion for HP’s global operations for decades but change began in the late 1990s.

HP spun off Agilent in 1998 and by 2005 only 500 people remained at the Loveland site according to the HP Computer Museum.

The Thompson School District acquired one building on the former HP/Agilent campus in 2004 an 88000-square-foot building at 800 S. Taft Ave. that was formerly home to Colorado Memory Systems Inc. which built the structure in 1984. Colorado Memory Systems was founded by former HP employee Bill Bierwaltes. The company manufactured computer tape backup systems and was acquired by HP in 1992.

The school district purchased the building for $4.7 million and now uses it for its headquarters.

Just to the east is Keysight Technologies at 900 S. Taft Ave. Keysight spun off from Agilent in 2014 developing test and measurement equipment.

Keysight’s Loveland building encompasses more than 139000 square feet.

Kari Fauber vice president of Keysight’s global partner sales and ecommerce told BizWest in an email that the Loveland facility is “primarily a research and development site but also hosts teams from legal sales marketing finance logistics and services.

“Keysight delivers advanced design and validation solutions that help accelerate innovation to connect and secure the world” she said. “Keysight’s dedication to speed and precision extends to software-driven insights and analytics that bring tomorrow’s technology products to market faster across the development lifecycle in design simulation prototype validation automated software testing manufacturing analysis and network performance optimization and visibility in enterprise service provider and cloud environments.”

Keysight’s customers span the worldwide communications and industrial ecosystems aerospace and defense automotive energy semiconductor and general electronics markets Fauber said.

Keysight also maintains operations in Colorado Springs and Boulder. It acquired Eggplant Software Inc. with U.S. headquarters in Boulder in 2020 for $330 million.

Keysight employs 14300 worldwide and employed about 300 people in Loveland at the time of the spinoff from Agilent. The company recorded revenue of $4.94 billion in 2021.

With Agilent’s retrenchment in Loveland the company negotiated a deal in May 2011 to sell the bulk of the Loveland campus to the city for $5.8 million.

Plans to revitalize the campus were ambitious with the Colorado Association of Manufacturing and Technology eventually selecting the site in June 2011 for an Aerospace and Clean Energy Manufacturing and Innovation Park known as ACE. The project was touted as creating up to 10000 jobs.

But the proposal faltered early on with developer United Properties withdrawing from the project in August 2011 citing unattainable timelines.

Loveland then selected Bowling Green Kentucky-based developer Cumberland and Western to develop the property with the city selling the property to the company for $5 million.

Plans for the ACE park formally ended in March when CAMT withdrew from the project.

Even before that Cumberland and Western had rebranded the site as the Rocky Mountain Center for Innovation and Technology.

Cumberland and Western invested in upgrades to the property including some tenant finishes and successfully lured Lightning eMotors Inc. (NYSE: ZEV) as a tenant. In April 2016 Cumberland and Western announced that EWI a Columbus Ohio-based organization that promotes manufacturing technologies would open an applied research center at RMCIT.

But it all wasn’t enough and Cumberland and Western opted through commercial brokerage CBRE to put the property on the market for $22.8 million in October 2020.

Loveland site sells rebrands

Cumberland and Western eventually found its buyer although not for the full asking price. In late October 2020 a group of local business owners led by Jay Dokter Josh Kamrath and Dan Kamrath purchased the 811000-square-foot property for $15.5 million under the entity RMCIT LLC.

Dokter CEO of Loveland-based Vergent Products Inc. and his partners began working to increase occupancy from an anemic 16%.

The new owners quickly got to work rebranding the property as the Forge Campus in March 2021.

“We just observed all of the potential that didn’t happen and thought ‘We could do that’” Dokter said. “What we saw was 40 to 50 companies in here collocated creating an innovative tech environment. And the price was right too. So we knew that it wasn’t as risky. We also saw building prices were going up for a lot of commercial.”

Cumberland and Western’s initial approach to the property was to secure a single large occupant Dokter said.

Jay Dokter and other investors acquired most of the former Hewlett-Packard Co. campus in Loveland for $15.5 million and are breathing new life into the facility. Christopher Wood/BizWest

“I think there was a fair amount of activity. They seemed to be going more for the grand slam one occupant and that market is extremely limited” he said adding that Cumberland did refocus to allow smaller companies in.

The vision of Dokter and his partners was clear from the beginning: Create an environment in which occupants would build an innovation ecosystem interacting and feeding off of one another.

The owners moved one of their own companies into the Forge — Bongo which provides video-assessment solutions for experiential learning. The investors also plan to relocate another of their companies Vergent Products a contract design and manufacturing company into the facility within a couple of years.

Dokter said one of the key advantages of the Loveland property was the maintenance that Cumberland and Western provided for almost a decade.

Often vacant properties are allowed to decay with damage by weather vandalism and neglect. Not so with the Loveland site. Cumberland and Western continued to employ a team of one part-time worker and three full-time workers to maintain the property and conduct real estate tours.

“The cool thing with Cumberland and Western is that they spent a lot of money maintaining the property” Dokter said. “I never forget the first time I came here to get a tour … there was a nice man waxing the floor over here in an empty building — one of those machines that go back and forth in an empty building. That impressed me that it was quite preserved.”

“Big buildings like this you don’t just shut the lights off and walk away” said Rob Blauvelt property manager for the Forge and one of the full-time workers who maintained the property during the Cumberland and Western years.

Cumberland and Western maintained a contract for upkeep of the 22 acres of roof. Landscaping was maintained although at a lower level than when the property was occupied. Cracks in parking lots were filled. HVAC systems were maintained.

“It was three and a half people watching an empty building for 11 years” Dokter said.

The property’s 16% occupancy at the time of purchase included 12 tenants but that number has doubled to 24. Another five tenants are housed on-site in The Warehouse accelerator a nonprofit organization that occupies 48000 square feet of donated space.

Allison Seabeck executive director of The Warehouse said the organization has three alumni members and three off-site members along with the five onsite members.

A capital campaign has raised $1.1 million out of a $4.8 million capital raise allowing the organization to add a staff member and proceed through Phase I of its construction plan creating space for nine companies.

Phase II of the capital campaign entails raising another $1.25 millon including $750000 to create space for 15 more companies including installation of a series of “garage pods” in the accelerator space providing turnkey manufacturing space for startups that need access to manufacturing floor space equipment ample power compressed air and other features.

Future expansions will include further buildout including community space a training room additional equipment a share marketing studio and other amenities.

Including The Warehouse occupancy at the Forge stands at 54% Dokter said with other leases pending.

One recent addition is Veloce Energy Inc. a Los Angeles-based company that produces modular devices to make electrification easier.

Veloce moved its Colorado location from north Fort Collins into the Forge campus in May. The company employs 12 people locally.

Additionally E.I. Medical Imaging a trade name for OrcaWest Holdings Inc. will move into the Forge. E.I. Medical Imaging develops real-time ultrasound devices for use by veterinarians and livestock producers.

Lightning eMotors which Cumberland and Western first brought to the site has expanded rapidly growing from 142386 square feet when Dokter and his team acquired the property to 250000 square feet and 260 employees. The company provides commercial electric vehicles for fleets and went public in 2021.

The Forge thus far has a mix of large clean-tech and other manufacturing companies.

“They’re more complimentary than you would think” Dokter said of the tenant mix. “That is the whole idea. We want to do more and more mixing and explaining who does what.”

With Vergent Products Dokter already has two clients within the Forge with another three potential clients. That cross-pollination can be seen among other tenants as well he said.

One additional amenity will foster even more interaction: The Forge soon will reopen the old HP cafeteria bringing a variety of local restaurant and catering companies in to provide a mix of dining options.

Blauvelt stressed the quality of the construction that is attractive for potential manufacturers.

“What you have here are structurally sound buildings with solid floors with a massive amount of power a massive amount of heating and cooling water a good amount of compressed air infrastructure for process vacuum … and you have a campus that’s just inviting as a workplace” Blauvelt said.

“This thing has awesome bones” he added “and it’s really easy to fit a business into here. It’s not very challenging to fit a complex operation into this space.”

And that 22 acres of roofs? Future plans call for installation of solar panels further emphasizing the site’s focus on clean technologies.

Stability characterizes Fort Collins site

No city in Northern Colorado has maintained as much of HP’s legacy operations as has Fort Collins a site that opened in 1978 and employed as many as 3200 HP workers at its peak.

In fact HP — both Hewlett Packard Enterprise and HP Inc. — remain prominent employers on the campus located on the northeast corner of East Harmony and Ziegler roads — with HP Inc. leasing space within Hewlett Packard Enterprise’s two buildings on 71.5 acres.

Hewlett Packard Enterprise’s operations there employ 800 workers and are varied.

“The Fort Collins site houses a range of business units and functions — from servers to R&D to marketing. It’s a multi-use facility and not dedicated to any specific part of the company” Adam Bauer a spokesman for HPE said in an email to BizWest.

The Fort Collins campus sits on the East Harmony Road corridor the focal point of a cluster of high-tech companies that includes Broadcom Intel Corp. Advanced Micro Devices and others. “Certainly having other tech players with whom we partner and do business in close proximity helps create an ecosystem that is mutually beneficial” he said. “That’s true in Fort Collins Silicon Valley Houston — everywhere we have a large presence.”

Bauer said that Fort Collins “is an important location for HPE and again is host to a range of business units and functions that span the company. It remains one of our biggest employment hubs in the U.S. and is an important part of our history. We do not anticipate any change to Fort Collins’ role in the company at this time. We actually are in the process of renovating the site to accommodate our hybrid Edge-to-Office working model that arose out of the pandemic.”

HPE leases space to HP Inc. which did not respond to BizWest requests for comment. The city of Fort Collins estimates that HP Inc. employs 1100 local workers but that number could not be verified.

HPE in April 2019 sold a building on the Fort Collins campus — at 3420 E. Harmony Road — to an entity owned by McWhinney Real Estate Services Inc. of Loveland for $21 million. Bauer declined to speculate on any plans to sell additional properties.

“We continuously evaluate our real estate portfolio based on a variety of criteria including usage opportunities for cost optimization and other factors” he said. “I can’t speculate on future real estate transactions.”

The McWhinney building is largely vacant although fully leased. Madwire formerly occupied the third floor and a first-floor gym space but the company has put the space on the sublease market although it continues to pay rent.

Additionally Comcast Corp. (Nasdaq: CMCSA) has vacated 80000 square feet within the building. The company had opened a call center in 2016 with plans to house up to 600 employees.

But those plans changed in September 2019 when the company announced closure of the operation. Comcast’s lease expires in 2027 with the space put up for sublease.

A federal contractor based in Maryland ASRC or Arctic Slope Regional Corp. leased 31000 square feet of the Comcast space in August 2020. The company operates as a contractor to federal intelligence aerospace and health-care information-technology agencies.

Comcast closed its Fort Collins call center in late 2019. Ken Amundson/BizWest

Micro Focus a spinoff of Hewlett Packard Enterprise occupies about 16000 square feet in the building.

Peter Kast a broker with CBRE who is listing space in the building for sublease said the campus and other corners of East Harmony and Ziegler roads benefit from infrastructure put in place to serve HP.

“If you look at it from an infrastructure point of view it’s one of the few places in town that has redundant fiber and redundant fiber so people like this that have needs for those kinds of things there’s not that many choices so in terms of an infrastructure location it’s great” he said.

He noted that HPE HP Broadcom Intel AMD and other high-tech companies in the area capitalize on a concentration of skilled workers.

“The thing that’s so attractive about Fort Collins for these guys is the intellectual capital the people who do this kind of work who are trained to handle whether it’s software or hardware design” he said. “We’ve got a ton of people who do chip design in this town.”

The biggest player in that space locally is Broadcom which has continued to invest in its Fort Collins operation. Although the city of Fort Collins estimates that Broadcom employs 1150 workers locally the company told BizWest in 2019 that it employed 1747 including 1313 employees and 434 contingent workers.

Broadcom owns a large swathe of the former HP campus with its predecessor Avago completing several major expansions.

The company in its most-recent quarterly report filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission cited ongoing supply-chain disruptions brought on by the COVID-19 pandemic and highlighted the importance of the Fort Collins operation.

“We have been and expect to continue experiencing some disruption to parts of our global semiconductor supply chain including procuring necessary components and inputs such as wafers and substrates in a timely fashion with suppliers increasing lead times or placing products on allocation and raising prices” the company reported noting shutdowns at key suppliers and service providers around the world.

“Any similar disruption at our Fort Collins Colorado manufacturing facility would severely impact our ability to manufacture our film bulk acoustic resonator (“FBAR”) products and adversely affect our wireless business” the company said.

Despite those challenges Broadcom HP and related companies remain key components of the Fort Collins economy.

SeonAh Kendall senior economic manager for the city of Fort Collins said Hewlett Packard Broadcom and other companies in the East Harmony Road corridor are “going strong.”

“We are seeing that they’re kind of staying in the area and growing with spinoffs in there as well” she said. “I do think that it is a critical piece for us in terms of the employment as well as the contributions that the companies as well as employees have in our community.

“There are opportunities for additional growth in those locations” she added “and opportunities for a lot of collaboration. I think one of the greatest strengths is that we’re able to retain the talent here. Sometimes we have seen folks leave AMD and go to Intel or leave Intel and go to HP and vice versa.”

She noted that companies in the area work closely with Colorado State University Front Range Community College and the Poudre School District on issues such as talent and retention.

Greeley facility sees different fate

Greeley’s Hewlett-Packard facility was the last to be built the first to close and the only one to be torn down — at least most of it.

The facility opened in 1984 focused on scanners tape drives and other devices but HP closed the operation in 2003 shifting what was then 800 workers to other locations. About 640 workers were transferred to Fort Collins with another 165 shifting to Flextronics International Ltd. Flextronics purchased DII Group Inc. which was buying HP’s tape-storage manufacturing business.

HP put the property on the market and seemed to attract widespread interest at first including for a potential expansion of Aims Community College. But that and other deals fell through prompting HP to sell the building to a group of local investors. HP sold the 355000-square-foot property on 157 acres in August 2004 to Boomerang Properties LLC headed by local investors Bruce Deifik and Jeff Bedingfield a Greeley attorney. The purchase price was $8 million far lower than HP’s $14 million asking price.

“Up to this point HP has not been willing to divide the property or divide the facility” Bedingfield told the Northern Colorado Business Report a predecessor to BizWest in August 2004. “Their desire is to sell everything and let the buyer determine how best to use it.”

Boomerang intended to subdivide the HP building to support perhaps four smaller tenants.

“There’s been a lot of talk that you can’t get big blocks leased that the best thing is to bulldoze the facility” Bedingfield said in 2004. “It’s too fine of a facility to begin talking about any kind of changes to that place other than demising it into large blocks.”

But the new owners also envisioned that surrounding acreage would be transformed into residential neighborhoods retail centers and office uses.

The project soon was taken over by City Center West LP a Denver development company affiliated with Westside Investment Partners Inc. which acquired the building and adjacent acreage for $8.36 million in 2007. Some holdings were owned and developed under the umbrella of BV Retail Land Holdings LLP.

City Center West began selling acreage for retail residential and other uses:

In 2011 the company sold 12 acres to a North Colorado Medical Center/Banner Health entity for $2.34 million. Banner continues to own the vacant land.

In 2014 City Center West launched a commercial development on the northeast corner of 71st Avenue and West 10th Street eventually adding a Bank of Colorado branch McDonald’s Breeze Thru Car Wash and a Les Schwab tire center.

Developers of a self-storage facility purchased land along 71st Avenue. That property now houses Boomerang Self Storage.

That property now houses Boomerang Self Storage. A memory-care facility Windsong at Northridge was built along 71st Avenue.

A chunk of the HP building — the cafeteria and events center — was redeveloped into the West Ridge Academy at 6905 Eighth St.

City Center West continues to own residential land on the former HP campus but sold the remaining vacant building and some acreage to LaSalle Investors LLC a unit of Waltel Cos. Inc. LaSalle demolished the remaining HP building preparing the site for future development.

But the company faces opposition to plans to rezone the property from Industrial – Low Intensity to Residential – High Density. About 10 neighboring residents voiced opposition to the rezoning request at a June 7 Greeley City Council meeting.

Residents voiced fears that LaSalle planned to build a large apartment complex on the property which they said could exacerbate existing traffic problems.

Several City Council members also voiced opposition to the R-H zoning preferring a less-intensive Residential – Medium Density zoning.

“It’s just too intense right now” Councilman Dale Hall said. “I’m uncomfortable making this R-H. I’m OK with Residential Medium Intensity.”

In the end LaSalle’s attorney asked that the council continue the discussion to the July 19 City Council meeting.

Greeley’s westward expansion

Why Greeley’s HP facility faced such a different outcome than campuses in Fort Collins and Loveland can be attributed to a variety of factors.

First the technology sector in Greeley has never developed to the scale of Fort Collins’ or Loveland which enjoy closer proximity to Colorado State University. Even before HP’s closure Greeley had seen the departure of home-grown printed-circuit-board manufacturer EFTC Corp. founded in Greeley as Electronic Fab Technology Corp. which left for the north Denver suburbs.

But the greatest factor seems to be the pattern of Greeley’s residential and commercial growth which has pushed inexorably westward for several decades.

Benjamin Snow director of economic health and housing for the city of Greeley said the area around “the core of the apple” meaning the HP building has transformed.

HP’s Greeley facility was once on the city’s outskirts with little nearby retail and far less residential development.

“When you look at what’s happened over the last 10 years out there it has sort of defaulted to what I would describe as typical suburban growth” Snow said pointing to the King Soopers and other retail development across 10th Street as well as retail and residential projects on former HP land surrounding the building.

He noted that for years he and his predecessors in the economic-development community sought to preserve the industrial zoning for the building as a way to balance the city’s housing stock with a solid employment center.

“It just never took” he said. “We never could get a secondary use in there … At some point you have to listen to the market signals.”

Although many potential users toured the facility one obstacle he said was that the building had fallen into disrepair.

“Once people went in because that building essentially had been neglected and abandoned for so long … it was kind of a magnet for that kind of vandalism. There was evidence that people were inside the building at different times.”

“Greeley has tried for 20 years to get some industrial users to reinhabit to reanimate that building to no avail” he said.

But the cast of the hit Paramount Network drama is notoriously tight-lipped and won't reveal any spoilers (we've tried). With production of season 5 underway in Montana excitement for the November 13 return is at a fever-pitch and no photo shared on Instagram is safe from scrutiny.

That is certainly the case with Kelly Reilly's recent Instagram story. The British actress who stars as Beth Dutton is fairly quiet on social media so when she does post her fans take notice. Along with some scenic photos of the Montana countryside she shared a photo of some season 5 scripts.

Taste of Country points to some industrious Reddit users who studied the photo for clues and they came up with some interesting details about the upcoming season including the episode titles on the scripts. Here's what they found:

Episode 1: ""One Hundred Years is Nothing""

Episode 2: ""The Sting of Wisdom""

Episode 4: ""Horses in Heaven""

Episode 5: ""Watch ‘Em Ride Away""

Episode 6: ""Cigarettes Whiskey a Meadow and You""

Interestingly the script for episode 3 is not shown. It's possible that Kelly doesn't appear in that episode or it may just not have made it in the photo! All of the scripts look to be written by Taylor Sheridan who has written every other episode of the show so far.

Episode titles may not give us much to go on (although ""One Hundred Years is Nothing"" could be a reference to the new 1923 spinoff starring Helen Mirren and Harrison Ford) but we'll take what we can get until the show returns later this year.

The 7-time national champion claimed that Jackson State — coached by Sanders — ""paid a guy a million dollars"" to play for their team and went unpunished.

The comments were related to those made by Saban alleging that Texas A&M ""bought every play on their team"" in the new NIL environment.

Sanders and A&M both responded with strong statements of their own and there were rumors that we may have seen the last of the famous ""Aflac"" commercials featuring Deion and Saban.

But that doesn't appear to be the case as the two reunited on set for another ad.

“Jackson State paid a guy a million dollars last year that was a really good Division I player to come to school. It was in the paper. They bragged about it! Nobody did anything about it” Saban said via AL.com.

Saban didn't mention the player by name but he may have been alluding to cornerback Travis Hunter the No. 1 player in the 2022 recruiting class.

Prime said he wanted to talk it out with Saban — but with witnesses.

“I haven’t talked to Coach Saban. I’m sure he’s tried to call. We need to talk publicly — not privately” Sanders said at the time.

“What you said was public. That doesn’t require a conversation. Let’s talk publicly and let everybody hear the conversation. You can’t do that publicly and call privately.”

Despite the comments which Saban has apologized for in part Sanders says he still has a lot of respect for the 7-time national champion.

""No no no. I still love him"" Sanders said.

Hewlett Packard Enterprise owns two buildings on the Fort Collins campus totaling 580000 square feet. Christopher Wood/BizWest

Sixty years after Hewlett-Packard Co. employees first began moving into Building A on the company’s new Loveland campus in October 1962 the company that once grew to employ more than 9000 workers in Loveland Fort Collins and Greeley does not have the presence that it once did.

Today HP’s successor companies — Hewlett-Packard Enterprise Co. (NYSE: HPE) and HP Inc. (NYSE: HPQ) — occupy 580000 square feet in Fort Collins with HPE employing 800 people. (HP Inc. did not respond to requests for information.)

But HP’s legacy extends far beyond that footprint from spinoff companies that continue to employ thousands of workers to the real estate that HP left behind.

SPONSORED CONTENT Business Cares: May 2024 As Mental Health Awareness Month unfolds in Colorado it serves as a reminder of the collective responsibility to prioritize mental well-being.

Much of the Fort Collins campus is now owned by Broadcom which essentially is a spinoff of a spinoff i.e. HP’s spinoff of Agilent Technologies Inc. which then sold its Semiconductor Products Group to an investment group creating Avago Technologies Inc. which acquired Broadcom in 2015.

No HP employees remain at the Loveland site where it all started but another spinoff of a spinoff — Keysight Technologies Inc. (NYSE: KEYS) which grew out of Agilent in 2014 — maintains an operation there.

In Greeley nothing remains of an HP operation that was once the center of the city’s nascent tech sector.

HP’s three Northern Colorado campuses have witnessed far different fates since the company began divesting local operations and selling local properties with tech remaining the driving force in Fort Collins and tech and manufacturing enjoying a resurgence at what was the Loveland campus. Greeley however has seen demolition of the long-vacant HP building with the bulk of the acreage transformed for residential retail and other uses.

Loveland

Hewlett-Packard Co.’s history in Northern Colorado began in Loveland but it almost didn’t start that way. Loveland had to compete with Boulder for an HP expansion but problems with potential Boulder sites — and a strong pitch from Loveland civic and business leaders — prompted Colorado native David Packard and other HP executives to select Loveland instead according to an HP Computer Museum post on the history of the Loveland plant.

The plant — with a temporary building opening in 1960 and the first permanent building in 1962 — initially produced power supplies but eventually began producing desktop computers and calculators. HP’s Loveland operation also produced a variety of computer peripherals including printers and instruments such as voltmeters.

The campus — on the northeast corner of South Taft Avenue and 14th Street Southwest — remained a bastion for HP’s global operations for decades but change began in the late 1990s.

HP spun off Agilent in 1998 and by 2005 only 500 people remained at the Loveland site according to the HP Computer Museum.

The Thompson School District purchased the former Hewlett-Packard Co. building that once housed Colorado Memory Systems. Christopher Wood/BizWest

The Thompson School District acquired one building on the former HP/Agilent campus in 2004 an 88000-square-foot building at 800 S. Taft Ave. that was formerly home to Colorado Memory Systems Inc. which built the structure in 1984. Colorado Memory Systems was founded by former HP employee Bill Bierwaltes. The company manufactured computer tape backup systems and was acquired by HP in 1992.

The school district purchased the building for $4.7 million and now uses it for its headquarters.

Just to the east is Keysight Technologies at 900 S. Taft Ave. Keysight spun off from Agilent in 2014 developing test and measurement equipment.

Keysight’s Loveland building encompasses more than 139000 square feet.

Kari Fauber vice president of Keysight’s global partner sales and ecommerce told BizWest in an email that the Loveland facility is “primarily a research and development site but also hosts teams from legal sales marketing finance logistics and services.

“Keysight delivers advanced design and validation solutions that help accelerate innovation to connect and secure the world” she said. “Keysight’s dedication to speed and precision extends to software-driven insights and analytics that bring tomorrow’s technology products to market faster across the development lifecycle in design simulation prototype validation automated software testing manufacturing analysis and network performance optimization and visibility in enterprise service provider and cloud environments.”

Keysight’s customers span the worldwide communications and industrial ecosystems aerospace and defense automotive energy semiconductor and general electronics markets Fauber said.

Keysight also maintains operations in Colorado Springs and Boulder. It acquired Eggplant Software Inc. with U.S. headquarters in Boulder in 2020 for $330 million.

Keysight employs 14300 worldwide and employed about 300 people in Loveland at the time of the spinoff from Agilent. The company recorded revenue of $4.94 billion in 2021.

With Agilent’s retrenchment in Loveland the company negotiated a deal in May 2011 to sell the bulk of the Loveland campus to the city for $5.8 million.

Plans to revitalize the campus were ambitious with the Colorado Association of Manufacturing and Technology eventually selecting the site in June 2011 for an Aerospace and Clean Energy Manufacturing and Innovation Park known as ACE. The project was touted as creating up to 10000 jobs.

But the proposal faltered early on with developer United Properties withdrawing from the project in August 2011 citing unattainable timelines.

Loveland then selected Bowling Green Kentucky-based developer Cumberland and Western to develop the property with the city selling the property to the company for $5 million.

Plans for the ACE park formally ended in March when CAMT withdrew from the project.

Even before that Cumberland and Western had rebranded the site as the Rocky Mountain Center for Innovation and Technology.

Cumberland and Western invested in upgrades to the property including some tenant finishes and successfully lured Lightning eMotors Inc. (NYSE: ZEV) as a tenant. In April 2016 Cumberland and Western announced that EWI a Columbus Ohio-based organization that promotes manufacturing technologies would open an applied research center at RMCIT.

But it all wasn’t enough and Cumberland and Western opted through commercial brokerage CBRE to put the property on the market for $22.8 million in October 2020.

Loveland site sells rebrands

Cumberland and Western eventually found its buyer although not for the full asking price. In late October 2020 a group of local business owners led by Jay Dokter Josh Kamrath and Dan Kamrath purchased the 811000-square-foot property for $15.5 million under the entity RMCIT LLC.

Dokter CEO of Loveland-based Vergent Products Inc. and his partners began working to increase occupancy from an anemic 16%.

The new owners quickly got to work rebranding the property as the Forge Campus in March 2021.

“We just observed all of the potential that didn’t happen and thought ‘We could do that’” Dokter said. “What we saw was 40 to 50 companies in here collocated creating an innovative tech environment. And the price was right too. So we knew that it wasn’t as risky. We also saw building prices were going up for a lot of commercial.”

Cumberland and Western’s initial approach to the property was to secure a single large occupant Dokter said.

Jay Dokter and other investors acquired most of the former Hewlett-Packard Co. campus in Loveland for $15.5 million and are breathing new life into the facility. Christopher Wood/BizWest

“I think there was a fair amount of activity. They seemed to be going more for the grand slam one occupant and that market is extremely limited” he said adding that Cumberland did refocus to allow smaller companies in.

The vision of Dokter and his partners was clear from the beginning: Create an environment in which occupants would build an innovation ecosystem interacting and feeding off of one another.

The owners moved one of their own companies into the Forge — Bongo which provides video-assessment solutions for experiential learning. The investors also plan to relocate another of their companies Vergent Products a contract design and manufacturing company into the facility within a couple of years.

Dokter said one of the key advantages of the Loveland property was the maintenance that Cumberland and Western provided for almost a decade.

Often vacant properties are allowed to decay with damage by weather vandalism and neglect. Not so with the Loveland site. Cumberland and Western continued to employ a team of one part-time worker and three full-time workers to maintain the property and conduct real estate tours.

“The cool thing with Cumberland and Western is that they spent a lot of money maintaining the property” Dokter said. “I never forget the first time I came here to get a tour … there was a nice man waxing the floor over here in an empty building — one of those machines that go back and forth in an empty building. That impressed me that it was quite preserved.”

“Big buildings like this you don’t just shut the lights off and walk away” said Rob Blauvelt property manager for the Forge and one of the full-time workers who maintained the property during the Cumberland and Western years.

Cumberland and Western maintained a contract for upkeep of the 22 acres of roof. Landscaping was maintained although at a lower level than when the property was occupied. Cracks in parking lots were filled. HVAC systems were maintained.

“It was three and a half people watching an empty building for 11 years” Dokter said.

The property’s 16% occupancy at the time of purchase included 12 tenants but that number has doubled to 24. Another five tenants are housed on-site in The Warehouse accelerator a nonprofit organization that occupies 48000 square feet of donated space.

Allison Seabeck executive director of The Warehouse said the organization has three alumni members and three off-site members along with the five onsite members.

A capital campaign has raised $1.1 million out of a $4.8 million capital raise allowing the organization to add a staff member and proceed through Phase I of its construction plan creating space for nine companies.

Phase II of the capital campaign entails raising another $1.25 millon including $750000 to create space for 15 more companies including installation of a series of “garage pods” in the accelerator space providing turnkey manufacturing space for startups that need access to manufacturing floor space equipment ample power compressed air and other features.

Future expansions will include further buildout including community space a training room additional equipment a share marketing studio and other amenities.

Including The Warehouse occupancy at the Forge stands at 54% Dokter said with other leases pending.

One recent addition is Veloce Energy Inc. a Los Angeles-based company that produces modular devices to make electrification easier.

Veloce moved its Colorado location from north Fort Collins into the Forge campus in May. The company employs 12 people locally.

Additionally E.I. Medical Imaging a trade name for OrcaWest Holdings Inc. will move into the Forge. E.I. Medical Imaging develops real-time ultrasound devices for use by veterinarians and livestock producers.

Lightning eMotors which Cumberland and Western first brought to the site has expanded rapidly growing from 142386 square feet when Dokter and his team acquired the property to 250000 square feet and 260 employees. The company provides commercial electric vehicles for fleets and went public in 2021.

The Forge thus far has a mix of large clean-tech and other manufacturing companies.

“They’re more complimentary than you would think” Dokter said of the tenant mix. “That is the whole idea. We want to do more and more mixing and explaining who does what.”

With Vergent Products Dokter already has two clients within the Forge with another three potential clients. That cross-pollination can be seen among other tenants as well he said.

One additional amenity will foster even more interaction: The Forge soon will reopen the old HP cafeteria bringing a variety of local restaurant and catering companies in to provide a mix of dining options.

Blauvelt stressed the quality of the construction that is attractive for potential manufacturers.

“What you have here are structurally sound buildings with solid floors with a massive amount of power a massive amount of heating and cooling water a good amount of compressed air infrastructure for process vacuum … and you have a campus that’s just inviting as a workplace” Blauvelt said.

“This thing has awesome bones” he added “and it’s really easy to fit a business into here. It’s not very challenging to fit a complex operation into this space.”

And that 22 acres of roofs? Future plans call for installation of solar panels further emphasizing the site’s focus on clean technologies.

Stability characterizes Fort Collins site

No city in Northern Colorado has maintained as much of HP’s legacy operations as has Fort Collins a site that opened in 1978 and employed as many as 3200 HP workers at its peak.

In fact HP — both Hewlett Packard Enterprise and HP Inc. — remain prominent employers on the campus located on the northeast corner of East Harmony and Ziegler roads — with HP Inc. leasing space within Hewlett Packard Enterprise’s two buildings on 71.5 acres.

Hewlett Packard Enterprise’s operations there employ 800 workers and are varied.

“The Fort Collins site houses a range of business units and functions — from servers to R&D to marketing. It’s a multi-use facility and not dedicated to any specific part of the company” Adam Bauer a spokesman for HPE said in an email to BizWest.

The Fort Collins campus sits on the East Harmony Road corridor the focal point of a cluster of high-tech companies that includes Broadcom Intel Corp. Advanced Micro Devices and others. “Certainly having other tech players with whom we partner and do business in close proximity helps create an ecosystem that is mutually beneficial” he said. “That’s true in Fort Collins Silicon Valley Houston — everywhere we have a large presence.”

Bauer said that Fort Collins “is an important location for HPE and again is host to a range of business units and functions that span the company. It remains one of our biggest employment hubs in the U.S. and is an important part of our history. We do not anticipate any change to Fort Collins’ role in the company at this time. We actually are in the process of renovating the site to accommodate our hybrid Edge-to-Office working model that arose out of the pandemic.”

HPE leases space to HP Inc. which did not respond to BizWest requests for comment. The city of Fort Collins estimates that HP Inc. employs 1100 local workers but that number could not be verified.

HPE in April 2019 sold a building on the Fort Collins campus — at 3420 E. Harmony Road — to an entity owned by McWhinney Real Estate Services Inc. of Loveland for $21 million. Bauer declined to speculate on any plans to sell additional properties.

“We continuously evaluate our real estate portfolio based on a variety of criteria including usage opportunities for cost optimization and other factors” he said. “I can’t speculate on future real estate transactions.”

The McWhinney building is largely vacant although fully leased. Madwire formerly occupied the third floor and a first-floor gym space but the company has put the space on the sublease market although it continues to pay rent.

Additionally Comcast Corp. (Nasdaq: CMCSA) has vacated 80000 square feet within the building. The company had opened a call center in 2016 with plans to house up to 600 employees.

But those plans changed in September 2019 when the company announced closure of the operation. Comcast’s lease expires in 2027 with the space put up for sublease.

A federal contractor based in Maryland ASRC or Arctic Slope Regional Corp. leased 31000 square feet of the Comcast space in August 2020. The company operates as a contractor to federal intelligence aerospace and health-care information-technology agencies.

Micro Focus a spinoff of Hewlett Packard Enterprise occupies about 16000 square feet in the building.

Peter Kast a broker with CBRE who is listing space in the building for sublease said the campus and other corners of East Harmony and Ziegler roads benefit from infrastructure put in place to serve HP.

“If you look at it from an infrastructure point of view it’s one of the few places in town that has redundant fiber and redundant fiber so people like this that have needs for those kinds of things there’s not that many choices so in terms of an infrastructure location it’s great” he said.

He noted that HPE HP Broadcom Intel AMD and other high-tech companies in the area capitalize on a concentration of skilled workers.

“The thing that’s so attractive about Fort Collins for these guys is the intellectual capital the people who do this kind of work who are trained to handle whether it’s software or hardware design” he said. “We’ve got a ton of people who do chip design in this town.”

The biggest player in that space locally is Broadcom which has continued to invest in its Fort Collins operation. Although the city of Fort Collins estimates that Broadcom employs 1150 workers locally the company told BizWest in 2019 that it employed 1747 including 1313 employees and 434 contingent workers.

Broadcom owns a large swathe of the former HP campus with its predecessor Avago completing several major expansions.

The company in its most-recent quarterly report filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission cited ongoing supply-chain disruptions brought on by the COVID-19 pandemic and highlighted the importance of the Fort Collins operation.

“We have been and expect to continue experiencing some disruption to parts of our global semiconductor supply chain including procuring necessary components and inputs such as wafers and substrates in a timely fashion with suppliers increasing lead times or placing products on allocation and raising prices” the company reported noting shutdowns at key suppliers and service providers around the world.

“Any similar disruption at our Fort Collins Colorado manufacturing facility would severely impact our ability to manufacture our film bulk acoustic resonator (“FBAR”) products and adversely affect our wireless business” the company said.

Despite those challenges Broadcom HP and related companies remain key components of the Fort Collins economy.

SeonAh Kendall senior economic manager for the city of Fort Collins said Hewlett Packard Broadcom and other companies in the East Harmony Road corridor are “going strong.”

“We are seeing that they’re kind of staying in the area and growing with spinoffs in there as well” she said. “I do think that it is a critical piece for us in terms of the employment as well as the contributions that the companies as well as employees have in our community.

“There are opportunities for additional growth in those locations” she added “and opportunities for a lot of collaboration. I think one of the greatest strengths is that we’re able to retain the talent here. Sometimes we have seen folks leave AMD and go to Intel or leave Intel and go to HP and vice versa.”

She noted that companies in the area work closely with Colorado State University Front Range Community College and the Poudre School District on issues such as talent and retention.

Greeley facility sees different fate

Greeley’s Hewlett-Packard facility was the last to be built the first to close and the only one to be torn down — at least most of it.

The facility opened in 1984 focused on scanners tape drives and other devices but HP closed the operation in 2003 shifting what was then 800 workers to other locations. About 640 workers were transferred to Fort Collins with another 165 shifting to Flextronics International Ltd. Flextronics purchased DII Group Inc. which was buying HP’s tape-storage manufacturing business.

HP put the property on the market and seemed to attract widespread interest at first including for a potential expansion of Aims Community College. But that and other deals fell through prompting HP to sell the building to a group of local investors. HP sold the 355000-square-foot property on 157 acres in August 2004 to Boomerang Properties LLC headed by local investors Bruce Deifik and Jeff Bedingfield a Greeley attorney. The purchase price was $8 million far lower than HP’s $14 million asking price.

“Up to this point HP has not been willing to divide the property or divide the facility” Bedingfield told the Northern Colorado Business Report a predecessor to BizWest in August 2004. “Their desire is to sell everything and let the buyer determine how best to use it.”

Boomerang intended to subdivide the HP building to support perhaps four smaller tenants.

“There’s been a lot of talk that you can’t get big blocks leased that the best thing is to bulldoze the facility” Bedingfield said in 2004. “It’s too fine of a facility to begin talking about any kind of changes to that place other than demising it into large blocks.”

But the new owners also envisioned that surrounding acreage would be transformed into residential neighborhoods retail centers and office uses.

The project soon was taken over by City Center West LP a Denver development company affiliated with Westside Investment Partners Inc. which acquired the building and adjacent acreage for $8.36 million in 2007. Some holdings were owned and developed under the umbrella of BV Retail Land Holdings LLP.

City Center West began selling acreage for retail residential and other uses:

In 2011 the company sold 12 acres to a North Colorado Medical Center/Banner Health entity for $2.34 million. Banner continues to own the vacant land.

In 2014 City Center West launched a commercial development on the northeast corner of 71st Avenue and West 10th Street eventually adding a Bank of Colorado branch McDonald’s Breeze Thru Car Wash and a Les Schwab tire center.

Developers of a self-storage facility purchased land along 71st Avenue. That property now houses Boomerang Self Storage.

A chunk of the HP building — the cafeteria and events center — was redeveloped into the West Ridge Academy at 6905 Eighth St.

City Center West continues to own residential land on the former HP campus but sold the remaining vacant building and some acreage to LaSalle Investors LLC a unit of Waltel Cos. Inc. LaSalle demolished the remaining HP building preparing the site for future development.

But the company faces opposition to plans to rezone the property from Industrial – Low Intensity to Residential – High Density. About 10 neighboring residents voiced opposition to the rezoning request at a June 7 Greeley City Council meeting.

Residents voiced fears that LaSalle planned to build a large apartment complex on the property which they said could exacerbate existing traffic problems.

Several City Council members also voiced opposition to the R-H zoning preferring a less-intensive Residential – Medium Density zoning.

“It’s just too intense right now” Councilman Dale Hall said. “I’m uncomfortable making this R-H. I’m OK with Residential Medium Intensity.”

In the end LaSalle’s attorney asked that the council continue the discussion to the July 19 City Council meeting.

Greeley’s westward expansion

Why Greeley’s HP facility faced such a different outcome than campuses in Fort Collins and Loveland can be attributed to a variety of factors.

First the technology sector in Greeley has never developed to the scale of Fort Collins’ or Loveland which enjoy closer proximity to Colorado State University. Even before HP’s closure Greeley had seen the departure of home-grown printed-circuit-board manufacturer EFTC Corp. founded in Greeley as Electronic Fab Technology Corp. which left for the north Denver suburbs.

But the greatest factor seems to be the pattern of Greeley’s residential and commercial growth which has pushed inexorably westward for several decades.

Benjamin Snow director of economic health and housing for the city of Greeley said the area around “the core of the apple” meaning the HP building has transformed.

HP’s Greeley facility was once on the city’s outskirts with little nearby retail and far less residential development.

“When you look at what’s happened over the last 10 years out there it has sort of defaulted to what I would describe as typical suburban growth” Snow said pointing to the King Soopers and other retail development across 10th Street as well as retail and residential projects on former HP land surrounding the building.

He noted that for years he and his predecessors in the economic-development community sought to preserve the industrial zoning for the building as a way to balance the city’s housing stock with a solid employment center.

“It just never took” he said. “We never could get a secondary use in there … At some point you have to listen to the market signals.”

Although many potential users toured the facility one obstacle he said was that the building had fallen into disrepair.

“Once people went in because that building essentially had been neglected and abandoned for so long … it was kind of a magnet for that kind of vandalism. There was evidence that people were inside the building at different times.”

“Greeley has tried for 20 years to get some industrial users to reinhabit to reanimate that building to no avail” he said.

Oliveira (33-8 MMA 21-8 UFC) will attempt to regain the belt he lost on the scale in May when he meets Makhachev (23-4 MMA 6-4 UFC) on the Oct. 22 card at Etihad Arena on Yas Island in Abu Dhabi. The promotion announced the vacant championship bout on Saturday’s UFC on ABC 3 broadcast.

Oliveira No. 1 in the latest USA TODAY Sports/MMA Junkie lightweight rankings is currently riding an 11-fight winning streak. His involvement in title bouts began at UFC 262 in May 2021 when he knocked out Michael Chandler to claim the strap that had been relinquished by Khabib Nurmagomedov when he retired. “Do Bronx” subsequently submitted Dustin Poirier for the first defense of his reign.

But then Oliveira missed weight ahead of his scheduled title defense against Justin Gaethje at UFC 274 earlier this year and was forced to forfeit the gold. He went on to submit Gaethje and UFC president Dana White promised he would be part of the next title fight. Oliveira has since campaigned for a showdown with Conor McGregor in his next fight but he ultimately signed on for Makhachev.

No. 3 Makhachev meanwhile will bring a 10-fight winning streak into his first UFC title opportunity. The pupil of UFC Hall of Famer Khabib Nurmagomedov has been dominant outside of a lone loss in October 2015 racking up wins over the likes of Bobby Green Dan Hooker Arman Tsarukyan and Gleison Tibau.

It doesn't explain however why it closed operations on short notice leaving employees guests and creditors hanging.

WanderJaunt the Phoenix Arizona-headquartered property manager that had raised $37 million in funding and abruptly ceased operations last month is trying to sell its assets to pay off creditors Skift has learned.

In its enterprise offering memorandum which Skift obtained WanderJaunt Inc. said on July 1 it transferred its assets to an unaffiliated entity WanderJaunt LLC to run the asset sale and to pay off creditors. The asset sale is tentatively slated to run through September 8.

WanderJaunt said prior to shutting down last month it had more than 200 employees operated more than 850 properties (some with long-term leases) and did more than $35 million in annualized revenue.

Investors included Khosla Ventures and Founders Fund.

In its sales pitch to potential buyers WanderJaunt claimed “best in class unit economics” and that its first three markets namely Phoenix (launched in 2016); Austin Texas (2018); and San Diego (2019) “were all cash-flow positive.” (See charts from the asset sale offering below.)

WanderJaunt is hoping to sell its property listing/management front end and back end and its pricing algorithm.

WanderJaunt said the bidding process will be closed in that bidders will not know details about other bidders. Proceeds would go toward administering the estate and “the balance” would go to the “creditors of the estate” the offering said.

Fiskars Group headquartered in Finland with a location on Madison’s West Side said it now gives 14 weeks of fully paid parental leave to employees. Fitchburg-based Promega said it not only expanded its caregiver leave benefits (which includes new parents) to six weeks but the biotech giant also now offers coverage for fertility expenses. Promega has about 1200 employees in the Dane County area and Fiskars has under 221.

Both companies say that the impetus for offering the benefits compared with the 12 weeks of unpaid leave under state law is to remain competitive in a shifting job market — as a rising number of workers locally and nationally want more of a say in how employers support their family needs.

That’s especially true as the U.S. is the only developed country that doesn’t require paid parental leave which would standardize what workplaces offer said Sarah Halpern-Meekin UW-Madison associate professor in the Department of Human Development and Family Studies.

“The United States is exceptional globally in not having any kind of paid family and medical leave; while a few states and private employers offer these benefits most Americans have to live on savings go without or return to work right after a child’s arrival or during a family member’s illness” she said in an email.

Hopes for federal paid family and medical leave program went dark earlier this year after Democratic Sen. Joe Manchin of West Virginia said he wouldn’t vote in favor of the provision as part of the Build Back Better Act a $1.75 trillion social safety net package. He told national news outlets the program didn’t belong in the bill and that the U.S. “can’t go too far left.”

Meanwhile only 23% of civilian and private industry workers had access to paid family leave in March 2021 according to data from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. The issue disproportionately affects women who can get pregnant. Women make up 50% of the country’s workforce according to the bureau.

But many small businesses may not have the money to support paid parental leave coverage said Jason Fields president of the Madison Region Economic Partnership.

The work of governments and employers needs to go beyond offering and mandating paid leave and into building a better social safety net said Tiffany Green UW-Madison associate professor in the departments of Population Health Sciences and Obstetrics and Gynecology adding that affordable child care options and access to adequate health care for parents should be factored into that mix among other things.

“The child care market doesn’t work well for parents or child care workers — the former pay too much and have trouble finding high-quality spots and the latter earn too little” Halpern-Meekin agreed. “Paid leave can be part of addressing this issue as parents can care for their new children themselves easing some of the demands on the child care market.”

The U.S. can look to other countries with more intact social safety nets as an example she said. For paid parental leave alone Swedish workers are guaranteed up to 68 weeks to bond with their newborns according to a November 2021 Washington Post report. Japan by comparison offers 52 weeks or more and Estonia 82 weeks or more. The United Kingdom requires 39 weeks.

Even a few months’ paid parental leave can be how local employers “pay their fair share” she said adding that the longer the parents have time off the better the mental and physical well being of the family.

Making the case

The economic and health benefits for employers providing paid parental leave benefits far outweigh any detriments various Madison experts said.

“When parents and caregivers can take leave with the arrival of a new child or to take care of their own or their family member’s health needs studies find that they are more likely to stay in the labor force over time” Halpern-Meekin said citing research from several academic sources. “Added flexibility can mean that they can better juggle the demands of work and family minimizing the trade-offs they face and allowing them to continue working despite pressing family demands.”

This boosts families’ finances while also helping employers with turnover and preventing labor shortages she said.

“The economy loves stability” said Gene Dalhoff MadREP’s vice president of talent and education. “If you’re doing this for all families you’re helping to stabilize the local economy.”

Various studies also point out the health benefits of parents having time to bond with their babies. Time away additionally allows new mothers to recover from their pregnancy which puts a lot of stress on the human body Green said.

Paid parental leave benefits led to a 51% decrease in rehospitalization after a birthing event according to research from the American Psychological Association. Parents who aren’t able to take at least two months off can face more depressive symptoms as well as marital and self-esteem problems the report states. Some research even suggests that paid parental leave benefits can help reduce infant mortality rates Halpern-Meekin said.

Paid parental leave does pose some challenges for employers however according to a 2019 Brookings Institution report.

Besides there being no national standard for how to pay for benefits or duration of time off one issue is determining the proportion of employee wages to pay while they are on leave. The dollar amount the report states is often capped to focus most of the benefits on low- and middle-wage earners.

Another obstacle is job protection: whether an employee should be guaranteed a return to their old job or a comparable role after they leave.

In the homes

Samantha Gadzinski a Madison engineer who has lived in the city for around 15 years and just had her third baby has been back at her job for two weeks after taking three months of maternity leave.

“I wish I would have had more time to spend with my babies” she said. “But given the circumstances I’ve been very grateful for the 12 weeks that I got.”

Without the paid time off Gadzinski said “I would have struggled emotionally.”

“I personally have four weeks of vacation right now” she added. “I would have had to save all that. I don’t think we would have been able to survive off my husband’s income (alone).”

Jen Heyroth who has lived in Madison since 2004 and works in information technology is currently on 12 weeks of fully paid maternity leave with her first newborn. Her husband only got three weeks of paid time off to bond with the baby who was born one month premature which she said has been challenging.

When Heyroth’s husband was home “we took shifts taking care of her. It was easier on everyone’s mental health to do it that way.”

“Right now it’s ... how do we break up who is getting sleep” she said.

Katie Davy assistant director of the Yahara River Learning Center child care agency in DeForest said she was able to use four weeks of her personal time off toward her eight-week maternity leave. Davy had her daughter a year ago. She’s thankful to work for a business that “fights for all to receive more in regards to benefits and paid parental leave.”

But because Yahara River Learning Center is a small business “I can’t do everything I wish I could” director Macy Buhler said.

“Our overhead (costs) are very high and our type of business structure is like a restaurant” she said. “We don’t have the extra possible cash flow to offset that.”

‘Right thing to do’

Melissa Dunn vice president of human resources at Fiskars said moving to 14 fully covered weeks was “the right thing to do” given current circumstances for U.S. parents.

Not only is the company covering 14 fully paid weeks for birthing parents but non-birthing parents get six weeks. Adoptive parents also get six weeks and two weeks cover the placement of a foster child.

Dane County’s largest employer Verona health software company Epic Systems said it also offers paid leave options for mothers fathers and adoptive parents. Epic has about 10000 employees in the region.

Parents are eligible for 12 weeks of leave said benefits director Erin McWilliams.

Birth mothers can take six weeks at 60% of their pay and all parents receive two weeks at 50% to 75%. In addition for more paid parental leave all parents can use accrued sick time (which accrues without limitation) and part or all of their earned sabbatical McWilliams said.

“To help new parents transition back to the office we offer them the ability to return to work on a part-time basis for an additional 12 weeks” McWilliams said in an email statement.

Madison-based American Family Insurance with tens of thousands of employees nationwide gives eligible employees up to four weeks of paid time off at their regular rate to care for their newborn the company said.

Madison biomedical giant Exact Sciences with about 3500 of its staff members based in the Dane County area offers up to four months of paid parental leave to employees working over 20 hours a week (up to 12 weeks for workers employed for one year). New in 2022 the company also provides money to staff who want to build new families Exact said.

Efforts stall

Recent efforts to pass legislation that guarantees and standardizes paid parental leave at state and federal level have stalled putting added pressure on individual businesses to cover the cost of paid parental leave.

In February state Democrats introduced a bill that would make all Wisconsin workers eligible for up to 12 weeks of paid leave for personal or family illnesses and to care for a new child. But the bill in its current form failed to pass both the Republican-controlled Assembly and Senate as recently as March.

The debate continues on the Build Back Better plan which includes a month of partially paid family and medical leave for nearly every U.S. worker funded largely through general revenues. The bill most recently passed the House of Representatives according to congress.gov but that was back in December.

“Everyone needs to keep in mind that we are in competition on a global scale and the thing we are missing right now are productive workers” said MadREP’s Dalhoff. “If we continue to fall behind when it comes to employee benefits that are readily available in other countries it impacts our ability to build our workforce.”

Green energy fossil fuel jostling for Asia’s richest position – and now telecom The Ambani-Adani rivalry has reached a new sector. But this time analysts and columnists are worried. Telecom companies bled for a long time after Ambani’s entry into telecom and now Adani given his financial muscle may do a Jio on Jio.“It was too quiet to last. A sustained and brutal destruction of capital in India’s telecom industry was only just starting to give way to a period of peace and calm. The three operators who survived out of the dozen on the scene in 2016 must have been grateful for the end to a debilitating price war. Stable market shares and decent per-user revenue would support the next round of investment.So imagine the anxiety that bubbled up on the news that billionaire Gautam Adani — the port and airport owner who’s so far had nothing to do with telecom — will bid for 5G spectrum in this month’s auction” wrote Andy Mukherjee for Bloomberg.“Six years ago it was another tycoon — Mukesh Ambani — who disrupted India’s wireless market with cheap data and free calls. He’s now the market leader with 410 million subscribers. Ambani’s Jio Platforms Ltd. in which Meta Platforms Inc. and Alphabet Inc. are investors is a $95 billion enterprise 17% bigger than the hydrocarbons empire he inherited from his dad according to Jefferies” wrote Mukherjee.That’s the kind of riches telecom has brought for Ambani.Experts expect a fairly intense three-way fight — between India's largest telco Jio second-ranked Airtel and new entrant Adani for 5G airwaves — particularly in the coveted but expensive 3.3-3.67 GHz band also known as the C-band or mid-band. This could push the price of the band 10% higher than the base rate of Rs 317 crore a unit reported ET. Reliance Jio Infocomm and Bharti Airtel are expected to bid for 5G spectrum worth Rs 55000-60000 crore and Rs 45000-50000 crore respectively in the airwaves sale starting from July 26 according to analysts and industry estimates. The Adani group through unit Adani Data Networks and cash strapped Vodafone Idea (Vi) in turn may bid for spectrum worth Rs 13000-15000 crore and Rs 5000-6000 crore respectively.Experts say it is not the price of spectrum that concerns them but the potential of a bloothbath after the auction.“I would not be too worried about the end price of the spectrum because in most bands spectrum is available in fairly abundant quantities. It should be more than enough to accommodate three players. The worry is less on the bidding front but is more on the lines of what happens in future once the Adani entity gets spectrum and over a period of time starts looking at the consumer 5G market seriously” said Balaji Subramanian AVP IIFL Securities “The market does not like the fact that what was looking like a fairly lucrative market will now have a third strong player going somewhat aggressively in terms of trying to get a larger share of this pie” Subramanian told ET Now."

Apparently this recycling program has been a thing for a while now but several of us at The Verge never even knew about it until we saw this tweet from journalist Dave Zatz and thought it might be a good idea to spread the word.

Amazon’s recycling program lets you ship your small electronics for free from any UPS dropoff point (you just have to provide the packaging). Amazon then transfers the devices it receives to a licensed recycling facility and notes that it will remove or destroy any “identifying marks or personal information” during the process. Amazon still recommends performing a factory reset on your device (if it still works) before sending it in however.

According to Amazon spokesperson Saige Kolpack the company’s recycling program isn’t new — it’s actually been around “for years” and Amazon just relaunched a new page in April to make it easier for customers to find. It isn’t to be confused with Amazon’s trade-in program which lets you send in Amazon devices cellphones video games and other electronics in exchange for an Amazon gift card. You don’t get anything in return for sending in devices to be recycled other than the personal satisfaction that you’re doing a small part in helping the environment.

The program is limited to only small electronics. You can find a list of all accepted devices if you click through to Amazon’s recycling page (which is still fully functional despite looking like something you’d find on the web in 2005). This includes e-readers tablets keyboards mice video game consoles device covers cellphones fitness trackers smart home devices and more. It pretty much accepts any small device you can fit into a small box or envelope — broken or not — so long as they don’t have “swollen or leaking batteries.”

I’m already eyeing up a few devices around my house to recycle for free — like that mini speaker I thought at the time would be a great purchase from Dollar General (don't judge). And since I already have a pile of shipping boxes from my previous online purchases I can double up and recycle that plus the device.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWd1YXJkaWFuLmNvbS90ZWNobm9sb2d5LzIwMjIvanVsLzE2L2FtYXpvbi1zdHlsZS1jbG90aGluZy1zdG9yZS1jYWxpZm9ybmlh0gFZaHR0cHM6Ly9hbXAudGhlZ3VhcmRpYW4uY29tL3RlY2hub2xvZ3kvMjAyMi9qdWwvMTYvYW1hem9uLXN0eWxlLWNsb3RoaW5nLXN0b3JlLWNhbGlmb3JuaWE?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,‘Hi-tech’ underwhelming: Amazon’s IRL clothing store misses the point of shopping,"Outside Amazon’s first in-person clothing store in California Diemmi Le 22 summed up her experience: “You don’t have to talk to anybody.”

For years Amazon tried – and ultimately failed – to translate its online book business into successful brick and mortar bookstores. Dozens of stores were shuttered this spring. Now the online shopping giant is trying again this time attempting to reinvent the mall clothing store.

During the pandemic Amazon pushed past Walmart to become the number one clothing retailer in the US analysts from Wells Fargo concluded last year. The company is billing its new store as an ambitious fusion of its online shopping algorithm with an in-person shopping experience.

The first Amazon Style store which opened in Glendale California a suburb of Los Angeles in May allows customers to use a smartphone app to send clothes directly to their fitting rooms rather than carrying them around and offers additional clothing recommendations from the company’s algorithms.

Clad in company lanyards employees at the front of the store greet customers and offer help navigating the smartphone app and the store’s free WiFi and phone chargers. And there are plenty of other Amazon employees at work behind the scenes swiftly delivering new outfit picks to the “magic closet” in each dressing room.

But the store is designed to make many of its staff invisible: customers can use a dressing room touchscreen to summon a pair of pants in a different size or a shirt in a different color without having to see or speak to another human being.

“It’s something new something you’ve never seen before. It’s an experience rather than just a regular store” said Marshall Sanders 28.

‘Hi-tech’ but limited

In person Amazon Style feels a bit like what someone in the 1990s might have imagined “hi-tech” shopping would look like in 2020.

The store features a mix of known and even high-end brands such as Levi’s Vince and Theory with the more obscure brands and cheap in-house clothing lines that Amazon customers are used to finding on the website. There are racks of $200 or $300 blouses in a “premium” section but more racks of cheaply made T-shirts in trendy prints and sack-like floral dresses.

Scan a summery floral Rebecca Taylor dress which was offered for the discounted price of $276.50 and under “related items” Amazon’s shopping app might recommend a floral dress in a similar color for $41.25.

Several customers shopping at the Glendale store said the retail store’s selection was limited and didn’t live up to the experience of shopping on Amazon’s online marketplace.

Dana Roo and Diana Guerrero both 25 had come from the west side of Los Angeles and San Diego specifically to check out the new Amazon store but were disappointed by the lack of bargains they enjoy online. For them Amazon was a place to find good “dupes” of higher-end clothes like Ugg’s fuzzy lounge sets Roo said. The brick-and-mortar store was offering only original sets.

The store’s clothing options are organized thematically in sections with names such as “rustic grace” “feminine strength” “Y2k” and more pragmatically “night out tops under $35”. The app sends an alert when the dressing room is ready and the phone unlocks the dressing room door.

The dressing rooms are bright and clean with a glowing lightstrip around the mirror and a message welcoming them by name on a touchscreen. Details about the customers’ selected clothes are on the screen as well as a list of new clothing picks including recommendations for matching tops shoes and bags to “finish the look”.

Swiping through outfit options on a touch screen is an experience straight out of Clueless though it remains to be seen whether Amazon’s algorithm will create Cher-inspired looks.

The main gimmick of Amazon Style is what one corporate director has called the “magic closet” in the fitting rooms. Close the door on the empty closet press a few buttons on the touchscreen and wait. A warning light will glow red there will be some rustlings in the closet and then a sudden glow of light around the door: open it and the clothes requested are there.

Amazon makes sure to keep the workers who fill its new magic closets out of sight: the “closet” door locks from the fitting room side when employees are at work in the closet for shoppers’ privacy according to a sign in the dressing room. The closet’s back door to the employee side is also locked from the inside.

Amazon touts that its quick clothing delivery is made possible through the “advanced technologies and processes used in Amazon fulfillment centers” which have also made headlines for years for grueling working conditions and high injury rates. So far Amazon has not let the public see what is happening in the rooms on the other side of its “magic closets”.

An Amazon press spokesperson declined a request for a behind-the-scenes tour. Asked about working conditions behind the scenes at Amazon Style the company touted what it called its competitive pay and good benefits and said that the store’s employees have the ability to try different roles throughout the store.

The human element

When Amazon announced its new clothing store concept in January ahead of the store’s official launch some critics saw it as an attempt to make human sales associates obsolete.

Many big box clothing stores are understaffed and their employees stretched too thin to provide many personal recommendations Rachel Kraus wrote in Mashable which meant that Amazon’s algorithmic shopping could be a better option for some customers. At the same time Kraus argued “I’m not sure an app telling me I’d look great in this top would give me the confidence boost that’s all part of the fun of in-person shopping.”

In a statement Amazon said that its front-of-store employees who provide customers with human recommendations and assistance were essential to the Amazon Style experience and would continue to be part of the store’s operations even as customers grew more accustomed to using the shopping app.

The Glendale store currently employs hundreds of people many of them with previous experience in the clothing industry Amazon said. Because employees at the front of the store did not have to spend time restocking sizes on the floor it suggested employees would have more time to interact with customers and provide recommendations.

Customers who had browsed inside the new California store this month praised the friendly front-of-store employees though many were divided on whether they liked the overall concept: some said they found it “really cool” and innovative others the experience was overwhelming and some said the in-store clothing selection was underwhelming compared with what they could find online.

Sanders the 28-year-old had not been a huge Amazon shopper previously but said he planned to encourage his friends to try the store.

Inside his fitting room Amazon’s algorithm offered Sanders items similar to what he had already picked – “two expensive things and two cheaper things” – and he ended up purchasing one of them he said without even realizing he had done so.

Le said the “anti-social” aspect of the store appealed to her but wasn’t a big fan of the quality of Amazon’s clothes. And she saw deeper problems: the store’s “cool concept” was also “classist” and “causes a lot of disparities” since people without smartphones would not be able to shop.

An Amazon spokesperson said that people without smartphones are welcome to shop in the store and that they would be assisted by a store employee throughout the shopping process.

This article was amended on 18 July to add comment from Amazon about the option to shop in the store without a smartphone.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnVzYXRvZGF5LmNvbS9zdG9yeS90ZWNoLzIwMjIvMDcvMTYvYW1hem9uLXJpbmctc2VjdXJpdHktZm9vdGFnZS1wb2xpY2Utc2FmZXR5LzEwMDY3NTQ5MDAyL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Amazon can send Ring footage to police without consent: 'Emergency' policy used 11 times in 2022,"Amazon has sent doorbell surveillance videos to police 11 times so far in 2022.

The videos were sent after the company received emergency requests and the company says it made ""a good-faith determination that there was an imminent danger of death or serious physical injury"" if sending the footage was delayed.

In July the numbers were sent to Massachusetts Sen. Edward Markey who has been in talks with the company about Ring security concerns since Sep. 2019.

Amazon has used a company policy that allows it to send Ring doorbell surveillance footage to police without customer consent on 11 occasions so far this year citing the presence of imminent danger a company official said in a letter to a U.S. senator this month.

The videos were disclosed in cases where ""an imminent danger of death or serious physical injury to a person"" was present wrote Amazon's vice president of public policy Brian Huseman in the letter to Sen. Edward Markey D-Mass. on July 1.

The letter states Amazon will not share customer information without consent or a warrant except in the case of an ""exigent or emergency"" circumstance which allows the company to disclose the information or footage after the company has been alerted to the incident via an emergency request form.

""In each instance Ring made a good-faith determination that there was an imminent danger of death or serious physical injury to a person requiring disclosure of information without delay"" Huseman wrote in the letter.

A Ring spokesperson told USA TODAY the company could not go into detail about the 11 cases but said legally Ring can give information to the government if the company thinks someone is in danger of death or serious physical injury such as kidnappings or attempted murder.

Discussions between the company and the Massachusetts senator began in September 2019 when Markey said the company sends suggestive language to push users to consent to disclosing doorbell footage to authorities.

""If you would like to take direct action to make your neighborhood safer this is a great opportunity"" Markey wrote at the time quoting Ring and Amazon via The Washington Post.

Tech privacy: 5 ways you’re being tracked and how to stop it

Google:Here's how to secure your Google accounts limit tracking and keep hackers out

Markey and the e-commerce company have exchanged a series of letters since the discussion began in 2019.

In his July 1 response Huseman appeared to argue that footage requests from officials don't contribute to over-policing of low-level offenses citing an audit done by a New York University's School of Law program called The Policing Project.

Police requesting home security footage from Ring ""is not the kind of continuous bulk and directly accessible surveillance that concerns us the most"" the audit reads.

""We intentionally designed these Requests for Assistance to keep control in the hands of our customers not the requesting agencies"" Huseman wrote. ""Ring does not participate in camera registry programs managed by police departments including programs that provide direct access to user devices.""

According to the audit from NYU the most common requests were for footage related to vehicle burglaries and robberies shootings home burglaries and robberies and stolen vehicles he recalled.

More than 2000 law enforcement agencies enrolled in Amazon public safety service

Huseman wrote that Amazon has a Neighbors Public Safety Service (NPSS) that connects users to safety information and in early July 2161 law enforcement agencies and 455 fire departments were enrolled.

He said all agencies that use NPSS where footage requests are made have a public profile. Users can review all posts and requests for information made by agencies.

In a statement to USA TODAY Markey said the privacy of Ring customers their neighbors and the public is ""in jeopardy because of Amazon’s growing surveillance network and quiet collaboration with law enforcement.""

""Congress needs to take action to rein in Big Tech which consistently puts profit over privacy"" he said.

A Ring spokesperson said customer privacy security and control are foundational to Ring and the company does not give anyone ""unfettered access to customer data or video.""

Sandy Carter.

Sandy Carter is the senior vice president and channel chief at Unstoppable Domains.

She says she didn't want to get left behind once Web3 takes off and that the recent crypto downturn doesn't bother her.

This is her story as told to reporter Jenna Gyimesi.

When I announced via Linkedin that I was leaving my job as a vice president at Amazon for a job in crypto I was absolutely terrified. And announcing it was more terrifying than putting in my notice.

I was leaving an amazing job with an amazing team and I thought everyone would think I had gone absolutely mad. But I was surprised that I got more than 800 comments on that LinkedIn post. And most people didn't think I was crazy.

I was around when Web2 started — the phase of the internet we're in now that is dominated by companies. And people viewed me as helping to shape it over my career at places such as IBM and Amazon. So people were very excited that I was going to go and help shape Web3 a community driven version of the internet too.

Now I'm the senior vice president and channel chief of Unstoppable Domains — a company that allows users to send receive and store cryptocurrencies and NFTs with one concise domain.

Here are 5 reasons why I gave up my incredible job at Amazon to shape the future of Web3.

1. I didn't want to get left behind

I first got interested in crypto when I was still working at Amazon. At the time I had a lot of customers who were talking to me about the value of blockchain and why it would be significant in the future of technology. So I started looking into the use cases for blockchain which led me to cryptocurrency. It became this little side project for me about a year and a half ago.

So I was looking at NFTs and metaverses and this visual image started to form in my head. Web3 is built on the blockchain. And the metaverses are built on Web3. Everything fit together and I came to a conclusion — I didn't want to be left out of the next technological evolutions as it was created. I love technology and am easily influenced by the idea of building something new and innovative. I realized quickly that I wanted to tie my career to it it was just a question of when and what I wanted to do.

2. I believe in the purpose behind Web3

I like to invest my time in projects with purpose. For example I've worked on projects related to space travel and cancer research.

When you say you work in Web3 people instantly assume that you're in it for the money. For me that wasn't the case. The concept of decentralization — where you own your data and identity — is a message I can get behind because I believe that your data should be owned by you.

At first I had to learn how blockchain technology could be trusted. I found that developers have paid special attention to keeping up the pace when it comes to security. Because of my enterprise background I needed to understand blockchain's compatibility with other business applications which is due to its open-source nature. When I started to see how blockchain technology could work in the supply chain I felt confident.

3. I fell in love with the community

If you think about it when I buy a Lazy Lion NFT I become a member of the Lazy Lion Community. In Web2 companies would produce a roadmap and share it with customers and their partners. But in Web3 we're creating the roadmap with our partners and customers because customers are a part of our membership — people are coming together as a group to make decisions. I think that's incredibly powerful.

Here's another example of the community around Web3. I built a group called Unstoppable Women of Web3. There were already multiple groups trying to raise up women in this space. And I would get these questions like ""Oh are you guys going to compete against each other?"" I was like absolutely not. We're not fighting because we're all a part of the same community. The view in Web3 is that we're all gonna make it and we all rise together. It's such a different and refreshing mindset than what I experienced in Web2.







It's truly a new way to look at the world. I think Web1 was about the internet being for the person but the tech wasn't there yet. Web2 became about companies and selling your data. And I think Web3 is going back to what we originally thought the internet would be — about community and individuals.

4. I saw that Web3 needed more women

When I first started looking around in Web3 most of the people I saw were men. I feel that there needs to be diversity built-in from the very beginning of Web3. So that's another reason I wanted to get involved.

When I announced that I was coming to Unstoppable Domains I included a link to apply to the company. We got 1500 applicants from all walks of life — different countries ages and levels of experience. But only 3% of applicants were women. That was shocking to me.

But diversity has gotten better since. For example I got 70 companies to sign up to take a pledge to prioritize diversity.

5. I see that Web3 needs to become easier to use and I think I can help

If we really want Web3 to go mainstream we'll make some improvements to make it easier for people to understand.

The user interface needs to be much much easier to use. For example I did a panel in the metaverse and it took us a couple of hours to just learn how to walk in and sit down with our avatars. And here I am in this panel and I look up and there are two people sitting on the ceiling. They started chatting with me asking ""How do I get off the ceiling?""

My dream is that we no longer have people sitting on the roof of a conference center and that it's so easy anyone can come in and use it.

The way we talk about Web3 also has to be simpler. I feel like my colleagues sometimes have 3 different words for the same thing. And it's incredibly confusing even for me. I'm really trying to push them to clean up the terminology and decide one word for each thing.

Sometimes they say I sound too Web2. For example I will say good morning when it should be gm with a little g and a little m. They also told me that Web3 people don't put pictures in their tweets.

I'm very happy with my decision to come to Web3. My dream is that digital identity is going to be a much bigger thing than it is today. I really think that everyone should learn more about Web3 and play with it — set up a wallet buy some crypto check out some discords and don't make assumptions before you do. It's so much easier to say crypto is for criminals and NFTs aren't valuable before you do the homework to figure out what it is.

The recent crypto downturn doesn't bother me. In my mind crypto doesn't equal Web3 even though they're connected. I see Web3 as impacting the internet through decentralization blockchain and digital identity. Its real power is in allowing for individual ownership of data and identity. Crypto is just one use case for blockchain technology.

I'm a builder and I'm in this for the long haul. I truly believe we are creating the next generation's internet.

In an order released Thursday the PSC affirmed two orders – one from Aug. 4 2021 and one from Oct. 12 2021 — when it approved a certificate of convenience and necessity requested by Appalachian Power and Wheeling Power for the Mitchell Power Plant the John Amos Power Plant in Putnam County and the Mountaineer Power Plant in Mason County.

The Oct. 12 order required the companies to keep the plants open until at least 2040 and charge all operational costs to West Virginia customers as long as customers in Virginia and Kentucky don’t share in capacity or energy from the plants.

The additional order gave the companies an opportunity to recover costs associated with the order as long as those costs are found to be reasonably or prudently incurred. It also required the companies to come before the PSC again for approval if there are any changes in the ownership agreement for Mitchell the Marshall County power plant co-owned by Wheeling Power and Kentucky Power.

“The Commission has explained many times that prematurely shutting down used and useful power plants with many years of remaining life would require billions of dollars in replacement costs that would be in addition to the continuing recovery of unrecovered costs already expended on those power plants” the PSC order stated.

“We have determined that such a plan is unreasonable and imprudent and in addition to the cost implications would greatly increase West Virginia’s reliance on purchases of energy which we have determined would be contrary to the interests of West Virginia customers and the economy of the State” the order continued.

West Virginia Citizen Action Group Solar United Neighbors and Energy Efficient West Virginia filed the motions asking the PSC to reconsider its earlier orders along with the PSC’s Consumer Advocate Division. West Virginia Energy Users Group and the Sierra Club also filed responses to the filings.

The groups accused the PSC of cherry-picking cost comparisons and not considering all of the costs of continuing to operate the power plants that the costs to retrofit the Mitchell plant should have been considered separately and that the PSC overstepped its statutory authority. They also questioned whether the companies provided adequate notice whether Wheeling Power had the authority to retrofit Mitchell given that it is co-owned with Kentucky Power and whether the October order violated constitutional rights to reasonable rates.

“AEP’s West Virginia customers will endure another hike in their monthly bills to prop up power plant capacity that serves Kentucky customers” said Emmett Pepper policy director for Energy Efficient West Virginia in a statement Friday. “There has been no showing that WV customers will need or use the Mitchell plant’s capacity — and we still don’t know how much this will even cost. Our state Constitution guarantees us a reasonable electricity rate — these rate hikes violate that guarantee.”

The companies sought a 1.5% rate increase on electric consumers to fund improvements to the Mitchell and the other plants to bring them in line with federal rules for wastewater and handling coal ash.

The surcharge works out to 38 cents for customers using at least 1000 kilowatts per month. The rates which kicked in last September are used to cover construction costs for the improvements.

Appalachian Power/Wheeling Power presented two different plans to the PSC last year: a $317 million plan to keep all three power plants open up to 2040 including Mitchell. The second was a $286 million plan that would keep the Amos and Mountaineer plants open but wind down Mitchell by 2028. Commissioners approved the first plan.

Appalachian Power/Wheeling Power serves more than 387000 customers across 23 counties in West Virginia.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm55dGltZXMuY29tLzIwMjIvMDcvMTUvY2xpbWF0ZS9jcnlwdG9jdXJyZW5jeS1iaXRjb2luLW1pbmluZy1lbGVjdHJpY2l0eS5odG1s0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Cryptomining Capacity in U.S. Rivals Energy Use of Houston Findings Show (Published 2022),"Seven of the largest Bitcoin mining companies in the United States are set up to use nearly as much electricity as all the homes in Houston according to data disclosed Friday as part of an investigation by congressional Democrats who say miners should be required to report their energy use.

The United States has seen an influx of cryptocurrency miners who use powerful energy-intensive computers to create and track the virtual currencies after China cracked down on the practice last year. Democrats led by Senator Elizabeth Warren are also calling for the companies to report their emissions of carbon dioxide the greenhouse gas that is the main driver of climate change.

“This limited data alone reveals that cryptominers are large energy users that account for a significant — and rapidly growing — amount of carbon emissions” Senator Warren and five other members of Congress wrote in a letter to the heads of the Environmental Protection Agency and Department of Energy. “But little is known about the full scope of cryptomining activity” they wrote.

Research has shown that a surge in cryptomining is also significantly raising energy costs for local residents and small businesses and has added to the strain on the power grid in states like Texas the letter noted.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMic2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1saXZlLmNvbS9wdWJsaWMtaW50ZXJlc3QvMjAyMi8wNy9yaXNpbmctZXYtZGVtYW5kLXB1dHMtYW1lcmljYXMtb25seS1uaWNrZWwtbWluZS1pbi10aGUtc3BvdGxpZ2h0Lmh0bWzSAYIBaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cubWxpdmUuY29tL3B1YmxpYy1pbnRlcmVzdC8yMDIyLzA3L3Jpc2luZy1ldi1kZW1hbmQtcHV0cy1hbWVyaWNhcy1vbmx5LW5pY2tlbC1taW5lLWluLXRoZS1zcG90bGlnaHQuaHRtbD9vdXRwdXRUeXBlPWFtcA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Rising EV demand puts America’s only nickel mine in the spotlight,"ISHPEMING MI — Right now 3200 feet below ground explosives are blasting apart billion-year-old rock that eventually is going to wind up in an electric vehicle.

Broken into chunks the rock now called ore takes a two-hour ride to the surface before getting trucked to a crushing mill which separates the valuable minerals within through a flotation process that produces a clumpy gray filter cake.

That concentrate is loaded onto trains and sent to Canada on its way to being smelted and refined into a sulphate used in lithium-ion batteries that power electric cars.

For nearly a decade that’s been occurring around-the-clock in Michigan’s Upper Peninsula where ore from two large deposits under the Yellow Dog Plains near Marquette accounts for 100 percent of the domestic nickel supply in the United States.

Since 2014 the Eagle Mine has put America on the map for global production of a critical mineral that’s key to reducing climate-warming carbon emissions from automobiles. The mine owned by Lundin Mining Co. of Toronto is the only place in the U.S. where nickel a mineral which helps increase energy storage in lithium-ion batteries and thus boost the range an electric car can drive on a single charge is produced.

That status has put a spotlight on Eagle Mine as growing momentum behind electric vehicle (EV) production supercharges demand for battery-grade nickel; a mineral largely sourced in countries like Russia Brazil Indonesia and the Philippines where loose environmental regulations and dirty mining practices undercut the EV market’s green ethos.

“World class nickel mines in stable political justifications are extremely rare” said Robert Johnston a research scholar at the Columbia University Center for Global Energy Policy and former CEO of Eurasia Group who runs the consulting firm’s climate and energy practice.

“They’ve done something right to bring on a major nickel mine in the eastern U.S. in a state that has high standards for environmental and social assessment of these kind of projects” Johnston said.

Environmental opposition fades in the UP

Eagle Mine has produced nickel from two ore bodies for about eight years. “Massive” and “semi-massive” ore containing between 6.5 and 1.5 percent nickel is extracted daily resulting in about 18000 tons of nickel concentrate in 2021. The mine also produces about 18000 tons of copper concentrate and a smaller volume of cobalt about 380 tons.

Today Eagle Mine is closer to the end of its life than the beginning. Unless more ore is found the mine will close in about four years. When it started production in 2014 Eagle was the first new mine in decades to open in Michigan and it was not without plenty of controversy.

The mine produces sulfide ore which must be crushed and ground to extract minerals from the waste rock which is known as tailings. Environmental groups tribes and the private Huron Mountain Club worried that sulfide acid drainage from the mine could leach into groundwater and two rivers the Salmon Trout and Yellow Dog located nearby.

Kennecott Minerals Co. discovered the Eagle deposit in 2002 and the company spent more than a decade in permitting and legal challenges that eventually petered out.

Since then “it’s been pretty quiet” said Melanie Humphrey a geology technician in the oil gas and mineral’s division at the Michigan Department of Environment Great Lakes and Energy (EGLE) which monitors the mine’s waste discharges and permit compliance. “We haven’t really received any complaints for quite some time.”

In the water resources division at EGLE Randy Conroy said the mine has been cited for minor discharge issues but “because they are very responsive and timely in their notifications and corrective actions it hasn’t really gotten escalated.”

Early concerns about the Salmon Trout River particularly for a rare species of trout called the coaster brook trout have not materialized Conroy said. “The mine discharge eventually makes it there but the monitoring is not showing it would affect those fish.”

Eagle Mine conducts its own ground and surface water monitoring but the data is verified by the Superior Watershed Partnership a nonprofit working in conjunction with the Keweenaw Bay Indian Community and the Community Foundation of Marquette County.

Lundin pays for the program and the data is posted online. The environmental testing goes beyond what’s required in the mine’s permit to include analysis of edible berries and plants of cultural importance in the area. The program has generated widespread interest and has been featured in mine engineering textbooks as an example of a best practice.

“It’s been replicated all over the world now. We’ve been contacted by different mines and universities that want to start a program like this” said Geraldine Grant a senior planner and biologist with Superior Watershed Partnership. “We get inquiries every year.”

Horst Schmidt president of the Upper Peninsula Environmental Coalition (UPEC) which opposed the mine said their group’s attention has turned to fighting a different project a proposed open pit gold mine along the Menominee River called the Back Forty.

Schmidt offered muted praise for Lundin.

“They are probably better than most of the companies I read about” Schmidt said. “They are actually a bona fide mining company and they seem to follow the rules.”

“If they can get away with something I suspect they do.”

Lundin bought the mine from Kennecott parent Rio Tinto in 2013 for $325 million. In 2016 the company began tunneling to a second ore body about a mile east and 2500 feet further down. The second deposit called Eagle East began producing nickel in 2019. The east deposit extended the mine’s lifespan from 2023 to 2025 after which the shafts would be filled in and buildings torn down. That closure date was recently extended a year to 2026 after increases in the price nickel made nearby lower-grade ore worth extracting.

Exploratory underground drilling for additional deposits is ongoing. A new discovery could extend the mine life as well as that of the Humboldt Mill a repurposed iron mine mill near Ishpeming that went through a $275 million rehabilitation to return it to functional life.

The mine and mill together employ about 400 people some of which commute from Iron Mountain Crystal Falls and Wisconsin. Jeremy Francois mill operations superintendent drives in from Pelkie about an hour to the west.

Jeff Poirier Eagle Mine’s health and safety advisor said the mine will continue to employ people even after the ore bodies are depleted.

“Once we’re done operating there’s still going to be a lot of demolition and site work that goes on. That’s going to require safety people environmental people to be here. I don’t really think of 2026 as my end date” Poirier said. “I mean there’s gonna be a lot that happens after that.”

Surging EV market creates massive nickel demand

External forces have put a spotlight on Eagle Mine.

According to global commodity research firm Roskill 36 percent of global nickel production is expected to go toward battery production by 2030 versus 6 percent in 2020. The mine has largely supplied the global market for stainless steel the largest overall use of nickel but the share going toward EV battery production is rapidly increasing.

Rising demand coupled with recent volatility in nickel pricing caused by supply concerns amid the onset of Russia’s war on Ukraine created heightened interest in Eagle Mine this year said Matt Johnson external affairs manager at Eagle Mine.

In January the mine got a big attention boost on social media when Porsche released video of a Guinness World Records effort to achieve a 3-mile altitude change in an electric car which drove from bottom of Eagle East the lowest drivable point in America across the country to Pikes Peak in Colorado the highest drivable point.

In April President Biden ordered the Department of Defense to consider five metals — lithium cobalt graphite nickel and manganese — as essential to national security under the Defense Production Act because of their importance to battery technology. Invoking the Cold War-era law to boost mineral development may result in new subsidies for domestic mining and mineral processing on which the U.S. largely relies on China and other nations.

A single point of production combined with a dearth of domestic smelting and refining capacity for battery-grade nickel “poses a supply chain risk for battery manufacturing globally not just in the United States” according to a 2021 White House supply chain review which recommended the federal government invest in a domestic nickel refinery.

“We got a lot of calls from the government state and federal asking our opinions of you know ‘what would you do for domestic planning policy’ and ‘what is your opinion on that?’” Johnson said. “We definitely have an opinion because of our experience.”

Direct inquiries also come from automakers.

“Volkswagen called last week for example” said Johnson. The mine works with universities on research into new technologies around sustainable mining.

Sustainable nickel production is of high interest to automakers as production of electric vehicles ramps up. Sales are skyrocketing for vehicles that run on batteries. From April to June this year EVs accounted for 5.6 percent of all car sales which is twice that share a year ago. Demand is outpacing supply as manufacturers struggle with shortages of crucial components like semiconductors and surging prices for battery elements like nickel and lithium.

The market transition to EVs has brought auto manufacturers into direct contact with mining companies to secure raw materials. General Motors has been signing agreements with mining companies like Glencore to source cobalt. Tesla signed a supply deal with Talon Metals for nickel from the proposed Tamarack Mine in Minnesota which has yet to successfully hurdle the permitting process and is planned to open in 2026.

In 2021 Tesla signed nickel supply deals in Australia and New Caledonia a small French territory near Fiji. Tesla CEO Elon Musk has made it clear the company wants supply from mines that produce nickel in an “environmentally-sensitive way.” In Minnesota the Tamarack project is developing a capture technology that would chemically bind carbon to rocks at the mine which would allow the company to market its nickel as carbon neutral.

Mining companies like Lundin and Rio Tinto want to be in stable jurisdictions where environmental standards are more rigid but also transparent and provide a level of certainty said Johnston at Columbia. It may take longer to become permitted in the U.S but “once you are its much less likely the government will change the terms nationalize the resources or you’ll be overrun by local protestors.”

Charles Griffith director of the Ecology Center’s climate and energy program in Ann Arbor said the accelerating EV demand creates an opportunity to modernize mining laws.

“In the U.S. we still operate under fairly ancient mining laws have not been really updated in a long time” said Griffith who works with the Clean Fuels Michigan nonprofit. “This is an opportunity to do mining in a more sustainable way and with more community engagement.”

“That’s probably more likely to happen in the U.S. than some other countries where the laws are even weaker” said Griffith.

Johnston said Eagle Mine has proven to be an exception to the conventional moan he often hears in Washington D.C. that you “just can’t build mining projects in the U.S.” because of onerous and lengthy permitting and high environmental standards.

As the world moves toward cleaner transportation “you have to acknowledge that somewhere those minerals need to be mined and is it better to do it in Michigan with a world class operation and transparency or in Congo or Indonesia where the mine is being run for economic reasons with little regard for environmental standards” Johnston said.

“If this project were going through the permitting process now I think you’d have NGOs lining up to support it.”

The Supreme Court last month limited how the nation’s main anti-air pollution law can be used to reduce carbon dioxide emissions from power plants. Then late Thursday Sen. Joe Manchin D-W.Va. said he wants to delay sweeping environmental legislation that Democrats have pushed as central to achieving Biden’s ambitious climate goals.

Biden who has pledged to cut greenhouse gas emissions in half by 2030 compared with 2005 levels said Friday that “action on climate change and clean energy remains more urgent than ever.”

If the Senate will not act to address climate change and boost clean energy “I will take strong executive action to meet this moment” Biden said in a statement from Saudi Arabia where he met Friday with Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman.

Biden did not specify what actions he will take on climate but said they will create jobs improve energy security bolster domestic manufacturing and protect consumers from oil and gas price increases. “I will not back down” he promised.

Some advocates urged Biden to use the moment to declare a national climate emergency and reinstate a ban on crude oil exports among other steps.

Declaring a climate emergency would allow Biden to redirect spending to accelerate renewable energy such as wind and solar and speed the nation’s transition away from fossil fuels such as coal oil and natural gas.

Climate advocates including some of Manchin’s Democratic colleagues in the Senate said Manchin’s announcement that he cannot back the climate provisions in the Senate bill — at least for now — frees Biden of the obligation to cater to a powerful coal-state senator eager to protect his energy-producing home state. Manchin’s vote is decisive in the evenly divided Senate where Republicans unanimously oppose climate action.

“Free at last. Let’s roll. Do it all and start it now” tweeted Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse D-R.I. who has long pushed stronger action on climate. “With legislative climate options now closed it’s now time for executive Beast Mode” Whitehouse wrote.

Whitehouse suggested a series of actions Biden could take including “a robust social cost of carbon rule″ that would force energy producers to account for greenhouse gas emissions as a cost of doing business. The senator also urged Biden to require major polluters to use technology to capture carbon dioxide emissions and impose stronger pollution controls on cars light trucks and heavy-duty vehicles.

Advocates also urged Biden to reject all onshore and offshore drilling on federal lands and in federal waters — a step he promised during the 2020 campaign but has not enacted — and restrict approval of natural gas pipelines and other fossil fuel projects.

“For too long we’ve been waiting on a single legislative package to save us and a single legislator to determine our fate” said Sen. Jeff Merkley D-Ore. “Now that it’s clear legislation to address our climate crisis is dead President Biden needs to put us on an emergency footing to address this disaster.”

Citing Biden’s campaign promise to end new drilling on federal lands and waters Merkley said “Now is the time to show the American people he’s serious by saying ‘no’ to expanding our addiction to fossil fuels.”

Even before Manchin’s apparent rejection of the climate measures Democrats had slimmed their down their plan from about $555 billion in climate spending to just over $300 billion in a bid to secure his support. Proposed tax credits for wind solar and nuclear energy along with still-unproven carbon-capture technology could reduce emissions by up to 40% by 2030 advocates said.

Manchin had already forced Democrats to drop two tax provisions he opposes: direct payments of clean energy credits and tax credits for drivers who purchase electric vehicles. Manchin forced other concessions last year including killing a proposal that would have paid utilities that increase clean energy while penalizing those that do not.

READ MORE: Sen. Joe Manchin wants Democrats to pause budget bill risking its fate

Sen. Ron Wyden D-Ore. chairman of the Senate Finance Committee said he still hopes to salvage the clean energy tax provisions and said failure “really is not an option here.”

Manchin’s request to postpone action on the climate measure follows a June 30 ruling by the Supreme Court which said in a 6-3 vote that the Clean Air Act does not give the Environmental Protection Agency broad authority to regulate greenhouse gas emissions from power plants.

The ruling by the court’s conservative majority likely complicates the Biden administration’s plan to manage power plant pollution but does not eliminate its authority to regulate greenhouse gases. EPA Administrator Michael Regan has said the agency is moving forward with proposed rules for power plants in the coming months.

Ann Clancy associate climate policy director for Indivisible a progressive advocacy group said it was time for Biden to “stop waiting for corporate-backed Democrats and their bad faith negotiations and deliver real wins for the American people on climate.”

“We don’t have any more time to waste” Clancy said.

Manchin in a radio interview Friday said climate activists want an immediate end to U.S. use of oil coal and gas. “That’s crazy” he told West Virginia talk show host Hoppy Kercheval. “I’m not throwing caution to the wind. I think we need an energy policy that works for our country.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMihwFodHRwczovL3d3dy5rcm9sbC5jb20vZW4vdHJhbnNhY3Rpb25zL20tYW5kLWEvdGVjaG5vbG9neS1tYS1wcmFjdGljZS1hZHZpc2VkLWx1Y2lkLWRlc2lnbi1ncm91cC1vbi1pdHMtYWNxdWlzaXRpb24tYnktYWN1aXR5LWJyYW5kcy1pbmPSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Technology M&A Practice Advised Lucid Design Group on its Acquisition by Acuity Brands Inc.,"OAKLAND CA – Lucid provider of the most comprehensive SaaS intelligence platform for building operations today announced it has been acquired by Acuity Brands Inc (NYSE:AYI) a leading provider of intelligent lighting building automation systems and IoT solutions.

Huh Amex has a restaurant at Stockholm Airport?!

This might sound strange on the surface so let me explain. Amex is of course well known for its Centurion Lounges and on top of that many premium Amex cards offer a Priority Pass membership providing access to 1300+ lounges around the world.

However at Stockholm Arlanda Airport Amex has a unique concept. The credit card issuer has partnered with a well regarded airport restaurant to serve complimentary food & drinks to those with the Amex Platinum and Amex Centurion.

Specifically the Amex restaurant is located inside Pontus in the Air which is an airport restaurant from Swedish chef Pontus Frithiof (who has some well regarded non-airport restaurants). So while anyone can dine at Pontus in the Air eligible Amex cardmembers can sit in a special section and receive free food & drinks.

This is probably most similar to the concept of Priority Pass restaurants. The difference is that Priority Pass restaurants give you a certain dollar limit while at this restaurant Amex cardmembers can order anything off a dedicated menu.

Pontus in the Air Stockholm Arlanda location & hours

Pontus in the Air is quite hard to find. Even with having read directions online I had to ask someone for help before I could find it. So let me try to explain the location in a way that makes sense to me.

Pontus in the Air is located in Terminal 5 in the direction of gates F26-69. The layout of Terminal 5 can be confusing since the first wing has gates 11-24 the second wing has gates 1-10 and the third wing has gates F26-69. Nothing about that makes sense to me but anyway…

Map of Stockholm Arlanda Airport

After clearing security follow the signage toward gates F26-F69. That will bring you to a long corridor that has a bunch of shops and restaurants.

A short walk down this hall and on the right you’ll see the stairs leading up to Pontus in the Air. It’s hard to miss when you walk past it given the bright green signs.

Pontus in the Air Stockholm Arlanda Airport entrance

On the staircase you’ll see signage reflecting the three dining options that are up there — there’s the standard Pontus in the Air (which had a wait) there’s Monstro Burgers & Pasta and then there’s the American Express Lounge (which is the section of Pontus in the Air just for cardmembers).

At the top of the stairs just turn right and you’ll see the American Express section of Pontus in the Air.

The restaurant is currently open daily from 5AM until 6PM (except on Saturdays when it closes at 5PM).

Which Amex cardmembers can dine at Pontus in the Air?

The American Express Lounge by Pontus is open to:

Amex Platinum cardmembers; they can bring up to one guest

Amex Centurion cardmembers; they can bring up to two guests

You register your card when you check-in with the host. In theory there’s a dedicated Amex Lounge section though it seems that it’s consistently overcrowded so they have blocked off an additional portion of the restaurant for cardmembers which is where I sat.

Shortly after settling in I was presented with a menu. A few things to note:

Breakfast is served from 5AM until 10AM while lunch & dinner are served from 10AM until closing

All the food options are included as well as wine (red white rose) beer soft drinks and juice and you can have refills

There’s also a coffee bar with complimentary coffee and there are cookies and other snacks there as well

Centurion cardmembers receive extra benefits — at breakfast they can receive an “express class” breakfast and at lunch and dinner they can receive a glass of champagne digestive or gin & tonic

Platinum cardmembers can order a digestive mimosa or gin & tonic for 50SEK (~$5)

I didn’t feel like having any alcohol so I ordered a Diet Coke to drink.

To eat I ordered the cured salmon with dill stewed potatoes. This was served within 10 minutes of ordering and was quite tasty.

I was alone but Ford and his mom were passing through the next day so I asked for pictures of their food so that I could share them here. They had meatballs with linguine tomato sauce and basil and cajun marinated chicken on rye with mozzarella roasted peppers and grape salad. They enjoyed their meals as well.

After the meal I ordered a cappuccino and was also invited to help myself to the cookies and other sweets by the coffee machine.

I appreciate that they don’t really rush you out of the restaurant but rather you can linger for as long as you’d like. I probably spent about an hour there and I had one of the shorter stays as the tables around me kept ordering more and more drinks.

While the restaurant was busy it was downright quiet compared to the Priority Pass lounge I would have otherwise had access to so I found this to be a great place to sit and wait for my flight.

Amex cardmembers also get fast track security at Arlanda Airport

Since we’re talking about Amex perks at Arlanda Airport I think it’s worth mentioning that Amex Platinum and Centurion cardmembers receive fast track security in Terminal 5 as well. You just have to present your card and then you’ll get access to the fast track lane. This can especially come in handy this summer given how busy the airport is.

Of course this is a moot point if you’re traveling in a premium cabin or are an elite member who would have access to these lanes anyway.

Pontus in the Air Arlanda is closing?!

I only noticed this just now while going to the restaurant’s website but it appears that Pontus in the Air may be closing later this year. Per a message on the restaurant’s website:

Unfortunately Pontus in the Air is closing down its operations permanently and the premises will cease. The date for the shutdown has not yet been decided but is set for the end of 2022. Pontus in the Air has been a very successful business that has gone from strength to strength gone through a pandemic increased when other players have lost and also won prizes and awards. A restaurant that undeniably put Arlanda on the map in a way like never before. Why then do we close Pontus in the Air a business we would have been more than happy to pursue? The background is that Swedavia has chosen to interpret the procurement legislation as meaning that we are not tenants but that we conduct restaurant operations in the form of a service which must therefore be procured as a concession according to LUK. We do not share that interpretation. This means that we do not get our lease extended but it ends for eviction as a result. The end date is not clear at the time of writing but will be around the turn of the year 2022/2023.

This is of course a shame and I haven’t heard anything from Amex yet about this or if the issuer is coming up with a replacement concept.

Bottom line

The Amex Lounge by Pontus is a unique concept and one I’m a fan of. Amex Platinum and Centurion cardmembers can dine at Pontus in the Air at Arlanda Airport at no cost. A meal and most drinks are included and the selection is much better than what you’d typically find in a lounge.

Given Arlanda Airport’s shortage of lounges and how crowded they can get this is a great place to spend time prior to a flight. Unfortunately it might not be around much longer though.

Citibank is an advertising partner of this site as is American Express Chase Barclays and Capital One. Any opinions expressed in this post are my own and have not been reviewed approved or endorsed by my advertising partners. I do not write about all credit cards that are available -- instead focusing on miles points and cash back (and currencies that can be converted into the same).

Wells Fargo introduced its new Autograph Card this month. It’s an above-average product but not best in class. What’s struck me most about it is that Wells Fargo is making marketing claims that just seem wrong – and that actually undersell other products they have in the process.

The no annual fee Autograph card offers



Initial bonus: 30000 points after $1500 spend in first 3 months



30000 points after $1500 spend in first 3 months 3x earning: dining travel (including transit and gas) streaming services and phone plans [1x everywhere else]



dining travel (including transit and gas) streaming services and phone plans [1x everywhere else] Redemption: points are worth 1 cent apiece with redemptions in $25 increments ($20 at Wells Fargo ATMs)

These are nice 3x categories but it’s basically a cash back card with minimums to cash out. You’ll never get better than 3% back on any of your spend. That’s better than a 1% card and it has no annual fee so a lot of consumers out in the world would do better with this card than they already have. But it’s hardly top of market.

So here’s what I see in an ad when I Google the card:

Wells Fargo claims Autograph is their “best points card ever.” I’m surprised their lawyers allowed the claim because it’s so obviously not accurate.

The Autograph card is basically the old Wells Fargo Propel card but running on the Visa network instead of American Express. The Propel World card used to come with baggage and trip delay; trip cancellation and interruption; return protection and extended warranty and more.

The most direct comparison for Autograph at Wells Fargo would be to their Active Cash card which is a no annual fee 2% back card on everything. Autograph has some nice 3x categories but that’s not obviously better than 2% across the board (just ask Capital One!). Active Cash is probably the more lucrative standalone card and one of the best cash back cards.

Wells wants to call Autograph a points card rather than cash back putting it in a different category from Active Cash. Sure they’re bonusing travel spend but it’s not a points card the way we usually think of those. There’s no elevated redemption option for travel and no transfers to other points programs. Instead you redeem points for cash or for other options like merchandise. Yet even on that technicality the claim doesn’t hold water.

Let’s grant them that they’re trying to define Autograph as a ‘points card’ and not claiming it’s their best cash back card ever (even though that’s really how to think about the Autograph card).

Do the Wells Fargo marketing people not realize they have a much better actual points card than Autograph right now? Wells Fargo issues the Bilt Mastercard.

Bilt has 3x points-earning too (dining) as well as 2x points-earning (travel) also at no annual fee with richer protections like trip delay and cancellation; primary rental car collision damage waiver (versus secondary with Autograph)

More importantly it’s going to earn far more points for most cardmembers than Autograph will – certainly for anyone who rents rather than owns their home and especially as consumers keep and use the card year after year. The Bilt Mastercard lets cardmembers earn 1 point per dollar spent on rent at no cost. It’s the biggest expense item for most people who rent and the Autograph card will generally earn zero points for that spending while the Bilt card earns up to 100000 points per year. Bilt will earn more points for most than Autograph will .

An Autograph point can be cashed out at a penny apiece. In contrast I’ve valued Bilt points at 1.7 cents each (others like The Points Guy use a higher value) thanks to Bilt’s valuable transfer partners like American AAdvantage United MileagePlus World of Hyatt and more. I still can get 8 to 10 cents per point or more in value against the retail cost of a ticket when redeeming transferred points for international business class travel and I use Hyatt points on especially expensive hotel nights and for the kind of suites you won’t be getting with points off a cash back card that earns 1% on much of your spend. Bilt also offers spending points through their travel portal at 1.25 cents apiece which while not how I prefer to use points is still 25% more value than straight 1% redemption value. Bilt’s points are worth more than Autograph’s.

At the end of the day Wells has a card that earns points in a category no one else can match (rent) that’s the biggest expense item for most customers who spend in the category. Each of their points is far more flexible and worth more. And somehow it’s the Autograph card Wells Fargo is spending money to shout from the rooftops as their best points card ever. What could possibly be going on here?

Big bank marketing claims go through extensive legal review. This isn’t a claim Wells Fargo is making lightly but I’m trying mightily to make sense of it. I’m confident they’re well-meaning here but that makes this even more of a mystery.

Wells Fargo has one of the best most innovative products that’s been introduced in the last year in the Bilt Mastercard. That’s a real coup for Wells because until now the bank hasn’t been a player or even competitive in the ‘points’ space.

Maybe it’s just so new to them (their launch party was just in March) that their executives don’t actually realize what they have? Perhaps marketing and legal just don’t know they have a much better card than the one they’re promoting as their best?

Regardless of the reason the consequence is the same: Wells Fargo is advertising in a way that points customers in the wrong direction that will earn many consumers fewer points and deliver less value. And that’s not something Wells Fargo wants to do as it builds its reputation in consumer cards.

Wells already has the very best no annual fee consumer points card offered by any bank in their portfolio. Think of it as Chase Sapphire Preferred but without the annual fee and better transfer partners too – that earns points on rent at no charge but doesn’t offer a signup bonus. Too bad the card is a well-kept secret even inside their own bank!",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNuYmMuY29tL3NlbGVjdC9ob3ctdG8tbWF4aW1pemUtdGhlLWNhcGl0YWwtb25lLXZlbnR1cmUteC13ZWxjb21lLWJvbnVzL9IBWGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNuYmMuY29tL2FtcC9zZWxlY3QvaG93LXRvLW1heGltaXplLXRoZS1jYXBpdGFsLW9uZS12ZW50dXJlLXgtd2VsY29tZS1ib251cy8?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,How to maximize the Capital One Venture X 100000-mile welcome bonus,"The Capital One Venture X Rewards Credit Card welcome offer mentioned below is no longer available.

Transfer Capital One Miles to airline partners

Capital One Rewards is connected to 14 airline partner rewards programs which extends your redemption options across all three airline alliances: Star Alliance Oneworld and SkyTeam. Nearly all of them transfer at a 1:1 ratio — EVA Air converts at a 2:1.5 ratio — so you'll be getting the best value by booking flights through the following carriers and their alliance partners: Aeromexico (Club Premier)

Air Canada (Aeroplan)

Air France KLM (Flying Blue)

Avianca (LifeMiles)

British Airways (Avios)

Cathay Pacific (Asia Miles)

Emirates (Emirates Skywards)

Etihad (Etihad Guest)

EVA Air (Infinity MileageLands) — transfer ratio is 2:1.5 not 1:1

Finnair (Finnair Plus)

Qantas (Qantas Frequent Flyer)

Singapore Airlines (KrisFlyer)

TAP Air Portugal (TAP Miles & Go)

Turkish Airlines (Miles & Smiles) While there aren't any domestic carriers listed as airline partners that doesn't mean it's not impossible to fly them for free. Thanks to airline alliances you can convert Capital One Miles to British Airways Avios then use those to book domestic U.S. flights on American Airlines its Oneworld alliance partner. You could also transfer Capital One Miles to Turkish Airlines or Avianca then use those to book flights on Star Alliance partner United Airlines.

Redeem Capital One Miles for free nights at hotels

Capital One Rewards has three hotel transfer partners — Choice Privileges Wyndham Rewards and Accor Live Limitless (AccorHotels) — letting cardholders cash in Capital One Miles for free nights at hotels worldwide. Capital One Miles can be transferred to Choice Privileges points at a 1:1 ratio allowing you to book free nights at more than 7000 properties in over 40 countries at brands including Quality Comfort Sleep Inn Econo Lodge Rodeway Inn MainStay Suites Clarion Clarion Pointe and Surburban Extended Stay Hotel Cambria Hotels and The Ascend Hotel Collection. Thanks to connections with Penn National Gaming Inc. Preferred Hotels & Resorts Nordic Choice Hotels and AMResorts (all-inclusive resorts in Mexico Costa Rica Panama and the Caribbean by brands like Dreams and Secrets) you can also redeem for stays at casino hotels and independent boutiques. Here's an idea of what you can redeem through Choice Privileges for 100000 Capital One Miles: Four nights at the Comfort Inn Manhattan – Midtown West in New York City (25000 points a night)

Five nights at Avenue Hotel Ascend Hotel Collection in Los Angeles (20000 points a night)

Eight nights at Comfort Hotel Nation Pere Lachaise Paris 11 in France (12000 points a night) Wyndham Rewards also lets you transfer Capital One Miles at a 1:1 ratio giving you access to free nights at over 9000 hotels in more than 80 countries at brands including Wyndham Wyndham Grand Wyndham Garden Registry Collection Hotels AmericInn Tryp Dazzler Esplendor Wingate Trademark Collection Dolce Hotels and Resorts La Quinta Inn & Suites Ramada Baymont Microtel Days Inn Super 8 Howard Johnson Travelodge and Hawthorn Suites. With redemptions from 7500 15000 or 30000 Wyndham Rewards points per night here's what transferring 100000 Capital One Miles could yield: Three nights at Wyndham Grand Athens in Greece (30000 points a night)

Six night at Ramada by Wyndham Queenstown Central in New Zealand (15000 points a night)

13 nights at Ramada by Wyndham Princess Santo Domingo in the Dominican Republic (7500 points a night) Thanks to a nifty partnership with Vacasa you can also redeem Capital One Miles for free nights at more than 15000 hotels vacation clubs and home rentals while a separate connection allows for redemptions at Caesars Rewards casino hotels around the U.S. Wyndham Rewards is also linked with Margarita Vacation Club Club Wyndham Cottages.com Shell Vacations Club Worldmark and Landal Greenparks so you can opt to redeem for vacation rental brands around the world. Another hotel transfer partner of Capital One is ALL Accor Live Limitless which offers hotel redemption options at a ratio of 2:1 and works a little differently from the last two programs. For starters you'll need to have at least 2000 ALL Rewards in your account which means you'd need to transfer over 4000 Capital One Miles and redeem them in increments of 2000 ALL Rewards points — 2000 points gets you 40 euros (about $45) off your stay while 4000 translates to 80 euros (about $90) and so forth. While you likely won't get the best value for your points this way the ALL Accor Live Limitless program can still be beneficial depending on your travel plans and style as award options through it include more than 5100 hotels in over 100 countries at brands like Fairmont Raffles Faena Delano Sofitel SLS Museum Hotel Mondrian Pullman Swissôtel Mövenpick Mantra Novotel and Ibis among others. While there are just 100 hotels in North America Accor brands are seemingly omnipresent throughout Europe Asia and Oceania so this is still a valuable points-transfer option.

Book flights hotels and car rentals through Capital One Travel

If you enjoy having the flexibility to book flights hotels and rental cars without having to worry about award availability or blackout dates consider making your reservations through Capital One Travel a new travel portal that offers added benefits like cancel-for-any-reason travel insurance (for a small fee) a freeze-your-price feature that helps you lock in lower rates price drop protection (if you find a lower price Capital One will refund you the difference) and a nifty price match guarantee (if you happen to find a better price within 24 hours of booking you could get a refund). While this also allows you to book travel at a fixed redemption rate of 1 cent per mile it's always worth comparing redemption rates — in other words seeing how many points and miles are needed for an award redemption directly through the carrier or hotel versus booking through the Capital One travel portal. Depending on your points and miles status goals you may also want to consider booking travel directly to maintain elite status or double-dipping by reserving tickets or rooms through another third-party website then simply ""erasing"" the travel purchase (more on that below).

Use Capital One Miles to ""erase"" recent travel purchases

One of the most valuable perks of the Capital One Venture X card is the ability to ""erase"" or redeem Capital One Miles to cover travel purchases made within the last 90 days. Simply use the card to book fights hotels car rentals or make other travel-related expenses (like Uber rides or Airbnb stays) then click on ""Redeem Travel Purchases"" to select which ones you'd like to cover or put your Capital One Miles toward — partial credit is fine too as long as you redeem more than 2500 Miles. Capital One Miles are worth 1 cent per mile when choosing this redemption option meaning 100000 miles could erase $1000 in travel purchases.

Redeem miles for gift cards and online shopping

If you know you won't be traveling for a while there's always retail therapy. With the Capital One Venture X card you'll be able to redeem Capital One Miles at a rate of 1 cent per point for gift cards to all your favorite restaurants and retail shops like Apple Bath & Body Works and Starbucks. Note that if you're redeeming Capital One Miles for Amazon gift cards — or using Capital One Miles to shop online via Amazon or PayPal — the redemption rate drops to 0.8 cents per point (you'd get $0.80 cents in value per 100 Miles) so it won't be the best value among all your other options.

Cash back is a low-value redemption

While this is the least valuable redemption option for your newly earned Capital One Miles you can still opt to exchange them at a rate of 0.5 cents per mile for cash in the form of an account credit or a check.

Other cards with large welcome bonuses

If you're interested in other cards with large welcome bonuses consider the following. The value and utility of the rewards from each card varies but you'll still be able to get plenty of ""free"" travel with their hefty welcome bonuses.

See our full disclaimer.

Online therapy is rapidly gaining traction as a mainstream option for receiving professional counseling. The increased popularity of this service has given way for several companies to dominate the space offering customers affordable and convenient options for virtual therapy. Two of the leading providers who share the majority of the market and have the best reputations are BetterHelp and Talkspace.

These two companies have much in common as they essentially offer the exact same solution. However one cannot ignore the areas of differentiation that without a doubt impact the overall experience they provide their customers. While individual preferences certainly play an important role when it comes to determining which service is better there are factors which tend to be objective such as price value and convenience.

One of the significant differences between the two companies is that Talkspace offers psychiatry services.

The detailed comparison below outlines the primary features and selling points of each service with the intention of helping users navigate these differences to help them decide between the two services based on their individual needs.

Comparison of BetterHelp and Talkspace

Average Weekly Price $80 to $90 per week $69 to $129 per week Messaging Video Sessions Audio Sessions Mobile App Professional Services Therapy Therapy and Psychiatry Works with Insurance Learn More Learn More

Pricing:

Both BetterHelp and Talkspace are well-priced as compared to the cost of traditional in-office therapy (which typically starts at $100 per session).

BetterHelp’s plan generally costs $90 per week for unlimited therapy while Talkspace offers multiple plans ranging from $69 to $129. The Talkspace model allows customers that are on a tighter budget to still get started with online therapy even if that means giving up on some of the premium features.

Advantage: Talkspace

The Therapists:

All therapists on both platforms are licensed professionals. Since each company uses an algorithm to pair you with a therapist based on your customized questionnaire during the signup process it is technically possible to be matched up with a therapist with whom you do not have good chemistry. However you can always request an alternate therapist that better suits you.

Though the number of therapists on each platform can change from day to day BetterHelp does have a larger pool of therapists.

Very little can be said about the actual quality differentials of therapists on these platforms as each of the companies have their own strict standards and guidelines. BetterHelp requires each therapist applicant complete a case study exam by a licensed clinician as well as undergo a video interview. This 4-5-week rigorous process results in a 15% acceptance rate to join the platform. Talkspace on the other hand requires all of their therapists to have logged over 3000 hours of clinical experience in order to join their platform.

Advantage: BetterHelp

Communication Options:

Both platforms offer live video sessions as well as communication with therapists via text and audio messaging. Both have mobile apps with favorable ratings.

Advantage: Draw

Security and Confidentiality:

These two companies take immense pride in their ability to provide safety and security to their customers as well as ensuring the confidentiality of their sensitive personal information throughout their use of the platform.

BetterHelp and Talkspace are both legally bound by US federal and state laws when it comes protection of health information just as any traditional therapy provider. They are therefore HIPAA certified and use 256-bit symmetric encryption for every piece of information that you type or say on their platforms.

Advantage: Draw

Usability:

BetterHelp and Talkspace both invest heavily in constantly improving the overall user experience of their apps and online platforms. BetterHelp offers a very simple and easy-to-use interface for both desktop and mobile users. Once you’ve logged in you’ll be taken straight to the private chat room with your therapist where you can easily initiate a conversation. Here you can make requests ask questions and schedule future sessions with therapists.

If you don’t want to stay logged in to the platform all the time you can opt to receive email updates whenever your therapist replies to you or sends a message. Aside from this it’s very easy to engage with your therapist via video chat or voice call from both desktop and mobile (though of course you’ll need a microphone and webcam to do so via desktop.)

Talkspace seems to place more focus on its mobile app experience than its website experience. This is due to the fact that its CEO recognized that one of the main challenges in seeking therapy is finding the time in our hectic modern-day schedules.

The Talkspace app which is predominantly used by their customers over the desktop version is available on iOS and Android. It is an easy and intuitive platform to navigate even for less technically savvy customers.

Advantage: Talkspace

Branding/Media Coverage:

When searching for online therapy services and you will undoubtedly return both BetterHelp and Talkspace in your results everywhere. However Talkspace has really done a fantastic job with brand awareness. And while BetterHelp is no pushover (mentions in WSJ Fox and BBC) they pale in comparison to what Talkspace has accomplished in the press – both offline and online.

From massive media outlets to social media influencers along with securing Michael Phelps as a company spokesperson Talkspace has received an impressive amount of press. While being an established brand does not necessarily correlate with quality or customer satisfaction it certainly does add a level of comfort knowing that you’re working with a well-known company that cannot afford to cut corners and tarnish their hard-earned reputation.

Advantage: Talkspace

Online Reputation:

Both Talkspace and BetterHelp are accredited by the Better Business Bureau (BBB) though BetterHelp surpasses Talkspace when it comes to their online reputations. BetterHelp also has thousands more online reviews than Talkspace across dozens of websites. This may be the result of having a more talented PR team but given how much Talkspace invests in media coverage it’s unlikely.

Advantage: BetterHelp

Customer Support:

It’s important to be able to contact customer support if you have a technical issue about the platform a billing question or would like to discuss your experience.

There is no significant difference between the customer support services that each of the two platforms offer. Both allow you to submit questions or feedback. BetterHelp has an online form while Talkspace has a similar experience through a ticketing system which is easier to track in your account dashboard.

Both provide online resources which can help work through many of the typical issues one might encounter. BetterHelp has this in the form of an FAQ section whereas Talkspace has a thorough resource they call the knowledgebase which are only different in their names.

The only noticeable difference is that BetterHelp provides an email address directly on their contact page. It might have been considered an advantage had Talkspace’s ticketing system not been so consistently responsive.

Typically you’ll receive a response within 24 hours during the week on both platforms – though these times can be much shorter when contacting them during business hours (note: BetterHelp is based in California and Talkspace is based in New York).

Advantage: Draw

Payments Accepted:

Both companies accept the same type of payments the majority of which are popular credit cards like Visa MasterCard and American Express. Neither company is accepting cryptocurrency payments yet.

Advantage: Draw

Bottom Line:

The most important factors when choosing an online therapy provider are price usability communication options and the experience of their therapists.

The pricing and features of each platform are very similar to another. In addition both of these providers use trained and licensed therapists that are accepted to the platforms only if they meet strict guidelines and standards though BetterHelp does seem to have more therapists to choose from.

The two companies enjoy esteemed reputations as far as Internet-based services are concerned along with being associated with well-respected mental health organizations and recognized personalities.

Two areas where the providers do differ are insurance coverage and access to psychiatrists that can help with prescription medications. Talkspace as a point of differentiation delivers on both fronts giving it an edge over BetterHelp.

All things considered BetterHelp and Talkspace are essentially equal in their ability to provide therapy services online. For those that feel more comfortable with a slightly larger company that’s more technology oriented BetterHelp is better choice. However those seeking insurance coverage or access to psychiatrists are better off with Talkspace. If you still find yourself unable to decide between the two rest assured there is no wrong decision as they are both fine options.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMilQFodHRwczovL3d3dy50dXJuaW5nbGVmdGZvcmxlc3MuY29tL2hvdy10by1nZXQtaG9sZC1vZi1icml0aXNoLWFpcndheXMtYnktcGhvbmUtc29jaWFsLW1lZGlhLW9yLWVtYWlsLXdoZW4teW91LWhhdmUtYS1jYW5jZWxsYXRpb24tYW5kLXdhbnQtdG8tcmVib29rL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,How to get hold of British Airways by phone social media or email when you have a cancellation and want to rebook,"I am seeing a lot of comments about being unable to get hold of British Airways again. This had improved in recent months and I suspect that it will improve again in the next couple of weeks. However being peak travel season and BA has recently made a large number of cancellations in a short space of time it’s understandably busy right now.

Firstly even if you don’t get offered flights that are suitable it’s always worth going into manage my booking and seeing if it will offer you any other options. There should be a change booking option.

Next if that doesn’t work I would have a look at exactly what you want to do by searching on ba.com initially for what is available and if there is nothing then looking at other airlines. BA is more likely to agree to oneworld airline reroutes.

Once you know what you want to do then phone is quickest if you can get through.

Phone

The general number for changes to bookings is 0344 493 0787 option 1 (calls charged at local rate) Daily: 06:00-20:00

(calls charged at local rate) Daily: 06:00-20:00 Try to call when they open or last thing before they close. If you ring when they open try to ring 2 or 3 minutes before to get through the menu options in advance of the opening time.

If you have Executive status you will be shown the correct number to call by logging into your account and clicking contact executive club on this page.

If you are having trouble and being hung up on – don’t press any options just wait.

Try calling another English-speaking country’s BA number such as the US which is often quieter. Be wary of the cost – a Skype cash account is great for these type of calls. I’d also use Skype if you are abroad and need to contact BA. It takes a minute or two to set it up but could save you a fortune. Most calls only cost around 1-2p per minute.

All the relevant contacts are on this page

Chat

There is a chat function in the bottom right on this page.

It’s limited in what they can do but it’s worth a try.

Social media

At the moment having a Twitter account can be very useful to get through to companies even if you never use it for anything else. BA’s Twitter is @British_Airways.

You will need to follow them and have them follow you in return by tweeting them and tagging them. Do not give out any booking details until you have got to the direct messaging stage. It will take several days or longer for them to get back to you. So you will have to be patient.

British Airways Holidays

If you have a BA Holidays booking you have to contact them unless you are GGL. For GGL they will usually liaise with BA Holidays for you to sort it out so call the usual GGL number.

While you are away or for travel within 24 hours you can contact the BA Holidays Duty office on [email protected] or text +44 786 002 2933. If you do not meet those criteria they will not be able to help.

If you need to contact BA Holidays before you travel or want to make changes call 0344 493 0787 and select Option 1 (charged at local rate) from 07:30 to 20:00 daily.

This is the first meeting since the semifinal of the delayed 2020 Olympics a match won 1-0 by Canada on a late penalty kick award by VAR. It was one of just two shots on goal for Canada in the match and it was Canada’s first win over the USA in 20 years. The USA has three players with multiple goals in this tournament in Alex Morgan (2) Sophia Smith (2) and Kristie Mewis (2) while Canada has two in Julia Grosso (3) and Jessie Fleming (3).

Unlike previous years where the rosters for Concacaf Qualifying have featured 20 players this year roster sizes were expanded to 23 matching the current World Cup roster size. U.S. Women’s National Team head coach Vlatko Andonovski announced his 23-player roster for the final competition on June 13 bringing in a squad that includes proven veterans on the international stage as along with dynamic up-and-coming talent.



The USA has made one change to its roster since the start of the tournament with midfielder Sam Coffey replacing forward Ashley Hatch for the knockout rounds. Hatch suffered a muscle strain in her leg following the USA’s July 7 win over Jamaica and was ruled unable to compete the remainder of the tournament. Coffey who received her first call-up to senior national team this June joins the team in Monterrey in search of her first cap.



Twenty-two players have seen action for the USA at the Concacaf W Championship 12 of whom made their Concacaf Qualifying debuts. The only players who have yet to see action are goalkeeper Aubrey Kingsbury and Coffey. Two players – Lindsey Horan and Sophia Smith – have started all four matches for the USA at the Concacaf W Championship while four additional players – Sofia Huerta Ashley Sanchez Kristie Mewis and Rose Lavelle – have also seen action in every game of the tournament. Becky Sauerbrunn and goalkeeper Casey Murphy lead the USWNT in total minutes played this tournament with 270 each followed by Alex Morgan (259 minutes) and Horan (251).

INSIDE THE SERIES: USA VS. CANADA

The USA and Canada are set to meet for the 62nd time overall in a series that dates back to 1986 when the USWNT was in just its second year in existence. Canada is the most common opponent in USWNT history and the USA leads the overall series 51-3-7.



The USA and Canada have met three times at the Olympics with the USWNT winning the first two meetings both of which came in the knockout rounds and went to extra time. In 2008 the USA bested Canada in the quarterfinals 2-1 thanks to a dramatic diving header from Natasha Kai in the 101st minute. The teams met again in the 2012 Olympic semifinal at Wembley Stadium a 4-3 victory for the USA in a thrilling affair punctuated by a header from Alex Morgan in the 123rd minute – which still stands as the latest goal in FIFA and Olympic history – to send the Americans through to the final. Sinclair tallied a hat trick for Canada but a Megan Rapinoe brace and a penalty kick from Abby Wambach kept the match level until Morgan’s header in the waning seconds.



Before the match in the 2020 Olympics the most recent meeting between the teams came on February 18 2021 at the SheBelieves Cup in Orlando. Rose Lavelle scored in the 79th minute to lift the USA to a 1-0 victory to kick off the three-game tournament. The USA threatened on a number of set piece opportunities throughout the evening earning 13 corners to Canada’s five and several free kicks in dangerous territory. After creating quality chances and knocking on the door for much of the night the USA finally broke through off a free kick when Lavelle a second-half substitute pounced poor clearance in the penalty box and fired home for the game’s lone goal.

USA ROSTER NOTES

The USA has an overall combined record of 59-1-1 in World Cup and Olympic Qualifying matches the lone loss coming in 2010 vs. Mexico in the semifinals of World Cup Qualifying. The USA’s only draw in World Cup or Olympic Qualifying officially came in the final of the 2008 Olympic Qualifying Tournament against Canada though the USA prevailed on penalty kicks to win the tournament.

The USA has won all five Olympic qualifying tournaments in which it has participated and has won eight of the nine World Cup qualifying tournaments in which it competed the lone blemish coming in the 2010 Concacaf Women’s World Cup qualifying tournament the USA fell to Mexico in the semifinal in Cancun Mexico and Canada defeated Mexico in the championship game.

Eight players on the Concacaf W Championship roster were on the USWNT’s roster for Olympic Qualifying in 2020: Lindsey Horan Rose Lavelle Alyssa Naeher Kelley O’Hara Megan Rapinoe Becky Sauerbrunn Emily Sonnett and Andi Sullivan.

Nine players on this year’s 23-player CWC roster were a part of the USA’s 2018 World Cup Qualifying roster with Alex Morgan and Mallory Pugh joining Horan Lavelle Naeher O’Hara Rapinoe Sauerbrunn and Sonnett.

Megan Rapinoe leads the squad with a combined 25 appearances in qualifying events – though she missed the July 7 match against Jamaica as she was in Washington D.C. to receive the Presidential Medal of Freedom .

Morgan is the next-most experienced player on this roster in World Cup and Olympic Qualifying with 23 qualifying caps followed by Becky Sauerbrunn (21) Kelley O’Hara (18) and Lindsey Horan (18).

Morgan Rapinoe and Sauerbrunn were on the U.S. team that last played in a World Cup qualifying tournament in Mexico. That was in 2010 when the USA lost its only match to Mexico which occurred in the semifinal in Cancun. That loss forced the USA to win the Third-Place Match and then the two-leg playoff vs. Italy to qualify for the 2011 FIFA Women’s World Cup a tournament in which the USA advanced to the Final before falling in penalty kicks to Japan.

CANADA ROSTER NOTES

Seventeen of the 23 players on Canada roster for this tournament were on the 2020 Olympic Team. Only nine players on the USA’s 23-player roster were on its 2020 Olympic Team.

One of the most experienced and respected players in women’s soccer history Portland Thorns FC forward Christine Sinclair is by far the most-capped player on Canada’s roster and the world’s all-time leading international goal scorer. Just the fourth player in international soccer history to amass 300+ caps Sinclair reached the milestone in Canada’s opening match of the Tokyo 2020 Olympics – in which she also scored the opening goal – and joined USWNT standouts Kristine Lilly (354 caps) Carli Lloyd (316) and Christie Pearce Rampone (311) and in the 300-cap club.

With 190 international goals she passed the USA’s Abby Wambach for the title early in 2020 during Olympic qualifying. The 2020 Olympics were her fourth Olympics and ninth world championship event for Sinclair who made her international debut in 2000 at age 16.

Canada’s gold medal in 2021 was in its fourth Olympic appearance having qualified for every tournament since 2008. After an eighth-place finish in Beijing in 2008 Canada captured bronze at each of the next two Olympics – beating France 1-0 in the Third-Place Match in 2012 and topping Brazil 2-1 in 2016 to earn a second consecutive medal.

International competition aside there is a very high degree of familiarity between the two sides as nearly every player on Canada’s roster has played in the United States at one point either professionally or collegiately. Canada’s roster features eleven current NWSL players two players current playing in U.S. colleges and of the nine Canadians currently playing in Europe three previously played in the NWSL. The nine players in Europe all played collegiate soccer in the USA.

Because of the NWSL ties six Canadians are teammates with 12 American players on these two rosters. There are no U.S. players on the roster from Angel City FC or the Houston Dash or that number would be higher.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiKGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmlyYW5pbnRsLmNvbS9lbi8yMDIyMDcxNjI0NDLSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Iran Sanctions US Officials Lawmakers Over Support For MEK Organization,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='news.google.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /articles/CBMiKGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmlyYW5pbnRsLmNvbS9lbi8yMDIyMDcxNjI0NDLSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen (Caused by NewConnectionError('<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x000002185BABF190>: Failed to establish a new connection: [WinError 10051] A socket operation was attempted to an unreachable network')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiKGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmlyYW5pbnRsLmNvbS9lbi8yMDIyMDcxNjI0NDLSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNubi5jb20vMjAyMi8wNy8xNy9jaGluYS9jaGluYS1ldXJvcGUtcmVsYXRpb25zLXVrcmFpbmUtcnVzc2lhLWludGwtbWljLWhuay9pbmRleC5odG1s0gFbaHR0cHM6Ly9hbXAuY25uLmNvbS9jbm4vMjAyMi8wNy8xNy9jaGluYS9jaGluYS1ldXJvcGUtcmVsYXRpb25zLXVrcmFpbmUtcnVzc2lhLWludGwtbWljLWhuaw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,China once saw Europe as a counter to US power.

Hong Kong CNN —

When Chinese leader Xi Jinping made his first state visit to Europe in 2014 he set out to herald a new era of cooperation in a multi-country tour which the European Parliament President at the time called “a welcome signal of the importance that the new Chinese leader attaches to a strengthened EU-China partnership.”

Eight years later the optimism of that period has cratered with the relationship between China and the European Union reaching what analysts call a clear low point of recent decades.

European concern about China’s global ambitions and its human rights record US-China tensions tit-for-tat sanctions and now Russia’s war in Ukraine – the impact of which on China-EU ties Beijing appears to have either underestimated or dismissed – have all brought relations to a nadir.

That was underlined last month during two summits featuring European leaders. Both the Group of Seven (G7) advanced economies and NATO significantly hardened their lines on China in a signal that views in Europe have fallen more in line with Washington’s.

The shift is the culmination of a series of steps in which Beijing may have at times underestimated the extent to which it was pushing Europe away but also appeared prepared to pay that price.

But it is a significant blow for Beijing’s ideal vision: a Europe with robust China ties that provides a counterbalance to American power and posture.

“China and the EU should act as two major forces upholding world peace and offset uncertainties in the international landscape” Xi told EU leaders at a summit in April urging them to reject “rival-bloc mentality.”

But those words appeared to fall flat with the European side which focused instead on pressing China to help broker peace in Ukraine. “The dialogue was everything but a dialogue. In any case it was a dialogue of the deaf” EU foreign affairs chief Josep Borrell said afterward.

Downward spiral

Beijing had carefully crafted its relationships in Europe in recent decades – creating a dedicated annual summit with Central and Eastern European countries and seeking inroads for its Belt and Road infrastructure initiative which won support from one G7 member when Italy signed on in 2019.

US concerns about the risks of collaboration with China resonated in Europe. And European nations were themselves watching Xi’s China grow increasingly assertive in its foreign policy from the combative tone of its “wolf warrior” diplomats to the establishment of a naval base in Africa rising aggressiveness in the South China Sea and toward Taiwan and the targeting of companies or countries that ran foul of its line on hot-button issues.

Allegations of major human rights violations in China’s northwestern region of Xinjiang and its dismantling of civil society in Hong Kong also played a role in shifting European perceptions analysts say. Chinese officials have called allegations that it held more than a million Uyghur and other Muslim minorities in internment camps in Xinjiang “fabrications” and slammed discussion of these issues as “interference” in its internal affairs.

The EU declared China a “systemic rival” in 2019 and ties have continued to fray since.

“China now demands the rest of the world pay it due respect and recognize the positions China takes without paying much regard to what the others may think” said Steve Tsang director of the SOAS China Institute at the University of London.

This approach made Western democracies “abandon the decades-long policy of helping China to modernize and rise with a hope that greater economic integration will encourage China to become a responsible stake holder in world affairs” Tsang said.

Economic edge

China was the third largest export market for European goods and the largest source of products entering Europe last year but frictions have taken their toll on the economic relationship between the EU and Beijing.

Earlier this year a dispute between China and Lithuania pushed the EU to level a case at the WTO. It accused Beijing of “discriminatory trade practices against Lithuania” in retaliation for what Beijing views as a violation by the Baltic state of its “One China” principle by which it claims self-ruled Taiwan as its sovereign territory.

The greatest financial casualty was the long-awaited trade deal between the EU and China which stalled last year after being caught in the crossfire of a sanctions exchange. Beijing slapped penalties on EU lawmakers and bodies European think tanks and independent scholars after the EU sanctioned four Chinese officials for alleged abuses in Xinjiang.

But the damage was greater than just the deal.

“This overreaction (from Beijing) was not a wise move” said Ingrid d’Hooghe a senior research associate at the Netherlands-based think tank Clingendael pointing to the harmful effect on public opinion.

“China’s strategy toward Europe was falling apart and it apparently didn’t understand that all these actions – the over-reactive sanctions coercive diplomacy – in the end worked against China’s diplomatic goals … and also pushed Europe closer to the United States” she said.

While these actions may have pushed a shift in European thinking with clear economic consequences they added up for Beijing’s Foreign Ministry according to Henry Gao a professor at Singapore Management University’s Yong Pung How School of Law.

“For them the cold relationship is a necessary price and it is more important to make political points” he said.

Blind spot?

It is China’s most recent calculations over how to respond to Russia’s war in Ukraine that may end up the most costly when it comes to European ties.

As European countries and the US united in support of Ukraine China refused to condemn the war – instead bolstering its relationship with Russia and joining the Kremlin in finger-pointing at the US and NATO.

There were leading policy analysts in China who understood the negative consequences China’s position would have on its European ties according to Li Mingjiang an associate professor and Provost’s Chair in International Relations at Nanyang Technological University’s S. Rajaratnam School of International Studies in Singapore. But that assessment may have been “underestimated” by decision makers Li said.

Calculations about the geopolitical importance of ties with Russia and also the close bond between Xi and Russian President Vladimir Putin also likely came to bear he added.

“It’s a really huge dilemma for China … and they couldn’t afford any major negative consequences on the China-Russia strategic partnership. That imperative really prevailed” Li said.

There has been acknowledgment of China’s myopia among mainland scholars

Chen Dingding founding director of the Intellisia Institute think tank in Guangzhou wrote in a coauthored article in The Diplomat that the risks of the war in Ukraine are “not fully understood in China” where officials and academics had failed to acknowledge the “shock” that death and destruction in Ukraine would bring Europeans.

“The geographic as well as emotional proximity of the war will fundamentally change European sentiments toward common security economic dependencies and national sovereignty for years to come” Chen and his international group of coauthors wrote.

However strong voices within many countries do continue to advocate a balanced approach to China according to d’Hooghe. The future may bring not a decoupling she said but rather a recalibration within Europe of how to collaborate with China while keeping an eye on security and balance.

“But right now – and this is also true with the European relationship with Russia – normative considerations seem to weigh heavier than economic interests” she said.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm55dGltZXMuY29tLzIwMjIvMDcvMTcvdXMvZ3JhbmQtZm9ya3Mtbm9ydGgtZGFrb3RhLWZ1ZmVuZy1jaGluYS5odG1s0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,A North Dakota City Attracted a Corn Mill. Then Came Questions About Its Chinese Owners. (Published 2022),"GRAND FORKS N.D. — For years the leaders of Grand Forks had their eyes on a patch of cropland north of town not far from a pasta-making facility a potato processor and a state-owned flour mill where farmers received top dollar for their wheat. That muddy field they thought would be the perfect place for another agriculture business.

So when Fufeng USA the American subsidiary of a Chinese company that makes components for animal feed announced last year that it wanted to build a corn mill in that field officials in Grand Forks celebrated. The mill they said would bring as many as 1000 construction jobs and more than 200 permanent jobs to the city. Gov. Doug Burgum a Republican described it as a “huge opportunity” for all of North Dakota.

But what local politicians lauded as an unambiguous win soon divided Grand Forks. Some residents were excited by the prospect of more jobs and investment but the company’s ties to China turned others against the project. Anti-Fufeng signs including hammer-and-sickle flags popped up in yards. City Council meetings that used to focus on road design and utility contracts suddenly turned into fiery discussions about communism and spying. Within a few months the debate had reached Capitol Hill and Grand Forks population 59000 had revealed just how mistrustful and dysfunctional America’s relationship with China has become.

For decades the large flows of money and merchandise between the two nations made it the world’s most important economic partnership even as the United States pressed China to improve its human rights record. But attitudes toward China have turned sharply negative as politicians from both parties have increasingly portrayed the country as a threat and as the pandemic helped fuel a rise in anti-Asian racism and highlighted Beijing’s embrace of a tougher authoritarianism.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnJldXRlcnMuY29tL2xpZmVzdHlsZS9zcG9ydHMvZWFsZXktd2lucy11cy13b21lbnMtc2hvdC1wdXQtd29ybGQtdGl0bGUtMjAyMi0wNy0xNy_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Ealey wins US women's shot put world title,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 401 Client Error: HTTP Forbidden for url: https://www.reuters.com/lifestyle/sports/ealey-wins-us-womens-shot-put-world-title-2022-07-17/ on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnJldXRlcnMuY29tL2xpZmVzdHlsZS9zcG9ydHMvZWFsZXktd2lucy11cy13b21lbnMtc2hvdC1wdXQtd29ybGQtdGl0bGUtMjAyMi0wNy0xNy_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen

KAMPALA - The Deputy Speaker of Parliament Thomas Tayebwa has lauded American Tower Corporation (ATC) Uganda for internet services in the country.

""ICT challenges in Mitooma district are now minimal and I am proud that with interventions of ATC Uganda the gap was been bridged"" the Deputy Speaker remarked.

Tayebwa made the remarks during ATC's 10-year of existence in Uganda celebrations at Serena Hotel in Kampala on Thursday (July 14 2022).

ATC is a tower company that builds owns and operates telecommunication towers or masts in Uganda and is regulated by the Ugandan Communications Commission (UCC) as a National Public Infrastructure Provider (NPIP).

ATC Uganda Chief Executive Officer Dorothy Ssemanda said their business model is to build and operate towers on which network operators and internet service providers or even broadcasters can rent space as opposed to each of them building their infrastructure which is quite costly and not environmentally responsive.

“We have sister companies in 24 other countries across six continents. In Africa ATC is present in seven countries including Uganda. Our operations in Uganda commenced in June 2012 with the acquisition of towers that were owned by MTN Uganda” she said.

Ssemanda added that to date they have continued to build and Acquire more towers bringing their total portfolio to close to 4000.

KALIRO - The American Tower Corporation (ATC) Uganda has handed over 2 classroom blocks and a six-stanza drainable pit latrine worth sh300m to Kibanda Primary School in Bugonya village Gadumire Sub County Kaliro district.

Speaking during the handover ceremony Marek Busfy Chief Executive Officer ATC Africa said “It is important to play our part as contributors to the communities in which we live. Education is a universal right for every child although in Africa we face the challenges of poorly resourced education systems and the difficulties ranging from the lack of basic school infrastructure to poor-quality instruction.”

“What we are doing today is to give the rural child an opportunity to learn in a decent environment.” Busfy said.

As part of the 10 years celebrations of ATC’s existence in Uganda this year the Company’s Corporate Social Initiative identified the school in Busoga region specifically because of the challenges that were aggravated by the COVID-19 pandemic.

“Our giving back to this school was because of the existing challenge of child labour in the region. We are aware of students finding small jobs of cutting sugar cane in the Sugar cane shambas fishing in lakes and rivers or streams and washing cars to earn a living” she highlighted.

Adding “Providing this building to give a learning shelter to both the students and teachers is to emphasize that Education is one of the uncontested development strategies to tackle several forms of social political economic and geographic inequalities in low- and middle-income countries” Ssemanda alluded.

During the COVID-19 pandemic schools in Uganda were locked down for close to 2 years.

Kibanda Primary School Mawanda Joshua said they were confident that the investment will last for several years and help improve education services to learners.

The alternative access to education on radios televisions newspapers and the internet was not viable for the rural schools and in a way the urban students realized the opportunity while the rural didn’t.

Applauding ATC Uganda the headteacher Kibanda Primary School Mawanda Joshua said “We are confident that this investment will last for several years and is an enabler for education in this village and region of Uganda.”

He revealed that they have been challenged by the effects of COVID where many students didn’t turn up to school because of lack of school fees books and uniforms pregnancies and even teachers who are disgruntled about the salary disparities.

“These buildings are an assurance to education continuity for both the students and teachers you have given hope to our community” Mawanda said.",,,,,,,,,

Short for per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances the quartet are part of a larger class sometimes referred to as “forever chemicals” due to their strength and failure to degrade in the environment.

The EPA's new advisories startled many observers because the safety levels for two of the chemicals -- perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) and perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS) -- are extremely low. Thousands of drinking water utilities across the country likely have PFOA or PFOS in their system above the EPA's new advisories. Studies have linked the chemicals to serious health effects like cancer low birthweight babies and immune system effects.

In the wake of EPA's action cities such as Mobile Alabama sent notices to their customers confirming the presence of PFAS in drinking water and alarming many residents.

If you're concerned about PFAS in your drinking water here's what to know:

How dangerous are PFAS?

There are thousands of PFAS chemicals hundreds of which are used in the U.S. for things like nonstick coatings and waterproofing in products such as kitchenware clothing furniture and food packaging.

The chemical industry argues that it has phased out the varieties of PFAS known to be hazardous such as PFOS and PFOA and replaced them with safer alternatives. But environmental groups and some scientists say the common characteristics of PFAS make them all dangerous.

More:What are PFAS? A guide to understanding chemicals behind nonstick pans cancer fears

The potentially toxic effects of most PFAS chemicals have not received robust research. But large studies have found links between PFOA and PFOS and a variety of health effects including high cholesterol ulcerative colitis thyroid disease testicular cancer kidney cancer and pregnancy-induced hypertension. Many researchers also worry about reproductive and developmental harms such as low birthweight and decreased immune response.

Exactly how much PFOA or PFOS it takes to harm someone is unknown. PFAS chemicals do not cause sudden illnesses like a poison would. Instead they accumulate in the body over time where scientists say they can begin to impact systems. The EPA says its new advisories are designed to protect even pregnant women young children and the elderly over a lifetime of constant exposure.

“This means that these advisory levels are very conservative or protective of your health” the EPA told USA TODAY in an email.

How do I know if I or my family are in danger?

Scientists say there is little anyone can do to assess individual risk. In highly contaminated communities people have had blood tests to determine how much PFAS they've been exposed to which can then be compared with national averages. But blood tests are expensive can be difficult to obtain and will not definitively tell someone what danger they face health experts say.

Instead many scientists assess the potential health impacts of PFAS at a population-level. Most recently researchers estimated that exposure to some PFAS may have played a role in about 6.5 million deaths in the U.S. from 1999-2018 primarily those caused by cancer and heart disease. Annually that's about the same mortality rate as COVID-19.

But virtually all Americans have some level of PFAS in their bodies and the blood levels of the most problematic chemicals PFOS and PFOA have declined ever since an industrywide phaseout over the past two decades. In one way that means the EPA advisories for PFOS and PFOA are part of an effort to further drive down a risk that has already been decreasing for many Americans.

How do I know if PFAS is in my drinking water?

At present there is no national rule to test for PFAS in public drinking water and many water utilities do not. Some like Mobile have tested and notified the public even when PFOA and PFOS are found in small amounts just above the level that can be detected by advanced equipment.

Other states have tested water utilities across their jurisdiction. A Chicago Tribune investigation published this week reviewed state data that showed PFAS in water utilities across the state with at least one PFAS chemical detected in water supplies collectively serving 8 million people about 62% of the state's population.

Private testing in North Carolina has found PFOA and PFOS in the water sources for dozens of utilities across the state. Officials in Raleigh Durham and Chapel Hill confirmed the presence of the chemicals above the EPA's new advisories adding that they are studying the problem the Raleigh News & Observer reports.

While the EPA is planning on sampling thousands of water authorities across the country for PFAS in the years ahead there is no official central database where the public can check every system.

Residents can inquire with their water supplier or state environmental agency about whether testing has been performed on their system. The Environmental Working Group a national environmental nonprofit that advocates for strict limits on PFAS maintains a map of all known locations where PFAS have been found in drinking water.

The American Water Works Association a nonprofit representing water utilities nationwide told USA TODAY its members “want to make the right decisions to quickly and efficiently reduce potential exposure to PFAS through water and protect their communities.”

But the association said members questioned the “scientific underpinnings” of the new advisories and the timing of their release and worry they create pressure for water utilities to make the “wrong investments.” They also want regulators to do more to find PFAS polluters and halt the contamination of water sources.

Regardless the group said it is urging transparency among members.

“We encourage our members to speak openly and honestly with their communities about PFAS discussing both what they know and do not know"" said Steve Via director of federal relations for the association. “Although there’s a great deal of uncertainty out there the act of having that conversation can be helpful in strengthening public trust.”

What is being done about this?

The EPA's new advisories are not formal regulations. The agency says it plans to announce draft regulations this fall which if approved would then likely take effect in coming years.

Until then action will continue to vary from community to community and state to state. In some places such as highly contaminated towns in southeast Pennsylvania officials adopted “zero tolerance” plans in which they installed carbon filtration systems to remove PFAS entirely from drinking water. But such plans can cost tens of millions of dollars for a typical water utility to implement.

Other cities have adopted a wait and see approach reluctant to make such investments before seeing what the EPA's regulations might be.

Individuals can install filters in their homes which can protect an entire house or can go under the kitchen sink to remove most PFAS from water used to cook and drink. Scientists say PFAS do not readily pass through the skin making showering and bathing safe.

The Environmental Working Group says individuals can also lower their exposure to PFAS by purchasing commercial products that are PFAS-free.

The EPA offers a guide on reducing exposure to PFAS and recommends that those with concerns or questions about PFAS in commercial products contact the Consumer Product Safety Commission. The agency also promotes its own Q&A page around the new health advisories and says it has released the first $1 billion of $5 billion in funding to help water utilities address PFAS contamination.

What are the most common mistakes that people make while using an equalizer? What’s the correct way to use an EQ and how can you use it to your advantage to make sure that your mix sounds the way you want? In this tutorial we’ll show you the 10 most common (and avoidable) mistakes that beginners often make while using EQs and filters.

What is an equalizer?

Simply speaking an equalizer (abbreviated as “EQ”) controls the “volume” of certain frequency ranges like treble mids or bass. It’s one of the most important tools in music production and mixing and it also plays a role in music consumption. That’s why you’ll also find equalizers on your home stereo system and maybe even in your smartphone’s music player app. That said we’ll focus on the use of EQs in music production and mixing.

Equalizer mistake #1: You’re not familiar with the different types of EQs

Looking at a channel strip on a mixing desk or a typical EQ plug-in you’ll come across various types of EQ controls. Besides a high pass filter and one or more parametric mid bands you’ll often find two shelving equalizers for the high and low frequencies. To get the most out of your EQ it’s important to know the differences.

Let’s look at a typical parametric EQ plug-in. The first band (usually at the top or on the left) is a high pass filter (or low cut filter). It removes the frequencies below the cutoff frequency which is often around 80 Hz in common studio applications. One of its purposes is to remove low-end rumble and mechanical noises (e.g. footsteps) that could otherwise end up on the recording. For instruments that don’t contain any important frequencies below 80 Hz it’s a good idea to use a high pass filter by default. Examples: vocals speech most guitars snare drum.

Parametric EQ

Another type of EQ band that you’ll find on most mixing desks and in most EQ plug-ins is the parametric mid band (bell EQ). A fully parametric mid band has three controls: center frequency gain (cut/boost) and Q factor (bandwidth). Use the frequency knob to dial in the frequency that you’d like to boost or cut. The gain knob controls the amount of boost or cut. The Q knob controls the bandwidth: the range of frequencies around the center frequency that the EQ will affect. A lower Q factor (quality factor) results in a wider bandwidth while a high Q factor yields a narrow bandwidth.

Fully parametric mid bands are often used to target specific frequencies and attenuate them; they allow you to perform “surgical operations” on the frequency spectrum. Variants that lack a Q control are called semi-parametric. The following screenshots show parametric mid bands with wide and narrow bandwidths.

Besides filters and parametric EQs the third type of equalizer that you’ll commonly find in a mixer’s channel strip is the shelving EQ. In contrast to a parametric bell EQ a shelving EQ affects all frequencies above or below a certain frequency. On smaller analog mixing consoles and consumer equipment the frequencies are often fixed with 80 Hz being a typical value for a low shelf and 12 kHz for a high shelf. More sophisticated equalizers allow you to adjust them within a certain range.

Compared to a parametric mid band a shelving band is a rather coarse tool. That’s why it isn’t ideal for targeting specific troublesome frequencies. Instead it lends itself to wide-band “sweetening” – polishing the overall sound by boosting characteristic frequency ranges. For example you can make vocals shine by applying a bit of high-end boost using a shelving EQ.

Equalizer mistake #2: You don’t eliminate troublesome resonant frequencies

A common beginner’s mistake is the attempt to improve the sound and expression of vocals or instruments by boosting many different frequencies. While this approach does occasionally deliver the desired results it’s much more important to find and attenuate resonant frequencies. Every musical instrument and microphone has certain resonant frequencies which can be detrimental to the overall sound. Furthermore resonances can build up a lot of energy and mask important components of the useful signal. That’s why it’s important to find troublesome resonances in your audio signals and attenuate them using an equalizer.

To find them solo the channel first. Then turn the gain knob of a parametric mid band up to about 6 to 10 dB of boost and choose a rather narrow bandwidth (high Q). Now you can use the frequency knob to sweep through the frequency spectrum while listening carefully. When you’ve found a spot where it sounds especially booming or piercing chances are that you’ve discovered a resonance which you can now attenuate. In many cases about 3 to 6 dB of cut is enough to tame the resonance while leaving the source signal intact.

Equalizer mistake #3: You’re boosting frequencies that mask other elements in the mix

When you boost the wrong frequencies you can end up covering up other instruments in the mix. One of the best examples is synthesizer sounds and electric guitars. Both instruments fight for the listener’s attention and compete for the same frequency range in the middle of the spectrum. Let’s say we boost the high mids at about 2 to 4 kHz in the synth channel. While doing so will undoubtedly help the synth stand out it can cover up the guitar or other instruments. Moreover the synth can begin to sound harsh and piercing. That’s why your first step should be to achieve a transparent well-balanced mix. And the easiest way to get there usually isn’t boosting what you want to hear but rather attenuating what you don’t want to hear as described above.

Equalizer mistake #4: You don’t pay attention to frequency spacing

Our ears are best at distinguishing natural sound sources if they come from different directions and sound differently. What happens in three dimensions in the natural world must be accomplished in only two dimensions in a stereo mix. You only have the stereo panorama and depth of field to work with.

This can be especially problematic with instruments like bass and bass drum both of which are usually panned in the center and contain similar frequencies. The louder instrument tends to cover up the quieter one. Let’s assume that the bass drum has a resonance at 80 Hz and the bass has a characteristic frequency at 60 Hz. This would likely lead to a situation where neither instrument comes through clearly and the mix sounds muddy and undefined.

That’s why it’s a good idea to give each instrument its own separate space in the frequency spectrum. In our example that could mean cutting the bass at 60 Hz and applying a slight boost at 50 Hz for example. We could also attenuate the bass drum at 80 Hz and boost 100 Hz. This way we’re creating some separation between the two instruments which helps them to get along in the mix. But be careful – the aforementioned equalizer settings are just examples!

Typical frequency ranges of various instruments

The table below shows some characteristic frequencies for some important instruments. As a starting point you could try to boost these while cutting other frequencies to make room for the other elements in the mix.

Ideally your mix fills the frequency spectrum evenly without any heavy emphasis in the bass mid or treble ranges. A spectrum analyzer can help to keep an eye on this. Another popular trick is to compare your mix with a reference track. This helps to spot imbalances which are easy to get used to when all you’re listening to for hours is your own mix.

Instrument Frequency range Vocals 80 Hz to 12 kHz Spoken voice fundamental frequency (male) 120 Hz Spoken voice fundamental frequency (female) 240 Hz Consonants 1.6 to 6 kHz Sibilance 5 to 8 kHz Bass drum (shell resonance) 50 to 150 Hz Bass drum (beater) 1 to 4 kHz Snare (sustain) 80 to 500 Hz Snare (wires) Harmonics up to 12 kHz Hi-hat up to 15 kHz Toms (sustain) 70 to 120 Hz Toms (attack) up to 7 kHz Cymbals up to 20 kHz Acoustic guitar (fundamentals) 82 to 1174 Hz Acoustic guitar (harmonics) up to 12 kHz Electric guitar amped (fundamentals) 82 to 1174 Hz Electric guitar amped (harmonics) up to 7 kHz Electric bass (4 string fundamentals) 41 to 343 Hz Electric bass (4 string harmonics) up to 5 kHz

Equalizer mistake #5: You overdo it

The equalizer was originally developed as a corrective tool for dealing with distortion introduced during the recording process rather than as a sonic shaping tool. Sometimes it’s a good idea to remember this. Using too much EQ can easily make your mix worse instead of better. If your recorded tracks don’t sound good without equalization they probably won’t sound much better when you EQ the living daylights out of them. That’s why it’s best to make sure your tracks sound great in the first place and use EQ sparingly. Otherwise you risk taking away too much substance which can sound unnatural.

That said it’s absolutely possible to use EQs and filters deliberately as effects – the popular “telephone voice effect” with a strong boost between 300 Hz and 3 kHz is a good example of this. Similarly a sweeping band pass filter with a steep slope can make a dull synth pad sound much more interesting. But this type of EQing is more of a sound design effect rather than a mixing technique. If you find yourself having to reach for an EQ all the time it’s probably time to go back and think about what might have gone wrong during recording.

Equalizer mistake #6: You over-emphasize the high frequencies

The vocals should be upfront in the mix the guitar riff should cut through and the snare needs to sound punchy. Simple – just turn up the high frequencies in all of them right? Unfortunately that’s probably a recipe for disaster.

Boosting the highs on vocal tracks also means boosting sibilant “S” sounds. If you overdo it they can become annoying and you need to use a de-esser to fix it. Likewise cymbals can sound very harsh with too much of a high-frequency boost which can really throw your mix off balance. That’s why you should resist the temptation to boost the high frequencies in all of your tracks.

Equalizer mistake #7: You try to boost frequencies that don’t exist in the source signal

If you boost a bass drum at 12 kHz chances are that nothing’s going to happen – certainly nothing that affects the sound of the bass drum. That’s because the instrument doesn’t produce any relevant content in this frequency range. An EQ can only boost frequencies that are already present in the source signal. Boosting other frequencies (like the highs in a bass drum) only gets you more noise and distortion because all you’re doing is increasing the noise floor of the signal. You’re also wasting an EQ band that could be put to good use for something else.

Equalizer mistake #8: You use too much EQ during recording

Your microphone signals are the raw material for all further editing and mixing. The better the source material the easier it is to get a good mix. When the vocals sound dull or the snare doesn’t slam many beginners make the mistake to boost the highs during recording. Unfortunately that doesn’t make the vocals or the snare any better – it only covers up the mistakes made during recording. That’s why it’s best to avoid using an EQ altogether during recording. If the sound doesn’t feel right experiment with a different microphone or microphone position rather than trying to fix it with an EQ.

That said you can absolutely use a bit of corrective EQ during recording such as a low cut to get rid of low-end rumble or some subtle parametric EQ to attenuate annoying resonances. However you should only do this if you’ve got a bit of experience and are absolutely certain that you won’t need those frequencies later. Remember: Once you’ve removed frequencies during recording you can’t bring them back later in the mix! It’s generally better to reserve the EQ for later editing and mixing sessions when you’ve got more time for precise adjustments. Recording sessions can be hectic and the focus should be on getting a great sound out of your microphones rather than dealing with an EQ.

Equalizer mistake #9: You don’t use graphic equalizers correctly

Contrary to parametric EQs graphic equalizers are mainly used for room compensation and feedback suppression in live sound applications. They’re less suitable for processing individual signals in the studio.

Graphic EQs are called “graphic” because they provide a quick visual representation of the overall EQ curve. A typical 1/3-octave EQ offers 31 frequency bands each of which is equipped with its own cut/boost slider. In contrast to a parametric EQ you cannot move the frequency bands to target specific frequencies. A common workaround is to adjust the surrounding bands forming a small curve around the desired frequency.

A graphic EQ has another major disadvantage: Once it is inserted into the signal path the signal always passes through 31 filter arrays because the individual bands cannot be deactivated. Consequently each band adds a little bit of noise distortion and possibly phase shifting which can add up and end up in the overall signal.

Live sound engineers rely on graphic EQs for tuning the PA system to account for the characteristics of the room or to prevent feedback in the monitor speakers. Due to the disadvantages mentioned above they’re less suitable for recording and mixing.

Equalizer mistake #10: You rely too heavily on the visual representation of the EQ curve

Thanks to digital signal processing modern EQs and EQ plug-ins offer many visual aids such as built-in analyzers. While these digital perks are convenient they also have a drawback: They can cause you to use your eyes rather than your ears.

Needless to say the graphical representation of the EQ curve in modern DAWs and digital mixers is very useful. Things like the bandwidth of a parametric EQ or the effect of a shelving EQ are easy to spot. However many users tend to rely too heavily on these visual aids and forget about what matters the most: the sound! Moreover the display doesn’t always correspond exactly to the acoustic effect. That’s why it’s a good idea to take your eyes off the screen once in a while and concentrate on what you’re hearing – because that’s what really matters!

Her Philosophies

On being an entrepreneur having worked for several organisations she said:

“There are challenges but when you are focussed dedicated and determined you will scale through all the hurdles. Looking back I thank God how far He has helped me.

“I’m a very passionate person. If I believe in anything I put in everything to make it work. In fact I do tell people that since I started here it’s as if I’m not working because when I was on the other side I put in so much. Then sometimes I had to work late into the night. But starting this company I’m not burdened because once you are used to hard work you don’t believe that there is a challenge you can’t overcome.”

Being a woman determined to excel in a corporate world she said is a challenge.

“So the challenge I faced most was that people rarely believed in me as a woman. People sometimes think women won’t be able to deliver. It’s a major challenge and as a female you have to do a lot for you to be recognised and given the opportunity to express yourself. I must say it’s tough for women. As a woman you have a home to run apart from work meaning you have to work much more than a man” she pointed out.",,,,,,,,,,,,

Rather than enjoying playing golf with his friends at famous Open courses around the United Kingdom the 47-year-old ended up traipsing across the country trying to locate his bags after they got lost on the journey over from the U.S.

Prenatt from Tampa Bay Fla. had attached Apple Inc. devices called AirTags to his golf bag and other luggage to track where they were after checking in for his flight. Upon landing in the U.K. he saw his bags were still stuck on the tarmac at Newark airport where they remained for two days. His luggage was eventually sent to a warehouse in Edinburgh but while driving there to pick it up he noticed that his clubs were already headed to Aberdeen. His AirTag showed they finally ended up in the West Midlands in England.

“It’s a mess” he said.

Prenatt’s experience encapsulates the chaos travelers are facing as airports in Europe the U.S. and elsewhere are overwhelmed by a surge in passenger traffic — and luggage — because they don’t have enough staff to cope following the mass job cuts that engulfed the aviation industry during the pandemic.

Travelers are turning to AirTags and similar devices from other companies to keep tabs on their belongings. Apple introduced AirTags in April 2021 with a starting price of $29 while Samsung Electronics Co.’s SmarTag costs $29.99.

The devices which use short-range Bluetooth are permissible on planes with many passengers already flying with gadgets that use similar technology like gaming consoles and headphones.

A British Airways Plc passenger wrote on Twitter this week that her tracker showed her luggage arrived in London Heathrow a day after her flight and has been there for more than 10 days. Last month a Singapore Airlines Ltd. passenger used his AirTag to locate and collect his bags after they’d been stuck in Melbourne Airport for a week the Daily Mail reported.

Representatives for British Airways couldn’t immediately comment.

Heathrow one of the world’s busiest airports on Tuesday imposed a two-month cap on daily passenger traffic through Sept. 11 because of staff shortages asking airlines to refrain from selling summer tickets. This week Delta Air Lines Inc. flew a wide-body aircraft without passengers to bring 1000 lost bags from the London hub back to the U.S. A Delta spokesperson said the carrier’s teams had “worked a creative solution” to move delayed checked bags on July 11 after a regular scheduled flight had to be canceled.

Paul Pelosi purchased on June 17 20000 shares of Nvidia a top semiconductor company worth between $1 million and $5 million the Daily Caller reported citing disclosure reports filed by the House speaker.

Senators are expected to convene as early as Tuesday to vote on a bipartisan competition bill to set aside $52 billion to boost domestic semiconductor manufacturing and give tax credits for production Reuters reported.

“It certainly raises the specter that Paul Pelosi could have access to some insider legislative information” Craig Holman a government affairs lobbyist for the left-wing think tank Public Citizen told the Daily Caller News Foundation. “This is the reason why there is a stock trading app that exclusively monitors Paul’s trading activity and then its followers do likewise.”

Taiwan has been stepping up efforts to stop what it views as underhand and illegal activities by Chinese firms to steal know-how and poach away talent in what Taipei's government views as a threat to the island's tech prowess.

Prosecutors in New Taipei said after a year-and-a-half investigation they had found that China's Luxshare Precision Industry Co Ltd had targeted Taiwanese competitor Catcher Technology Co Ltd ""in order to quickly enter the Apple production chain to win orders"".

Luxshare ""lured"" Catcher's China based research and development team with promises of high salaries and stole business secrets from the Taiwanese firm causing them big losses the prosecutors said in a statement.

Luxshare was doing this in order to be able to ""quickly build factories and mass produce cases for iPhones iPads and other products"" the statement said.

Luxshare did not immediately respond to a request for comment and neither did Apple.

New Taipei prosecutors have now charged 14 people in connection with the case for breach of trust and taking commercial secrets for use overseas they added.

""The department will do its best to investigate such cases to maintain the sound development of our country's enterprises and ensure the competitiveness of national industries.""

Catcher which makes iPhone and iPad cases said in a statement it continues to implement and optimise the protection of trade secrets and intellectual property rights and will investigate anything that infringes on its rights and interests.

The company is cooperating with the probe it added.

In May Taiwanese authorities raided 10 companies or their R&D centres operating in Taiwan without approval suspected of illegally poaching chip engineers and other tech talent.

(NYSE:AJG) insiders offloaded a considerable amount of shares over the past year could have raised some eyebrows amongst investors. Knowing whether insiders are buying is usually more helpful when evaluating insider transactions as insider selling can have various explanations. However shareholders should take a deeper look if several insiders are selling stock over a specific time period.

Although we don't think shareholders should simply follow insider transactions we would consider it foolish to ignore insider transactions altogether.

Arthur J. Gallagher Insider Transactions Over The Last Year

The Corporate VP & Chief Human Resource Officer Susan Pietrucha made the biggest insider sale in the last 12 months. That single transaction was for US$5.2m worth of shares at a price of US$212 each. That means that an insider was selling shares at around the current price of US$206. We generally don't like to see insider selling but the lower the sale price the more it concerns us. In this case the big sale took place at around the current price so it's not too bad (but it's still not a positive).

Smith is disappointed with Patrick Beverley for his behavior toward a fan and a producer following the Bucks' loss. (2:30)

INDIANAPOLIS -- Indianapolis police announced Wednesday they've opened an investigation into an ""NBA player and citizen"" altercation that happened at Gainbridge Fieldhouse on the night Milwaukee Bucks guard Patrick Beverley threw a ball at a fan in the final minutes of a season-ending loss to the Indiana Pacers.

Police said in a news release the case has been forwarded to detectives ""who are currently investigating this situation and take all accusations seriously.""

Detectives will present the case to the Marion County Prosecutor's Office at the conclusion of the investigation the release stated.

Cameras showed Beverley sitting on the bench and tossing a ball into the stands hitting a fan in the head with about 2½ minutes left in Thursday's contest. After a different fan threw the ball back to Beverley who was holding his arm out for it the Bucks guard fired it back at that spectator.

Beverley spoke about his behavior on an episode of ""The Pat Bev Podcast"" that was released Wednesday. He said he was called a word that he'd never been called before but added that his own actions were ""still inexcusable.""

""I will be better"" he said. ""I have to be better and I will be better. That should have never happened. Regardless of what was said that should have never happened. Simple as that.""

Beverley added the atmosphere in Indianapolis ""was great"" aside from ""a handful of fans"" who crossed a line. The Pacers beat the Bucks 120-98 eliminating Milwaukee in six games in the first round of the Eastern Conference playoffs.

""I will be better. I have to be better and I will be better. That should have never happened. Regardless of what was said that should have never happened. Simple as that.""

""I ain't bringing a basketball on the bench no more"" Beverley said. ""That ... threw my whole vibe off.""

After the game Beverley wouldn't allow ESPN journalist Malinda Adams to ask him a question in a group interview in the locker room. He said it was because she didn't subscribe to his podcast. Beverley told her to get her microphone out of his face then eventually asked her to leave the interview circle.

On his podcast Wednesday Beverley said he had asked that of reporters who interviewed him ever since he launched his podcast. Beverley said he told Adams that ""it was never my intent to disrespect you.""

A day after the loss Bucks coach Doc Rivers said Beverley's behavior was ""not the Milwaukee way or the Bucks way.""

""We're better than that"" Rivers said. ""Pat feels awful about that. He also understands emotionally -- this is an emotional game and things happen -- unfortunately you're judged immediately and he let the emotions get the better of him.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiT2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lndhc2hpbmd0b25wb3N0LmNvbS9zdHlsZS8yMDI0LzA1LzA4L3RoZS1vZmZpY2UtcmV0dXJucy0yMDI0LXJlYm9vdC_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,'The Office' spinoff to take place at a daily newspaper - The Washington Post,The new untitled series which starts production in June will center on a newsroom whose publisher is trying to save it with “volunteer reporters” per the announcement.

On a nearby wharf Prime Minister Mark Brown and many other prominent citizens had gathered to celebrate the smaller boat’s arrival. To Mr. Brown the cruise ship represented his country’s troubling dependence on tourism. He described the other vessel owned by an international mining company as a harbinger of incredible wealth.

The Cook Islands is at the vanguard of a quest to mine the ocean floor for minerals used in electric car batteries.

Engineering design software provider Autodesk (ADSK -0.31%) is one of the fascinating investment propositions on the market. It's a stock that looks likely to reward investors over the long term but anyone buying in must be aware it will take time for the company's full potential to shine through in the numbers. Here are some of the red and green flags waving around Autodesk simultaneously.

Expectations

No one likes it when a company they invest in continues to lower its earnings projections and Autodesk's investors are no different. The company's guidance particularly for fiscal 2023 -- the current fiscal year which will end in January -- has long been a battleground among investors.

The debate long centered on management's previous guidance for $2.4 billion in free cash flow (FCF) for fiscal 2023. This represented a significant step up from both the $1.35 billion reported in 2021 and the original guidance for $1.575 billion to $1.65 billion in 2022.

However Autodesk missed its original guidance estimate for 2022 FCF (reporting just $1.48 billion) and its FCF guidance for 2023 now stands at $2 billion to $2.08 billion.

What the market thinks about Autodesk

To flesh out what Wall Street now expects from Autodesk here's a look at consensus forecasts for earnings and FCF.

There are a couple of things to note here. First the market's FCF estimate for 2023 ($2.04 billion) is bang in the middle of management's guidance range but it's notably lower than the previous target of $2.4 billion.

Second FCF is set to dip in FY 2024 due to management's revising its billing strategy for larger clients. In a nutshell Autodesk will reduce its discounts for up-front payments in favor of multiyear deals. This has the effect of lowering revenue and FCF in the year of implementation but possibly raising long-term revenue and FCF generation. It's not a significant issue in itself but note that based on these numbers Autodesk's price-to-FCF multiple based on the current price will expand to 21 in 2024 even though revenue and earnings are still increasing.

Metric 2020 2021 2022 2023 (Estimated) 2024 (Estimated) 2025 (Estimated) Revenue $3.27 billion $3.79 billion $4.39 billion $5.02 billion $5.72 billion $6.51 billion Earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization $0.86 billion $1.17 billion $1.45 billion $1.9 billion $2.23 billion $2.63 billion Free cash flow $1.36 billion $1.35 billion $1.48 billion $2.04 billion $1.81 billion $2.24 billion Price to free cash flow 28.4 28.6 26.1 18.9 21.3 17.2

Moreover Autodesk's revenue growth will likely slow if the economy slows. After all its architecture engineering construction and manufacturing customers are all in sectors that are sensitive to interest rates. If the fears of an economic slowdown prove valid then don't be surprised if Autodesk lowers its full-year guidance.

Is the stock worth buying?

As I said above investors buying shares of Autodesk will need to tolerate near-term risk around its earnings. Moreover the optics on FCF growth will be clouded by the artificially induced slowdown in fiscal 2024.

On the other hand Autodesk is still seeing revenue grow in the double digits and has plenty of growth drivers including digitization within its core products. Using digital technology developers can collaborate better in the design development and ""make and build"" process. These technologies include its cloud construction initiatives and its 3D modeling software. In addition there's an opportunity to convert customers over time to these products.

Moreover Autodesk's implied valuations set out in the table above are not expensive for a growth stock and even with a slight reduction in guidance for 2023 you can still make a strong case for buying shares. However be aware you will have to wait a few years before the stock starts to look like a great value again and the near-term risk is rising.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiO2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1ha2V1c2VvZi5jb20vYmVzdC1zb2Z0d2FyZS1mb3ItamV3ZWxyeS1kZXNpZ24v0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,The 7 Best Software for Designing Your Own Jewelry,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with ('Connection aborted.', RemoteDisconnected('Remote end closed connection without response')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiO2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1ha2V1c2VvZi5jb20vYmVzdC1zb2Z0d2FyZS1mb3ItamV3ZWxyeS1kZXNpZ24v0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen",,,,,,,,,

Thirty-one college students (18–33 years old average: 20.68 years old; 14 males) participated in the present experiment. None of the participants reported any neurological or psychiatric history. All participants were right-handed and had normal or corrected-to-normal vision. Each participant voluntarily enrolled in and signed an informed consent form prior to the experiments and got the monetary compensation of approximately MOP 60 for one experimental session. The anonymous participants can only be identified by the tag from “sub-01” through “sub-31”. This study was performed in strict accordance with the Guidelines for Research Ethics of the University of Macau. The Institutional Review Board of the University has approved all procedures.

Text descriptions of task overview were shown in Table 1.

Table 1 An overview of the four sessions. Full size table

Experimental procedures

Participants were instructed to sit in an adjustable chair whose eyes were approximately 60 cm away from the monitor (Dell resolution: 1920 × 1080 pixels vertical refresh rate: 60 Hz) see Fig. 3a. They were then informed that they would perform simple decision making tasks. All three tasks were divided into three blocks interleaved with two breaks when the experimenter could check the impedance of the electrodes and supplement saline if necessary.

Stimulus presentation and manual response measurement were controlled by PsychoPy13 Standalone (2020.2.3) and the EGI PyNetstaion module was used to connect PsychoPy and EGI Netstation. All stimuli were presented on the screen against a black background (RGB: 000). A white cross subtended 1.0 × 1.0° worked as a fixation at the center of the screen. There was a grey rectangle (RGB: 169 169 169) with the white-font “start” subtended 4.0 × 2.2° at the start of each trial showing up at the bottom center of the screen. Two target options (images or words) subtended 10.6 × 8.0° appeared at the screen’s top left and top right side respectively. After clicking on one of the targets a blue frame (RGB: 0 255 0) will appear on the selected target subtended 10.7 × 8.1°.

Session 1: Resting-state

The resting-state session consisted of two blocks with 50 trials in each block. In each trial participants were asked to look at the fixation cross at the center of the screen for 7 s followed by a blank lasting for 1 s. There was a 2-min break between the two blocks.

Session 2: Food choice task

Three hundred and twenty pictures depicting various types of food were selected from Food-Pics Extended14 for both the pre-rating and food choice tasks. Firstly participants were required to rate the target food from three aspects which were presented randomly.

The first rating task aims to examine participants’ preferences in food choices. Participants needed to rate the taste of the target food presented at the center of the screen by a five-point Likert scale (“How do you like this food?” One denotes “extremely unsavory” while five denotes “extremely delicious”). The second rating relates to participants’ perception of food healthiness. Participants were asked to judge whether the target food was healthy or not (“How healthy do you think this food is?” One denotes “extremely unhealthy” while five denotes “extremely healthy”). In the third rating participants were asked to judge how much they wanted to eat the target food after the experiment (“How much do you want to eat this food after the experiment?” One denotes “I don’t want it at all” while five denotes “I desperately want it”).

In the formal food choice task as shown in Fig. 1a each trial began with a blank with the word “start” at the bottom center of the screen. The participant could click the start box once they were ready. Two pictures of target food appeared in the upper left and upper right corner of the screen. The participants were asked to choose the preferred one by continuously moving the mouse to their favorite food box and clicking it. Upon click the selected picture would be highlighted in blue for 1000 ms. After the pictures disappeared a fixation would show up for 800 to 1500 ms (mean = 1150 ms). There were 160 pairs of pictures in the formal task with each pair appearing twice. This session took about 26 minutes. There were two 2-min breaks in this task.

Session 3: Image choice task

Eighty images of animate objects and 80 inanimate objects were collected and designed by ourselves. Each image appeared twice in a pseudo-randomized order. Each trial began with the “start” button at the bottom center of the screen as shown in Fig. 1b. Once started the target object image would appear at the center. Participants need to determine whether the object is an animate or inanimate thing by clicking on the corresponding option in the upper left or upper right corner of the screen with a mouse. Upon click the selected option would be highlighted in blue and lasted for 1000 ms. A fixation cross would subsequently show up and last for 800–1500 ms randomly. There were 320 trials in total. The positions for the “animate” and “inanimate” options were counterbalanced across all trials. It took participants around 27 minutes to complete this session. There were two 2-min breaks in this task.

Session 4: Word choice task

The procedure of the word choice task was almost identical with the image choice task as shown in Fig. 1c. All the pictures from session three were replaced by their corresponding Chinese written words. To avoid ambiguity two raters of Chinese linguistics background were invited to name the pictures and reached an agreement upon the 80 animate and 80 inanimate nouns. Two word types were also matched regarding word frequency [t(80) = 1.241 p = 0.216 word frequency data retrieved from the chinese corpus (http://corpus.zhonghuayuwen.org)] and number of strokes [t(80) = 0.749 p = 0.455]. This session took around 26 minutes. There were two 2-min breaks in this task.

Although the time to finish all of the tasks is long we attempted to give participants enough break time during the task and between the tasks. Meanwhile the saltwater during the break time can keep the impedance of the electrodes low which provides sufficient guarantees to ensure high quality EEG data collection.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVGh0dHBzOi8vc3VuZGF5Z3VhcmRpYW5saXZlLmNvbS9uZXdzL2luZGlhbi1hcm15LWdldHMtZnV0dXJlLXJlYWR5LWFpLWJhc2VkLWVxdWlwbWVudNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Indian Army gets future ready with AI-based equipment - The Sunday Guardian Live,"These products range from equipment to detect stealth-human activity and translate Mandarin language in real time to detecting suspicious vehicles and analysing intercepts of the adversary in the Western Theatre.

New Delhi: Under the guidance of Prime Minister Narendra Modi the Indian Army is now among the few global armed forces operating with a plethora of Artificial Intelligence (AI) aided equipment which has resulted in improved operational success and decrease in fatalities to its men.

Within a short period of four years that started in March 2018 when a multi-stakeholder task force was set up on the directions of Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Defence Minister Rajnath Singh to study how to implement AI in the national security perspective the various arms under the Ministry of Defence (MoD) are as of today using at least 75 AI products and technologies or are in the advanced stage of putting these products into use.

The said task force was set up under the chairmanship of N. Chandrasekaran Chairman Tata Sons and submitted its report in June 2018 suggesting multiple inductions into the system including the establishment of the High level Defence AI Council (DAIC) and a Defence AI Project Agency (DAIPA).

Based on the recommendations of the aforesaid task force the Ministry of Defence in February 2019 created Defence AI Council (DAIC) under the Chairmanship of Singh and Defence AI Project Agency (DAIPA) with Secretary (Defence Production) as the ex-officio head for providing necessary guidance to enable and effect development of operating framework policy level changes and structural support for AI adoption in the Indian military.

This urgency which is rarely seen in the Indian administrative ways of working led to the MoD preparing a specific Artificial Intelligence (AI) roadmap for each defence public sector undertaking (DPSU). As a result of this push by the highest office of the present government by March 2020 16 AI products were developed by these DPSUs. The number rose to 26 by March 2021 and by the end of March 2022 another 40 products were developed.

To put things in perspective on how the Indian military as happens generally did not fall behind in exploring and implementing this new technology the most advanced Army of the world the US Army too created a dedicated command to implement AI United States Army Futures Command (AFC) headquartered in Austin Texas only in August 2018.

China similarly issued its AI development plan in July 2018 announcing to emerge as the world leader in AI technology by 2030. Pakistan’s first venture in the field took place in August 2020 when it opened a “Centre of Artificial Intelligence and Computing” at Chaklala Rawalpindi. Turkey another close ally of Pakistan through Turkish Aerospace Industries (TAI) has started working on AI related products from 2018.

Documents and related details shared by Indian government officials with The Sunday Guardian reveal the extent of how these AI products are augmenting the strength of the security establishment.

While the details of most of the products that are being used or are in advanced stages of development have been shared there are a few products whose details have been kept under wraps by the government due to the sensitivity of the functions they execute.

These products range from equipment that detect stealth human activity translate Mandarin language in real time detect suspicious vehicles (and prevent Pulwama-like tragedy) to programs to analyse and automate intercepts of the adversary in the Western Theatre (Pakistan-based terror groups who converse in localised Urdu Punjabi and local languages in order to avoid giving out information regarding their terror related operations).

Official sources told The Sunday Guardian that from this stage these programs and equipment will keep getting better and will cover other operational demands as Government of India encouraged by the result shown by the DPSUs and MoD officials in the last four years will be allocating more money and resources to put the Indian armed forces among the top five global forces when it comes to using AI tools and programs.

Some of these equipment and programs that are being used by the Indian armed forces include:

1. Storm drone:

An AI-enabled automated room intervention drone system with the capability to carry and drop lethal and non-lethal payload to carry out building clearance and urban surveillance in GPS denied areas. It is being used in counter-terrorism room intervention operations urban area surveillance disaster response rescue operations in underground mines (coal and iron ore mines) construction forest and poaching monitoring.

It has saved the lives of military and civilians in urban counter terrorist operations reduced the engagement time in operations has aided in situational awareness and informed decision making and is being used in urban surveillance and tracking of threats.

2. Drone feed analysis:

The Drone Feed Analysis system is an AI deep learning which analyses objects retrieved by remotely piloted aircraft and builds a database repository and carries out AI-enabled analysis providing military pattern of enemy operations and analysis and prediction of events.

It is being used for conventional military Intelligence Surveillance Target Acquisition and Reconnaissance (ISTAR) missions Smartization of Road Opening Party (ROP) Ops live monitoring of counter terrorism operation border surveillance illegal immigration movements drugs trafficking disaster response and progress monitoring (traffic agriculture shipping construction etc).

It is increasing the efficiency and usage of strategic surveillance assets reducing the operations engagement time aiding in situational awareness and informed decision making has helped in increasing the area under surveillance while drastically reducing the cost of surveillance missions and analysis.

3. Seeker monitoring and analysis system:

The Seeker system is a self-contained AI-based facial recognition surveillance monitoring and analysis system for identification and tracking of threats for counter terrorism continuous surveillance and monitoring of disturbed areas. It can also be employed for ensuring state of the art security of critical military/civilian establishments and monitoring at border crossing points. The AI-powered analytics module enables processing of Intelligence data from various sources to identify and track movement of terrorists and anti-national elements aided by accurate information collection.

It is helping the forces by leading to an efficient and effective surveillance allowing psychological dominance on threats and anti-national elements aiding the pre and post incident analysis increasing the area of surveillance and reducing the manpower requirement.

4. Mandarin translators:

In order to develop indigenous capability the Indian Army has been focusing in multiple domains to leverage AI. In the domain of Natural Language Processing (NLP) it has focused on AI based Bi-directional Mandarin to English Wearable Translation devices.

The device is a wearable device for speech-to-speech translation. It equips intelligence agencies with a bi-directional speech-to-speech system that accepts input audio/speech in one source language (e.g. English/Mandarin) and converts it into an equivalent audio/speech of the target language (e.g. Mandarin/English). The portable translation device has real time bi-directional speech capability without any rearward network connectivity. It weighs 80-100 gm with a latency of 3-4 seconds and a battery life of 12 hours.

5. “Project prism”—AI based motion and object detection for target identification:

All units in the Indian Army in operation/field are involved in active surveillance measures for ensuring security of Area of Responsibility (AoR). Majority of the surveillance inputs are in the form of real-time video feeds converging at company posts battalion surveillance centre division surveillance centre etc.

Manual monitoring of real-time continuous video surveillance is very cumbersome and monotonous in nature. No such system exists in IA which can automatically detect and classify objects for target identification.

Proactive Real-time Intelligence and Surveillance Monitoring System (PRISM) is an Artificial Intelligence-based system which is first of its kind software in the Indian Army capable of generating real-time audio/visual alerts on detecting suspicious enemy movements from multiple surveillance inputs for monitoring real-time feeds from the Line of Control Line of Actual Control and counter-terrorism areas to perform real-time motion detection target identification and tracking.

The system is capable of performing real-time video analysis to identify movement detection object detection and target identification from multiple surveillance feed inputs. The system supports detection of multiple types of objects appearing within the same frame or region of video input. It is capable of processing multiple camera inputs/surveillance feeds which are distributed over a local network to a single computer for analysis. The software is capable of identifying the presence of a particular object and raising an alert from long distances. Field tested for various surveillance devices ranging from close range to long ranges up to 800-1000 meters. Detection ranges can be further scaled up for longer distance depending on surveillance device optical capability. The system is seamlessly capable of analysing night surveillance videos with higher accuracy by integrating with infrared and thermal vision cameras.

It is capable of raising an audio alert to sentry on occurrence of motion/appearance of an object of user’s interest.

6. “Project v-logger” vehicle tracking system:

Weaponizing the vehicle is an emerging trend amongst terror groups with the Pulwama attack of 2019 being a prime example of it. Despite deliberate measures the identity of a suspicious vehicle still remains a challenge to the units deployed on active fronts.

V-Log Veh Tracker is a state of the art AI-based software tool being developed for detection and tracking of civilian vehicles using licence plates. The system uses the latest state-of-the-art AI and Deep Learning algorithms for real-time vehicle detection from live video feeds. The system is capable of identifying individual vehicles from moving traffic in real time extract the vehicle information to include number plate make model colour etc. on-the-fly and corroborate the details with a registered vehicle database for cross matching the identity of the vehicle. The system is capable of raising an automatic alarm in case of any identification mismatch in vehicle credentials amounting to suspicion.

(a) Fusion of sensory feeds from multiple imaging systems and sensors on a single dashboard.

(b) AI-based video analytics for anomaly detection allowing rapid intervention.

8. Silent sentry (rail mounted robot with AI):

The fully 3D-printed rail mounted robot slides on a rail that can be installed on fences. The robot can be controlled from computers/tablets and android app as well as function autonomously within set limits. The system utilises two AI features for surveillance i.e. human detection and face recognition for the purpose of surveillance.

(i) Human Detection: The video feed received from the robot is analysed by an AI software utilising object recognition. The software detects movement and human presence automatically generates an audio alarm and stores the photographs with time and date log.

(ii) Facial Recognition: On detection of a human a background facial recognition algorithm is activated which tries to determine the identity of a person from a stored database. The facial features are then stored in the database.

9. AI-based Intercept Management System (IMS)

One of the major tasks in military operations is corroboration of intelligence that requires analysis and interpretation of a huge number of intercepts for generation of Common Operating Intelligence Picture (COIP). The analysis visualisation interpretation and corroboration of such unstructured data is a challenging task. Further the predictive analysis of future operation events requires the support of Artificial Intelligence to plug the gaps. Hence an urgent requirement was felt to design and develop Artificial Intelligence Based Intercept Management System.

IMS is an indigenous software developed inhouse to analyse and automate intercepts of adversaries in the Western Theatre. The software makes use of visualisation techniques and artificial intelligence to interpret op-critical data thereby generating accurate intelligence pictures.

10. Continuously Observing Ubiquitously Available Artificial Intelligence Surveillance System (Choukass):

Existing surveillance equipment deployed for early warning of enemy intrusion suffer from inherent disadvantages of line of sight limitations deployment restricted to its own side resources heavy high power requirement and need for continuous manning. Choukass does not suffer from any such limitations. It is designed to obtain early warning of any intrusions and is extremely portable.

The optical sensor constantly monitors the field of view and when it gets any movement it transmits information in real time through a small inbuilt NB-IOT satellite module to a customized web portal accessible at its own surveillance centres.

11. AI capability in swarm drones

Drone Swarms are a group of drones operating in conjunction with the ground maneuver forces which would provide an aerial maneuver capability during offensive as well as defensive tasks. The shaping of the battlefield can be greatly influenced by Drone Swarms thereby allowing preservation of decisive columns of mechanized forces initially and application at place and time of own choosing. The inherent advantages of affordability flexible employability redundancy precision software domination reduction in mission costs beyond visual Line of Sight (BVLOS) attack capabilities and risk of human casualties make the Swarm Drone a potent weapon for conventional as well as non-conventional operations. Swarm Drones can be effectively employed to detect enemy ground activities and target enemy ground forces to include troops vehicles and command and control links.

Artificial Intelligence and machine learning algorithms used in the system are capable of communicating with each other to form a swarm and achieve a collective goal. Artificial Intelligence algorithms have also been designed and developed to compute the shortest path form a pattern and achieve the common goal such as combined search of a large area. Each drone is powered with distributed active collision avoidance algorithms. These algorithms compute any future collision with every other drone and alter its path dynamically.

Target detection and identification algorithms used in the system enable detection and identification of small size targets vehicles and structures from high altitude and distance. These algorithms are able to perform precise identification wherein it is able to distinguish between equipment humans animals and other objects. Depending upon whether the target is a friend or foe it also suggests action that can be taken to neutralise the threat if any to the operator.

MEMPHIS Tennessee — The Southland Mall in Whitehaven has sat dilapidated—looking partly abandoned for years.

Now a Starbucks plus other stores are opening at the first enclosed mall in the Mid-South.

Public Storage (Aug. 1) as well as Starbucks and AutoZone (early 2023) are confirmed to open at Southland Mall—all announced a year after a push for cleanup on the property.

Sears and Macy's the property’s previous two flagship stores vacated leaving over 30000 square feet empty.

Have you heard? Whitehaven's finally getting a @Starbucks at #SouthlandMall.



An AutoZone and Public Storage too. I spoke with an area restaurant owner who wants #Whitehaven to keep its economic momentum going. @ABC24Memphis pic.twitter.com/FM5Izc6dn2 — Rebecca Butcher 🦋 (@RebeccaB_TV) July 17 2022

""We cook with love on the spot—Whitehaven’s finest” Chef Precious Thompson Jones said.

It’s a momentous move for the historic Whitehaven neighborhood—one that businesses on Brooks Road are feeling. The restaurant that Jones owns Fabulous Flavors is no exception.

“This whole area was dead"" Jones said. ""All these businesses mostly were closed down. My food truck burnt up one night and I put on Facebook ‘God I need you to release me some land.’""

Chef Jones purchased the space for her restaurant on faith.

Soon after that post someone told her the whole building was on sale.

“I was like what? My husband just lost his job too and I was like 'are you ready to trust god with me?'”

So Jones poured her love of cooking into her new culinary endeavor.

The road to opening wasn’t easy.

“I’ve been a convicted felon since ’18"" Jones said. ""When I came home my first job was the Waffle House.”

The former Memphis City Schools cafeteria lady got into the Second Chance Program to get on her feet.

“I believe in giving other people chances because I got another chance and that was the best thing to ever happen to me—to lose my freedom” she said.

""It’s a blessing Whitehaven coming up. Whitehaven coming up. More jobs we need less crime” said Chef Precious Thompson Jones who owns 'Fabulous Flavors' on Brooks Road. @ABC24Memphis pic.twitter.com/bTlNdssPap — Rebecca Butcher 🦋 (@RebeccaB_TV) July 17 2022

The entrepreneur said about new businesses coming to Southland ""It’s a blessing—Whitehaven coming up. More jobs—we need less crime.”

Chef Precious knows that first-hand.

Her restaurant was vandalized and burglarized multiple times.

“They bust my TVs they bust the doors they knocked my cameras down and he took him a drink of water.”

It’s an issue Whitehaven is seeing more of with a recent upswing in property damages and burglaries.

The Greater Whitehaven Economic Redevelopment Corporation is expanding grants to include exterior cameras. They will be plugged into MPD's network to solve more crime.

“We always need good cameras to catch photos of everything going on"" Jones said. ""The good parking lots—we need that as you can see we got holes in the parking lot. The signage falling off the building.”

The list goes on.

Jones said to keep new investments from pulling out security is needed.

""People want to feel safe"" she said. ""I have people calling me ‘like is it safe around there?’ Yes it’s safe.""",,,,,,,,,

Axon Enterprise Inc. a company that develops technology and weapons for military law enforcement and civilians made a stop at the Mendocino County Sheriff’s Office Headquarters yesterday to showcase their latest models of tasers unmanned aerial vehicles and their digital evidence management systems.

In the parking lot of MCSO’s Low Gap office the company’s demonstration trailer along with multiple pop-ups and lunch by Big Earl’s BBQ provided the public an opportunity to see their technology in action and even try their hand at deploying the Taser 7 the company’s latest in taser technology.

Law enforcement’s budgetary demands have given rise to a robust crop of private companies looking to sell products and services to police forces. In Mendocino County public protection accounts for 18.9% of the overall budget representing $64737065 of taxpayer money. This category includes the courts law enforcement and corrections. More specifically the Sheriff’s Office’s yearly budget is approximately $23000000. That sort of budget is enticing to entrepreneurs who see profit potential.

Axon Enterprises first gained notoriety for its mainstreaming of Taser technology within law enforcement refining a design developed by a NASA researcher in 1969. The company broke into the police body camera market branding itself as a tool used to enhance transparency. Police agencies throughout the United States have contracted with Axon including the Berkeley Police Department the Sacramento Police Department and the Los Angeles Police Department.

Axon has also entered the evidence management system market providing agencies with Evidence.com a domain dedicated to warehousing an agency’s evidence and body camera footage.

Touted as an efficient method of storing and maintaining the deluge of data produced by police departments some privacy advocates have expressed concern public records are stored and maintained within the servers of a private entity.

We stepped inside Axon’s demonstration trailer and found its design evoking scenes of stormtroopers patrolling the halls of the Death Star. Theresa Wigley Axon’s roadshow coordinator told us that was purposeful with Axon’s CEO Rick Smith being a huge Star Wars fan and other sci-fi motifs.

Wigley geared us up for an immersive virtual reality experience called “Taser vs. Zombies” created to provide a demonstration of the “immersive nature of the VR.” With zombies lurching toward users experienced the operational nuances of Axon’s Taser technology.

The sci-fi environment of Axon’s demonstration trailer

John Tinder an Axon Senior Master Instructor provided a real-life practicum in taser deployment. Tinder travels around the United States providing training and instructor courses on what he calls Conducted Energy Devices (CEW) to law enforcement military and civilians Tinder described the tool as an essential component in de-escalation.

Standing on the firing line Tinder instructed participants through the operational process of safely using the CEW device. After emphasizing the importance of keeping the device pointed down range Tinder gave the green light to yell “Taser!” and pull the trigger. The probes ejected and immediately connected with the target along with the sound of the energy being sent to each probe.

Theresa Wigley provided an overview of Axon’s Evidence.com a cloud-based evidence management system designed to do the tedious tech work most law enforcement agencies do not have the training nor infrastructure to do efficiently. Using Evidence.com Wigley explained police body cameras are automatically uploaded to Axon’s servers protected by heavy encryption allowing for streamlined management of the hours of data accrued by law enforcement.

John Tinder showing off the Taser 7’s technologies to the Sheriff Kendall

Sheriff Matt Kendall told us tools like Axon’s taser technology have provided a vital non-lethal option for law enforcement when navigating situations that require use-of-force. He remembers as a young deputy with mace a baton and a firearm giving very few options in the continuum of force. He described taser technology as a game changer for law enforcement providing an important stopgap between the baton and the firearm.

In terms of Axon’s data management Sheriff Matt Kendall said the information technology demands of modern law enforcement often get in the way of his deputies doing the work they were trained to do. Instead of dedicating trained law enforcement officers to the tedious demands of data management data management companies like Axon can provide those services faster cheaper and with higher quality.

Sheriff Kendall told us that MCSO currently is in contract with Axon for their taser technologies some number crunching is in order to determine if his agency is interested in expanding those services. “We have to make sure the juice is worth the squeeze” Kendall said.",,,,,,,,,,,,

Uganda government officials have been racking up air miles between Entebbe Italy and US to strike a financing deal for the $4 billion refinery project.

Government officials admit that the refinery project has fallen behind others and will likely come onstream late in 2027 at the earliest if the necessary financing is tied up and the pending technical studies concluded sooner.

As a result local players that were primed to take up equity in the project as well as regional countries that expressed interest in the refinery that was sold as an East African Community (EAC) venture remain non-committal citing the project’s failure to take shape since 2018 when it was awarded to a consortium of investors.

Potential investors say they remain open to discussions with the government but without an engineering procurement and construction (EPC) structure the refinery remains an unbankable project.

“The problem is that the refinery doesn’t have a structure yet — an EPC structure” said Richard Byarugaba managing director of the National Social Security Fund a Ush14 trillion ($3.68 billion) Fund that the government approached in 2015 to take up stake in the project.

The NSSF which traditionally invests heavily in fixed income assets securities and real estate has since 2017 been looking to diversify its investment portfolio by moving into private equity space in new areas especially oil and gas.

Officials in Kampala admit that the project has struggled to attract more interests and investment commitments from other EAC countries besides Tanzania and Kenya who offered to take up part of Uganda’s 40 percent shareholding.

Indeed Africa Intelligence news service reported last week that Uganda is struggling to garner enough enthusiasm from private sector partners to finance the ambitious project located at Kabaale in Hoima District in the west and storage projects in Mpigi District central Uganda where refined products will be stored before distribution.

Regional stake

On paper Uganda remains with a 29 percent stake after Tanzania and Kenya take up their 8.5 percent and 2.5 percent shareholding respectively. Rwanda and Burundi declined participation in the project while there is no local entity that has committed to take up shares.

“Now we have South Sudan and DR Congo as part of EAC; I am not sure if they will come onboard. But it’s useful for all [EAC] countries to participate” said Peter Muliisa chief legal and corporate affairs at Uganda National Oil Company (Unoc) a government entity that oversees its interests in the oil sector.

Unoc subsidiary Uganda Refinery Holding Company (URHC) is the government’s participating agency in the oil refinery project that is expected to produce 60000 barrels of oil per day including gas that will be sold in the regional market.

Since taking the $10 billion FID for Tilenga Kingfisher and the East African Crude Oil Pipeline (Eacop) in February Energy Minister Ruth Nankabirwa and government officials have been visiting Italy to negotiate with the lead investor Albertine Graben Refinery Consortium (AGRC) to get the project going.

Despite getting the refinery deal in 2018 AGRC remains domiciled in Italy Mauritius and the US forcing Ugandan officials to fly for negotiations of three critical commercial agreements which include the shareholders agreement the implementation agreement and crude supply agreements expected to be finalised in six months Mr Muliisa said.

The government subsequently contracted Foster Wheeler Energy from UK in 2009 to conduct a feasibility study for the development of a refinery in Uganda.

The study was undertaken between 2010 and 2012 and it defined the key aspects of developing a refinery in the country such as the size and configuration its location and financing as well as the market for the products to be produced.

The study also confirmed the economic viability of refining petroleum in Uganda hinged on serving the Ugandan market and other East African countries.

Early FID

Uganda Bureau of Statistics data indicate that Uganda’s petroleum consumption has been growing at around 7 percent with 37000 barrels consumed everyday.

It was expected that FID for the refinery would take place alongside that of the upstream projects Tilenga and Kingfisher as well as Eacop in February this year but experts argue that this would be risky for AGRC to commit to a project before assurance of crude oil production.

“I am delighted to work with AGRC which started with the signing of the Project Framework Agreement (PFA) for refinery project on April 10 2018. The refinery FID in the amended PFA was expected within 41 months from effective date of the agreement which falls on 7th February 2022” said Ms Nankabirwa after meeting the consortium in Italy in February this year.

Early FID for the refinery would attract interest from new investors to the project which has a post-tax internal rate of return (IRR) of 15 percent but the committed parties remain the private investor — a consortium of four anchor investors with a 60 percent of the project and Uganda government that takes 40 percent which is further shared amongst the EAC countries and other local participating investors.

The refinery is a point of contention between President Yoweri Museveni and the international oil companies that invest in Uganda’s upstream which favoured the crude oil export pipeline as the best way to commercialise the resources from the Lake Albert projects.

Despite having not warmed up to the refinery TotalEnergies the biggest player in Uganda’s upstream and crude pipeline projects later wrote to government offering to take up a 10 percent stake but there has been no further commitment from the French giant.

The government in April 2018 selected AGRC a consortium of Nuovo Pignone International SRL a Baker Hughes General Electric Company located in Italy Yaatra Africa and Lionworks Group Limited both domiciled in Mauritius and Saipem Spa of Italy as the lead investor for the $4 billion project.

The government is represented by URHC which holds a participating interest of up to 40 percent in the refinery and its attendant infrastructure which includes a 211km refined products pipeline and storage facilities near Kampala.

Kenya and Tanzania will also participate through their investment vehicles.

Uganda government agencies are looking for about $480 million to $500 million for its stake but officials say this could change depending on the project attracting new local and regional.

The $4 billion project will be funded through a debt to equity ratio of about 70:30 with the lead investor AGRC responsible for raising the $2.8 billion debt as loans for the project while also contributing 60 per cent of the $1.2 billion in equity the regulator Petroleum Authority of Uganda (PAU) explains.

The PAU is currently reviewing the refinery Front End Engineering Design (FEED) before making its final comments.

Uganda’s push for a refinery has history of abandoned efforts; in 2013 the government shortlisted several firms for the job before awarding the tender in 2015 to Russian consortium RT Global Resources as the best preferred bidder.

However Kampala kept South Korean consortium SK Energy on short leash as the alternative preferred bidder for the refinery job in case the Russians pulled out — a reality that came to pass in 2016.

SK Energy was then handed the job but the firm also pulled out citing the high risk of taking up 60 percent as the private lead investor prompting a new tendering process that resulted in the 2018 selection of the AGRC consortium.",,,,,,,,,,,,

The company said that the PDR was part of a technical process to ensure that its design can realize a precise low-cost speed-of-light technology for military operations.

In March 2021 the US Department of Defense (DoD) awarded Northrop Grumman a $72 million contract under the High Energy Laser Scaling Initiative (HELSI) to demonstrate a HEL prototype using Northrop Grumman’s coherent beam combining technology.

The HELSI is a Pentagon initiative to develop a new 300-kilowatt-class laser weapon prototype for technology demonstration.

“This is an important step in combining high-power laser beams into a single beam that can be scaled for maximum power” said Robert Fleming vice president and general manager strategic space systems Northrop Grumman.

“We’re on track to demonstrate the technology leveraging our decades of experience in the field.”

According to the company the prototype can be scaled up to more than a megawatt. It will be tested at progressively higher powers later this year to prove the coherent beam combining (CBC) design.

Beam combining involves combining the outputs of multiple laser sources to obtain a single high-energy output beam. In contrast ‘Coherent’ beam incorporation would involve the merger of coherent waves – waves with a constant phase difference.

Another method to fuse two laser beams is ‘Spectral’ beam combining (SBC) also known as wavelength beam combining which involves superimposing the outputs of several laser emitters at specific wavelengths in an area to form a single beam.

The SBC technology was used by Lockheed Martin and its subsidiary Aculight Corporation to demonstrate a series of laser weapon prototypes: first the 30 kilowatts then 60 kilowatts and ultimately 100 kilowatts in October 2019 which then also won them a HELSI contract to demonstrate a 300 kilowatts class laser in 2022.

Lockheed Martin is only one of the three companies participating in the HELSI initiative led by the Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD) and the US Army promotes it. Other companies are Nutronics Inc. sponsored by the Navy and General Atomics sponsored by the US Air Force (USAF).

In May 2020 Dynetics also announced that it would work to increase the power of a 100 kW-class system to the 300kW-class system for the US Army and demonstrate a prototype in 2022.

High-Energy Lasers US Military’s Top Priority

The incorporation of laser weapons technology is currently one of the high-priority targets of the US military especially after the US lawmakers asked the armed services to speed up efforts toward developing Directed Energy Weapons (DEWs) in early July.

The US Army plans to have two types of laser weapons systems for air defense by 2022 which include the 50 kilowatts class weapons and 300 kilowatts class weapons fitted on Stryker armored vehicles manufactured by General Dynamics.

The 50-kilowatt laser weapon is designated as the DE-MSHORAD (Directed Energy – Maneuver Short-Range Air Defense) which will be used to shoot short-range rockets artillery and drones. In contrast the 300 kilowatts beams will be used against cruise missiles.

Initially Northrop Grumman and Raytheon competed for the 50-kilowatt laser weapon system. Still Northrop Grumman dropped out of the program while Raytheon recently demonstrated its prototype in May against 60-millimeter mortars and several small medium and large drones.

Meanwhile the US Air Force received its first high-energy laser weapon on July 12 called LANCE (or Laser Advancements for Next-generation Compact Environments) from Lockheed Martin.

LANCE is a pod weapon that can be fitted on an aircraft with the primary laser weapon supplied by Lockheed Martin and the pod carrying LANCE made by Boeing. Also the beam control system that trains the laser on its target is provided by Northrop Grumman.

It is unclear how much power this new laser weapon will produce but reports indicate it will probably not exceed 100 kilowatts.

It is also unknown which aircraft this podded laser weapon will ultimately be tested on or deployed. However Lockheed Martin had previously shown the pod carried by an F-16 fighter jet in its concept art. At the same time Boeing had tested a pre-prototype pod shape on a USAF F-15 fighter.",,,,,,,,,,,,

He is highly regarded by Warren Buffett (Trades Portfolio)’s right hand man Charlie Munger (Trades Portfolio) who has called Li a genius and even trusts him with part of his investments.

Li is even credited for giving Munger and Buffett the idea to invest into Chinese EV maker BYD Co (SZSE:002594 Financial). Berkshire Hathaway reportedly purchased $232 million worth of BYD shares for a 10% stake back in 2008. We don't know any concrete details on this stake because it's not a U.S. holding and is thus not required to be reported to the Securities and Exchanges Commission but if the holding has remained the same since then it would now be worth approximately $5.6 billion.

It's clear that Li knows a lot about stock picking. Thus in anticipation of the second-quarter 13F filings which should start hitting the news soon let's take a look at the top three holdings in Li's 13F portfolio as of the first quarter.

Investors should be aware that 13F reports do not provide a complete picture of a guru’s holdings. They include only a snapshot of long equity positions in U.S.-listed stocks and American depository receipts as of the quarter’s end. They do not include short positions non-ADR international holdings or other types of securities. However even this limited filing can provide valuable information.

1. Micron

Micron (MU Financial) is the fourth largest semiconductor company in the world and one of the “big 3” providers of DRAM technology. RAM (Random Access Memory) is an essential component of all computers and cell phones. The holding takes up 37% of Li's U.S. equity portfolio.

The rise of 5G mobile devices is a strong secular tailwind behind the company as 5G devices have 50% higher DRAM and double the NAND versus 4G phones. Micron makes ~71% of its revenue from DRAM and 26% from NAND which is used in solid state hard drives (SSDs).

Micron's stock nosedived from the highs of $94 per share in January 2022 to lows of $51 per share recently which is perhaps one of the reasons why investors such as Mohnish Pabrai (Trades Portfolio) were buying shares lately. Li last added to this position in the third quarter of 2020 at an average price of $48 per share which is ~22% lower than where the stock currently trades at the time of writing.

Micron generated good earnings results for the quarter ending June 2022. It generated revenue of $8.64 billion up 16% from the $7.42 billion achieved in the quarter ending June 2021. Operating income came in at $3 billion up a rapid 36% from $2.3 billion generated in the same period last year.

The bad news is that management stated poor guidance for the full fiscal year and according to the CEO “industry demand has weakened."" The semiconductor industry is notoriously cyclical and all areas of the market tend to move from supply shortage (which we saw in 2020) to supply overflow or weak demand which we are seeing now. But if we zoom out in the long term the trend towards an increasing number of electronic devices and 5G penetration is still a strong secular tailwind.

Micron’s management forecast earnings per share on a non-GAAP basis to be in the range of $1.43 and $1.83 per share which is lower than conesus estimates of $2.62 per share.

According to the GF Value line Micron has a fair value of $83 per share and is thus modestly undervalued at the time of writing.

2. Bank of America

Bank of America (BAC Financial) is the second largest bank in the U.S. and eighth largest bank in the world. The bank has one of the largest brick and mortar branch networks in the U.S. and has become a “one stop shop” for consumer banking. It has a 25% weight in Li's U.S. equity portfolio.

It is also one of Warren Buffett (Trades Portfolio)’s top stocks and makes up 11% Berkshire Hathaway’s (BRK.A Financial)(BRK.B Financial) $363 billion portfolio.

Li Lu (Trades Portfolio) was most recently adding to his Bank of America position in the fourth quarter of 2021 at an average price of $45 per share which is 30% higher than where the stock is trading at currently.

Bank of America divides its business into four main segments;

Consumer Banking (36% of revenue) Global Wealth Management (22% of revenue) Global Banking (22% of revenue) Global Markets (20% of revenue)

Bank of America reported stable earnings for the first quarter of 2022. It generated revenue of $23.2 billion which was up 2% year-over-year and net interest income (NII) of $11.6 billion up 13% year-over-year on the back of strong deposit growth and investment of excess liquidity.

Bank of America could act as an “inflation hedge” as it has a large variable loan portfolio. Thus as interest rates increase Bank of America generates more profit. According to management for every 100 basis points rise in interest rates net interest income is expected to increase by $6.5 billion.

According to the GF Value line Bank of America has a fair value of $37 per share and thus is modestly undervalued at the time of writing.

3. Berkshire Hathaway

Warren Buffett (Trades Portfolio)’s investing conglomerate Berkshire Hathaway is the third-largest holding of Li's U.S. portfolio taking up 13% of the portfolio space. Li owns the Class B shares (BRK.B Financial) and was buying more in the third quarter of 2021 at an average price of $280 per share which is close to where the stock trades today.

Berkshire Hathaway is one of the world's largest investing conglomerates. It has over 360000 employees but only 25 work at the headquarters. This unique decentralized setup is only made possible because of Buffett's unique management style.

Berkshire's Investment strategy has been outlined many times by many different people so going too in-depth here would be like beating a dead horse. Buffett summarized his strategy well in Berkshire's annual letter for the year 2021:

“Our goal is to have meaningful investments in businesses with both durable economic advantages and a first-class CEO.”

Buffett also outlined the “Four Giants” of Berkshire in this letter which include insurance Apple (AAPL) BNSF and Berkshire Hathaway Energy.

Berkshire's insurance companies include GEICO General Re National Indemnity etc. The firm owns “100% of the float” in these companies. Buffett stated in the 2021 shareholder letter;

“The product will never be obsolete and sales volume will generally increase along with both economic growth and inflation.”

Apple is one of Berkshire's most successful investments and makes up ~42% of the U.S. equity portfolio by market value. Apple paid Berkshire “$785 million” in dividends in 2021. Yet their “share” of Apple’s earnings amounted to an astonishing $5.6 billion!

BNSF (Burlington Northern Santa Fe) operates the largest railroad network in the U.S. with 32500 miles of track. The railroad hit a record $6 billion in earnings in 2021.

Berkshire Hathaway Energy or BHE earned a record $4 billion in 2021 which was a 30-fold increase from the $122 million earned in 2000 when Berkshire first bought shares. Berkshire now owns a 91.1% stake in the company.

Warren Buffett (Trades Portfolio) has also been recently loading up on shares of Occidental Petroleum (OXY Financial) and there is even some speculation that he might be planning to acquire the company outright. You can read more about this subject here.

Final thoughts

Li Lu (Trades Portfolio) is an incredible value investor a genius that stands with the likes of Charlie Munger (Trades Portfolio) and Warren Buffett (Trades Portfolio). Unfortunately we have little insight on his non-U.S. holdings but we can see some of his positions thanks to the 13F reports. Even this limited information can be valuable for investors to analyze.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiY2h0dHBzOi8vZmluYW5jZS55YWhvby5jb20vbmV3cy9yZXRhaWwtc3RvY2tzLWhpc3RvcmljYWxseS1sYXVnaC1pbi1mYWNlLW9mLXJlY2Vzc2lvbi0xODQ3NTM1MDAuaHRtbNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Retail stocks that historically laugh in the face of recession,"Shares of food retailers should do quite well if the U.S. economy slips into a recession in 2023 argues Bank of America.

The investment thesis is rather simple: in a tough time people cut back on pricey nights out and instead stay home and cook.

All of that in-home party food comes from you guessed it grocery retailers such as Walmart (WMT) Kroger (KR) and Costco (COST).

And with all that buying grocers see outsized positive effects on their sales and earnings.

""Food retail stocks (including grocers mass discounters warehouse clubs and dollar stores) have mostly outperformed the S&P 500 during prior recessions (including the 1980s the first Gulf War the Dotcom Bubble and the Global Financial Crisis)"" said Bank of America analyst Robbie Ohmes in a new note to clients.

A worker and a shopper are seen wearing masks at a Walmart store in North Brunswick New Jersey U.S. July 20 2020. REUTERS/Eduardo Munoz (Eduardo Munoz / reuters)

""We believe that this reflects that recessions tend to drive (1) increased food-at-home spending (the post-Dot.com Bubble recession drove a pause in the decades-long shift toward food-away-from-home while the Global Financial crisis resulted in food-at-home regaining share; and (2) greater consumer price sensitivity that favors consumer trade-down into the discount/value retail channels.""

Ohmes' work shows shares of Walmart have out-performed the S&P 500 in each of the past five recessions.

Costco Kroger Target (TGT) Dollar General (DG) and Dollar Tree (DLTR) have also seen relative outperformance to the S&P 500 in prior recessions.

The market has also gravitated to Kroger shares during recessions. (Bank of America)

""All of the food retailers including Walmart are seeing strong grocery business in this environment"" Ohmes added on Yahoo Finance Live after publishing his note.

While food retail stocks may be a decent place for some investors to hide out amid an ongoing slowdown in consumer spending discretionary retailers are on the other side of the coin.

In early June Target kicked off concerns on the retail sector's health with a shocking decision to liquidate massive amounts of slow-moving inventory and take a more cautious view on near-term profits.

Since then discretionary retailers such as RH (RH) Bed Bath & Beyond (BBBY) and Kohl's (KSS) issued financial warnings for the second quarter. Nike (NKE) took a more measured approach to its full-year financial outlook when it reported quarterly earnings.

Gap (GPS) also fired its CEO this week after another lackluster quarter.

This week will determine its future,"A version of this story first appeared in CNN Business’ Before the Bell newsletter. Not a subscriber? You can sign up right here.

New York CNN Business —

Netflix once a darling of Wall Street is suddenly on the ropes.

The streaming giant will report its second-quarter earnings on Tuesday and it’s shaping up to be one of the most consequential moments in the 25-year history of the company.

Netflix is having a terrible year. In April the company reported that it had lost subscribers in the first quarter of 2022 – the first time that had happened in any quarter for more than a decade. Netflix’s stock subsequently burst into flames (it’s currently down about 70% so far this year) wiping out billions of dollars in market value and the company laid off hundreds of employees.

The loss of subscribers wasn’t the only problem that caused Netflix (NFLX)’s world to be turned upside down like the kids on “Stranger Things.” A weak outlook for the second quarter shocked investors: Netflix (NFLX) predicted it would lose another 2 million in the spring.

Whatever happens Tuesday could reshape the future of the company as well as the entire streaming sector. As goes Netflix so goes streaming.

“There will be hell to pay if they report a number that is significantly higher than the 2 million loss being thrown around” Andrew Hare a senior vice president of research at Magid told CNN Business.

The streaming market has matured and saturated Hare noted. So investors will be asking: “What’s next and where is the growth going to come from?”

Netflix is pinning its hopes on potential savior: advertising.

The company announced Wednesday that it will partner with Microsoft on a new cheaper ad-supported subscription plan. Despite Reed Hastings Netflix’s CEO being allergic to the idea for years advertising is now a major part of Netflix’s plans to boost revenue going forward. The new tier will reportedly come before the end of 2022 but Netflix admits its nascent ad business is in its “very early days.”

The company is also focusing on clamping down on password sharing and focusing on creating compelling content to help turn the tide.

But will any of that matter if Tuesday’s numbers are so lackluster that Wall Street fully turns its back on Netflix?

“Once Netflix becomes heavily undervalued by the market all bets are off” Hare said.

The streamer does have some things working in its favor however.

For starters it’s still Netflix — the streaming leader with 221.6 million subscribers worldwide. It’s also reporting numbers in a marketplace that’s presenting factors out of Netflix’s control such as soaring inflation. So it has those excuses it can rely on to possibly soften the blow with investors.

“Investors will give them time to right the ship but they need to hear more solid plans about the path towards immediate growth” Hare said. “It’s all about communicating how they are evolving the business to ensure they continue to win in streaming… No one has the stomach for a business losing millions of subscribers every quarter.”

Wall Street CEOs grapple with the ‘R’ word

Big banks kicked off earnings season last week placing executives in front of investors and members of the media for questioning.

The rapport was fairly predictable: Bank execs want to discuss things like net interest margin and credit reserve builds. Everyone else had one thing on their mind: Recession.

There’s no denying that the economy is the story and investors believe that banking titans are co-authors. They want to know what happens next.

So here’s what we’ve gleamed so far about the state of the economy to come.

JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon:

Geopolitical tension high inflation waning consumer confidence the uncertainty about how high rates have to go and the never-before-seen quantitative tightening and their effects on global liquidity combined with the war in Ukraine and its harmful effect on global energy and food prices are very likely to have negative consequences on the global economy sometime down the road.

Morgan Stanley CEO James Gorman:

We might head into some form of recession – and I like many of others have tried to handicap it but we are frankly guessing at this stage but I think it’s unlikely to be a deep and dramatic recession at least in the U.S. I think Asia is a little behind. It depends how COVID rolls out and it’s sort of reemerging a little bit in some countries. And then Europe is obviously – is fighting the hardest right now because of the war in the Ukraine because of the pressure on gas and gas prices and so on.

First Republic Bank CEO and founder Jim Herbert:

The Fed has to play catch up. They’re behind and they’re doing – they’re likely to do so pretty quickly. So I think you’re likely to see the recession is probably coming of some kind and it will stabilize a lot of the excesses. I don’t think that it’s threatening overly to us… I think we’re in maybe the second or third inning of what’s going to be required to get inflation under control. That would be my personal opinion.

BNY Mellon president and CEO-elect Robin Vince:

You’ve all seen those charts. The S&P 500 had its worst first half performance in over 50 years 10-year Treasury had the worst start to the year since the beginning of the Index in the early 1970s. And with 150 basis points in rate hikes this is the fastest tightening cycle over six months since the Volcker era at the end of the 1970s. Underneath these headlines what we’re seeing across our platforms is that investors are clearly rebalancing and de-risking. We’re seeing asset reallocation from growth to value higher than expected cash balances and relatively shallow market liquidity making it harder for investors to move risk.

Wells Fargo CEO Charles Scharf:

You’re really looking at a number of scenarios that you need to be thoughtful about and include in your modeling. And for a number of quarters in a row we have had a significant weighting on the downside scenario already. And some of those scenarios are pretty severe right? And so you’ve got weightings on what some might term wild recession more severe recessions so you could create a lot of labels for them. But it’s a number of scenarios that have different severities of downside.

Citigroup CEO Jane Fraser:

While sentiment has shifted little of the data I see tells me the U.S. is on the cusp of a recession. Consumer spending remains well above pre-Covid levels with household savings providing a cushion for future stress. And as any employer will tell you the job market remains very tight.

I’m just back from Europe where it’s a different story. We expect a very difficult winter is coming and that’s due to disruptions in the energy supply. There is also increasing concern about second order effects on industrial production and how that will affect economic activity across the continent. And the mood is of course further darkened by the belief that the war in Ukraine will not end anytime soon.

Public Finance Authority during its Friday meeting approved $17 million for the dredging of the West Indian Company (WICO) dock to accommodate larger cruise ships.

""We have met all the local permitting requirements and are awaiting approval from the Army Corp of Engineers to ensure that this harbor will be able to accommodate bigger cruise ships"" PFA Board Chairman Governor Albert Bryan said during the meeting referring to WICO.

According to PFA Director Nathan Simmonds financing for the project is secured through earnings in the territory's Debt Service Reserve Fund for the Gross Receipts Tax Bonds held with The Bank of New York Mellon Trust Company. The earnings resulted in an overfunding of the Debt Service Reserves totaling $17 million. Mr. Simmonds said these funds can be withdrawn and used for specific projects tied to the government of the Virgin Islands.

The Gov't Employees' Retirement System which owns the Havensight Mall that is adjacent to the WICO dock in June expressed support for dredging stating that the accommodation of larger ships would be a boon for its merchants.

""Over the past 10 years GERS as the owner of the Havensight Mall has been on record along with the Havensight Merchants Association in support of the dredging of the harbor to allow Oasis class ships to dock at the WICO dock"" G.E.R.S. said in the statement. ""During the past fiscal year WICO turned away 21 ships because they were too large to enter the constricted harbor. Larger ships will result in an increase of visitors increase revenues to the Havensight Mall tenants and WICO increase revenues to the taxi concession increase gross receipts taxes to the government increase in the bottom line of the GERS and overall an economic boost to the economy of the territory.""

Following the PFA board approval of the funds on Friday the board then moved to forward the appropriation to the V.I. Legislature for further vetting.

The board also approved a $100000 allocation to the Virgin Island Cricket Board to complete the construction and preparation of cricket grounds in Estate Nazareth on St. Thomas among other items.",,,,,,

If you’re Jessica Biel the night before the Met Gala was all about dumping more Epsom salt than anyone has ever needed into a bathtub. How much Epsom salt do you think that would be? A pound maybe? Two? Think bigger.

In a TikTok Biel shared that she would be spending the night before the Met Gala soaking in a bath filled with 20 pounds of Epsom salt. That’s five full bags of magnesium sulfate. Dr. Teal’s the brand used by Biel in the video recommends customers use “at least” two cups per bath to relax muscles and reduce inflammation. So technically she is following the instructions.

For scale the average 1-year-old weighs about 20 pounds. Why would anyone need a baby-size amount of Epsom salts in their bath? Biel did not explain her reasoning but kindly shared her routine. The actress said your bath should have “water as hot as you can take it.” Then she instructed you soak for 30 minutes then “drink tons of water” and “off to bed early.” Anyone who has ever taken an Epsom-salt bath knows that there’s no way you wouldn’t be off to bed early after soaking in that high of a concentration.

If you think that maybe 20 pounds of Epsom salt might fix everything for you think again. First of all that’s like a $25 bath. Second of all medical professionals don’t think it’s a good idea. Dr. T.N. Rekha Singh told Yahoo Life that Biel’s method could have negative side effects. “Overuse or excessively concentrated solutions can lead to dehydration salt imbalance or magnesium overdose” she told the website.

Long story short you don’t need more than two cups of Epsom salt to get the maximum amount of relaxation. Your muscles will still thank you and — I’m just guessing on this one — so will your pipes. (That much salt can’t be good for them right?)

It’ll hang there until the next time you need to towel off—unless it needs to be washed that is. But how often should you really change out your bath towel for a fresh one?

There’s a certain number of days to be mindful of before your towel becomes a breeding ground for bacteria. Plus using a fresh clean bath towel is not only good for your personal hygiene but for your overall health. Ahead find what experts have to say when it comes to how often you should change your bath towel.

This Is How Often You Should Change Out Your Bath Towel

According to Annie Chiu MD a board-certified dermatologist and founder of The Derm Institute there's a clear guidance on when to make the swap.

“Generally you should change your towels every three to four uses” she says. “This helps prevent the buildup of bacteria and odors.”

It’s important to stick to this clean towel schedule for a few reasons Chiu notes. Bacteria dead skin cells and excess oils from your skin can build up on wet towels. So when a dirty towel is used you run the risk of creating skin infections or exacerbating existing skin conditions like acne.

Factors That Affect When You Should Swap Out Your Towel

That said several factors can impact the length of time you keep a towel in your rotation.

How Smelly It Is

If a towel looks unclean or starts to smell before three uses you should change it sooner Chiu says.

How Often You Shower

On the flip side if you shower every day you might be able to use your towel a few more times before changing it.

How Much You Sweat

“However if your workout or job causes you to sweat a lot you should change your towel more frequently” she adds. “The same applies to those who live in humid climates—because towels may take longer to dry increasing the risk of bacterial growth and odor.”

Your Towel's Material

Your towel’s material can also come into play. Waffle weave towels for example tend to dry more quickly than typical terrycloth towels.

“Thanks to the waffle weave construction of our towels we have found that they do generally dry faster than a traditional cotton terry towel” explains Jason Gutierrez cofounder of textile company Geometry. “In our experience a quicker-drying towel lends itself to more uses between washes.”

Gutierrez estimates swapping out a waffle weave towel every seven to 10 days while also considering how often the towel is being used where and how it is stored in between uses and the humidity and temperature of the area where the towel is hung.

Pollutants in the Environment

“Factors such as exposure to pet dander smoke or outdoor pollutants can also affect towel cleanliness and may necessitate more frequent changes” say the product experts at bedding and linens company Cozy Earth.

When Should You Throw Away Towels?

After swapping towels in and out over a few years your bath towel may start to lose its softness fluff and absorbency. “If your towels no longer absorb water effectively and feel less soft and plush than they used to it may be time for replacements” say the experts at Cozy Earth. “Over time towels can lose their absorbency due to wear and tear or the buildup of detergent residue.”

Similarly if your towels are exposed to chlorine and sunlight that makes a difference in their longevity as do washing habits and how often you use them.

When properly cared for a typical towel's lifespan is about two years (less if they're heavily used more if they're mainly for display).

“Personally once my towel starts to show signs of wear such as fraying I know it has lived its life and it's time for a new one” says Gutierrez. “I have several Geometry waffle bath towels that have been in my towel rotation for years and are still going strong. They’re quite durable in terms of construction and functionality but like all textiles they do eventually wear out.”

Don't throw your towels away though! There's plenty you can do with them like donating them to animal shelters or turning them into cleaning rags.

So not unlike the star of a high school musical asking Steven Spielberg for a part she figured she should start at the top.

At 24 fresh out of business school with barely any formal work experience Ms. Britt Cool mailed a letter to Warren E. Buffett asking the Oracle of Omaha if she could work for him. Soon his office address became hers too.

Ms. Britt Cool joined Mr. Buffett’s conglomerate Berkshire Hathaway in the fall of 2009 as financial assistant to the chairman — a title that Mr. Buffett the chief executive and chairman of Berkshire made up. She became one of his top lieutenants along with the Berkshire investment managers Todd Combs and Ted Weschler — Mr. Buffett called them “the three T’s” — and one of the company’s few senior female executives.

In early 2020 not long after people began to include Ms. Britt Cool on a short list of potential successors to Mr. Buffett she left. The move surprised many because Berkshire executives rarely leave.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZvb2wuY29tL2ludmVzdGluZy8yMDIyLzA3LzE2L2lzLXdhbGdyZWVucy1hLXdhcnJlbi1idWZmZXR0LXN0b2NrL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Is Walgreens a Warren Buffett Stock?,"The price is right but Buffett might not bite.

Warren Buffett is a stickler for consistency and it's no surprise why. Businesses that are capable of doing the same thing year after year while still posting decent growth regardless of whatever's happening in the market and in the world tend to be winners in the long run. And for Buffett it's no big problem to wait out decades as his investments compound in value like clockwork.

Companies like Walgreens Boots Alliance (WBA -0.69%) seem like obvious candidates for investors like Buffett. As a pharmacy and retailer there's little it needs to do differently to keep collecting money from the millions of people who rely on its stores. But the picture is a bit more complicated than that upon closer inspection so let's dive in.

It's a mixed bag

One of Buffett's biggest points of emphasis in investing is whether or not a business has an economic moat and if it does how wide. Wide moats tend to lead to robust and sturdy profit margins whether or not there are competitors in play. So they're a crucial aspect of a company's potential to make long-lived returns. In Walgreens' case the moat consists of the locations of its retail stores especially in high-value areas where commercial real estate may be sparse or too expensive for late-coming competitors to justify having a footprint.

But as you may have realized that isn't exactly a wide moat so it isn't particularly a point in the stock's favor as far as Buffett might be concerned. Nor is Walgreens' profitability particularly durable over time; in the last 10 years its gross margin has shrunk and it has had a number of unprofitable periods.

Nonetheless the company's sales grow with a consistency that would probably appeal to Buffett. Since 2002 its trailing 12-month revenue has risen by 369% reaching more than $134.5 billion. At a minimum that points to the enduring demand for its pharmacy goods and services.

Buffett might be pleased with Walgreens' low spending on research and development; it hasn't claimed any such expenses in the past decade. For Buffett spending a lot on making new products or improving old ones is a sign that the company's business model may not be evergreen enough and is at risk of competition that could drive down margins.

That's not to say that Walgreens isn't changing its offerings over time to chase new growth opportunities though. With its new plans to offer health insurance and some basic primary care services out of its branded Health Corners it's conceivable that its growth could accelerate.

Plus services like health insurance tend to be inconvenient to switch away from once customers are signed up which should mean that at least some of the new revenue from selling insurance could be persistent. And health insurance is a line of business that definitely features wide and often unassailable moats thanks to the legal hurdles necessary to participate in the market.

He'd probably like its price

So far Walgreens doesn't have the makings of a traditional Buffett stock like Moody's or Visa even if there are a few indications it's getting into lines of business that he might find more favorable. But there is one thing that Buffett would find very appealing compared to the company's competitors: its valuation. Take a look at this chart:

As you can see Walgreens has a significantly lower price-to-sales (P/S) ratio price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio and price-to-book (P/B) ratio in a head-to-head matchup against its archrival CVS Health. That doesn't mean Buffett would be jumping to buy it but it does mean that he'd interpret its potential for future growth as being at a discount today which could be an important influence.

Given that Buffett prefers to buy high-quality companies at a fair price rather than average companies at a discount it's still hard to say that he'd be very tempted. It's not beyond the realm of possibility for that to change over the next few years especially if the pharmacy can demonstrate that its new services are going to lead to permanent improvements to its margin.

Until then there's no rule that says you shouldn't buy stocks that the Oracle of Omaha wouldn't be interested in even though it's hard to justify a purchase if you use his traditional value investing framework.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTGh0dHBzOi8vZmluYW5jZS55YWhvby5jb20vbmV3cy93YXJyZW4tYnVmZmV0dC1kb2VzbnQtYnV5LXJlYWwtMTQ1MTU3NTczLmh0bWzSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Warren Buffett Doesn't Buy Real Estate - Here's Why Most Investors Shouldn't Either,"Warren Buffett’s long-term outlook on investments has proven successful over the years with Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE: BRK-A) outperforming the S&P 500 in total returns by about 84% over the past 20 years. If there’s one thing that’s made Buffett one of the most successful investors in history it’s his commitment to his strategy.

While several new investment techniques and algorithms have come and gone over the years Buffett has maintained his fairly simple strategy of picking solid companies and focusing on long-term growth while somehow ignoring the noise that has most investors constantly second-guessing themselves.

It may seem odd that somebody with such a disciplined long-term approach to investing has no interest in purchasing real estate especially since it's what vice chairman of Berkshire Hathaway Charles Munger used to build his fortune.

Buying Real Estate vs Investing in Real Estate

Buffett isn’t against investing in real estate. In fact he has invested in several real estate investment trusts (REITs) over the years and currently owns a large stake in Store Capital Corp (NYSE: STOR). However he knows it makes little sense for him to get into the business of being a landlord.

Buying and managing real estate is more of a business than it is an investment and Buffett knows that his time is better spent choosing companies to invest in than it is running a real estate business.

Real estate is a tough business. For most people it requires scaling the business to comprise several properties in order to build massive wealth. Many individual investors get into real estate with the idea that it’s going to be a passive investment and most of these individuals eventually exit the properties once realizing what they’ve actually gotten into.

Investing in real estate is a different story. Passive real estate investments allow investors to reap the rewards of this profitable asset class without taking on the management responsibilities.

The FTSE Nareit All Equity REITs index has outperformed the S&P 500 in total returns during 13 out of the last 20 years producing an average total annual return of 13.1% versus 11.1% for the S&P 500.

Many investors that have turned to the private markets for passive real estate investments have averaged even greater returns. For instance the real estate crowdfunding platform RealtyMogul has produced an average internal rate of return (IRR) of 17.2% for investors on its fully realized deals since inception.

Passive investors have options to buy shares of short-term real estate loans make equity investments in cash-flowing multifamily properties help fund large-scale developments or simply invest in a managed fund. While the potential profit may not be as high as buying or developing real estate the likelihood of long-term success is much higher for most investors.

The returns realized through owning real estate are a direct result of the time energy and money that goes into it. While that business has been the source of many great fortunes over the years it’s just simply not a business that makes sense for most people.

The more than 46-acre property called “Casa Del Paradiso” in the real estate listing by Berkshire Hathaway Adirondack Premier Properties is located off of Bear Cub Road near the John Brown Farm Historic Site.

Berkshire Hathaway Adirondack Premier Properties Broker-Owner Margie Philo who is a co-listing agent for the property along with Realtor Justin McGiver said she believes the $31150000 asking price is the highest Lake Placid has ever seen. The only property in the area to list or sell for that much was the Last Chance Ranch — on Adirondack Loj Road — which she said sold for $13 million in 2005.

The Berkshire Hathaway listing touts the Casa Del Paradiso property as “a private majestic estate rarely offered anywhere in the world.” There are five “primary buildings” on the property with a total of nine bedrooms eight bathrooms and two half-bathrooms according to the listing. There’s a main house with an underground tunnel to one of the property’s two guest homes a “tree house residence” and an Airstream “she-shed.” Philo said the interior walls of the she-shed are covered with animal pelts.

The property has a tennis/basketball court an indoor shooting range a lean-to and a toboggan hill and the nearby Olympic Ski Jumping Complex is visible from the property. Casa Del Paradiso is listed online at https://tinyurl.com/5dupjsxh.

Philo said the property will be a “turnkey” sale meaning all of the “expensive artisan” Adirondack-style furnishings will remain. Philo said many of these pieces of furniture are “unique” adding that one of the dining room tables in the house is one of two in the world — the other table is owned by Oprah according to Philo.

Philo said the Riggis have four children and they brought their children up to the home from Saratoga Springs for vacations and weekend trips. Philo said the Riggis built the toboggan hill for their children. The Riggis first bought the home in 1980 for around $1 million and the property only had one structure at the time.

Philo is hopeful the home will sell for its asking price.

“I think it’s very possible and we’re hopeful” she said “and we’re certainly attracting the upper echelon of the world to look at it.”

Philo said she already had a couple of inquiries about the property on Friday — one from someone living in the U.S. and one from someone in Dubai. She said Berkshire Hathaway has offices all over the world and every BH agency has received the listing information. She said she won’t be giving tours of the home noting that anyone who looks at the home would need to be financially qualified with proof of funds. She said the property will sell for cash.

“Most people who buy a home like this have multiple homes and this is part of their portfolio” she said.

North Elba Town Assessor Todd Anthony said Friday that the sale of this property should it sell for the asking price likely wouldn’t impact everyday homeowners’ property assessment values in Lake Placid since the property isn’t really comparable to most properties in the town or village. He said this would be a kind of “outlier” sale and he said those types of sales don’t affect property assessments unless a “critical mass” of them start to come in.

“I don’t think most mere mortals have to worry about the sale price” he said.

Philo believes the Casa Del Paradiso listing is putting Lake Placid “in front of the world.” Media outlets including the Albany Times Union and the Wall Street Journal have featured the listing in their publications.

Philo added that she’s selling more than the property — she’s selling a lifestyle. She said that there’s something for everyone in Lake Placid from winter sports to summer hiking to leaf-peeping in the fall.

“I think it will appeal to someone looking for a lifestyle not just a home” she said.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5ld3RyYWRlcnUuY29tLzIwMjIvMDcvMTYvaG93LXdhcnJlbi1idWZmZXR0LW1hZGUtaGlzLWZpcnN0LTEwMDAwMDAv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,How Warren Buffett Made His First $1000000,"Warren was very interested in creating his own businesses and investments from an early age. At seven years old he was motivated by a book he found in his local public library called One Thousand Ways to Make $1000. This book got him started thinking about different ways to make money as a kid it was like a game and he loved it.

His childhood businesses included selling chewing gum collecting glass Coca-Cola bottles to return for money along with selling weekly magazines door to door. He also worked part-time in his grandfather’s grocery store.

During high school he delivered newspapers sold golf balls he recovered from a local golf course sold stamps and washed and detailed cars. He and a friend formed one of his first business partnerships and spent $25 to buy a used pinball machine that they placed in a local barber shop. They liked the cash flow from the pinball business so much that he bought a few more of them to put in three more barber shops. His pinball machine business was later sold in less than a year for $1200.

After being mentored by Benjamin Graham his first investment firm as a professional was Buffett Partnership Ltd that he created in 1956 at 26 years old.

In 1961 after his partnership was worth millions Buffett made his first $1 million investment in a windmill manufacturing company.

At what age did Warren Buffett made his first million?

By January of 1962 the Buffett Partnership had a value of over $7 million with Buffett’s personal share being worth over $1 million. Mr. Buffett closed his Partnership in 1969 after great returns citing that he was out of good investment ideas. He became a millionaire in his late twenties and “retired” in his early thirties.

In 1962 when Warren Buffett was just 30 years old he was already a millionaire before he teamed up with Charlie Munger as his partner.

When did Warren Buffett make his first billion?

Warren Buffett’s biggest investment started when he began purchasing Berkshire Hathaway stock in 1962 after noticing a price action pattern of the stock to go up after the company closed a mill. Buffett knew that the textile business was dying in the U.S. and Berkshire’s fundamentals were never going to improve as it slowly went out of business. He was just looking for a quick investment gain as its price was so low in comparison to its liquidation value based on assets it owned.

After he was offended by a tender offer to buy his shares that was lower than a verbal agreement that was made Buffett bought more Berkshire stock in 1964. He took control of the company through a majority of stock ownership and fired the guy that went back on the oral agreement to buy his shares at a higher agreed upon price. Buffett became the majority shareholder of a failing textile business through this incident.

He quickly pivoted the company from its traditional textile manufacturing to insurance and kept it under the same name. He would evolve Berkshire-Hathaway into a diversified holding company over time. He used the cash flow from the insurance premiums part of the business to acquire the best cash flowing businesses. He also started to build an investment portfolio for Berkshire of stocks in great publicly traded businesses that he would buy when a stock was at a good price. Berkshire Hathaway grew into a corporate conglomerate that is now the seventh biggest company in the United States by market cap.

In 1986 when Warren Buffett was 56 years old he first became a billionaire his wealth came from his ownership in Berkshire-Hathaway shares as his salary with the company for being president was only $50000 at the time.

Warren Buffett allowed Berkshire-Hathaway stock to grow in price to multiple six figures as he did not want a stock split of its Class A shares because he wanted long-term investors in his company’s stock not short-term traders and speculators. In 1996 Berkshire-Hathaway did finally do a partial stock split to create Class B shares through a Unit Investment Trust and kept the per-share value of the smaller shares close to ​1⁄ 30 of the original Class A share price.

How did Warren Buffet make his money?

Warren Buffett’s current net worth in 2022 is $95.5 billion in U.S. dollars making him currently the fifth richest person in the world at 91 years old.[1]

His wealth was created from investments he started as a teenager his early investment partnership and finally his ownership in shares of Berkshire-Hathaway that created over 99% of his total net worth over his lifetime. 99% of Warren Buffett’s net worth was created after his 50th birthday.

Warren Buffett first bought Berkshire Hathaway shares in 1962 for $7.50 a share. In 2022 Berkshire Hathaway Class A shares are trading at approximately $415000. The Berkshire Hathaway stock annual return (CAGR) is approximately +20.26% for the past 57 years.

Warren Buffett’s wealth was built through his personal ownership of just one stock: Berkshire-Hathaway. It was his management as CEO and Chairman of his company’s cash flow into building a portfolio of companies and stocks that created one of the greatest companies of all time through acquisitions and portfolio management. Warren Buffett used Berkshire-Hathaway as an indirect wealth building machine making himself and his investors wealthy.

This shows the power of compounding growth. Berkshire-Hathaway is the only stock he owns personally. When you hear about the Warren Buffett portfolio or Buffett stocks this refers to the Berkshire-Hathaway holdings in the company’s stock portfolio.

The social distancing strictures put in place to slow the spread of coronavirus meant that more people were cooking at home than usual and baking their own bread too. In May of 2020 King Arthur Flour sent out almost 6.6 million bags double what they typically sell in their usual high season in the fall. At my own local grocery store the baking aisle had been picked clean save for a few sad-looking bags of white chocolate chips. But that didn't mean there wasn't any flour in the country — there was plenty! You just had to know where to look.

I took this mess as an opportunity to do something I'd been meaning to do for a while which was to put in a big order at some of the small-scale mills making delicious and interesting flours from fresh grains. As our resident baking guru Paige Grandjean has written before baking with freshly milled flours requires some subtle adjustments particularly if you're making bread but the flavor payoff is well worth it. Like wine single-origin flour has a terroir and no two batches are exactly the same.

Here are some excellent small mills where you can nab great flour and other materials for all your baking projects.

When you walk into a supermarket and pick up an item — anything from milk to cereal to a can of beans — you’ll likely see a little date on the package preceded by “enjoy by” “sell by” or a similar phrase.

You might think that date is the absolute last day that food is safe to eat. You’d be wrong. But you wouldn’t be alone in coming to that mistaken conclusion because the system behind food label dates is an absolute mess.

There’s no national standard for how those dates should be determined or how they must be described. Instead there’s a patchwork system — a hodgepodge of state laws best practices and general guidelines.

“It is a complete Wild West” said Dana Gunders executive director of ReFed a nonprofit trying to end food waste. And yet “many consumers really believe that they are being told to throw the food out or that even when they don’t make that choice that they’re sort of breaking some rule” she said.

For food makers sell-by dates actually are more about protecting the brand than safety concerns explained Andy Harig vice president of sustainability tax and trade at FMI a food industry association.

The sell-by date often referred to as the expiration date is the company’s estimate of when a food item will taste best its optimal date. “You want people to eat and enjoy the product when it’s at its peak because that’s going to increase their enjoyment [and] encourage them to buy it again” he said.

The main consequence of this unclear labeling? Food waste. Lots of it.

“Consumer uncertainty about the meaning of the dates … is believed to contribute to about 20 percent of food waste in the home” the Food and Drug Administration wrote in a 2019 post.

Wasted food often ends up in landfills making it a major contributor to climate change. By some estimates food loss and waste makes up 8% of global greenhouse-gas emissions.

Wasting food also means wasting money which many consumers can’t afford especially now as grocery prices soar. And food that is thrown out is diverted from food banks where it is desperately needed.

Though many companies put dates on their products baby formula is the only food that is required to have use-by dates in the United States said Meredith Carothers a food safety expert with the USDA’s Food Safety and Inspection Service.

Companies choose dates based on when they think an item tastes best. But FSIS has its own safety recommendations. Many canned goods can last on shelves for anywhere between one and five years according to the agency if properly stored. Under the right conditions packages of rice and dried pasta can last about two years. The FDA offers food storage tips and guidelines on its website.

But the rules are wildly different for many perishables.

While consuming shelf-stable items after a “best if used by date” is likely fine fresh meat and poultry could go bad even before the date on the label. That’s because store refrigerators tend to be colder than our home fridges explained Carothers.

Once consumers take meat and poultry home they should follow home-storage rules she said. The FSIS instructs people to cook or freeze some meats within two days of bringing them home from the store.

How we got here

Manufacturers began printing sell-by information on products in the early 20th century. At first the date was written in code: Retail employees had to match each code to a date using a key but to customers the codes were incomprehensible.

In the 1970s grocery shoppers clamored for more information about the quality of food on supermarket shelves. Under pressure from activists including the distribution of pamphlets deciphering sell-by codes food makers began to put dates on their labels.

At first this “open dating” tactic appeared to be working.

In February 1973 The New York Times ran an article headlined “Food Dating is Found to Please Customers and Reduce Losses.” The piece pointed to a study conducted by the USDA and the Consumer Research Institute a group backed by food manufacturers which concluded that open dating had slashed by half the number of consumer complaints of purchasing stale or spoiled food.

Food manufactures started sharing sell-by dates with consumers about 50 years ago. Bebeto Matthews/AP

But by the end of the decade those examining the system were less convinced of its merits.

A 1979 study by the now-defunct Office of Technology Assessment noted that open dating may not have been the right way to quell consumer fears.

“There is little evidence to support or to negate the contention that there is a direct relationship between open shelf-life dating and the actual freshness of food” the study found.

There’s no way to “accurately determine dates for various products no consensus on which type of date or dates … to use for which product or even which products to date at all and no real guidelines as to how to display the date” the report’s authors wrote.

Decades later we’re still in the same boat. “​​There are no uniform or universally accepted descriptions used on food labels for open dating in the United States” according to the USDA’s current guidance.

The FDA said that manufacturers can’t place false or misleading information on labels but that “they are not required to obtain agency approval of the voluntary quality-based date labels they use or specify how they arrived at the date they’ve applied.” Carothers from the FSIS reiterated that dates can be applied as long as they don’t mislead customers and comply with the service’s labeling regulations.

Where we go next: The sniff test

To avoid food waste some advocates encourage people to rely on their senses when determining whether certain foods are safe to eat.

The British retailer Morrisons said early this year that it is removing “sell by” dates from some of its branded milk switching instead to “best before” dates and encouraging customers to decide whether to discard the product based on how it looks and smells.

Morrisons offered these guidelines to consumers: if it looks curdled or smells sour ditch it. If it looks and smells okay you can consume it even after the date.

Morrisons said this year that it is eliminating dates from its branded milks in some markets. Chris Ratcliffe/Bloomberg/Getty Images

“When food is decayed past the point where we’d want to eat it our defenses work very well” said ReFed’s Gunders. “If food doesn’t look good if it doesn’t smell good if it doesn’t taste good if it’s slimy … then absolutely we should not eat that food.”

In general Gunders recommended that those who are concerned about food safety remain strict about consuming food before the sell-by date if it has a “higher potential to carry listeria.” One way to identify those items? They’re the foods that pregnant women are told to stay away from she said.

Another way to prevent confusion experts say is to regulate the language used to describe these dates.

“Best by” versus “Use by”

The Food Date Labeling Act of 2021 introduced in December of last year wants manufacturers to use “use by” or “best if used by” only before dates on labels. The bill is the latest in a series of legislative efforts to make a national labeling standard.

Here’s the logic: Companies that decide to put a date on labels have to make clear to consumers whether the item is potentially unsafe after that date or if it just tastes a little off. If it’s a safety issue they have to use “use by.” If it’s about food quality “best if used by” is the way to go.

Gunders and agencies like the FDA and USDA point to this label harmonization as a good solution. Many companies have already made the transition.

Del Monte which sells canned fruits and vegetables among other products uses “best if used by.” In an email the company explained that the dates “are a guideline.” Dole which has dates on its packaged salads also uses the “best if used by” label.

Even if the bill becomes law and all companies make the same changes there will still be a missing piece of the puzzle: Alerting consumers to the shift and what it means.

After all consumers who pick up an item today won’t necessarily know that “use by” is distinct from “best if used by” or if either of those are different from something like “enjoy by” or “sell by.”

To make the dates clearer to the public there needs to be a “consistent and engaged effort to help consumers think through this” said FMI’s Harig. “I think it’s going to take some work to figure it out.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1vdG9ydHJlbmQuY29tL2ZlYXR1cmVzL21vc3QtcmVsaWFibGUtZGllc2VsLXRydWNrcy1vZi1hbGwtdGltZS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,The Most Reliable Diesel Trucks of All Time,"Daily use decent fuel economy and the ability to carry big payloads and tow hefty trailers are the primary considerations that prompt most truck buyers to choose diesel pickups over their gas-powered counterparts. And when they're cared for properly diesel trucks can last for hundreds of thousands of miles.

Given the current state of the U.S. economy with fuel prices continually rising and new-vehicle availability limited by supply chain issues and higher production costs (which typically are passed on to the buyer) many of the brand-new and expensive diesel trucks we drool over may not be as great a bargain as some of the older rigs that are available in the used-truck market.

The question ""What is the most reliable diesel truck?"" opens a war-zone of debate where differing opinions and fierce brand loyalty make coming up with a universally accepted answer extremely difficult. Actually the fact of the matter is it really can't be done; there are many different years makes and models of diesel rigs that can be trusted.

Generation of a CIP2A knock-out RPE-1 cell line by CRISPR/Cas9

RPE-1 cells were cultured overnight at a density of 0.1 × 106. For transfection 375 ng of synthetic sgRNA (TrueGuide™ CRISPR932782_SGM; sgRNA sequence: GGTCTTCAAGTAGCTCTACA) along with 6 µL Cas9 mRNA (Invitrogen) and 18 µL of the MessengerMAX™ reagent (Invitrogen) were separately diluted in 300 µL Opti-MEM™ I (Gibco) each. After 10 min of incubation at room temperature both mixtures were combined and added to the plate at 100 µL per well. The cells were kept in culture for another 48 h trypsinized and transferred to a 96-well plate in serial two-fold dilution starting with 4000 cells. Wells containing single colonies were identified under a transluminescence microscope and progressively expanded to larger culture volumes. One successful knock-out clone could be identified by means of immunofluorescence as well as western blotting of total cell extracts. A bi-allelic single dA insertion at position 5110 of the gene was confirmed by subcloning the targeted area into a pCR™4Blunt-TOPO® vector (Invitrogen) and subsequent colony sequencing of transformed Stellar™ Competent E. coli cells (Takara).

Complementation of RPE-1 ΔCIP2A cells by lentiviral transduction

For lentivirus production 293FT cells were plated at 80% confluence in a 10 cm dish with 8 mL of culture medium one day prior to transfection. Transfection was carried out using Lenti-X Packaging Single Shot (VSV-G) system (Takara Bio 631275) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. 7 μg of pHIV-NAT-T2A empty plasmid or plasmid containing Flag-tagged CIP2A cDNA (WT and ΔNES) were used. Lentivirus-containing supernatants were centrifuged at 4 °C for 10 min at 500 g and passed through a 0.45 μm filter. Virus titer was measured using the QuickTiter™ Lentivirus Titer Kit (Cell Biolabs VPK-107-T) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. For lentiviral transduction RPE-1 ΔCIP2A cells were plated in 6 cm dishes at 80% confluence in culture medium one day prior to infection. Cells were incubated with virus-containing supernatants in the presence of 8 μg/mL Polybrene (Santa Cruz Biotech) for 24 h. The virus volume needed for infection was calculated using the following formula: Total Transduction Units (TU) needed = cells seeded*MOI (MOI = 5 was used). After incubation virus-containing medium was discarded and replaced with fresh culture medium. Cells were incubated for an additional 48 h before proceeding with protein analysis to evaluate expression of the gene of interest. Transduced cells were selected in the presence of 100 µg/mL Nourseothricin dihydrogen sulfate (Roth 3011). Stably transduced cell lines were cultured in the presence of 50 μg/mL Nourseothricin dihydrogen sulfate.

Cell transfection with RNA and DNA

The control siRNA (siCtrl) siRNA targeting TOPBP1 (siTOPBP1 #1) and the 3′ UTR sequence of TOPBP1 gene (siTOPBP1 #2) were obtained from Microsynth AG. The sequences of the siRNAs are the following:

siCtrl: UGGUUUACAUGUCGACUAA-dTdT

siTOPBP1 #1: ACAAAUACAUGGCUGGUUA-dTdT

siTOPBP1 #2: GUAAAUAUCUGAAGCUGUATT-dTdT

ON-Target plus SMART pool siRNA targeting CIP2A was purchased from Dharmacon (L-014135-01-0005) and contained a mix of four different siRNAs:

Sequence 1: ACAGAACUCACACGACUA

Sequence 2: GUCUAGGAUUAUUGGCAAA

Sequence 3: GAACAAAGGUUGCAGAUUC

Sequence 4: GCAGAGUGAUAUUGAGCAU

For siRNA transfection cells were grown in a six-well plate 24 h prior to transfection. A total of 60% confluent cells were transfected using 20 nM siRNA and Lipofectamine RNAiMAX™ (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Cells were incubated with siRNA-lipid complexes for 48 h before being seeded on coverslips and harvested 72 h after transfection. I-Ppo1 mRNA transfection was done using the Lipofectamine MessengerMax™ Reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer’s protocol.

Plasmid DNA was transfected using jetOPTIMUS® DNA Transfection Regent in 6-well plates following the standard protocol provided by the manufacturer. Cells were then incubated for 24 h before proceeding with further analysis.

SDS-PAGE and Western blotting

To prepare cell extracts for SDS-PAGE cells were washed in PBS scraped off the plate and pelleted before resuspension in RIPA lysis buffer (150 mM NaCl 50 mM Tris-HCl pH 8 1% Igepal CA-630 0.5% sodium deoxycholate 0.1% SDS). Lysis buffer was supplemented with cOmplete EDTA-free protease Inhibitor cocktail (Roche) before use. Next cells were incubated on ice for 30 min and vortexed every 10 min to dissolve the cell clumps. After incubation lysates were centrifuged at 16000 g for 15 min in a refrigerated centrifuge and clear lysates was transferred into a fresh tube for protein quantification. To detect phosphorylated proteins SDS-lysis buffer (120 mM Tris pH 6.8 20% glycerol 4% SDS) was used to lyse cells directly on the plate. Protein aliquots were mixed with 2x SDS sample buffer (Geneaid PLD001 100 mM DTT) and heated for 5′ at 95 °C before loading on the gel.

SDS-PAGE was performed using 4–20% Mini-PROTEAN TGX Stain-free Precast Gels (Bio-Rad 4568094) except for the experiments in Fig. 4a and Supplementary Fig. 4b where mPAGE™ 4–20% Bis-Tris Precast Gels (Millipore MP42G10) were used. As a reference for molecular weights Prestained Protein Ladder 245 kDa (Geneaid) was loaded on the gel. Western blotting was performed using the Trans-Blot® Turbo™ Transfer system (Bio-Rad) on 0.2 μm nitrocellulose membranes. Membranes were blocked for at least 2 h with 5% milk in TBS-Tween. To detect phosphorylated proteins membranes were blocked for 1 h with EveryBlot Blocking Buffer (Bio-Rad). Antibodies against the following proteins were used at the indicated dilutions: GFP (Mouse Roche 11814460001 1:5000) GFP (Rabbit Abcam ab290 1:1000) HA (Rabbit Abcam ab9110 1:4000) MDC1 (Rabbit Abcam ab11171 1:5000) MDC1 pSer168 (Rabbit AMS Biotechnology custom-made 1:500)11 MDC1 pSer196 (Rabbit 21st Century custom-made 1:200)11 TOPBP1 (Rabbit Abcam ab2402 1:1500) CIP2A (Rabbit Cell Signaling 14805 1:1000) CIP2A (Mouse Santa Cruz sc-80659 1:1000) CRM1 (Rabbit Atlas Antibodies HPA042933 1:1500) Tubulin (Mouse Sigma T6199 1:5000) Tubulin hFAB™ rhodamine (Bio-Rad 12004166 1:5000) FLAG M2 (Mouse Sigma F1804 1:1000) pSer10 Histone H3 (Rabbit Millipore 06-570 1:1000) Histone H3 (Rabbit Abcam ab1791 1:10000). Blots were incubated with primary antibodies overnight at 4 °C and washed 3 × 10 min with TBS-Tween before incubation for 1 h at with secondary antibodies at room temperature: HRP-conjugated anti-mouse (GE Healthcare NA934 1:10000) or HRP-confugated anti-rabbit (GE Healthcare NA934 1:10000). Blots were developed with ECLTM Prime Western Blotting Detection Reagent (Cytiva) and image acquisition was done on a ChemiDoc MP Imaging System (Bio-Rad).

Expression and purification recombinant proteins

For purification of the CIP2A ArmRD pGEX-4T3 containing the coding sequence of aa 1–559 of CIP2A was transformed into BL21(DE3)pLysS competent cells for high-efficiency expression of the recombinant protein under the IPTG inducible control of a T7 promoter. The harvested bacteria were lysed through repeated freezing (down to −80 °C) and thawing followed by vigorous sonication in an ice-cooled buffer with 1% Triton X-100. Finally the extract was cleared from insoluble debris centrifuged for 30 min at 15000 rcf and 4 °C and then loaded onto a high performance 1 mL GSTrap™ affinity column (Cytiva 17-5281-01) for purification on an NGC Quest 10 chromatography system (Bio-Rad). For expression and purification of the HA-tagged TOPBP1 aa740–899 fragment ExpiCHO-S cells (Life Technologies) were cultured in suspension at 36 °C and 8% CO 2 using the CHOgro® Expression System (Mirus MIR 6270) inside of 50 mL TubeSpin® bioreactors (TPP 87050) while shaking at 225 rpm on a Rotamax 120 orbital shaker. The cells were adjusted to a density of 4 × 106/mL before transfection with a mix of the TransIT-PRO® reagent and pcDNA3.1(+)-N-HA-TOPBP1(740–899) plasmid DNA. After adding the complex the cell suspension was further supplemented with CHOgro® titer enhancer and its temperature was lowered to 32 °C. A sample was collected for co-immunoprecipitation after seven days.

Immunoprecipitations

To prepare cell extracts for immunoprecipitation cells were washed in cold PBS buffer pH 7.45 harvested with a cell scraper and centrifuged at 500 g for 3 min. PBS was then discarded and cells were resuspended in an appropriate volume of IP lysis buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.6 150 mM NaCl 5 mM MgCl 2  0.5% Triton X-100) supplemented with cOmplete EDTA-free protease inhibitor cocktail and 25 U/ml Benzonase nuclease (Sigma E1014). Cells were incubated on ice for 30 min and lysates were cleared by centrifugation at 16000 g (4 °C) for 15 min. For HA-immunoprecipitations 30 µL of monoclonal anti-HA agarose beads (Sigma A2095) were added to 2 mg of the soluble cell extract and samples were incubated for 2 h with end-over-end rotation at 4 °C. For GFP Immunoprecipitation 1 mg of cell extract was incubated with 25 μL/sample of binding control magnetic agarose beads (Chromotek bmab-20) for 40 min as a control of unspecific binding of proteins to the beads. Using a magnet beads were precipitated and the supernatant was transferred into a fresh tube containing 25 μL/sample of equilibrated GFP-trap magnetic agarose beads (Chromotek gtma-20) and incubated for 1 h with end-over-end rotation at 4 °C. For Flag immunoprecipitation between 100 and 800 μg of cell extract was incubated with 40 μL/sample of Anti-FLAG® M2 affinity gel (Sigma A2220) for 2 h with end-over-end rotation at 4 °C. Immunoglobulin-antigen complexes were washed 3 × 15 min in cold PBS with end-over-end rotation before elution in 2× SDS sample buffer except for Flag immunoprecipitation where immunoglobulin antigen complexes were washed 3 × 15 min in cold TBS (50 mM Tris-HCl pH7.4 150 mM NaCl) with end-over-end rotation before elution in 2x SDS sample buffer. For HA-immunoprecipitation to detect interaction between purified recombinant proteins 800 µg of CHO protein extracts containing the bait protein (HA-tagged TOPBP1 aa740-899) were incubated with 30 µL of monoclonal anti-HA agarose beads for 1 h at 4 °C end-over-end rotation. After incubation the unbound fraction was washed away and 5 µg of purified GST-tagged ArmRD was added followed by incubation for 90 min at 4 °C end-over-end rotation. Washing steps were performed (3 × 15′ with cold PBS) to remove the excess of unbound GST-tagged ArmRD. After the last wash protein complexes were eluted using 50 µL of 2x SDS sample buffer.

Mass spectrometry

The Functional Genomics Center of the University of Zurich (FGCZ) was commissioned to perform the mass spectrometry analysis. HA immunoprecipitation was performed as described above. After the last wash precipitated material was resuspended in PBS buffer pH 7.45 and subjected to on-beads trypsin digestion according to the following protocol. Beads were washed twice with digestion buffer (10 mM Tris 2 mM CaCl 2  pH 8.2). After the last wash the buffer was discarded and monoclonal anti-HA agarose beads were resuspended in 10 mM Tris 2 mM CaCl 2  pH 8.2 buffer supplemented with trypsin (100 ng/μL in 10 mM HCl). The pH was adjusted to 8.2 by the addition of 1 M Tris pH 8.2. Digestion was performed at 60 °C for 30 min. Supernatants were collected and peptides were extracted from beads using 150 μL of 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid (TFA). Digested samples were dried and reconstituted in 20 μL ddH2O + 0.1% formic acid before performing liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry analysis (LC MS/MS). For the analysis 1 μL were injected on a nanoACQUITY UPLC system coupled to a Q-Exactive mass spectrometer (Thermo Scientific). MS data were processed for identification using the Mascot search engine (Matrixscience) and the spectra was searched against the Swissprot protein database.

Immunofluorescence

Cells were grown on glass coverslips (Thermo Scientific Menzel) and washed two times with cold PBS before fixation with cold methanol for 10 min on ice. Methanol was discarded and cells were washed 2 × 5 min with PBS at room temperature and incubated with blocking buffer (10% FCS in PBS) for at least 1 hour. Primary antibody incubations were performed at 4 °C overnight. Coverslips were then washed 3 × 10 min with 10% FCS in PBS and secondary antibody incubation was performed for 1 h at room temperature in the dark. After washing 3 × 10 min with PBS coverslips were mounted on glass microscopy slides (Thermo Scientific) with VECTASHIELD® PLUS Antifade Mounting Medium containing 0.5 μg/mL 4’6-diamidino-2-phenylindole dihydrochloride (DAPI; Vector Laboratories). The following antibodies were used at the indicated dilutions: CIP2A (Mouse Santa Cruz sc-80659 1:800) γH2AX (Mouse Merck 05-636-I 1:500) MDC1 (Rabbit Abcam ab11171 1:300) TOPBP1 (Rabbit Millipore ABE1463 1:300) CENPA (Mouse Abcam ab13939 1:500) pSer10 Histone H3 (Rabbit Millipore 06-570 1:500) ACA (Human Antibodies Incorporated 15–235 1:2000) Cep135 (rabbit home-made 1:1000)36. The following secondary antibodies were used: Alexa Fluor 488 Goat Anti-Mouse (Life Technologies A11029 1:500) Alexa Fluor 568 Goat Anti-Mouse (Life Technologies A11031 1:500) Alexa Fluor 647 Goat Anti-Mouse (Life Technologies A21235 1:500) Alexa Fluor 488 Goat Anti-Rabbit (Life Technologies A11034 1:500) and Alexa Fluor 568 Goat Anti-Rabbit (Life Technologies A11036 1:500).

In-situ proximiy-ligation assay (PLA)

U2OS cells were seeded on round glass coverslips in 24-well plates at a density of 0.8 × 105 cells per well. The growth medium was removed and all coverslips were washed with PBS fixed with ice-cold methanol on ice for 12 min and washed again 3x in PBS. All subsequent steps were performed using Duolink® PLA Reagents (Sigma-Aldrich DUO92001 DUO92005 DUO92008 DUO82049). The blocking solution was applied for 1 h in the humidified incubator at 37 °C. The following antibody combinations were used: mouse-anti- CIP2A (Mouse Santa Cruz sc-80659 1:800) and anti-TOPBP1 (Rabbit Millipore ABE1463 1:300) or anti-MDC1 (Rabbit Abcam ab11171 1:300). Antibody incubation was done overnight at 4 °C under humid conditions. PLUS and MINUS PLA probes were prepared according to the manufacturer’s protocol and applied analogous to the previous step but for 1 h at 37 °C in the humidified incubator. Cells were washed for 15 min then 10 min with wash buffer B followed by 5 min with 0.01X wash buffer B and mounted on glass slides using VECTASHIELD® PLUS antifade mounting medium with DAPI.

Widefield and confocal microscopy

Widefield image acquisition was done on a Leica DMI6000B inverted fluorescence microscope equipped with Leica K5 sCMOS fluorescence camera (16-bit 2048 × 2048 pixel 4.2 MP) and Las X software version 3.7.2.22383. An HC Plan Apochromat 40×/0.95 phase contrast air objective and HCX Plan Apochromat 63X/1.40 and Plan Apochromat 100X/1.40 phase contrast oil immersion objectives were used for image acquisition. For triple-wavelength emission detection we combined DAPI with EGFP or Alexa Fluor 488 and Alexa Fluor 568.

Confocal images were acquired with a Leica SP8 confocal laser scanning microscope coupled to a Leica DMI6000B inverted stand with a 63x 1.4-NA Plan-Apochromat oil-immersion objective. For quadruple-wavelength emission detection we combined DAPI with EGFP Alexa Fluor 568 and Alexa Fluor 647. For triple-wavelength emission detection we combined DAPI with EGFP or Alexa Fluor 488 and Alexa Fluor 568. The sequential scanning mode was applied and the number of overexposed pixels was kept at a minimum. 7 to 10 z-sections were recorded with optimal distances based on Nyquist criterion.

For airyscan high-resolution confocal microscopy cells were grown on high precision glass coverslips #1.5H 0.17 mm thick (Assistent) and processed for immunofluorescence as described above. Cells were then stained with 1 μg/mL DAPI (AppliChem A1001) diluted in PBS for 15 min at room temperature in the dark. DAPI was discarded and cells were further washed 2 × 5 min with deionized water to completely remove the PBS. Coverslips were mounted on microscopy glass slides without frosted edges (R. Langenbrick GmbH Dimensions L 76 × W 26 mm) using VECTASHIELD® HardSet™ Antifade Mounting Medium (Vector Laboratories). Airyscan confocal imaging was carried out at the ScopeM imaging facility of ETH Zurich using an LSM 880 Airyscan inverted microscope (ZEISS) equipped with a DIC Plan Apochromat 63×/1.4 oil immersion objective and an Airyscan 32-pinhole detector unit. DAPI was detected using a 405-nm diode laser and 420–480 nm plus 495–550 nm band pass emission filters Alexa 488 and GFP were detected with the 488-nm line of an argon laser and 420–480 nm plus 495–550 nm band pass emission filters and Alexa 568 was detected using a 561-nm diode-pumped solid-state laser and 495-550 nm band pass plus 570 nm long pass emission filters. Z-stacks of entire cells were acquired using optimal step size. Raw data were processed using Airyscan processing with Wiener Filter (auto setting) available in ZEN Black software version 2.1 yielding 8-bit images with approximately 180 nm lateral resolution. Display of images was adjusted for intensity for optimal display of structures of interest.

For optimal representation in figures maximum intensity projections were calculated using Fiji37. Unprocessed grayscale tagged image files (TIFs) and maximum intensity projections of confocal z-stacks were exported from Fiji followed by pseudo-coloring and adjustment of exposure or brightness/contrast in Adobe Photoshop CC2021. For maximum data transparency and preservation unprocessed grayscale images or maximum intensity projections were imported as smart objects and adjustments were done using adjustment layers. Processed images were saved as multilayer PSD files.

Image quantification

DNA damage foci in mitotic cells were counted manually. For quantitative assessment of protein colocalization the SQUASSH plugin (part of the MosaicSuite) for ImageJ and Fiji was used1138. PLA quantification and TOPBP1 foci quantification in interphase cells were done using CellProfiler 4.039. First nuclei segmentation was performed by the intensity-based primary object detection module using the DAPI signal. For DNA damage foci segmentation the primary object detection module was used on the respective channels after applying a feature enhancement filter. Downstream data manipulation was done using either RStudio or structured query language (SQL) scripts on the CellProfiler output SQLite databases. CellProfiler pipelines and SQL scripts are available upon request. For quantification of γH2AX foci cells were grown on coverslips and incubated with RO-3306 for 16 h to synchronize cell population in late G2. Cells were subsequently released from the cell cycle arrest by washing 3 × 5 min with warm PBS and by adding fresh culture medium. Cells were further incubated for 20 min to allow them to progress into mitosis before irradiation with 0.5 Gy when indicated and then fixed 24 h after irradiation with ice-cold methanol. Cells were stained with mouse monoclonal anti-γH2AX antibody as described above. Image acquisition was done using widefield microscopy and quantification was done using CellProfiler 4.0 as described above. For quantification of micronuclei formation unsynchronized cell populations were grown on coverslips and either treated with 3 Gy or left untreated. 6 h after IR cells were washed in cold PBS and fixed with ice-cold methanol for 10 min. Methanol was discarded and cells were washed twice before mounting the coverslips on microscopy glass slides with VECTASHIELD® PLUS antifade mounting medium with DAPI. Images were captured by widefield microscopy and micronuclei were counted manually in Fiji while nuclei were counted using a CellProfiler 4.0 nuclei segmentation pipeline. For quantification of CENPA and γH2AX positive and negative MNi cells were stained with anti-CENPA or anti-γH2AX antibodies following standard immunofluorescence protocol as described above. Image acquisition was done using widefield microscopy and quantification of CENPA and γH2AX positive and negative MNi was done manually.

Metaphase analysis

Cells were grown to 90% confluence on a 10 cm plate and were treated with 0.1 μg/mL KaryoMax Colcemid (Thermo Fisher Scientific) for 16 h overnight. Cells were trypsinized and transferred to a 15 ml Falcon™ tube centrifuged at 176 g for 5 min and carefully resuspended in 5 ml of pre-warmed hypotonic buffer (15% FBS 75 mM KCl) with intermittent agitation and incubated for 15 min at 37 °C. Cells were again pelleted at 176 g for 5 min the supernatant was discarded and the cell pellet was resuspended in 200 μl of hypotonic buffer. Cells were fixed by adding drop-wise 7 ml of ice-cold MeOH:AcOH 3:1 while slowly vortexing followed by 40 min on ice. After centrifugation at 176 g for 5 min supernatant was discarded and cells were resuspended in the remaining 200 μl of the fixation buffer. A total of 20–25 μl of the cell suspension was then dropped at a 45° angle onto a wet glass slide and air-dried for 10 min. Metaphases were stained with VECTASHIELD® PLUS antifade mounting medium with DAPI covered with a glass coverslip and sealed with nail varnish. Telomere FISH was conducted using the Telomere PNA FISH Kit/Cy3 (Dako K5326) according to the protocol provided by the supplier. Spreads were imaged using Leica DMI6000B inverted fluorescence microscope and quantification of telomere aberrations was performed manually.

Clonogenic survival assay

For clonogenic survival assay 4 × 105 asynchronously growing RPE-1 cells were counted and plated in 6 cm dishes. The day after plating cells were treated with the indicated doses of X-rays. Soon after irradiation cells were counted and plated in triplicates in 6-well plates at a density of 250 cells/well. Colonies were grown for 14 days at standard cell culture conditions with medium change every two days. At the assay endpoint colonies were fixed with 3.7% formaldehyde (Chemie Brunschwig extra-pure 37-41% solution diluted 1/10 in deionized water) for 10 min before staining with 0.5% Crystal Violet in 10% Ethanol solution (Honeywell) for 10 min at RT. Last staining solution was discarded colonies were washed 3 × 2 min in PBS while shaking and left to dry overnight. Images of the plates were acquired using a flatbed scanner Epson perfection V800 (Epson Nagano – Japan) with the following settings: 24-bit colour 1200 dpi resolution. Quantification was performed using the ColonyArea plug-in of Fiji40.

Statistics and reproducibility

The appropriate statistical test was chosen as follows: Unpaired normal distributed data were tested with a two-tailed t test (in case of similar variances) or with a two-tailed t test with Welch’s correction (in case of different variances). Unpaired non-continuous (count) data or non-normal distributed data were tested with two-tailed Mann–Whitney test (in case of similar variances) or with a two-tailed Kolmogorov–Smirnov test (in case of different variances). Three or more groups were analyzed by one-way ANOVA with Dunnett’s correction for multiple comparison. In case of non-continuous (count) data or non-normal distribution Kruskal-Wallis with Dunn’s correction for multiple comparison was used. Clonogenic survival data was tested with linear regression.

All statistical analysis was performed with GraphPad Prism 9. Sample sizes and the statistical tests used are specified in the figure legends.

It was named for the icehouse conditions found within its natural cavities where year-round ice provided natural cold storage for farmers in the days before refrigeration.

The black basalt of the Ice Springs lava flow is visible in the image above acquired on July 12 2022 by the Operational Land Imager-2 (OLI-2) on Landsat 9. Soil and vegetation have not yet taken hold on these young rocks. The last lava flowed from the Ice Springs vent about 700 years ago making the jagged basaltic aa lava the newest rock in Utah.

A total of about 700 million cubic yards (540 million cubic meters) of lava have erupted here from four cinder cone volcanoes for which the area is also known as The Cinders.

The 17-square-mile (45-square-kilometer) Ice Springs lava flow erupted onto older lava flows which erupted on the shores and under the surface of ancient Lake Bonneville. A precursor to the Great Salt Lake Lake Bonneville occupied basins in northeastern Nevada western Utah and southeastern Idaho in the late Pleistocene Epoch from 25000 to 10000 years ago. At its greatest extent the lake was up to 1000 feet (300 meters) deep and covered about 20000 square miles (52000 square kilometers).

The darker brown areas in the image are older lava flows along with the sediments deposited atop them when they sat at the bottom of Lake Bonneville. In some places the contact between the younger and older lava flows appears almost linear; this is where the lava flowed up against a fault scarp. The lightest brown areas are more recent sand dunes.

One of the cinder cones Red Dome is the site of Utah’s largest open-pit lava-rock mine. Lava cinder pumice and scoria rock have been mined here since the 1930s for use in landscaping road construction the manufacture of cinder blocks and cement and to line BBQ grills and fish tanks.

A religious Jewish woman found the flyer at the Sassoon Yehuda Synagogue in the heart of the religious Jewish community of the city. The woman was the granddaughter of Holocaust survivors.

The flyer lists Australian CDC members with Jewish background or names as a form of evidence for the claim that ""every single aspect of the COVID agenda is Jewish"".

Among the names listed were Robert Kapito founder and president of the New York City-based investment management firm BlackRock and Mortimer J. Buckley CEO of The Vanguard Group.

The flyer then claims these two companies ""are the two largest shareholders of both Pfizer and GSK plc a British multinational pharmaceutical company. An antisemitic flyer found on the front steps of a synagogue on Melbourne Australia (credit: ANTI-DEFAMATION COMMISSION)

It also claimed that these companies control the ""MSM"" - mainstream media.

""Remember... those who argued that 'if you're against lockdowns you're against state power' were literally Shabbos goy carrying out the will of the Jews wittingly or unwittingly"" the flyer concluded.

The flyer had the logo of GoyimTV on it. GoyimTV is an antisemitic troll video platform operated by the Goyim Defense League a conspiracy theorist network of antisemites and neo-Nazis.

According to the Anti-Defamation league ""The GDL was responsible for at least 74 antisemitic propaganda incidents in 2021.""

The GDL has indeed been behind both propaganda incidents and attacks worldwide. In May a GDL member dressed as a haredi man shouted ""The Nazis are coming"" in a Beverly Hills hotel entrance whilst two other members dressed as Nazis patrolled the driveway.

Similarly in October of last year GDL member Jon Minadeo II hung an antisemitic banner near a synagogue in Austin Texas which read ""Vax the Jews.""

""Times of turmoil like this pandemic have offered fertile ground for neo-Nazis to dehumanise and scapegoat Jews for this health crisis and I am very alarmed by the scale and depth of the wave of hatred engulfing us"" said Anti-Defamation Commission chairman Dr. Dvir Abramovich.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFzaWFuaW52ZXN0b3IubmV0L2FydGljbGUvd2Vla2x5LXJvdW5kdXAtb2YtcGVvcGxlLW5ld3MtanVseS0xNS80ODAzMDnSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Weekly roundup of people news July 15 | Fund Managers,"Ping An of China Asset Management hires new MD and fixed income head; Two senior executives leave HKEX; Prudential Thailand names chief actuary; Fidelity promotes new head of equities in China; BlackRock relocates Eric Liu to Shanghai as fixed income head; WTW appoints new head of crb for Hong Kong; and more

The section is now safer due to better lighting and more accessible thanks to ramps – says City Council

The Cork City to Passage West Greenway has re-opened to the public after major works aimed at providing a higher quality route for recreational and commuting pedestrians and cyclists. The works are being carried out for Cork City Council by Ward and Burke Construction and funded by the National Transport Authority

The public can enjoy a wider safer greenway new access ramps over 2000 new trees CCTV and environmentally sensitive public lighting on the much-loved amenity which traces the route of the 19th-century Cork Blackrock and Passage Railway line.

Conservation works are ongoing at Blackrock Railway Station and the many bridges along the route. These bridges represent some of the finest examples of stone-cut bridges in the State. The Blackrock Road railway footbridge has been re-installed using the existing historic abutments access ramps and disused railway platforms.

The culvert which runs along the greenway under Skehard Road has also been transformed by local street artists working alongside artists from Spain and Brazil. Coloured lighting has also been installed on the underpass.

The Cork City to Passage West Greenway begins a stone’s throw from Cork City ‘Docklands’ (the new term for what used to be known as ‘the Marina’ – plus more land) and from phase one of the recently-opened Marina Park. It continues alongside the Marina which was pedestrianised two years ago. Cork City Council is currently asking the public to have their say on its plans to re-purpose approximately 1.8km of the existing Marina Promenade to deliver a combined footpath-cycle path and improved public spaces.

Lord Mayor of Cork Cllr Deirdre Forde said:

“There will be great excitement to see ‘The Line’ re-opened and to enjoy an even better and safer walking running and cycling route for residents and visitors to the city. Native trees shrubs and wildflowers have also been planted along the route and bat boxes installed to enhance its biodiversity in the years ahead”.

Cork City Council is continuing works on the new access ramps at locations such as the Marina and Blackrock Station and further semi-mature tree planting is planned. It is expected that Cork City Council will shortly submit a planning application to upgrade the section of the greenway from Mahon to Passage West."

A spokeswoman for the commission acknowledged the attack in a Friday evening email to The Providence Journal.

""Last week the Narragansett Bay Commission identified a cybersecurity incident that involved the encryption of data on certain computers and systems in its network"" spokeswoman Jamie R. Samons said in the email.

While she did not specify a ransomware attack such attacks typically involve hackers encrypting data on a victim's computer system and refusing to supply the key to decode the data until a ransom is paid.

Samons did not reply to a follow-up email asking whether a ransom was paid.

She did note that the systems hit by the attack are not ones that control the operation of the sewage system.

""There has been no disruption to wastewater collection and treatment services"" Samons wrote.

She said that law enforcement was contacted immediately.

It was unclear whether customer information was taken during the attack.

""If it is determined that anyone’s personal information was potentially subject to unauthorized access or acquisition in connection with this incident Narragansett Bay Commission will promptly provide notice to those individuals in accordance with applicable law"" Samons wrote. ""Notably Narragansett Bay Commission does not store payment information or Social Security numbers for any of its customers on its systems.""

She said the commission is enhancing security measures on its systems as well as training employees ""concerning data security.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiQWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnZpbmR5LmNvbS9vYml0dWFyaWVzLzIwMjIvMDcvbmljay1rYXRjaG1lci0xOTMyLTIwMjIv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Nick Katchmer 1932-2022 | News Sports Jobs,"GIRARD — Nick Katchmer 90 passed away on Friday July 8 2022 at his home surrounded by his family.

Nick was born March 29 1932 in McKinley Heights the son of Pete and Catherine Senchisak Katchmer. He enjoyed a long life full of adventure and had many friends.

Nick attended Niles McKinley High School and was a member of the graduating Class of 1950. He served for many years on the class reunion committee and enjoyed going to monthly dinners and yearly reunions with other classmates.

Nick served his country in the Air Force during the Korean War from 1952 to 1956 and earned the rank of staff sergeant. While stationed in Korea he took the message at his teletype station of the signing of the Korean Armistice Agreement on July 27 1953. After Korea he was stationed at Ethan Allen Air Force base in Winooski Vt. where he was in charge of the communications station. Nick always said he was glad to be in the Air Force and was proud of his service. He was a life member of American Veterans of World War II Korea and Vietnam (AMVETS).

Nick owned and operated Katchmer Floor and Tile Co. for more than 50 years and was a member of the Carpenters & Joiners Union Local 171 for 59 years. Over the years he created many beautiful custom floors countertops and tile work in surrounding area homes at his home and at his daughter’s home. When in his work clothes he usually sported a pair of red suspenders a red bandana and Red Wing shoes. He would often joke that he couldn’t retire as people kept calling him well into his late 70s.

Nick enjoyed polka music and dancing especially at Avon Oaks where he met the love of his life Barbara. He enjoyed vacationing with his wife in Florida for the summer and Christmas holidays at his daughter’s home and fishing trips with his son-in-law. He traveled to the Florida Keys and took a cruise to the Bahamas. He loved the family pets dearly.

Nick loved going to air shows and flying in warbirds including a North American T-6 Texan and a flight in the restored Liberty Belle B-17 Flying Fortress with his daughter and son-in-law (his wife chose to stay on the ground for this one). He also enjoyed going to and watching boxing matches playing poker and going to the casino (and occasionally winning big!).

He was an avid reader of aviation and history books and loved watching old war movies with his favorites being “The Enemy Below” and “A Bridge Too Far.” He also loved working crossword puzzles building model airplanes squirrel feeders and even a bridge out of toothpicks (for his daughter’s science fair project). He loved plaid shirts Golden Grahams cereal old-fashioned cocktails and Old Spice (the original not that new stuff as he would say). He was never without a handkerchief a toothpick or a tube of Chapstick in his pocket. His favorite musical piece was “The Blue Danube Waltz” by Johann Strauss and his favorite color was green like his eyes which always had a twinkle in them.

He leaves behind to cherish his memory his wife of 53 years Barbara Machel Katchmer whom he married Nov. 16 1968; his daughter Cyndi (Todd) Bradley of Davenport Fla.; brother John (Grace) Katchmer of Girard; and several nieces and nephews.

Besides his parents he was preceded in death by his brothers Mike and Steve; and his sisters Rose Davis Mary Pavlich and Ann Round.

Nick was very much loved and will be deeply missed by all who knew him but especially by his wife and daughter. Dad always had a smile on his face a kind word to say and a story or joke ready to tell. He will forever live on in our hearts and never be forgotten.

The family would like to extend heartfelt thanks to the Girard Fire Department the Girard Police Department Lane Transport the doctors and nurses at St. Joseph Warren Hospital and St. Elizabeth Hospital Dr. William Eddy Dr. David Fredericka Heyday Health the staff at Blackstone Funeral Home and family friends and neighbors for their care kindness support and compassion shown to Nick and our family.

A memorial service will be held at 3 p.m. Saturday July 23 2022 at Blackstone Funeral Home where the family will receive relatives and friends from 2 p.m. until the time of service.

But thanks to the particular vehicle he was piloting that was never going to happen.

The Opener Blackfly is one of the first legitimate attempts at bringing a mass-produced eVTOL personal transportation vehicle to the market in any significant capacity. No wonder this example sits among a host of other eVTOL concepts at the Cradle of Aviation in Garden City New York. On the former site where Charles Lindbergh took off bound for Paris these eVTOLs may not have the same ambitions. But it can't be argued; they're still cool as heck.Founded in Ontario Canada by Mr. Marcus Leng and now based in Palo Alto California their single product the Blackfly is an engineering marvel. It allows a single pilot without passengers to take off in the same manner as a helicopter fly as the crow flies as far as 25 miles at speeds exceeding 60mph (96.5 kph). With an inner structure composed of epoxy-bonded carbon fiber an empty weight of 343 lbs (155.6kg) doesn't sound unreasonable at all.This surprisingly sparce weight also qualifies the airframe as an ultralight vehicle that requires no pilot's license to operate via FAA regulations. The craft consists of a single-seat cockpit attached to a long tube-like fuselage with a set of straight wings at the aircraft's front and back. It can't exactly be called a biplane but it sure is an airplane with two sets of wings if that makes sense. At 13 feet and seven inches wide (4.12 m) 13 feet and five inches long (4.08 m) and five feet tall (1.52 m) the Blackfly is wider than even the widest Lamborghini Aventador. Such a wide load may not bode well for storage inside parking or home garages but something tells us an airplane hangar is a better storage facility for a vehicle like this. Powering the Opener Blackfly is a series of eight DC electric motor units charged by an 8battery in the U.S. and 12 kWh in international markets. Both will be paired to a series of eight dual-bladed composite propellers to cut through turbulent air with relative ease.Using either a 120 or 240-volt power outlet at anywhere from 15 to 50 amps the Balck fly can recharge from 20 to 100 percent in anywhere from seven hours to just over one hour. While FAA regulations prevent the Blackfly from reaching its top speed international examples are slated to have top speeds as high as 80 mph (128.8 kph). Like lots of eVTOL projects the Opener Blackfly is designed to take off from a wide array of terrains. That includes snow grass tarmac gravel and even ice.With a clever fly-by-wire control system no physical levers or metal cables operate the Blackfly's control surfaces. It's all controlled by a suite of sensors and electric actuators that make real-time adjustments based on the pilot's flight stick input. This system also allows for an advanced autoland system to bring the aircraft safely to the surface in both regular landings and emergencies.Four redundant pairs of elevon controls ensure even in a said emergency so there shouldn't be too much loss of control in a bind. If all else fails Blackfly production models will all come sporting a ballistic parachute in the event of loss of power and control. But compared to other exhibits at the Cradle of Aviation's eVTOL display is the Blackfly the most practical?Unlike the Kitty Hawk Flyer located just to the right of the Blackfly it had indeed been able to reach full-scale non-test prototype production beginning in 2021 with retail sales slated to start in late 2022. Though no definitive pricing has been laid out just the consensus seems to be that the Blackfly will cost around the same money as a high-end luxury. So then not exactly cheap utilitarian eVTOL transportation for the masses.But perhaps it's the Blackfly whose innovation finally lowers the price of entry to the eVTOL scene. If successful it would almost assuredly usher in a new and profoundly exciting era of personal aviation.

There isn’t anything like a home-cooked meal. With so many cooking appliance options it can feel overwhelming to decide what will work best for your needs. Between air fryers and mixers the marketplace is full of choices to make life in the kitchen much more efficient.

Grills are a common appliance that many can’t go without. However it can be difficult to keep up with the constant addition of newer models and designs. Flat top grills are a favorite for their overall convenience. Pellet grills are beginning to gain momentum for their ease of use. Determining which one is best for your needs depends on several factors.

Flat top grills

Flat top grills are well-known for their versatility. Consumers love that anything from eggs to burgers can be placed on the grill and cooked to perfection. They also come in a variety of designs. Some require electricity while others you can use above an open flame or stovetop. Flat top grills come in a range of prices so you’re likely to find one in your budget. They’re also made from chrome steel cast iron and aluminum materials.

Flat top pros

Flat top grills are versatile. They can cook various breakfast foods including bacon pancakes and eggs. They can also cook meats rice vegetables and more. Flat top grills burn out the fat and excess oil from your food resulting in less grease and fat. Depending on the design you can use them indoors outdoors or both. They also come in a range of sizes. Whether you’re cooking for a group or just yourself there is a size for your needs. Cleanup is easy with flat top grills because the grease can run down or you can wipe it into the grease traps which you can then pour out.

Flat top cons

Flat top grills don’t offer the smoky flavor of a traditional grill. They also can’t create the crisscrossed seared look that many love to see on their grilled food. Though flat top grills burn the fat and excess oil out of food unless you’re constantly wiping off the excess grease you’ll be cooking in it. Also some outdoor flat top grills don’t come with a lid.

Pellet grills

Pellet grills are not as popular as other grills like gas charcoal and flat top. Pellet grills are like outdoor convection ovens. You can use it to smoke grill roast bake and braise. Pellet grills need electricity to work and they use compressed hardwood (pellets) as fuel. The pellets are placed into the pellet hopper. The auger pushes the pellets from the hopper into the fire pit. The fan then dispenses the heat throughout the grill. Essentially it does most of the work for you.

Pellet grill pros

Pellet grills are extremely easy to use. All that is required are pellets to get things started. The temperature can be set and maintained without needing to tend to the fire. Their versatility is also a bonus. The pellets come in various flavors to add an aroma to your food. Pellet grills come with grease traps for easy cleanup. The grease traps also prevent flare-ups from occurring when cooking. Pellet grills can get very hot. Some can go above 500 degrees Fahrenheit. Select pellet grills come with Bluetooth capability to control the grill from their phone. For instance users can even fire up the grill on their way home from work.

Pellet grill cons

Pellet grills are quite expensive. Additionally they need electricity to function. It’s important to note that not all pellet grills can sear food. Pellet grills are large and heavy making them difficult to take with you on a camping trip. Compared to traditional grills pellet grills offer a subtle smoky flavor instead of a rich smoky flavor. Cleaning a pellet grill is much like cleaning other grills with a grate and it’s more of a tedious process than cleaning a flat top.

Should you get a flat top or a pellet grill?

Choosing one over the other depends on what you hope to achieve and how much you can afford. Flat top grills come in an array of options for outdoor to indoor use with a wide price range. You can cook all sorts of food on them they’re easy to clean and they’re portable. However they don’t offer a smoky flavor like other grills and need to be watched to prevent overcooking or burning your food. Pellet grills however are a breeze to use and offer advanced technology that makes cooking efficient. But they are costly and cannot be easily taken with you on a trip.

Both are excellent choices. Factor in what is most important to you and you’ll have a reliable grill for life.

Ted Colbert who became CEO of Boeing Defense Space & Security in April spoke as the U.S. Air Force holds a secret competition for a next-generation fighter jet.

“I can't speak to the specific…projects. I can just tell you that we're investing” Colbert said during a Sunday briefing in London on the eve of the Farnborough Air Show.

Asked whether Boeing should be included in discussions about the classified Next Generation Air Dominance project he said “I'd ask the government about that.”

Air Force leaders have declined to say much about the contest since it was unveiled in September 2020 and have not named the companies competing to win leading to speculation and analysis of ambiguous statements made by defense executives on quarterly earnings calls.

Lockheed Martin is the only U.S. maker of fifth-generation fighter jets and Northrop Grumman is the lone maker of long-range stealth bombers. Boeing still builds new versions of F-15 and F/A-18 fighter jets for the U.S. and its allies but has not created a new fighter-jet line since the 1990s. It built key parts of the F-22 fighter for Lockheed but that plane has been out of production for more than a decade. In 2001 the Pentagon chose Lockheed’s F-35 over Boeing’s X-32 as its future combat fighter back.

Still in 2018 the Air Force chose a new Boeing-designed pilot training jet over existing planes built by Lockheed and Italian defense firm Leonardo.

“Fighters [are] important business to the Boeing Company” Colbert said. “We have a Phantom Works organization that has does today and will continue to invest in the future of fighters— that's facilities that's people that's technology.” Phantom Works is Boeing’s advanced development group that operates largely in secret and is responsible for designing and developing new aircraft and technology.

Beyond combat fighters Colbert discussed how he intends to run Boeing’s $26 billion defense and space business differently than predecessors. He signaled the company would not take as much risk when bidding for Pentagon contracts a practice that has cost the company billions of dollars as it has struggled to deliver new aerial refueling tankers two new Air Force One aircraft pilot training jets security helicopters and a Navy refueling drone.

“We'll take the approach that makes the most sense” Colbert said of future bids.

Boeing CEO Dave Calhoun has criticized the company’s low-ball bids for fixed-price contracts which require the company to pay for any development hiccups.

“The priority right now is delivering the commitments and the programs that we have today” Colbert said. With the exception of the two new aircraft being modified for use as Air Force One to fly the U.S. president Colbert said “every single one of those programs we believe have tremendous opportunities in the future.”

The company has “learned a ton of lessons” from its shortcomings on several defense projects he said.

Colbert several times touted the company's efforts to develop technology that will allow future aircraft to fly autonomously. He also said there is “a lot of interest in other parts of the world” for the E-7 Wedgetail a radar plane flown by several American allies and is now being purchased by the U.S. Air Force to replace old AWACS planes. “Dynamic threats around the world” are driving interest in the E-7 and the P-8 a submarine hunting plane flown by the U.S. Navy and allies.

But while the unit’s new chief executive declined to say for certain that company will be less aggressive in offering low-ball bids for future programs he said it does plan to “take a different approach” in some cases based on lessons learned from past mistakes.

“We’ll take the approach that makes the most sense” Ted Colbert said in one of his first interviews with reporters since he became CEO of Boeing Defense Space and Security in April.

“We have learned a ton of lessons especially around contracting” he said. “Frankly we’ve had a discussion with our customers in the procurement space about those lessons learned. And we’ve all learned. So we’re working together to make sure that anything we do going forward will heighten the probability of getting things done in a timely manner.”

Under the terms of a fixed-price contract a company is responsible for paying for any expenses above a certain price ceiling. Boeing is locked into fixed price agreements a host of major aircraft programs such as the KC-46 tanker MQ-25 tanker drone T-7A trainer jet and the VC-25B which will eventually become the next presidential transport aircraft.

On several of those programs Boeing has logged major losses due to technical and supply chain difficulties as well as the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. Most significantly KC-46 losses now total more than $5 billion on a $4.9 billion contract while losses on the $3.9 billion VC-25B contract have risen to $1.1 billion according to the company.

During an April earnings call with investors Boeing CEO Dave Calhoun even went so far as to say its VC-25B contract with the Air Force — which then-CEO Dennis Muilenburg negotiated directly with then-President Donald Trump who threatened to cancel the program — was “a unique set of risks that Boeing probably shouldn’t have taken.”

During the roundtable on Sunday Colbert also addressed criticism by Andrew Hunter the Air Force’s acquisition executive who has previously said that the service is working with Boeing to address a number of issues including challenges with Boeing’s internal business systems and obtaining data needed to definitize agreements such as the first F-15EX contract.

“It isn’t about protecting [Boeing’s business interests]. Sometimes it’s just about clarity of question and clarity of answer in the back-and-forth that goes on in the process” Colbert said. “One of the examples we’ve worked through on many of our programs is price reasonableness. Price reasonableness requires a lot analysis. And so it’s just like anything else — you do the analysis you provide the answer and you sort of lobby and go back and forth.”

July 16 2022 © Leeham News: After years of market turmoil Boeing and Airbus see brighter skies–and bigger order backlogs–ahead. Both companies maintained confidence that demand for aircraft would bounce back as the COVID-19 pandemic ebbed. Passenger traffic and aircraft utilization seem to back up their optimism. Traffic is bouncing back despite short-term economic concerns a pandemic that is still smoldering and Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.

Boeing projects demand for 39050 new commercial aircraft excluding regional jets over the next two decades according to its Current Market Outlook which it released Saturday. The company’s forecast is in line with Airbus’ forecast of demand for 39500 aircraft. Single-aisle aircraft make up three-quarters of demand in both companies’ outlooks. Boeing is slightly more bullish on passenger widebody demand.

Sustainability is an increasingly important factor in Boeing’s market outlook. It is also a relatively new variable and how much it will shape market demand and in what ways is not very clear.

Projected demand almost at 2019 level

Boeing projects demand for 41170 commercial jet aircraft through 2041: 2120 regional jets 30880 single-aisle 7230 widebody and 940 freighters. The company expects that demand to be largely evenly split among North America (23%) Europe (21%) Asia Pacific (21%) and China (21%). The rest is split among the Middle East (7%) Latin America (5%) and Africa (2%). Given the current war in Ukraine Boeing’s outlook excludes the Russian market.

The U.S. aerospace giant sees slightly more than half the global demand coming after 2031. In the next 10 years it forecasts global demand for 19575 new aircraft: 1170 regional jets 14620 single-aisle 3300 widebody and 485 freighters. The regional distribution is roughly the same as the overall outlook.

If Russia is included in the 10- and 20-year forecasts the overall numbers are fairly close to 2019’s pre-pandemic outlook. The 10-year projection is nearly the same: 20550 aircraft in 2019 20285 (19575 plus 710 for the Russian market) in 2022.

There is more room between 2019’s 20-year outlook and the current year. Boeing projected 44040 deliveries over 20 years in 2019. This year it forecasts 42710 deliveries including the Russian market (41170 plus 1540). That is a 3% difference.

Boeing continues to expect domestic passenger traffic to return to 2019 levels by early 2023 followed by long-haul traffic in mid to late 2024 based on current trajectories Boeing’s Vice President Commercial Marketing Darren Hulst said.

Airbus gives a wider range–between 2023 and 2025.

Single-aisle traffic is bouncing back strongly. Already 98% of narrowbody aircraft flying before the pandemic are operating again. Widebodies continue to lag with less than 80% back in operation according to Boeing.

Airlines have been dusting off planes they parked during the pandemic especially in Europe and Asia. Since June 1000 single-aisle aircraft have been taken out of storage according to Cirium. Single-aisle aircraft utilization for domestic U.S. travel is 1% higher than it was in 2019. In Latin America it is 9% higher than pre-COVID-19 levels.

To be sure airlines face plenty of short-term economic challenges. Several are driving up costs–higher prices for fuel labor and maintenance among other expenses–which will likely mean higher ticket prices. At the same time global GDP growth is slowing. And the COVID-19 virus is no slouch. It continues to mutate ready to throw a wrench in the works.

Air cargo’s growing value is pushing freighter demand

COVID-19 spurred ecommerce to new heights. Ecommerce is now a structural driver of economic growth through the next decade Hulst said during a pre-Farnborough briefing. That shift in purchasing behavior is causing ripples throughout the global cargo and shipping industry.

“The speed and reliability of air cargo is an important aspect and a strategic value to the freight forwarders and shipping companies” far more today than it was three to five years ago he said.

Capacity discipline and consolidation in the shipping industry should continue to increase the relative value of air cargo to ground and sea freight Hulst said.

However air cargo’s high yields compared to container shipping during the pandemic are “clearly phenomenon of extreme shortage of supply and extreme demand because of challenges in the supply chain related to shipping” he said.

Currently air cargo makes up about 1% of global freight. Even a tiny shift from container shipping to air cargo would greatly increase demand for freighters he said.

Boeing projects demand for 940 new freighters–515 large widebodies and 425 medium widebodies plus about 1850 freighter conversions–555 widebody conversions and 1300 narrowbody conversions. That makes a total demand of just under 2800 freighter deliveries and conversions. Airbus projects 2440 new-build or conversion freighters through 2041. As LNA has previously reported with the Airbus A350F Boeing faces its first credible competition in the widebody freighter market since it merged with McDonnell Douglas in 1997.

Sustainability is shaping the future…but how much?

The drive to decarbonize aviation and other sustainability pushes are major variables that could significantly shape future demand for aircraft. In the near term OEMs are focused on innovations such as sustainable aviation fuel. Longer term though new technologies could disrupt the large commercial aircraft industry.

Boeing accounts for sustainability in its market outlook as best as it is able to Hulst said. “The more and more detail we have into how sustainability measures will truly impact the cost of aviation that’s still largely unknown in specific markets.”

There are signs that it is affecting some ultra-short haul and short haul markets he said.

That market is Russia which is taken out of the equation because of the war in Ukraine.

There is uncertainty around when manufacturers could again sell planes to Russian carriers.

US AUTHORITIES OBTAIN WARRANT TO SEIZE BOEING GULFSTREAM JETS TIED TO RUSSIAN OLIGARCH

Boeing's new projection is that airlines worldwide will need 41170 new airplanes over 20 years with half of the deliveries for replacement aircraft and with single-aisle aircraft accounting for about 75% of planes.

The forecast is down from its previous 20-year-forecast of 43610 deliveries.

The new estimate excludes the Russian market and its projection of 1540 planes.

BOEING'S STARLINER RETURNS FROM SPACE STATION

Boeing's new market outlook was released on Sunday ahead of the Farnborough Airshow.

The Farnborough International Airshow is an industry trade show for the aerospace and defense industries where manufacturers demonstrate their aircraft in an attempt to book orders.

Boeing did however increase its 10-year demand forecast slightly to 19575 airplane deliveries excluding the Russian market.

Boeing sees strong near-term demand for aircraft despite the risk of a recession.

Potential buyers in New Jersey are shopping in a high-end mall across the hall from an Apple store. And from Denver to Washington state they are using virtual reality instead of kicking the tires.

Electric vehicle makers are racing to roll out showrooms across the country looking to create a new type of display space for their sleek and pricey cars and in the process becoming a growing tenant type for retail properties.

Just last week VinFast a Vietnamese electric car maker with much fanfare debuted a half-dozen showrooms in California most in the Los Angeles area. The company which has its U.S. headquarters in the Playa Vista section of Los Angeles said it plans to open several dozen more in the Golden State with the goal of having 30 total by the end of the year.

While VinFast is joined in a fast-growth strategy by some of the biggest electric car makers these companies don’t all share the same vernacular when it comes to naming the new showrooms popping up. So Lucid Group based in Newark California is continuing to build out a network of U.S. ""studios"" and service centers opening its 28th location — its first in the Pacific Northwest — in Seattle last month. Polestar the Swedish electric car maker aims to have 35 ""spaces"" across North America by year’s end.

They are jockeying to compete with dominant electric vehicle maker Tesla headquartered in Austin Texas. Tesla has the most retail ""galleries"" initially locating them in upscale malls.

Santa Monica California was one city where VinFast debuted its first electric vehicle stores outside of Vietnam last week. (VinFast)

""Tesla being the first to expand utilizing retail found a tremendous amount of success in attracting a consumer base"" and competitors are ""following a very similar path"" to the one that the legacy electric car maker laid out said Jason Greenstone an executive director of retail services at real estate firm Cushman & Wakefield.

Electric vehicles are looking more alluring to some Americans as gasoline prices soar. But competition in that auto sector has increased with more players emerging to take on incumbent Tesla. The newer entrants are trying to get their cars out in front of the public and showrooms in spots with high foot traffic act to get exposure for the brands.

""It’s a growing trend"" said Chuck Lanyard president of The Goldstein Group a retail broker in Paramus New Jersey.

New Way To Sell Cars

Electric vehicle makers have always had a much different model for selling their cars than traditional carmakers — offering them direct to consumers rather than through dealerships — and their leasing of sites at malls and other locations for showrooms is done to augment online sales.

A sign at the Lucid showroom at The Mall at Short Hills in New Jersey advises visitors that they can’t purchase any electric vehicles at the site. (Linda Moss/CoStar)



Some states including New Jersey don’t permit automakers to operate their own dealerships to sell new cars so showrooms are the only option to get a vehicle in front of consumers to peruse in person or to nail down the features the buyer wants for the car he or she plans to order. Even if a state allows an electric vehicle company to have a dealership there is no need for those manufacturers to have a huge space like a traditional dealer since they often are only selling a handful of models in some cases just two or three Lanyard said.

But it’s been a rocky road for some electric car makers. At least one company that originally announced showroom openings has pulled back on those plans: Rivian Automotive which is headquartered in Irvine California.

VinFast which will be offering all-electric SUVs is making an audacious debut in the United States where it is opening its first stores outside of Vietnam. It held grand openings for six retail sites in California on Wednesday.

They are located at:

VinFast part of the conglomerate Vingroup owns a highly automated automotive manufacturing plant in Hai Phong Vietnam. In addition to targeting 24 more stores in California this year the company plans to open retail locations in Canada Germany France and the Netherlands.

""As the birthplace of car culture in the U.S. California is a natural focus market for VinFast. ... California is leading the way in the EV revolution so there is no better place for us to begin our U.S. expansion than in California"" Craig Westbrook VinFast’s chief service officer said in a statement.

Lucid Revs Openings

Lucid also has been ramping up its retail expansion. In recent months it’s opened showrooms at The Mall at Short Hills in Short Hills New Jersey; Cherry Creek Shopping Center in Denver; and most recently at University Village in Seattle where it also has a service center at 3412 Airport Way S.

""The response to Lucid in Washington state has been tremendous which reflects the region’s unique embrace of both innovation and the environment"" Zak Edson Lucid’s vice president of sales and service said in a statement about the showroom’s debut adding that there’s a growing number of Lucid Air sedan owners in the Seattle market.

Lucid recently opened a studio showroom at the Cherry Creek Shopping Center in Denver. (Lucid)

Like most auto showrooms Lucid’s retail sites offer samples of the interior and exterior elements of its cars. In Lucid’s case the elements are modeled and named after different parts of California. In addition to actually seeing some of Lucid’s vehicles visitors can sit in a virtual reality configurator for a demonstration of how the interior finishes and exterior color they are interested in will look when put together.

Lucid didn’t respond to several emails seeking a comment.

Its studio at the Short Hills mall is across from an Apple store the kind of retail site that Tesla pioneered according to Greenstone. Tesla’s strategy — and now that of other electric vehicle makers — was to open its galleries in upscale high-traffic malls or streets near lifestyle brands such as Apple Peloton and Lululemon he said.

""When you go to Short Hills mall you are paying for a billboard"" said Bill Read an executive vice president at brokerage Retail Specialists.

Patrons of those retailers are more likely to be physically active and concerned about issues such as the environment and pollution therefore more likely candidates to purchase an electric vehicle Greenstone said. And they are often affluent able to afford the price tags. Lucid’s luxury Air Grand Touring vehicle sells for $154000 while Rivian’s R1T truck will set a buyer back $73000.

These electric vehicle showrooms only have to be 2500 to 4000 square feet big enough to display a couple of vehicles he said. And in a mall setting an electric car maker can easily have some vehicles parked outside in the lot for test drives and it doesn’t have to have inventory in stock on-site according to Greenstone.

Tesla Turns to Big Boxes

Tesla has recently been moving away from mall locations evolving its real estate strategy to lease large vacant free-standing retail sites for combined showrooms and service centers. For example last week Wayne New Jersey granted approval for Tesla to take over a former Bloomingdale’s furniture outlet at 469 Route 46. Tesla plans to use the largest building at the site for vehicle service. A smaller building will incorporate a 3120-square-foot showroom with the rest of the building used to store vehicles awaiting pickup by customers.

And in Atlanta Tesla has filed plans to lease a former Whole Foods Market store at 2111 Briarcliff Road as a sales and service center according to a report in Atlanta Tomorrow’s News Today.

Tesla didn’t respond to several emails seeking comment.

Tesla has 165 sites — showrooms and combined showroom-and-service centers — according to CoStar data. It has two locations that are 60000 square feet and over former department store boxes said Brandon Svec CoStar Group’s national director of retail analytics. The Tesla locations include 35 that are 30000 to 38000 square feet; 29 that are 10000 to 20000 square feet; and 27 that are 20000 to 30000 square feet. The automaker has 51 sites that are 1000 to 5000 square feet according to CoStar.

Tesla is ""keeping and renewing"" stores at malls that are performing well Greenstone said.

Retail expansion hasn’t been without its pullbacks by electric vehicle makers with not only Tesla shuttering some mall showrooms during the past few years but Rivian dropping plans to open a showroom at 932 W. Randolph St. in the Fulton Market area of Chicago.

""The Randolph Street location is no longer in our plans though we are still exploring our options in Chicago and look forward to sharing when the time is right"" Rivian spokewoman Miranda Jimenez said in an email adding that the company has shifted its ""physical footprint focus"" to its service centers.

Rivian only operates one U.S. showroom or ""hub"" in Venice California which it opened in October.

Former Substation and Gallery

""This space caters to anyone ranging from the EV-curious to Rivian pre-order holders and owners to families"" Jimenez said. ""Visitors can come together to share and connect through the site’s offerings and programming. ... The space is just over 3500 square feet and emphasizes adaptive reuse as it was formerly the site of author Ray Bradbury’s private residence an electric utility substation and an art gallery at separate times. You’ll find a library communal hall two display vehicles and open-air spaces for adults and children alike on-site.""

Rivian has more than 20 service centers across the United States in major cities such as Los Angeles and Chicago as well as smaller markets such as Olathe Kansas and Garfield Heights Ohio.

But there’s still a swell of retail activity by electric vehicle makers with newcomers beyond even VinFast and Lucid.

Faraday Future Intelligent Electric will also be establishing a foothold in the retail world in California. It will be opening what it calls a ""flagship-brand experience center"" at 464 N. Beverly Road in Beverly Hills. The company plans to debut its core vehicle the FF 91 in the third quarter.

""In the near future our cars will not only be in store windows but will also be on the streets of California and beyond available to all who wish to experience this new species of the ultimate intelligent TechLuxury vehicle” Carsten Breitfeld global CEO of Faraday Future said in a statement.

The company has received its dealer license from California which allows it to sell directly to buyers in the state and to sell vehicles online to users outside of California. Its Beverly Hills center will feature a retail area a sales lounge a cafe a virtual-reality experience a co-creation lab and a VIP lounge ""making the in-store sales experience complementary to the driving experience of the FF 91"" according to Faraday Future.

Faraday has said it aims to have flagship showrooms in the largest 20 cities around the world including New York by 2025.

Swedish electric vehicle maker Polestar aims to have 35 showrooms across North America by the end of 2022. (Polestar)

And Polestar aims to have 35 of its spaces across North America by the end of 2022 according to company spokesman Donny Nordlicht. Right now it has nearly 25.

""Our sales model is digital-first but also includes teaming up with our space partners for the physical footprint"" Nordlicht said in an email. ""Those partners are franchised retailers; we are not subject to any state laws regarding direct-sales as we do not sell direct to the customer.""

Polestar also has mall sites including the Short Hills mall where Lucid opened in February.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiSGh0dHBzOi8vYmFua2VyYW5kdHJhZGVzbWFuLmNvbS90cmFpbi1sdXJlcy1pbnZlc3RvcnMtdG8tdGhlLXNvdXRoLWNvYXN0L9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Train Lures Investors to the South Coast,"Massachusetts’ South Coast will not see MBTA commuter rail service until the end of next year but the train is already making waves in the region’s housing market.

Along with homebuyers looking for more affordable single-family homes compared to other parts of Massachusetts lenders say investors – many from the Greater Boston area – have flocked to Bristol County’s small multifamily properties anticipating that their investment will appreciate as train travel transforms the region.

“Southeastern Mass. the South Coast have been a long-kept secret for a long time” said Nicholas L. Christ senior vice president of sales and marketing at Swansea-based BayCoast Mortgage. “Combine [the rail project] with a perfect market for the mortgage industry – extremely high demand and then you bring in the investors – for Bristol County it was kind of a double whammy.”

While lenders have seen some slowing down in Bristol County’s multifamily purchase market in recent weeks demand among single-family homebuyers remains strong even as interest rates rise.

Small Multifamilies Draw Investors

Bristol County saw 7230 purchase mortgages issued for single-family condominium two- and three-unit homes in 2021 an increase of 9.5 percent over 2020 and 10.2 percent compared to 2019 according to The Warren Group publisher of Banker & Tradesman.

About 91800 of these residential purchase mortgages were issued in Massachusetts last year with growth rates of 10 percent over 2020 and 10.7 percent over 2019 similar to what Bristol County saw.

During the first five months of 2022 2576 purchase loans were made in Bristol County and 29950 were made statewide.

“Real estate investors feel is still the place to be long-term and I don’t disagree.” — Paul Matos branch manager Guild Mortgage

Purchase mortgages for two- and three-family homes saw the most growth in Bristol County over the course of 2021 with numbers of loans issued increasing by 37.8 percent compared to 2020 and 33.7 percent over 2019. Throughout Massachusetts purchase mortgages for two- and three-family homes increased by 36 percent over 2020 and 25.6 percent over 2019.

The prospect of commuter rail service to and from Boston and within Bristol County has partly driven demand for small rental properties Christ said noting that the market for these homes has approached record levels of activity. Small multifamily properties continue to sell he added though bidding wars have started to taper off in recent weeks compared to the previous two years.

The South Coast Rail project will connect the coastal cities of Fall River and New Bedford as well as the city of Taunton to the MBTA’s existing Middleborough line. The MBTA expects service to begin at the end of 2023.

Paul Matos a branch manager with Guild Mortgage in Dartmouth said Fall River and New Bedford have made other investments in their communities including waterfront development and adding amenities to help attract and keep residents.

Many of the multifamily investors buying locally have come from outside the region Matos said including Boston. Despite rising interest rates making refinance loans – often a source of funding for property purchases – more expensive investors have continued to seek opportunities to buy small multifamily properties Matos said adding that demand has recently started to slow down.

“We’re seeing appreciation probably not as robust as it has been more of a normal market with all these interest rate increases” Matos said. “Real estate they feel is still the place to be long-term and I don’t disagree.”

Rental listings portal site Apartment List estimates the monthly median rent for a two-bedroom unit in Bristol County has consistently been up 14 percent year-over-year since March and now sits at $1360.

While rents had increased at small multifamily properties during the pandemic Matos said they have recently remained stable.

Condos Offer Affordable Options

The year-to-date median sale price for a single-family home in Bristol County through May was $425000 according to The Warren Group.

Demand has remained strong for single-family mortgages and first-time homebuyers with some buyers coming from the Greater Boston area in search of more affordable options Matos said.

Lenders issued 1456 single-family and 333 condominium purchase mortgages in Bristol County in the first five months of 2022. The region saw 4685 single-family and 858 condo purchase mortgages over all of 2021.

While Bristol County remains a seller’s market Matos has heard of instances where borrowers had offers accepted below the asking price. Realtors have started seeing fewer homebuyers at open houses Matos said and sellers have started accepting contingencies again as part of the transaction.

Christ with BayCoast Mortgage said the limited inventory of single-family homes has given the condo market a boost.

“Condos have kind of stood out because the availability of single-family homes was not there” Christ said. “Condos from an affordability standpoint and from an availability standpoint made a more attractive buy than maybe in years past.”

Black Buyers Look South of Boston

As interest rates rise preapprovals need to be reevaluated as borrowers search for homes Matos said. While the current rate environment might make monthly payments unaffordable for some Matos sees signs that the market could start benefiting buyers as prices stabilize competition declines and properties stay on the market longer.

Matos said he often works with Bristol County’s low- and moderate-income buyers many of whom are immigrants.

Guild Mortgage entered the Massachusetts market last year by acquiring Residential Mortgage Services the top lender across the state in 2021 for MassHousing loans mortgage products for first-time homebuyers. Residential Mortgage Services made 40 percent of its loans to low- and moderate-income homebuyers two years ago according to the Massachusetts Community & Banking Council which recently released a report evaluating 2020 Home Mortgage Disclosure Act data.

Some Bristol County communities have seen racial diversity increase as Black borrowers find success buying homes there. The Massachusetts Community & Banking Council’s report which was prepared by the University of Massachusetts Donahue Institute found that Taunton where Black residents make up 7 percent of the population accounted for 23 percent of all owner-occupied home purchase loans. In Fall River with a population that was 6 percent Black in 2020 17 percent of these types of loans went to Black borrowers.

Low- and moderate-income buyers still face challenges in Bristol County Christ said. BayCoast Mortgage the mortgage lending division of BayCoast Bank has prioritized working with these homebuyers but has seen them face challenges amid the lack of inventory he said. As part of an initiative to help first-time homebuyers BayCoast plans to launch a $500000 program that will provide matching grants for down payment assistance.

“You still have prices at an all-time high; you have rates that have gone up faster than anybody anticipated so that market has made it even harder than it was before which was basically impossible to harder than impossible” Christ said. “We’ve made really every effort to give that extra attention and we will continue to and as the market changes hopefully there’s more opportunity there.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMidGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNic25ld3MuY29tL2Jvc3Rvbi9uZXdzL3dhdGVydG93bi1icmVhay1pbi1ob21lcy11bmxvY2tlZC13aW5kb3dzLWdhcmZpZWxkLXN0cmVldC1iYXJuYXJkLWF2ZW51ZS1wb2xpY2Uv0gF4aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuY2JzbmV3cy5jb20vYW1wL2Jvc3Rvbi9uZXdzL3dhdGVydG93bi1icmVhay1pbi1ob21lcy11bmxvY2tlZC13aW5kb3dzLWdhcmZpZWxkLXN0cmVldC1iYXJuYXJkLWF2ZW51ZS1wb2xpY2Uv?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,2 Watertown homes believed to be broken into through unlocked windows,"2 Watertown homes believed to be broken into through unlocked windows Friday night

2 Watertown homes believed to be broken into through unlocked windows Friday night

WATERTOWN - Watertown Police are warning residents about two home break-ins that happened Friday night while the homeowners were inside.

Police said one break-in happened on Garfield Street around 9:45 p.m. and another happened on Barnard Avenue at around 11:45 p.m. The homes are just two blocks from each other.

""Well it was one house up the street two weeks ago and then yesterday it was another house down here"" said Watertown resident Paul Coucette.

Coucette said in addition to Friday's break-ins the area has seen other similar incidents within the last few weeks.

Police said no one was hurt in Friday's incidents and nothing was taken from either of the homes.

The suspect or suspects are believed to have entered both homes through unlocked windows in the back of the homes police said. One of the homes was entered on the second floor.

But neighbors said they are most bothered by the fact that the homeowners in both cases were inside when the break-ins occurred.

""When you are in the house and they come in upstairs and you are downstairs with your kids and someone is rummaging around that's kind of nerve-wracking"" Coucette said.

Police are asking those who live in the area to review any doorbell or home surveillance video to see if it caught anything.

As of Saturday night no arrests had been made.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiV2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJpempvdXJuYWxzLmNvbS9kYXl0b24vbmV3cy8yMDIyLzA3LzE3L2RheXRvbi1pbmR1c3RyaWFsLXByb3BlcnR5LXNhbGUuaHRtbNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Dayton industrial property sold as part of $82 million transaction - Dayton Business Journal,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.bizjournals.com/dayton/news/2022/07/17/dayton-industrial-property-sale.html on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiV2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJpempvdXJuYWxzLmNvbS9kYXl0b24vbmV3cy8yMDIyLzA3LzE3L2RheXRvbi1pbmR1c3RyaWFsLXByb3BlcnR5LXNhbGUuaHRtbNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen

In addition following the acquisition of FoxEducation by GoStudent in 2021 Seneca Learning and Tus Media Group became available in 2022. Globally GoStudent serves more than 11 million students each year.

EdTech unicorn GoStudent has announced its US expansion with headquarters in Austin Texas in its quest to become a world leader in education.

In addition online tutoring will be welcomed in many rural areas for example where access to quality physical tutors is limited and where online tutors are already trusted and established. All of these factors make for an exciting launch in the US.”

Brands use Loyalsys to drive brand-to-customer collaborations retain customers and maximize marketing budgets by offering loyalty programs and membership clubs. Many additional developers are expected to be recruited for the Israeli office following the acquisition.

Yaniv Kaspi one of Loyalsys’ founders says: “We are delighted to be joining the Emarsys family. We look forward to collaborating with the SAP software giant from the beginning.”

In the wake of COVID-19 many brands have been scrambling for marketing tools that will assist them in providing the best customer experience while further strengthening their brand-customer relationship. To maximize customer loyalty brands need marketing solutions that provide actionable insight into the customer experience to increase customer retention. This merger of customer experience technologies allows both brands and communities to boost customer loyalty through personalized marketing experiences.

The acquisition of Loyalsys by Emarsys follows the success of their cooperation in business and technology according to CEO Ohad Hecht. The most advanced platform available on the market will allow us to fulfil our customers’ needs one step further.”

The Israeli Amarsys were originally Israeli Loyalsys. The scope of the purchase was not disclosed but People and Computers learned that it amounted to tens of millions of dollars. Two weeks ago SAP acquired Amarsys for about half a billion dollars.

Amarsys provides a marketing platform that is used by more than 1500 retail chains and e-commerce sites including Samsonite Wizz Air and Karl Lagerfeld. The company has 800 employees worldwide with more than 15 offices including in Israel. The acquisition is expected to close in the last quarter of 2020 in parallel with the acquisition of Amarsys by the German software giant. Amarsys helps brands improve their business results through omnichannel marketing strategies. The company combines AI technologies and a data platform Customers (CDP) to enable marketers to build marketing and sales channels tailored to the brand’s customer profile in a measurable and results-oriented manner.

Amarsys which to date has raised about $60 million was established in 2000 in Vienna. Its founders are daniel Harari an Israeli-Austrian who has already left the company; Austrian Joseph Aharoner the fourth generation of the family of the founder of the Porsche Automobile Corporation who is also the company’s main shareholder and chairman; and the Israeli Hagai Hartman who served as CEO until 2016 and currently serves as the company’s Chief Innovation Officer.

Loyalsys was founded in 2018 under the leadership of entrepreneurs Yaniv Caspi and Michael Fisch. The company is incorporated in Austria and has an office in Israel where support and development teams are based. Loyalsys enables the creation of rewards programs and loyalty clubs to drive collaborations between brands and customers. This is to better retain customers and achieve maximum value from each customer. Levialsys’ solution is made possible by leveraging the capabilities of the marketing platform Taking retention and rewarding capabilities to the next level personalized automated and easy to operate. Following the acquisition the company intends to recruit additional development personnel for the Israeli branch.

In recent years there has been an increase in the adoption of technologies from the marketing world (Martech) that allow brands to create a personalized online and offline experience for their customers maximizing the value and retention of each customer. The need to retain customers and improve the purchasing experience has become even stronger in light of the COVID-19 pandemic and the economic instability which requires brands to be creative and generate customer connection and loyalty in the digital space as well.

“Taking customer retention and reward solutions a big step forward”

Hartman said “The need to retain customers and maximize their value for companies has never been more important than these days. The synergy between Levialsys’ solution and Amarsys platform enables marketers to take customer retention and reward solutions a big step further with a better and personalized customer experience in every customer interaction with the business.”

According to Caspi one of the founders of Loyalsys: “We are delighted to have the opportunity to become part of the Amarsis family whose people have been partners from the very beginning in our vision of bringing innovation to the worlds of marketing and look forward to the shared future of all of us as part of the software giant.”

Ohad Hecht CEO of Amarsys said: “The acquisition decision came after successful business and technological cooperation between the two companies. We will continue to provide our customers with the most advanced platform on the market.”

Not SAP’s first acquisitions in Israel

As mentioned about two weeks ago SAP announced that it would acquire Amarsys. After the completion of the large transaction Loyalsys and Amarsys employees in Israel will join SAP’s development centre in Israel. The acquisition of Amarsis is built on a previous purchase made by SAP in Israel: that of the Israeli startup Gigya for $350 million in cash in September 2017. The company has developed social platforms for websites. Its main product is a system for managing a user base for sites With more than 1 billion users in total.

As far as they are concerned the entrance to the sites is done as usual except that the entrance is transferred to the system of Gigia which combines the information about the user that comes from social networks with that collected in the databases of the content site itself about its users. Before its acquisition Gigia had about 700 customers – including Nike Nestle NBC Forbes Fox Speedo L’Oréal Asus and KLM – and in total the company’s platform manages about 1.3 billion customer profiles on various websites. Gigia manages users’ profiles with all their online interactions. Once there is the lake this data – SAP can make it accessible to Amarsys.

SAP has been operating in Israel since 1998 and has acquired many companies including Shai and Reuven Agassi’s Top Tier which it acquired in 2001 for $400 million and Top Manage which it acquired a year later for less than $10 million. The company employs hundreds of employees in Israel most of them in R&D.

The Allcyte start-up uses high-content imaging and artificial intelligence to improve precision medicine and drug development. Exscientia has acquired Allcyte

In June 2021 Exscientia is ready to spend its hard-earned cash after closing several deals worth more than $1.7 billion in 2020.

Among its first purchases? An Austrian company Allcyte is developing a platform for predicting the effectiveness of cancer therapies.

Using this technology Exscientia can identify and build new drugs send them to clinical trials and test them on humans.

In exchange for Allcyte Exscientia will pay €50 million in cash and ordinary shares or about $60.6 million U.S. After the deal is completed Exscientia’s European headquarters will move to Vienna.

By combining these two platforms Exscientia will be able to design drug molecules based on precision medicine which will ensure that they are more effective at targeting tumour tissues than those that are created with Exscientia alone. Also the new platform will enable clinical trials to select patients more accurately.

Rather than using artificial or animal models to study the effects of various drugs Allcyte’s technology uses deep learning to analyze the effects of live samples taken from a patient’s tissue.

In comparison to the patients’ original treatment plans the AI-identified haematological cancer therapies improved progression-free survival rates significantly.

Patients receiving treatments other than those recommended by Allcyte had worse outcomes according to a follow-up analysis.

The most disease-relevant screening platform we’ve seen Allcyte can demonstrate to the individual patient what therapy works” Exscientia CEO Andrew Hopkins said. With Allcyte’s platform and Exscientia’s technologies combined we can transform how drugs are discovered and selected for patients.”

Exscientia’s drug development efforts and existing collaborations will be boosted by Allcyte’s software integration into the company’s platform.

A $50 million upfront payment was made by Exscientia to Bristol Myers Squibb last month for its drug discovery expertise. After that another $125 million will be paid for proven success in the short term plus ongoing milestone payments totalling at least another $1 billion should everything go well on the clinical and regulatory fronts.

As if that weren’t enough Exscientia received another $300 million equity commitment from SoftBank’s Vision Fund 2 in April on top of $225 million in series D funding from Bristol Myers Squibb among others.

10. Bitpanda

The company’s founders said that market conditions forced a scaling down of Bitpanda.

As of now the company intends to have 730 employees. LinkedIn reports that it has just over 1000 employees.

It wasn’t until a certain point when more people joined that we became more effective. This was particularly true in this new market reality when coordination overheads became greater rather than lower” Bitpanda wrote. “Now that we have looked back we realize that our hiring speed wasn’t sustainable. My apologies.”

Moreover employees have been notified of the retraction of recent offers.

In response to a market downturn and rising interest rates crypto platforms and tech firms alike have slashed headcounts.

In a statement sent to CoinDesk Bitpanda said “We recognize our responsibility to our employees and their families.” Supporting their career transitions is one of our top priorities.

American dreams usually begin where? Amazon Apple and Google are among the largest companies of the early 21st century all of which were started in garages. They represent the myth that you can conquer the global market even if you can’t afford to rent an office in the early days.

Along the Süd Autobahn it is there that the most successful Austrian startup was founded so maybe in a few years we’ll compare it to the motorway service station where the Austrian dream began. In addition Austria is home to Bitpanda the country’s only unicorn startup (a million-dollar business).

Three Austrians and a German met on the motorway between Vienna and Graz in the first half of 2014. The three involved in Bitpanda met on the border between Lower Austria and Styria. After talking for over two hours they established the company within weeks of their meeting.

Berlin Barcelona Dublin Krakow London Madrid Milan and Amsterdam are among the offices of the once small startup but Vienna remains its headquarters. Today the company is based in the Prater near where Demuth and Klanschek met for the first time just a couple hundred meters away. “It was late 2013” Klanschek recalls. It had been six months since I launched something but I had failed. Eric was at university when I met him.”

It was virtually unheard of at the time to even hear about Bitcoin. We found buying cryptocurrencies to be time-consuming exhausting and risky. Mt.Gox a rudimentary exchange that ceased trading in early 2014 was the only place to send money to Japan. Demuth and Klanschek became acquainted with Bitcoin in the online poker community where money transfers are shared.

Hewlett Packard Enterprise owns two buildings on the Fort Collins campus totaling 580000 square feet. Christopher Wood/BizWest

Sixty years after Hewlett-Packard Co. employees first began moving into Building A on the company’s new Loveland campus in October 1962 the company that once grew to employ more than 9000 workers in Loveland Fort Collins and Greeley does not have the presence that it once did.

Today HP’s successor companies — Hewlett-Packard Enterprise Co. (NYSE: HPE) and HP Inc. (NYSE: HPQ) — occupy 580000 square feet in Fort Collins with HPE employing 800 people. (HP Inc. did not respond to requests for information.)

But HP’s legacy extends far beyond that footprint from spinoff companies that continue to employ thousands of workers to the real estate that HP left behind.

SPONSORED CONTENT Business Cares: May 2024 As Mental Health Awareness Month unfolds in Colorado it serves as a reminder of the collective responsibility to prioritize mental well-being.

Much of the Fort Collins campus is now owned by Broadcom which essentially is a spinoff of a spinoff i.e. HP’s spinoff of Agilent Technologies Inc. which then sold its Semiconductor Products Group to an investment group creating Avago Technologies Inc. which acquired Broadcom in 2015.

No HP employees remain at the Loveland site where it all started but another spinoff of a spinoff — Keysight Technologies Inc. (NYSE: KEYS) which grew out of Agilent in 2014 — maintains an operation there.

In Greeley nothing remains of an HP operation that was once the center of the city’s nascent tech sector.

HP’s three Northern Colorado campuses have witnessed far different fates since the company began divesting local operations and selling local properties with tech remaining the driving force in Fort Collins and tech and manufacturing enjoying a resurgence at what was the Loveland campus. Greeley however has seen demolition of the long-vacant HP building with the bulk of the acreage transformed for residential retail and other uses.

Loveland

Hewlett-Packard Co.’s history in Northern Colorado began in Loveland but it almost didn’t start that way. Loveland had to compete with Boulder for an HP expansion but problems with potential Boulder sites — and a strong pitch from Loveland civic and business leaders — prompted Colorado native David Packard and other HP executives to select Loveland instead according to an HP Computer Museum post on the history of the Loveland plant.

The plant — with a temporary building opening in 1960 and the first permanent building in 1962 — initially produced power supplies but eventually began producing desktop computers and calculators. HP’s Loveland operation also produced a variety of computer peripherals including printers and instruments such as voltmeters.

The campus — on the northeast corner of South Taft Avenue and 14th Street Southwest — remained a bastion for HP’s global operations for decades but change began in the late 1990s.

HP spun off Agilent in 1998 and by 2005 only 500 people remained at the Loveland site according to the HP Computer Museum.

The Thompson School District acquired one building on the former HP/Agilent campus in 2004 an 88000-square-foot building at 800 S. Taft Ave. that was formerly home to Colorado Memory Systems Inc. which built the structure in 1984. Colorado Memory Systems was founded by former HP employee Bill Bierwaltes. The company manufactured computer tape backup systems and was acquired by HP in 1992.

The school district purchased the building for $4.7 million and now uses it for its headquarters.

Just to the east is Keysight Technologies at 900 S. Taft Ave. Keysight spun off from Agilent in 2014 developing test and measurement equipment.

Keysight’s Loveland building encompasses more than 139000 square feet.

Kari Fauber vice president of Keysight’s global partner sales and ecommerce told BizWest in an email that the Loveland facility is “primarily a research and development site but also hosts teams from legal sales marketing finance logistics and services.

“Keysight delivers advanced design and validation solutions that help accelerate innovation to connect and secure the world” she said. “Keysight’s dedication to speed and precision extends to software-driven insights and analytics that bring tomorrow’s technology products to market faster across the development lifecycle in design simulation prototype validation automated software testing manufacturing analysis and network performance optimization and visibility in enterprise service provider and cloud environments.”

Keysight’s customers span the worldwide communications and industrial ecosystems aerospace and defense automotive energy semiconductor and general electronics markets Fauber said.

Keysight also maintains operations in Colorado Springs and Boulder. It acquired Eggplant Software Inc. with U.S. headquarters in Boulder in 2020 for $330 million.

Keysight employs 14300 worldwide and employed about 300 people in Loveland at the time of the spinoff from Agilent. The company recorded revenue of $4.94 billion in 2021.

With Agilent’s retrenchment in Loveland the company negotiated a deal in May 2011 to sell the bulk of the Loveland campus to the city for $5.8 million.

Plans to revitalize the campus were ambitious with the Colorado Association of Manufacturing and Technology eventually selecting the site in June 2011 for an Aerospace and Clean Energy Manufacturing and Innovation Park known as ACE. The project was touted as creating up to 10000 jobs.

But the proposal faltered early on with developer United Properties withdrawing from the project in August 2011 citing unattainable timelines.

Loveland then selected Bowling Green Kentucky-based developer Cumberland and Western to develop the property with the city selling the property to the company for $5 million.

Plans for the ACE park formally ended in March when CAMT withdrew from the project.

Even before that Cumberland and Western had rebranded the site as the Rocky Mountain Center for Innovation and Technology.

Cumberland and Western invested in upgrades to the property including some tenant finishes and successfully lured Lightning eMotors Inc. (NYSE: ZEV) as a tenant. In April 2016 Cumberland and Western announced that EWI a Columbus Ohio-based organization that promotes manufacturing technologies would open an applied research center at RMCIT.

But it all wasn’t enough and Cumberland and Western opted through commercial brokerage CBRE to put the property on the market for $22.8 million in October 2020.

Loveland site sells rebrands

Cumberland and Western eventually found its buyer although not for the full asking price. In late October 2020 a group of local business owners led by Jay Dokter Josh Kamrath and Dan Kamrath purchased the 811000-square-foot property for $15.5 million under the entity RMCIT LLC.

Dokter CEO of Loveland-based Vergent Products Inc. and his partners began working to increase occupancy from an anemic 16%.

The new owners quickly got to work rebranding the property as the Forge Campus in March 2021.

“We just observed all of the potential that didn’t happen and thought ‘We could do that’” Dokter said. “What we saw was 40 to 50 companies in here collocated creating an innovative tech environment. And the price was right too. So we knew that it wasn’t as risky. We also saw building prices were going up for a lot of commercial.”

Cumberland and Western’s initial approach to the property was to secure a single large occupant Dokter said.

“I think there was a fair amount of activity. They seemed to be going more for the grand slam one occupant and that market is extremely limited” he said adding that Cumberland did refocus to allow smaller companies in.

The vision of Dokter and his partners was clear from the beginning: Create an environment in which occupants would build an innovation ecosystem interacting and feeding off of one another.

The owners moved one of their own companies into the Forge — Bongo which provides video-assessment solutions for experiential learning. The investors also plan to relocate another of their companies Vergent Products a contract design and manufacturing company into the facility within a couple of years.

Dokter said one of the key advantages of the Loveland property was the maintenance that Cumberland and Western provided for almost a decade.

Often vacant properties are allowed to decay with damage by weather vandalism and neglect. Not so with the Loveland site. Cumberland and Western continued to employ a team of one part-time worker and three full-time workers to maintain the property and conduct real estate tours.

“The cool thing with Cumberland and Western is that they spent a lot of money maintaining the property” Dokter said. “I never forget the first time I came here to get a tour … there was a nice man waxing the floor over here in an empty building — one of those machines that go back and forth in an empty building. That impressed me that it was quite preserved.”

“Big buildings like this you don’t just shut the lights off and walk away” said Rob Blauvelt property manager for the Forge and one of the full-time workers who maintained the property during the Cumberland and Western years.

Cumberland and Western maintained a contract for upkeep of the 22 acres of roof. Landscaping was maintained although at a lower level than when the property was occupied. Cracks in parking lots were filled. HVAC systems were maintained.

“It was three and a half people watching an empty building for 11 years” Dokter said.

The property’s 16% occupancy at the time of purchase included 12 tenants but that number has doubled to 24. Another five tenants are housed on-site in The Warehouse accelerator a nonprofit organization that occupies 48000 square feet of donated space.

Allison Seabeck executive director of The Warehouse said the organization has three alumni members and three off-site members along with the five onsite members.

A capital campaign has raised $1.1 million out of a $4.8 million capital raise allowing the organization to add a staff member and proceed through Phase I of its construction plan creating space for nine companies.

Phase II of the capital campaign entails raising another $1.25 millon including $750000 to create space for 15 more companies including installation of a series of “garage pods” in the accelerator space providing turnkey manufacturing space for startups that need access to manufacturing floor space equipment ample power compressed air and other features.

Future expansions will include further buildout including community space a training room additional equipment a share marketing studio and other amenities.

Including The Warehouse occupancy at the Forge stands at 54% Dokter said with other leases pending.

One recent addition is Veloce Energy Inc. a Los Angeles-based company that produces modular devices to make electrification easier.

Veloce moved its Colorado location from north Fort Collins into the Forge campus in May. The company employs 12 people locally.

Additionally E.I. Medical Imaging a trade name for OrcaWest Holdings Inc. will move into the Forge. E.I. Medical Imaging develops real-time ultrasound devices for use by veterinarians and livestock producers.

Lightning eMotors which Cumberland and Western first brought to the site has expanded rapidly growing from 142386 square feet when Dokter and his team acquired the property to 250000 square feet and 260 employees. The company provides commercial electric vehicles for fleets and went public in 2021.

The Forge thus far has a mix of large clean-tech and other manufacturing companies.

“They’re more complimentary than you would think” Dokter said of the tenant mix. “That is the whole idea. We want to do more and more mixing and explaining who does what.”

With Vergent Products Dokter already has two clients within the Forge with another three potential clients. That cross-pollination can be seen among other tenants as well he said.

One additional amenity will foster even more interaction: The Forge soon will reopen the old HP cafeteria bringing a variety of local restaurant and catering companies in to provide a mix of dining options.

Blauvelt stressed the quality of the construction that is attractive for potential manufacturers.

“What you have here are structurally sound buildings with solid floors with a massive amount of power a massive amount of heating and cooling water a good amount of compressed air infrastructure for process vacuum … and you have a campus that’s just inviting as a workplace” Blauvelt said.

“This thing has awesome bones” he added “and it’s really easy to fit a business into here. It’s not very challenging to fit a complex operation into this space.”

And that 22 acres of roofs? Future plans call for installation of solar panels further emphasizing the site’s focus on clean technologies.

Stability characterizes Fort Collins site

No city in Northern Colorado has maintained as much of HP’s legacy operations as has Fort Collins a site that opened in 1978 and employed as many as 3200 HP workers at its peak.

In fact HP — both Hewlett Packard Enterprise and HP Inc. — remain prominent employers on the campus located on the northeast corner of East Harmony and Ziegler roads — with HP Inc. leasing space within Hewlett Packard Enterprise’s two buildings on 71.5 acres.

Hewlett Packard Enterprise’s operations there employ 800 workers and are varied.

Hewlett Packard Enterprise and HP Inc. continue to maintain a significant presence in Fort Collins. Christopher Wood/BizWest

“The Fort Collins site houses a range of business units and functions — from servers to R&D to marketing. It’s a multi-use facility and not dedicated to any specific part of the company” Adam Bauer a spokesman for HPE said in an email to BizWest.

The Fort Collins campus sits on the East Harmony Road corridor the focal point of a cluster of high-tech companies that includes Broadcom Intel Corp. Advanced Micro Devices and others. “Certainly having other tech players with whom we partner and do business in close proximity helps create an ecosystem that is mutually beneficial” he said. “That’s true in Fort Collins Silicon Valley Houston — everywhere we have a large presence.”

Bauer said that Fort Collins “is an important location for HPE and again is host to a range of business units and functions that span the company. It remains one of our biggest employment hubs in the U.S. and is an important part of our history. We do not anticipate any change to Fort Collins’ role in the company at this time. We actually are in the process of renovating the site to accommodate our hybrid Edge-to-Office working model that arose out of the pandemic.”

HPE leases space to HP Inc. which did not respond to BizWest requests for comment. The city of Fort Collins estimates that HP Inc. employs 1100 local workers but that number could not be verified.

HPE in April 2019 sold a building on the Fort Collins campus — at 3420 E. Harmony Road — to an entity owned by McWhinney Real Estate Services Inc. of Loveland for $21 million. Bauer declined to speculate on any plans to sell additional properties.

“We continuously evaluate our real estate portfolio based on a variety of criteria including usage opportunities for cost optimization and other factors” he said. “I can’t speculate on future real estate transactions.”

The McWhinney building is largely vacant although fully leased. Madwire formerly occupied the third floor and a first-floor gym space but the company has put the space on the sublease market although it continues to pay rent.

Additionally Comcast Corp. (Nasdaq: CMCSA) has vacated 80000 square feet within the building. The company had opened a call center in 2016 with plans to house up to 600 employees.

But those plans changed in September 2019 when the company announced closure of the operation. Comcast’s lease expires in 2027 with the space put up for sublease.

A federal contractor based in Maryland ASRC or Arctic Slope Regional Corp. leased 31000 square feet of the Comcast space in August 2020. The company operates as a contractor to federal intelligence aerospace and health-care information-technology agencies.

Micro Focus a spinoff of Hewlett Packard Enterprise occupies about 16000 square feet in the building.

Peter Kast a broker with CBRE who is listing space in the building for sublease said the campus and other corners of East Harmony and Ziegler roads benefit from infrastructure put in place to serve HP.

“If you look at it from an infrastructure point of view it’s one of the few places in town that has redundant fiber and redundant fiber so people like this that have needs for those kinds of things there’s not that many choices so in terms of an infrastructure location it’s great” he said.

He noted that HPE HP Broadcom Intel AMD and other high-tech companies in the area capitalize on a concentration of skilled workers.

“The thing that’s so attractive about Fort Collins for these guys is the intellectual capital the people who do this kind of work who are trained to handle whether it’s software or hardware design” he said. “We’ve got a ton of people who do chip design in this town.”

The biggest player in that space locally is Broadcom which has continued to invest in its Fort Collins operation. Although the city of Fort Collins estimates that Broadcom employs 1150 workers locally the company told BizWest in 2019 that it employed 1747 including 1313 employees and 434 contingent workers.

Broadcom owns a large swathe of the former HP campus with its predecessor Avago completing several major expansions.

The company in its most-recent quarterly report filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission cited ongoing supply-chain disruptions brought on by the COVID-19 pandemic and highlighted the importance of the Fort Collins operation.

“We have been and expect to continue experiencing some disruption to parts of our global semiconductor supply chain including procuring necessary components and inputs such as wafers and substrates in a timely fashion with suppliers increasing lead times or placing products on allocation and raising prices” the company reported noting shutdowns at key suppliers and service providers around the world.

“Any similar disruption at our Fort Collins Colorado manufacturing facility would severely impact our ability to manufacture our film bulk acoustic resonator (“FBAR”) products and adversely affect our wireless business” the company said.

Despite those challenges Broadcom HP and related companies remain key components of the Fort Collins economy.

SeonAh Kendall senior economic manager for the city of Fort Collins said Hewlett Packard Broadcom and other companies in the East Harmony Road corridor are “going strong.”

“We are seeing that they’re kind of staying in the area and growing with spinoffs in there as well” she said. “I do think that it is a critical piece for us in terms of the employment as well as the contributions that the companies as well as employees have in our community.

“There are opportunities for additional growth in those locations” she added “and opportunities for a lot of collaboration. I think one of the greatest strengths is that we’re able to retain the talent here. Sometimes we have seen folks leave AMD and go to Intel or leave Intel and go to HP and vice versa.”

She noted that companies in the area work closely with Colorado State University Front Range Community College and the Poudre School District on issues such as talent and retention.

Greeley facility sees different fate

Greeley’s Hewlett-Packard facility was the last to be built the first to close and the only one to be torn down — at least most of it.

The facility opened in 1984 focused on scanners tape drives and other devices but HP closed the operation in 2003 shifting what was then 800 workers to other locations. About 640 workers were transferred to Fort Collins with another 165 shifting to Flextronics International Ltd. Flextronics purchased DII Group Inc. which was buying HP’s tape-storage manufacturing business.

HP put the property on the market and seemed to attract widespread interest at first including for a potential expansion of Aims Community College. But that and other deals fell through prompting HP to sell the building to a group of local investors. HP sold the 355000-square-foot property on 157 acres in August 2004 to Boomerang Properties LLC headed by local investors Bruce Deifik and Jeff Bedingfield a Greeley attorney. The purchase price was $8 million far lower than HP’s $14 million asking price.

“Up to this point HP has not been willing to divide the property or divide the facility” Bedingfield told the Northern Colorado Business Report a predecessor to BizWest in August 2004. “Their desire is to sell everything and let the buyer determine how best to use it.”

Boomerang intended to subdivide the HP building to support perhaps four smaller tenants.

“There’s been a lot of talk that you can’t get big blocks leased that the best thing is to bulldoze the facility” Bedingfield said in 2004. “It’s too fine of a facility to begin talking about any kind of changes to that place other than demising it into large blocks.”

But the new owners also envisioned that surrounding acreage would be transformed into residential neighborhoods retail centers and office uses.

The project soon was taken over by City Center West LP a Denver development company affiliated with Westside Investment Partners Inc. which acquired the building and adjacent acreage for $8.36 million in 2007. Some holdings were owned and developed under the umbrella of BV Retail Land Holdings LLP.

City Center West began selling acreage for retail residential and other uses:

In 2011 the company sold 12 acres to a North Colorado Medical Center/Banner Health entity for $2.34 million. Banner continues to own the vacant land.

In 2014 City Center West launched a commercial development on the northeast corner of 71st Avenue and West 10th Street eventually adding a Bank of Colorado branch McDonald’s Breeze Thru Car Wash and a Les Schwab tire center.

Developers of a self-storage facility purchased land along 71st Avenue. That property now houses Boomerang Self Storage.

A chunk of the HP building — the cafeteria and events center — was redeveloped into the West Ridge Academy at 6905 Eighth St.

City Center West continues to own residential land on the former HP campus but sold the remaining vacant building and some acreage to LaSalle Investors LLC a unit of Waltel Cos. Inc. LaSalle demolished the remaining HP building preparing the site for future development.

But the company faces opposition to plans to rezone the property from Industrial – Low Intensity to Residential – High Density. About 10 neighboring residents voiced opposition to the rezoning request at a June 7 Greeley City Council meeting.

Residents voiced fears that LaSalle planned to build a large apartment complex on the property which they said could exacerbate existing traffic problems.

Several City Council members also voiced opposition to the R-H zoning preferring a less-intensive Residential – Medium Density zoning.

“It’s just too intense right now” Councilman Dale Hall said. “I’m uncomfortable making this R-H. I’m OK with Residential Medium Intensity.”

In the end LaSalle’s attorney asked that the council continue the discussion to the July 19 City Council meeting.

Greeley’s westward expansion

Why Greeley’s HP facility faced such a different outcome than campuses in Fort Collins and Loveland can be attributed to a variety of factors.

First the technology sector in Greeley has never developed to the scale of Fort Collins’ or Loveland which enjoy closer proximity to Colorado State University. Even before HP’s closure Greeley had seen the departure of home-grown printed-circuit-board manufacturer EFTC Corp. founded in Greeley as Electronic Fab Technology Corp. which left for the north Denver suburbs.

But the greatest factor seems to be the pattern of Greeley’s residential and commercial growth which has pushed inexorably westward for several decades.

Benjamin Snow director of economic health and housing for the city of Greeley said the area around “the core of the apple” meaning the HP building has transformed.

HP’s Greeley facility was once on the city’s outskirts with little nearby retail and far less residential development.

“When you look at what’s happened over the last 10 years out there it has sort of defaulted to what I would describe as typical suburban growth” Snow said pointing to the King Soopers and other retail development across 10th Street as well as retail and residential projects on former HP land surrounding the building.

He noted that for years he and his predecessors in the economic-development community sought to preserve the industrial zoning for the building as a way to balance the city’s housing stock with a solid employment center.

“It just never took” he said. “We never could get a secondary use in there … At some point you have to listen to the market signals.”

Although many potential users toured the facility one obstacle he said was that the building had fallen into disrepair.

“Once people went in because that building essentially had been neglected and abandoned for so long … it was kind of a magnet for that kind of vandalism. There was evidence that people were inside the building at different times.”

“Greeley has tried for 20 years to get some industrial users to reinhabit to reanimate that building to no avail” he said.

The elite schools took $10 million from 2017 to 2023 from entities within the “State of Palestine” according to the analysis by Open the Books a Republican-owned nonprofit dedicated to revealing government spending.

Brown University Harvard University and non-Ivy Indiana University of Pennsylvania are among the schools to accept funding from donors located in the nation that technically doesn’t exist at least by UN standards.

The “State of Palestine” is not a recognized entity by the United Nations or the US — though some 140 countries do officially recognize it.

3 Brown University in February 2020 received a $643000 gift from the Munib and Angela Masri Foundation based in the West Bank.

Brown University in February 2020 received a $643000 gift from a foundation located within the “State of Palestine” to create a professorship in Palestinian Studies as part of the college’s Middle East Studies program according to federal disclosures reviewed by Open the Books.

Though the financial filing does not disclose the donor’s name Brown previously said the money was gifted by the Munib and Angela Masri Foundation based in the West Bank.

Nine different donors — including multiple Brown alumni and the foundation — came together to fund the “Mahmoud Darwish Professorship in Palestinian Studies” according to a 2020 press release.

Meanwhile Harvard took in $1.6 million from donors within the “State of Palestine” and the Indiana University of Pennsylvania received $6.4 million from entities within the “State of Palestine” and another $900000 from a donor from “Palestinian Territory Occupied” according to the review of the financial disclosure documents.

The donors are not identified in the filings. Harvard previously said that monies it received from Palestinian donors in 2017 2018 and 2019 did not come from the Palestinian Authority though the Ivy League would not disclose the donor names in a 2020 news report.

Most of the money helped pay for Palestinian students from the occupied territories to receive an education at American universities according to the filings.

They were often reported as “payment of tuition and fees for students from Palestine. Funds are also utilized to pay for educational-related expenses incurred by the university for these students through their enrollment in this program” the documents state according to Open the Books.

Indiana University of Pennsylvania received at least $2.3 million from the West Bank-based Arab American University to cover the tuition and other expenses for Palestinian students attending the US college according to the same 2020 report.

In addition to the funding the US universities have had ongoing relationships with universities in the West Bank.

Brown’s inaugural professor of Palestinian Studies Beshara Doumani was granted permission to simultaneously serve as the president of Birzeit University in the West Bank for two years.

The Palestinian university was criticized after its Union of Professors and Employees penned an op-ed days after Hamas’ deadly Oct. 7 attack stating “2023 will be recorded historically as the year that Palestinians stood boldly in the face of colonial fascism and screamed in defense of their homes humanity and lives.”

For its part Indiana University of Pennsylvania offers business Ph.D. and master’s programs in partnership with Arab American University.

During her confirmation hearing in 2022 Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson introduced herself to Congress as an originalist. This surprising move from a presumptively liberal justice signified to many the triumph of originalism as the accepted methodology of the Supreme Court. Jackson was following in the footsteps of Justice Elena Kagan who famously declared that “we are all originalists now” during her own confirmation.

Kagan however came to regret that quip after watching her conservative colleagues implement a series of GOP policy preferences in the name of applying the Constitution’s “original” meaning which is what originalism claims to be. She is surely not the only progressive with second thoughts: The legal left’s embrace of originalism was a major influential development in the 12 years between Kagan’s and Jackson’s elevation to the court—one that’s arguably waning today despite Jackson’s appointment. After three terms of precedent-smashing activism by the Supreme Court’s 6–3 conservative supermajority almost always under the banner of originalism the methodology looks more intellectually bankrupt manipulable and dangerous than ever.

Some liberals have responded with accusations that this supermajority peddles “fauxriginalism” cherry-picking history to fit Republicans’ favored results. This allegation is certainly true but doesn’t answer the underlying question: Is it even a good idea to concede that the “original meaning” of the Constitution—even if it could be reliably ascertained—is the authoritative one? Jackson’s approach illustrates the benefits and risks of trying to beat originalists at their own game from the left. And with each passing term the payoff looks smaller and smaller.

For progressives the problems begin with the origin of the theory. Conservative scholars politicians and activists developed the idea of originalism in response to Brown v. Board of Education—yes the decision that desegregated public school—arguing that the Framers of the 14th Amendment would never have intended to integrate public education. They may have been right about that claim: The same Congress that proposed the 14th Amendment in 1866 segregated the District of Columbia’s public schools while a supermajority of states that ratified the amendment also strictly separated education by race. That doesn’t mean the push toward integration was the wrong move for our country and our 20th-century understanding of what equal rights ought to mean legally. Regardless in the coming decades the burgeoning conservative legal movement refined and pushed the theory to combat other contested Supreme Court decisions including Roe v. Wade Griswold v. Connecticut (birth control) Miranda v. Arizona (self-incrimination) Reynolds v. Sims (malapportionment) and Regents v. Bakke (affirmative action).

Today originalism is the house style of the Federalist Society the lavishly funded network of conservative lawyers who provide intellectual cover for the Republican Party’s preferred policies. It’s propounded to some degree by all six conservative justices who have placed it at the center of their continual smash-and-grab campaign against progressive precedent. When the Supreme Court overruled Roe its justification boiled down to a single claim: Abortion was largely illegal when the 14th Amendment was ratified so it may still be criminalized today. When the court established a new right to carry guns in public it deployed the same reasoning: People could allegedly carry guns in public when the Second Amendment was ratified so they have a right to do so today. And when the court struck down affirmative action? Same story: The original meaning of the equal protection clause requires the law to be “colorblind” the court declared.

This last decision gave Jackson an opportunity to flaunt her skills as a progressive originalist as did an earlier case designed to gut the Voting Rights Act’s remnants. In both she delivered: The justice drew heavily upon the work of historians like Eric Foner who reject the “colorblind” conception of the 14th Amendment in favor of a nuanced interpretation that allows for “race-conscious” remedies to protect minorities’ equal citizenship. Jackson pitched this theory in a lengthy monologue during oral arguments in the voting rights case—her second day on the bench—as if to warn her conservative colleagues that their bogus originalism would no longer go unchallenged. And perhaps her shaming strategy worked since the court ultimately delivered an unlikely victory for the Voting Rights Act.

Jackson’s approach here echoed the work of advocacy groups that seek to employ originalism for progressive ends most prominently the well-respected Constitutional Accountability Center. The goal here is to engage with conservative judges on their own turf demonstrating that their own methodology would actually yield a liberal result if they did it honestly. In short these advocates try to out-originalist the originalists. And on select topics the tactic can work marvels. Race is one example since the conservative fixation with a “colorblind” Constitution so obviously contradicts the historical record. Federal power is another since the Framers clearly gave Congress sweeping powers to regulate commerce. (That’s why Jackson’s most important majority opinion so far is an originalist defense of Congress’ ability to create private rights through its spending power.) Many protections for criminal defendants too like the right to trial by jury and the guarantee against self-incrimination have strong historical foundations.

Other liberties treasured by progressives however do not end up saved by progressive originalism. The Supreme Court’s historical analysis in Dobbs may have been sloppy and inaccurate but that doesn’t change the fact that there’s no evidence Americans thought the 14th Amendment safeguarded abortion back in the 1860s when it was written. Selectively deploying originalism when it bolsters progressive aims does not solve the underlying problem: that as Hawaii Supreme Court Justice Todd Eddins has put it the theory champions the views of “the few white men who made laws and shaped lives during the mostly racist and misogynistic very old days.” This flaw may be most pronounced in cases involving the civil rights of those whom the authors of the Constitution scorned or ignored.

Consider for instance a group of people who were excluded from the political process—indeed from public life—when the 14th Amendment was ratified: women. Sex equality is rooted in the amendment’s equal protection clause which became law in 1868. During this period though in most of the country women had virtually no rights at all. Married women could not own property sign contracts or file lawsuits under the doctrine of “coverture” which subsumed their legal identity into that of their husband. Men could legally beat their wives under the doctrine of chastisement which allowed for “moderate” physical violence in the home. As one court put it in 1868 while upholding the acquittal of a man who whipped his wife the judiciary could “not interfere with family government in trifling cases.” (This history suddenly became relevant when the lower courts struck down a law barring domestic abusers from possessing firearms.)

Conservative litigants are not even shy about citing this evidence when defending discriminatory laws. South Carolina placed it front and center when arguing for same-sex marriage bans in 2015. The state cited congressional debates over the 14th Amendment’s impact on coverture laws that denied women equal citizenship. At the time of the amendment’s adoption some congressmen fretted that the new amendment might restrict the ability of states to discriminate against women. Contemporaneous comments from the primary author of the 14th Amendment himself Rep. John Bingham assured them that the new promise of equality would not interfere with state control over “domestic relations.” His comments reflected a broad consensus from the time reflected in the congressional record that the amendment would not establish equality or even a baseline of civil rights for women. (South Carolina cited this history to show that discrimination against both women and gay people remained constitutional by the way.) If the Supreme Court adopted this reading of the equal protection clause it would have to overturn every past ruling against sex discrimination making husbands the “head and master” of their households once again.

Progressive originalists generally respond to this obstacle by defining rights at a higher level of generality. The Constitutional Accountability Center for example argues that the equal protection clause forbids discrimination against women and gay people by outlawing “class-based” legislation. By denying rights to an entire group of people the theory goes the government condemns them to second-class status stamping them with an impermissible badge of legal inferiority.

It’s a fine idea—but is it really originalism? The answer probably depends on whether you want to salvage originalism or supplant it. If you want to salvage it then sure: It’s perfectly acceptable to define rights so broadly on such an abstract level that they can be squared with the “original meaning” of the Constitution. As George Washington University law professor Peter J. Smith has persuasively argued that is in fact precisely what today’s conservatives already do when mounting an originalist defense of Brown v. Board of Education. Evidence that the 14th Amendment’s Framers supported school segregation is overwhelming. So Brown’s defenders on the right define “equal protection” with sufficient abstraction to mandate integrated public education.

Should progressives want to salvage originalism though? Why step in to shore up a flailing theory that was born out of contempt for Black children women and criminal defendants? A theory that the Supreme Court is currently manipulating to impose conservative policy goals like nationwide public carry under the thin guise of judicial review?

Because originalist justices like Clarence Thomas are so incredibly bad at interpreting history cherry-picking facts and crediting debunked sources it may be tempting to conclude that they’re just doing it wrong. But why do it at all? The strong argument for progressive originalism is the hope that advocates can convince conservative judges to issue liberal decisions if they just present enough historical evidence. That hope feels increasingly hollow. When Thomas is presented with proof that his past views were rooted in bogus history he simply dismisses it. Activist scholars flood the nation’s law journals which are not peer-reviewed with tendentious or outright false historical claims which conservative justices then cite as the gospel truth. This is less like a legitimate judicial or academic enterprise than like a scam to reverse-engineer outcomes to fit a partisan agenda. Pointing out inaccuracies is not going to change the outcomes.

With originalism’s reputation so tarnished maybe progressives should stop co-opting the right’s brand altogether. Maybe they should embrace constitutional values like equality without squeezing them into a framework that was literally designed to shut out minorities from full citizenship. Maybe rather than trying to beat conservatives at their own game progressives should present a competing vision of constitutional interpretation to the public—one which acknowledges that original meaning is often unknowable and too frequently shackled to the antiquated views of dead white men. And maybe that would give disillusioned Americans a reason to believe in the rule of law once again.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMihgFodHRwczovL3d3dy5mb3JtdWxhMS5jb20vZW4vbGF0ZXN0L2FydGljbGUvYmV5b25kLXRoZS1ncmlkLXphay1icm93bi1vbi1ob3ctaGVzLWluc3RpbGxlZC1hLXdpbm5pbmctbWVudGFsaXR5LWF0LjgyaGZxSWVsa0VxU1lyakVLSnBsctIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Zak Brown on instilling a winning mentality at McLaren,"McLaren are back on top of the Formula 1 podium after Lando Norris's stunning Miami victory but their mission is far from accomplished yet as this week's Beyond The Grid guest Zak Brown points out.

Ltd. - about-drinks.com,"Royal Unibrew has entered into an agreement to acquire 100% of the Toronto-based company Amsterdam Brewery Co. Ltd. The Canadian craft brewing company Amsterdam Brewery Co. Ltd. was founded 1986 and is based in Toronto and is a large-scale craft brewery with a potential to increase both capabilities and capacities during the coming years.

CEO of Royal Unibrew Lars Jensen says “the acquisition we are doing today is very important for the future growth of Royal Unibrew in the Americas region. We are adding capacity in Canada which is also close to our US business and over time we expect to serve most of Canada and partly US from Amsterdam Brewery Co. Ltd. which will reduce transportation costs and our CO2 footprint. On top of that we will service the market much better and thereby protect ourselves against out of stock and transport congestions which have increased significantly the last 18 months. Further we will free up capacity on our current facilities in Denmark which will postpone certain capex needs”.

Our export business model in the Americas has grown over recent years but is currently challenged by high freight costs and longer and more unpredictable logistical supply chains. The export business model has had natural limitations on both breadth and depth of the offered product portfolio and local production capacity will make us a more flexible supplier.

From a product portfolio point of view Amsterdam Brewery Co. Ltd. is bringing a more premium offering to our current above mainstream portfolio in Canada and in particularly in Ontario which is the largest region for our business in Canada. Further Amsterdam Brewery Co. Ltd. has a solid position in On-Trade in Toronto both through two own operated Brewpub restaurants and through traditional On-Trade outlets which we believe will bring further synergies during the coming years.

The acquisition is also supporting our sustainability strategy as it will reduce our CO2 footprint significantly by reducing the transportation needs for products sold in the US and Canada.

The acquisition of Amsterdam Brewery Co. Ltd. is based on an enterprise value of CAD 44 million (around DKK 300 million) on a debt free basis. Amsterdam Brewery Co. Ltd. has normalized revenue of around CAD 34 million (around DKK 200 million) and a normalised annual EBITDA of around CAD 5 million (around DKK 28 million).

The acquisition is expected to be EPS accretive within the first year of ownership parts of the benefits will only be harvested after some investments have been made.

Closing is expected to take place during Q3/2022 and is only subject to customary closing preparations.

Beyond the intoxicating whirligig of casinos concerts and costumed performers local neighbourhoods are blooming with street art while hiking trails offer desert vistas.

This article was adapted from National Geographic Traveller (UK).

Las Vegas is a monument to human ingenuity and vice; capitalist performance art let loose in the outer reaches of the Mojave Desert; a neon-lit oasis existing solely to entertain us. Each year up to 40 million people visit the city of just 635000 residents that’s home to the world’s biggest tourist trap: the Strip. Many travellers might feel predisposed to dislike Sin City for its brashness its lurid aesthetic its populist appeal — but I find its unique brew of hedonism and heart intoxicating.



My first stop is the residential Arts District. In March 2020 when casinos on the Strip were closed for an record six weeks in response to the pandemic the focus shifted to other neighbourhoods. Consequentially here and in Downtown local artists were hired to paint murals. Today Frida Kahlo smiles down on me on a Main Street full of small businesses including craft breweries and vintage clothes shops. Many Americans are now moving to Vegas; it’s not just the sunshine good salaries and affordable housing that lure them but the thriving culinary scene and community feel.



The Vegas that most visitors flock to is the Strip a cartoonish theme park of a boulevard serving up a sensory overload. As a blonde American gondolier sings to me beautifully in Italian as she paddles me around The Venetian Las Vegas hotel it dawns on me: this place isn’t meant to be authentic; it’s a world of make-believe.



But that doesn’t mean there aren’t real thrills to be had. At dusk I drink delicious cocktails covered in glittery pop rocks at a bar made to look like a fantasy facsimile of 19th-century Europe; I watch The Beatles LOVE by Cirque du Soleil and am brought to tears by its intensity; then almost as a rite of passage I forfeit the contents of my purse to a slot machine. There are worlds here to explore and when it comes time to leave I’ve barely scratched the surface.



To entice new people to visit and others to return Las Vegas continues to grow and change launching bigger casinos more exotic restaurants and sexier shows. Dozens of new attractions and events will open this week and dozens more the next. Vegas rolls with novelty and innovation and the house always wins.

See & do



Cruise The Strip at night: Where else can you find a pyramid-shaped hotel shooting a beam of light into space a shimmering half-size Eiffel Tower and a thousand dancing lit-up fountains all within a four-mile stroll? Join the throngs for the must-see most Vegasy part of Vegas: the Strip. The bridge linking the MGM Grand and New York-New York Hotel & Casino has some of the best views over the cacophony of neon lights. Next weave through audacious air-conditioned casinos where slot machines chortle and ping snapping photos with costumed staff — from feather-clad dancers to Roman legionaries.



See a show: There’s always something new on (Katy Perry Sting and Usher are some of the musicians set to perform this summer) but there are classic residencies too: opt for magician Criss Angel or the Blue Man Group for an evening to remember. The five Cirque du Soleil shows currently playing each at a different resort are unique to Vegas with over-the-top water-based O being the hottest ticket.



Experience Fremont Street: North of the Strip in Downtown this is the original gambling district — and it could easily feel like a 1970s time capsule but for that fact the world’s largest (1500ft long) video screen serves as a canopy covering all five blocks. The gambling and entertainment hub capitalises on the area’s seedy roots: here electric guitar players busk next to lingerie-clad women holding signs proclaiming ‘dances for cigarettes and vodka’. Continue east and you’ll come to the open-air section of the street the Fremont East District which brims with bars and restaurants.



Explore AREA15: Discover alternate universes at this vast immersive entertainment zone. They include Omega Mart a ‘supermarket’ where a fridge leads to an alien world of slides and staircases. Expand your mind in the mirror rooms of Wink World or head to Lost Spirits Distillery where an immersive distillery tour takes you through a recreation of 19th-century London. Next door newly opened Illuminarium offers virtual safaris undersea adventures and more via ‘video transport technology’.



Visit ‘foreign cities’: Las Vegas serves up the European dream in spades. Crooning gondoliers paddle punters past a replica Saint Mark’s Square at The Venetian Las Vegas while at the new Vanderpump à Paris restaurant at the Paris Las Vegas hotel settle into a belle époque sofa for cocktails served in Louvre Pyramid-shaped glasses. You can also time travel: sample ancient Rome at Caesars Palace or the era of the Egyptian pharaohs at the Luxor Hotel & Casino. For a conceptual hop across the US grab a drink at a corner bar off Times Square at the New York-New York Hotel & Casino.



Day trip to the Hoover Dam: This 726ft-high dam provides electricity to around 1.3 million households. Visit the Boulder City-Hoover Dam Museum before taking a tour of the inner workings of this engineering masterpiece. Adjacent Lake Mead has myriad tours from cruises on a Mississippi-style paddle steamer to kayaking. It’s all a 40-minute drive from the Strip.

Fergusons downtown: The rooms of this former motel host local artists and fashion designers as well as artisans selling handmade T-shirts soap and more. There’s also a cafe a regular pop-up craft market and the Vegas Test Kitchen where local chefs can try out their recipes during three-month residencies.



Shopping malls: Casino winners love to spend their spoils at high-roller malls like the Grande Canal Shoppes or The Shops at Crystal. Fashion Show Las Vegas is a mall for clothes hounds looking to dress to impress while at opposite ends of the city Las Vegas North and South Premium Outlets are where to go for brands from Prada to Levi’s.



The Writer’s Block: Need to get away from the lights and the hubbub of the Strip? There’s no better place than this bookshop with its floor-to-ceiling windows potted plants and aroma of freshly ground arabica wafting from the coffee shop.

Sleep



Golden Nugget: Lovers of kitsch will adore Fremont Street’s most distinctive hotel. Rooms are run-of-the-mill but amenities include a swimming pool surrounding a fish tank and one of the most lively and colourful casinos on the ground floor. Don’t stay here if sleep is a priority but fun is right on your doorstep.



Nobu Hotel at Caesars Palace: This sumptuous hotel is hidden away inside the massive bustling Caesars Palace making it feel like a secret and serene oasis. The Japanese aesthetic adds class and creativity to the good-value rooms.

ARIA Sky Suites: Superlative in both its physical height and luxury these ultra-modern apartment-sized suites offer a dedicated concierge service pool access and deluxe airport transfers. The expansive views over the city from the floor-to-ceiling windows in the bedroom dining and living rooms are postcard-perfect.

Eat



Famous Foods Street Eats: This globe-trotting food court has everything from sushi and fried chicken to authentic Southeast Asian noodle dishes. At night slip into the well-hidden speakeasy — the discrete entrance is behind a shelf lined with lucky cat figurines.



Esther’s Kitchen: When renowned chef James Trees opened his restaurant in the Arts District in 2018 people thought his choice of location was lunacy. But the food — simple Italian-inspired fare with a focus on fine ingredients — attracted so many accolades that Esther’s Kitchen sparked a wave of interest in the neighbourhood. Don’t miss the sourdough bread with a whipped basil ricotta topping.



Delilahs: Get your Great Gatsby on at this ritzy supper club where a diva belts out jazz tunes under crystal chandeliers to tables of finely dressed diners. The beef wellington is a rival to Gordon Ramsay’s and there’s a strict no-photo policy owing to the fact that many celebrities like to spend their evenings here.

After hours



Atomic Liquors: Opened in 1952 Las Vegas’s oldest bar was a favourite watering hole for workers at an atomic bomb test site 50 miles away. It’s said that nuclear explosions could be watched from the roof and it later became a hangout for the Rat Pack.



Lake of Dreams: At this surreal lakeside show at Wynn Las Vegas hop between three cocktail bars: the opulent Overlook Lounge Asia-inspired Bar Parasol and Aft Cocktail Deck which has superyacht vibes. The cocktails mixed here by Mariena Mercer Boarini are as creative as they are delicious and you’ll have the surreal perk of being serenaded across the lake by a giant mechanical frog.



Marquee Nightclub & Dayclub: Celebrity DJs spin EDM house and hip hop amid light shows to crowds of up to 5000 revellers dancing the night away. It morphs into a day club in the morning when the party rolls on in infinity pools and at an outdoor party deck.

Like a local



Take a hike: Las Vegas has outstanding desert hiking with many trailheads under an hour’s drive from Downtown. Try the 2.2-mile trail from Calico Tanks into Red Rock Canyon which winds over pink sandstone hills and ends at a magnificent viewpoint overlooking the Strip.



Chinatown: This three-mile stretch of Spring Mountain Road commonly known as Chinatown Vegas is lined with strip malls. But behind this shabby veneer are some of Vegas’s most interesting bars and restaurants. Head to kitschy The Golden Tiki where any drink can be set on fire for $1 (80p); the Sand Dollar Lounge for blues and occasional surprise performances by ZZ Top’s Billy Gibbons; or restaurants like Shanghai Taste for authentic xiao long bao.



Arts District: Covered with murals by local artists and famous for its monthly First Friday street festival which features live music and food trucks this up-and-coming neighbourhood is the place to go for craft beer art galleries and eclectic shops.

Usher is back in Las Vegas with “My Way: The Las Vegas Residency” at the Dolby Live at Park MGM and he's talking to “Extra” about this new show following a successful run with his first at the Colosseum at Caesars Palace.

Usher also opened up about his good friend Justin Bieber with whom he recently vacationed in Idaho after Justin's his Ramsay Hunt syndrome diagnosis.

“As an artist I think we are all going to experience some things that people may not necessarily understand"" Usher said referencing a performer's life being ""a life that comes with a great deal of pressure.""

He went on to say ""I think [Justin] has obviously taken the world on a journey. I am happy that I was at the beginning of and I am still a part of to this day as a friend.”

Revealing how Bieber is doing Usher said “He is doing great. Seeing him on vacation we managed to hang out with each other and I think that whatever he may be experiencing right now it’s actually really great to see that he has the support from his fans and his family.”

Usher is giving the fans ""My Way"" but the show is really their way. He said “It’s all about giving the ladies what they want to see you know? It’s about giving Vegas something they may not have experienced before... It’s a bit theatrical... So many things throughout my career — Broadway acting skating hit records dancing — I try to put all of those things into my show. I’ve played arenas and stadiums but to be here at Dolby Live theater and give them this intimate view of my music and also to share with them the things that I am passionate about and the places that I’ve gone… whether it’s the heat of the strip club or the intimacy of the moments that’s nice and slow… It’s all of that into one.”

Usher is also bringing roller skating to his Vegas stage! “It’s something that I have always loved and is authentically Atlanta culture… You listen to ‘Good Love.' We shot it in Atlanta at Cascade where I am at either on Sundays or Wednesdays when I am in Atlanta. It’s the culture. It’s the culture that I have always loved.”

He also said “As a kid being introduced by Ben Vereen to Gene Kelly he showed me these moments where he would skate and sing and dance and perform. It was this classical example of being a triple threat. I’ve always tried to weave that into my music — and I finally got a chance to do that.”

At home he is just ""Dad"" to his four kids — no star trips there! The father of sons Usher V 14 and Naviyd Eli 13 with ex Tameka Foster and of daughter Sovereign nearly 2 and son Sire nearly 1 with Jenn Goicoechea said “My kids are not concerned about what I am doing in Vegas. They got their own lives. They either playing basketball acting camp… my older kids. My younger babies they are swimming and they are having a good time with each other.""

Usher 43 is pleased to have children who range from teens to toddlers so ""they can teach each other. It helps my baby girl grow up and become a big girl and my son to understand how to walk.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMihwFodHRwczovL3d3dy5yZXZpZXdqb3VybmFsLmNvbS9lbnRlcnRhaW5tZW50L2VudGVydGFpbm1lbnQtY29sdW1ucy9rYXRzL2plbm5pZmVyLWxvcGV6LWJlbi1hZmZsZWNrLWVsb3BlLWluLWxhcy12ZWdhcy13ZS1kaWQtaXQtMjYwOTAyOC_SAYsBaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cucmV2aWV3am91cm5hbC5jb20vZW50ZXJ0YWlubWVudC9lbnRlcnRhaW5tZW50LWNvbHVtbnMva2F0cy9qZW5uaWZlci1sb3Blei1iZW4tYWZmbGVjay1lbG9wZS1pbi1sYXMtdmVnYXMtd2UtZGlkLWl0LTI2MDkwMjgvYW1wLw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Jennifer Lopez Ben Affleck elope in Las Vegas: ‘We did it’,"Jennifer Lopez right and Ben Affleck pose for photographers upon arrival at the premiere of the film 'The Last Duel' during the 78th edition of the Venice Film Festival in Venice Italy Friday Sept. 10 2021.

“Bennifer” have eloped in an overnight ceremony in Las Vegas.

Entertainment superstars Ben Affleck and Jennifer Lopez were married just after midnight Saturday at A Little White Wedding Chapel in downtown Las Vegas. Lopez shared videos photos and an essay about the fabled night.

“We did it” Lopez wrote in a message posted to her “On The Jlo” online newsletter. “Love is beautiful. Love is kind. And it turns out love is patient. Twenty years patient.”

The couple picked up their marriage license at 11:32 p.m. Saturday at Clark County Marriage License Bureau as confirmed Sunday morning by Clark County Clerk Lynn Goya.

The license was issued to Benjamin Geza Affleck and Jennifer Lopez who is also identified as Jennifer Affleck. The couple then trekked to A Little White Chapel established in 1951. The chapel has married about 800000 couples. Frank Sinatra and Mia Farrow Bruce Willis and Demi Moore Michael Jordan and Juanita Vanoy and Paul Newman and Joanne Woodward are among the stars to hold ceremonies at the chapel.

Lopez continued “Exactly what we wanted. Last night we flew to Vegas stood in line for a license with four other couples all making the same journey to the wedding capital of the world. Behind us two men held hands and held each other. In front of us a young couple who made the three-hour drive from Victorville on their daughter’s second birthday — all of us wanting the same thing — for the world to recognize us as partners and to declare our love to the world through the ancient and nearly universal symbol of marriage.”

Lopez said the couple barely made it to the chapel before it was scheduled to close at midnight. “They graciously stayed open late a few minutes let us take pictures in a pink Cadillac convertible evidently once used by the king himself (but if we wanted Elvis himself to show that cost extra and he was in bed).”

That would be a bummer for any number of Elvis tribute artists who work downtown. Those chapels have recently worked out a licensing agreement with the Authentic Brands Group which oversees Presley’s name and likeness.

Lopez’s mother and children reportedly attended the late-night fete.

“So with the best witnesses you could ever imagine a dress from an old movie and a jacket from Ben’s closet we read our own vows in the little chapel and gave one another the rings we’ll wear for the rest of our lives. They even had Bluetooth for a (short) march down the aisle. But in the end it was the best possible wedding we could have imagined. One we dreamed of long ago and one made real (in the eyes of the state Las Vegas a pink convertible and one another) at very very long last.”

Goya said the couples in the bureau’s lobby recognized Affleck 49; and Lopez 52. Affleck and Lopez had filled out their application online and Affleck produced the confirmation number when stepping to the counter.

“The issuing clerk said that they were really nice” Goya said. “They came in and waited in line like everyone else.”

The couple didn’t ask for special treatment and declined to be photographed by those in the room. Lopez wore a long white sleeveless dress and Affleck wore a white dress shirt white pants and a dark tie with a dark jacket. They changed at the chapel.

“When love is real the only thing that matters in marriage is one another and the promise we make to love care understand be patient loving and good to one another” Lopez said. “We had that. And so much more. Best night of our lives. Thank you to the Little White Wedding chapel for letting me use the break room to change while Ben changed in the men’s room.”

Affleck and Lopez dated and became engaged in the early 2000s. The spent nearly two decades apart before rekindling their relationship last year. News of their second engagement surfaced in April. Lopez shared a video for her fans crying and showing off her 6.1 carat green-diamond ring from Harry Winston. She posted “Saturday night while at my favorite place on earth (in a bubble bath) my beautiful love got on one knee and proposed.”

In her Sunday post Lopez referred to the couple’s trip through the Las Vegas “tunnel of love.”

“They were right when they said ‘All you need is love.’ We are so grateful to have that in abundance a new wonderful family of five amazing children and a life that we have never had more reason to look forward to” Lopez said. “Stick around long enough and maybe you’ll find the best moment of your life in a drive through in Las Vegas at twelve thirty in the morning in the tunnel of love drive through with your kids and the one you’ll spend forever with. Love is a great thing maybe the best of things-and worth waiting for.”

Lopez has been involved in a Vegas ceremony prior to Saturday night. In October 2008 she and recording star Marc Anthony renewed their wedding vows in the Forum Tower Penthouse at Caesars Palace. Lopez was also engaged to ex-Major League star Alex Rodriquez before they split up in 2021 after a four-year relationship.

The Marriage Bureau has redoubled efforts to present Las Vegas as an international wedding destination.

“This is the biggest couple we’ve had in a long time” Goya said. “They are equal to any movie-star couple. They are A-list.”

Over the decades such icons as Newman and Woodward Ann-Margaret and Roger Smith Kirk Douglas and Anne Buydens and Francis Ford Coppola and Eleanor Jesse Neil have all been married in Las Vegas. All of those couples made it to their 50th anniversaries.

As Goya says “We wish Mr. Affleck and Ms. Lopez the same enduring love.”

Roos now heads the largest tea company in the world. × 2 of 2 Expand Ekaterra tea CEO Nathalie Roos. Prev Next

Nathalie Roos the newly named CEO of the world’s largest tea company ekaterra announced her vision of a “grounded in reality” business that delivers outstanding sustainable growth.

“As the market leader our responsibility is not only to succeed but also to help lift the entire industry to the top” Roos posted on her LinkedIn profile. “What does it take?” she continued “Put simply: infusing quality into everything we do bringing value to everyone in a global value chain from the women and men who pick the tea leaves on tea estates to the final consumers.”

Roos is currently a non-executive director at Pret-a-Manger and a member of the board of French cheese marketer Bel Group. She was previously head of L’Oreal Professional Products leading a team of 12000 people with a turnover of €3.4 billion. Her experience in the beverage and packaged goods segment includes executive positions at the Mars Group where in 2004 she achieved a business turnaround that grew sales over 36% within three years.

“During my first week at ekaterra I have been meeting with our amazing teams from all over the world. I shared with them the ambition to make ekaterra a ‘Great Place to Grow’” writes Roos who replaced John Davison the executive responsible for executing a “carve out” after Unilever CEO Alan Jope announced in January 2021 his frustration with sluggish performance in the tea division. Unilever’s portfolio at the time consisted of about 40 tea brands including Lipton PG Tips Pukka Herbs TAZO and T2 retail with a combined annual turnover of €2 billion ($3.1 billion) in 2020.

In November 2021 Rotterdam-based CVC Capital Partners Fund VIII bested several bidders to reach a sales agreement for €4.5 billion that closed on July 1. Coffee executive Pierre Laubies was named chair of the board. Ekaterra tea now consists of 34 of Unilever’s brands 11 production facilities and tea estates in three countries.

Unilever remains the world's third-largest tea company having retained its brands in India Nepal and Indonesia its partnership with PepsiCo for RTD teas in the U.S. and properties in Africa India and Indonesia.

Roos praised tea’s “extraordinary” cultural role describing a beverage served 8.2 billion times a day as “an unquenchable source of joy in every country every region and every family.”

“Tea holds an extraordinary role in societies around the world steeped in tradition culture and community spirit” said Roos. “It also has an incredible power to evolve and always be relevant to the times. Ekaterra’s future will embody these elements too alongside ambitious plans to become a leader in sustainable tea production in farming and distribution methods and as a supporter of the communities in which we operate” she said.

Laubies is a 30-year veteran of the coffee industry at Jacobs Douwe Egberts. He previously held executive positions at Coty Mars and Campbell Soup Company.

In a press release distributed on July 1 Laubies wrote that “Nathalie has precisely the right blend of skills for the role with her strong commercial background her ability to develop great teams and a passion for building consumer brands and delivering growth. Working alongside Nathalie we have the opportunity to grow our world-leading tea business committed to reaching the highest sustainability goals.”",,,,,,,,,,,,

Capital One Rewards is connected to 14 airline partner rewards programs which extends your redemption options across all three airline alliances: Star Alliance Oneworld and SkyTeam. Nearly all of them transfer at a 1:1 ratio — EVA Air converts at a 2:1.5 ratio — so you'll be getting the best value by booking flights through the following carriers and their alliance partners: Aeromexico (Club Premier)

Air France KLM (Flying Blue)

Avianca (LifeMiles)

British Airways (Avios)

Cathay Pacific (Asia Miles)

Emirates (Emirates Skywards)

Etihad (Etihad Guest)

EVA Air (Infinity MileageLands) — transfer ratio is 2:1.5 not 1:1

Finnair (Finnair Plus)

Qantas (Qantas Frequent Flyer)

Singapore Airlines (KrisFlyer)

TAP Air Portugal (TAP Miles & Go)

Turkish Airlines (Miles & Smiles) While there aren't any domestic carriers listed as airline partners that doesn't mean it's not impossible to fly them for free. Thanks to airline alliances you can convert Capital One Miles to British Airways Avios then use those to book domestic U.S. flights on American Airlines its Oneworld alliance partner. You could also transfer Capital One Miles to Turkish Airlines or Avianca then use those to book flights on Star Alliance partner United Airlines.

Redeem Capital One Miles for free nights at hotels

Capital One Rewards has three hotel transfer partners — Choice Privileges Wyndham Rewards and Accor Live Limitless (AccorHotels) — letting cardholders cash in Capital One Miles for free nights at hotels worldwide. Capital One Miles can be transferred to Choice Privileges points at a 1:1 ratio allowing you to book free nights at more than 7000 properties in over 40 countries at brands including Quality Comfort Sleep Inn Econo Lodge Rodeway Inn MainStay Suites Clarion Clarion Pointe and Surburban Extended Stay Hotel Cambria Hotels and The Ascend Hotel Collection. Thanks to connections with Penn National Gaming Inc. Preferred Hotels & Resorts Nordic Choice Hotels and AMResorts (all-inclusive resorts in Mexico Costa Rica Panama and the Caribbean by brands like Dreams and Secrets) you can also redeem for stays at casino hotels and independent boutiques. Here's an idea of what you can redeem through Choice Privileges for 100000 Capital One Miles: Four nights at the Comfort Inn Manhattan – Midtown West in New York City (25000 points a night)

Five nights at Avenue Hotel Ascend Hotel Collection in Los Angeles (20000 points a night)

Eight nights at Comfort Hotel Nation Pere Lachaise Paris 11 in France (12000 points a night) Wyndham Rewards also lets you transfer Capital One Miles at a 1:1 ratio giving you access to free nights at over 9000 hotels in more than 80 countries at brands including Wyndham Wyndham Grand Wyndham Garden Registry Collection Hotels AmericInn Tryp Dazzler Esplendor Wingate Trademark Collection Dolce Hotels and Resorts La Quinta Inn & Suites Ramada Baymont Microtel Days Inn Super 8 Howard Johnson Travelodge and Hawthorn Suites. With redemptions from 7500 15000 or 30000 Wyndham Rewards points per night here's what transferring 100000 Capital One Miles could yield: Three nights at Wyndham Grand Athens in Greece (30000 points a night)

Six night at Ramada by Wyndham Queenstown Central in New Zealand (15000 points a night)

13 nights at Ramada by Wyndham Princess Santo Domingo in the Dominican Republic (7500 points a night) Thanks to a nifty partnership with Vacasa you can also redeem Capital One Miles for free nights at more than 15000 hotels vacation clubs and home rentals while a separate connection allows for redemptions at Caesars Rewards casino hotels around the U.S. Wyndham Rewards is also linked with Margarita Vacation Club Club Wyndham Cottages.com Shell Vacations Club Worldmark and Landal Greenparks so you can opt to redeem for vacation rental brands around the world. Another hotel transfer partner of Capital One is ALL Accor Live Limitless which offers hotel redemption options at a ratio of 2:1 and works a little differently from the last two programs. For starters you'll need to have at least 2000 ALL Rewards in your account which means you'd need to transfer over 4000 Capital One Miles and redeem them in increments of 2000 ALL Rewards points — 2000 points gets you 40 euros (about $45) off your stay while 4000 translates to 80 euros (about $90) and so forth. While you likely won't get the best value for your points this way the ALL Accor Live Limitless program can still be beneficial depending on your travel plans and style as award options through it include more than 5100 hotels in over 100 countries at brands like Fairmont Raffles Faena Delano Sofitel SLS Museum Hotel Mondrian Pullman Swissôtel Mövenpick Mantra Novotel and Ibis among others. While there are just 100 hotels in North America Accor brands are seemingly omnipresent throughout Europe Asia and Oceania so this is still a valuable points-transfer option.

Book flights hotels and car rentals through Capital One Travel

If you enjoy having the flexibility to book flights hotels and rental cars without having to worry about award availability or blackout dates consider making your reservations through Capital One Travel a new travel portal that offers added benefits like cancel-for-any-reason travel insurance (for a small fee) a freeze-your-price feature that helps you lock in lower rates price drop protection (if you find a lower price Capital One will refund you the difference) and a nifty price match guarantee (if you happen to find a better price within 24 hours of booking you could get a refund). While this also allows you to book travel at a fixed redemption rate of 1 cent per mile it's always worth comparing redemption rates — in other words seeing how many points and miles are needed for an award redemption directly through the carrier or hotel versus booking through the Capital One travel portal. Depending on your points and miles status goals you may also want to consider booking travel directly to maintain elite status or double-dipping by reserving tickets or rooms through another third-party website then simply ""erasing"" the travel purchase (more on that below).

Use Capital One Miles to ""erase"" recent travel purchases

One of the most valuable perks of the Capital One Venture X card is the ability to ""erase"" or redeem Capital One Miles to cover travel purchases made within the last 90 days. Simply use the card to book fights hotels car rentals or make other travel-related expenses (like Uber rides or Airbnb stays) then click on ""Redeem Travel Purchases"" to select which ones you'd like to cover or put your Capital One Miles toward — partial credit is fine too as long as you redeem more than 2500 Miles. Capital One Miles are worth 1 cent per mile when choosing this redemption option meaning 100000 miles could erase $1000 in travel purchases.

Redeem miles for gift cards and online shopping

If you know you won't be traveling for a while there's always retail therapy. With the Capital One Venture X card you'll be able to redeem Capital One Miles at a rate of 1 cent per point for gift cards to all your favorite restaurants and retail shops like Apple Bath & Body Works and Starbucks. Note that if you're redeeming Capital One Miles for Amazon gift cards — or using Capital One Miles to shop online via Amazon or PayPal — the redemption rate drops to 0.8 cents per point (you'd get $0.80 cents in value per 100 Miles) so it won't be the best value among all your other options.

Cash back is a low-value redemption

While this is the least valuable redemption option for your newly earned Capital One Miles you can still opt to exchange them at a rate of 0.5 cents per mile for cash in the form of an account credit or a check.

If you're interested in other cards with large welcome bonuses consider the following. The value and utility of the rewards from each card varies but you'll still be able to get plenty of ""free"" travel with their hefty welcome bonuses.

Eager consumers will have to act fast however. You have until March 14 to apply for these two credit cards and score the welcome bonus offer. After that the offers will change.

Capital One Venture X and Spark Cash Plus bonuses ending March 14

Both of these credit card sign-up bonuses provide a lot of value to cardholders. With the Capital One Venture X Card you can earn 100000 bonus miles after spending $10000 on purchases within the first six months of account opening. Even at a modest 1 cent per mile value that bonus is worth $1000 — a 10% return on your initial spend. On top of a generous welcome bonus the card's robust travel benefits make this card even more beneficial. Cardholders receive everything from a $300 annual travel credit for bookings made through Capital One Travel and a $200 statement credit towards travel rentals such as Airbnb or Vrbo® within your first year to access to Capital One and Priority Pass lounges a $100 credit towards TSA PreCheck® or Global Entry and comprehensive travel insurance. It's unclear what the bonus will be after March 14. With the Capital One Spark Cash Plus Credit Card you can earn up to a $3000 cash bonus: $500 once you spend $5000 in the first three months and $2500 once you spend $50000 in the first six months. If you can achieve the $50000 spend mark over half a year the $3000 bonus is a 6% return on your initial spend. And since you also earn an unlimited 2% cash back on every purchase you'll earn an additional $1000 on a $50000 spend — making your total cash back $4000. That $4000 bonus can come in handy bolstering your emergency fund contributing to your Roth IRA or paying down debt. And the best part is that credit card rewards are not taxable as long as you had to spend to earn them according to the IRS. Along with the valuable bonus the card comes with no foreign transaction fees and no preset spending limit. It's unclear what the bonus will be after March 14.

How to choose between a travel rewards or cash back credit card

While both of these Capital One welcome bonuses are attractive a question that comes up regularly among consumers is: Should I get a credit card with travel rewards or one with cash back? While one is not automatically better than the other there are several key questions to ask yourself: What are your financial needs/goals? If you're aiming to offset the costs you spend on necessary purchases a cash back card is an excellent resource especially during a time of inflation. The cash you get back from the routine spending you have to do anyways can put money back in your pocket. However if you're financially comfortable and want to save money on your upcoming adventures then a travel credit card would be more appropriate. If you are leaning towards a travel card do you have a plan to redeem your travel rewards? If you earn travel rewards regardless of which card or currency it's a smart strategy to 'earn and burn' — meaning to not let them sit for too long. This mainly applies to currencies that are directly linked to a brand such as Delta SkyMiles® or Marriott Bonvoy® points since brands regularly go through devaluations of their loyalty points. Transferable rewards however can be much more durable in their value. Travel credit cardholders should make it a priority to take advantage of the miles they earn and the benefits that they have access to. So if you decide the Venture X Card is the best for you be sure to use its travel credits enroll in TSA PreCheck or Global Entry and redeem the miles you earn for enjoyable travel experiences.

It turns out that he made a booking at the Austin airport but just didn’t use it. Nonetheless Hertz showed him picking up the car driving 100 miles and returning it the next evening. They billed him $91.77.

The good news is he got a receipt – they checked the vehicle back in – so they don’t think he stole it.

What do you do if this happens to you?



If you’re not going to pick up a rental car cancel the reservation



Call the rental company. They won’t know how to help but will probably ‘open a case’



Try reaching out to the local location. A manager there might be able to help sort it.



Collect any information you can showing where you were at the time the car was being picked up. (This reader was in a Lyft nowhere near the rental location)



Dispute the charge

Jeff was surprisingly reluctant to dispute the Hertz charge afraid to get banned by them (most people wouldn’t consider renting from them again!). He says he “likes their Teslas.”

This with the rental car company that won’t withdraw false auto theft charges afraid that doing so would hurt their credibility. Hertz really does seem to have broken processes and IT systems although I’m at a bit of a loss how they managed to attribute a rental to someone who wasn’t there – they’re supposed to check IDs and match those to contracts unless of course someone with the same name had a rental on the same day and a clerk pulled the wrong booking.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMigwFodHRwczovL3d3dy5kYWlseW5ld3MuY29tLzIwMjIvMDcvMTYvbWxiLWFsbC1zdGFyLXdlZWtzLWZyZWUtc2FudGEtbW9uaWNhLWZlc3RpdmFsLWtpY2tzLW9mZi1kcnVtcy11cC1leGNpdGVtZW50LWZvci10dWVzZGF5cy1nYW1lL9IBhwFodHRwczovL3d3dy5kYWlseW5ld3MuY29tLzIwMjIvMDcvMTYvbWxiLWFsbC1zdGFyLXdlZWtzLWZyZWUtc2FudGEtbW9uaWNhLWZlc3RpdmFsLWtpY2tzLW9mZi1kcnVtcy11cC1leGNpdGVtZW50LWZvci10dWVzZGF5cy1nYW1lL2FtcC8?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,MLB All-Star Week’s free Santa Monica festival kicks off drums up excitement for Tuesday’s game,"A sea of blue Dodger jerseys and baseball fans took over the Santa Monica Pier on Friday July 15 -– and will continue doing so through the weekend.

MLB’s All-Star Week is officially underway and Friday kicked off the first-ever beach event called the Capital One All-Star Oceanfront at the Santa Monica Pier and beach.

This year’s All-Star Game on Tuesday July 19 will mark the fourth time in franchise history that the Dodgers will host the Midsummer Classic but the only other time they did so at their current home was in 1980 (the 1949 game was in Brooklyn and the 1959 game – one of two played that season – was at the L.A. Memorial Coliseum).

All-Star activities are generally pricey so MLB created the free Santa Monica event for Angelenos and baseball fans from elsewhere who may not be able to afford to attend the game.

The event features instructional youth baseball and softball on the beach baseball-themed sand-sculpture contests and batting and pitching cages for all ages to test their skills.

One of the features that Jeremiah Yolkut MLB’s vice president of Global Events said attendees should check out are the activities on the beach south of the pier.

“I think one of the best things is what’s happening on the beach itself; how often do you get to see people play baseball in the sand?” he said Friday. “We have an initiative called Play Ball which is getting more youth involved in the game and to be able to activate and play ball on the beach with the ocean as the backdrop you don’t get much better than that.”

Along with that each morning of the event the public can participate in free yoga classes on the beach before the festivities begin in earnest.

MLB also partnered with Heal the Bay a local nonprofit dedicated to making the coastal waters in Greater Los Angeles clean and safe to organize a beach cleanup on Saturday.

“(MLB) wanted to stay true to the community leave the place better than how we found it” Yolkut said “so we’re trying to do everything we can to really be in the market and present.”

The pier was crowded by hundreds of fans and families on Friday most representing their favorite teams in some way including by donning their jerseys. People waited in long lines to buy official All-Star merchandise and get baseball cards and pins.

Allen Estrada of El Segundo went to collect rare pins and take advantage of what the event had to offer.

“I wanted to mingle with other baseball fans and check out all the booths” Estrada said. “There was beach yoga in the morning and there’s a baseball field in the sand with the wavy roof of Dodger Stadium which is so cool.”

MLB also had various photo-ops for fans including massive gloves helmets and baseballs with which folks could pose.

Virginia Jauregui and her husband Gilbert Jauregui attended the event’s opening day sporting rivaling jerseys.

Virginia Jauregui wore her Angels jersey and Gilbert Jauregui had on his Dodgers jersey.

The El Monte couple attended the event because they are big baseball fans and it got them more excited for the All-Star Game.

The two teams also resumed the Freeway Series on Friday and will play again on Saturday.

“We played some games” Virginia Jauregui said “got some pins and we liked the atmosphere.”

Baseball activities weren’t the only forms of entertainment though: The main stage had live music that attendees could hear throughout the entire event.

Children and baseball fans could also get their faces painted or get a caricature drawn of them.

Local food vendors and different beverage stations were available for people to grab a bit to eat and something to drink.

“Santa Monica is thrilled to host Major League Baseball’s first-ever All-Star Oceanfront event” Deputy City Manager Anuj Gupta said. “We urge everyone attending to bike bus train or walk to Santa Monica as we are expecting a busy summer weekend in celebration of MLB’s All-Star Week.”

MLB took over the pier to give locals and tourists an event intended to represent Southern California – with a view of the beach and everything baseball.

“Come enjoy the two best things about summer” said Jim Harris executive director of the Santa Monica Pier Corporation. “Major League Baseball and the Santa Monica Pier.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5iYS5jb20vd2l6YXJkcy9uZXdzL3JlY2FwLXdpemFyZHMtY2xvc2Utc3VtbWVyLWxlYWd1ZS13aXRoLWNvbWViYWNrLXdpbi1vdmVyLXdhcnJpb3Jz0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Recap: Wizards close Summer League with comeback win over Warriors,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='www.nba.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /wizards/news/recap-wizards-close-summer-league-with-comeback-win-over-warriors (Caused by NewConnectionError('<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x000002185BC19600>: Failed to establish a new connection: [WinError 10051] A socket operation was attempted to an unreachable network')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5iYS5jb20vd2l6YXJkcy9uZXdzL3JlY2FwLXdpemFyZHMtY2xvc2Utc3VtbWVyLWxlYWd1ZS13aXRoLWNvbWViYWNrLXdpbi1vdmVyLXdhcnJpb3Jz0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen"

Special to The Columbus Dispatch

A variety of mediums and subject matter and overall excellence in artistry is on view in “Diálogos” an exhibit of work by seven Columbus-area Latinx artists.

Installed in the Cardinal Health Gallery at Franklin Park Conservatory and Botanical Gardens the exhibit offers a snapshot of experiences and history from the origin countries of the artists – Argentina Colombia Cuba Ecuador Mexico and the United States.

“There’s a huge tradition of fine art all over South America that Americans don’t know about” said co-curator Eglé Gatins. “These are serious artists with track records.”

Working with found objects and handmade dyes Christian Casas a first-generation Cuban-American created a large wall installation of alphabet squares in which each letter represents an aspect of Cuban life ranging from F is for Fidel (Castro) to letters that stand for words describing Cuban people geography and history. The installation is bold colorful and informative.

Elsie Sanchez’s “Entredos” and “Procession” are large abstract oil paintings with layers of colors creating overall swirling patterns. The works can be viewed near and far producing feelings of movement and hypnosis. Sanchez born in Havana Cuba emigrated to the United States at the age of 9.

In her large black and gold woodcuts Eliana Calle Saari who was born and grew up in Colombia references life on a Caribbean island as well as Colombian history and culture including Gabriel Garcia Marquez’s “One Hundred Years of Solitude.”

A Mexican tradition of animal and human portraits is reflected in Pedro Prieto Jr.’s black and white linocuts. Prieto was born in the United States to Mexican parents.

Mabi Ponce de Léon who describes herself as a transplanted South American (born in Argentina) visits Peru in her large map a collage of acrylic and mixed media work on canvas. “I explore what it feels like to ‘be’ from two places and belong to neither” she writes in her statement.

The conquering Spaniards’ quest for gold – and the cost to South America’s indigenous people – is examined in the handmade paper works of Micaela de Vivero who grew up in Ecuador. In “Oro no es/Gold is it not?” she combines historical drawings with splashes of color including gold thread.

In the intriguing video installation “Chapultepec” titled for the huge park in Mexico City Florence Gouvrit-Montano who is based in Mexico City and Columbus incorporates the recorded sounds of birds from the park with a light-colored soothing visual of swaying trees.

Gatins’ co-curator and fellow artist Elena Osterwalder said that in addition to supplying artwork each artist was asked to write about their work and how it feels to be a Latinx artist in Columbus. Their statements available to visitors to the gallery are rich with context for their works.

“Their work is beautiful in itself but if you read about it there’s an added dimension” Gatins said.

Gatin was born in France to French and Colombian parents and is an artist who works in painting collage and mixed media. Osterwalder was born and raised in Mexico and came to the United States when she was 30. She is a painter now working with natural dyes. The curators have been friends and colleagues for years and are passionate about spotlighting Latinx artists calling those in the exhibit “established high-quality artists.”

“A lot of people think of Latinx art as more craft more pop culture. It can be that but it can be much more. This is really fine art” Gatin said.

After all the line has for decades been a fixture of warm-weather cruise itineraries leaving from close-to-home ports. But the fact remains that Carnival has long offered a small assortment of Alaskan cruises.

Cruise Critic hopped aboard the 2124-passenger Carnival Spirit in Seattle for eight days of Carnival Alaska cruise adventure to see what the line is doing in The Last Frontier -- and it turned out to be a perfect time to do so.

In addition to Carnival Spirit offering Alaska cruises from Seattle sister-ship Carnival Miracle sails to the Last Frontier roundtrip from San Francisco. The slightly larger 2008-built Carnival Splendor joins Carnival Spirit in sailing from Seattle operating a variety of itineraries..

It's the largest Alaskan cruise deployment in the history of Carnival Cruise Line which has historically only deployed one or two ships to the region and it comes on the heels of last year's shortened cruise season in Alaska a result of the global health pandemic.

There's another reason we're excited to be sailing aboard Carnival Spirit: this ship the first of the hugely successful Spirit-class that debuted in 2001 has been permanently based in Australia since the fall of 2012. Until this year North American audiences just haven't been able to book a cruise onboard Carnival Spirit.

Our Alaskan cruise itinerary is one of Carnival's more unique. Spanning an unusual eight days sailing roundtrip from Seattle's Pier 91 it includes stops in Icy Strait Point Juneau Skagway Ketchikan and Victoria British Columbia along with a full day of cruising Tracy Arm Fjord just south of Juneau.

Here are our first impressions of our Fun Ship Fun in the Last Frontier:

Carnival Offers Unexpected Surprises in Alaska

Given its value-driven price point we wouldn't have expected Carnival to offer much in the way of destination immersion aboard Carnival Spirit. As it turns out we were wrong. While its offerings aren't as elaborate as more upscale sister brand Holland America Line we were pleasantly thrilled to see Carnival employ an onboard naturalist named Chris on our sailing.

Chris the Naturalist comes over the public address system periodically to advise of wildlife sightings and give other relevant geographical information. He has also hosted two informative lectures so far: an overview of Alaska and one on the Glaciers Wildlife and Volcanoes of Alaska.

While many passengers probably aren't swayed one way or another by having a naturalist onboard we are -- and we've heard similar comments from other passengers. It's a huge win for Carnival and a great unexpected surprise on this voyage.

While passengers won't find Alaskan beers onboard -- or even Alaskan seafood for that matter Carnival has managed to tweak some of its entertainment programming to offer a more Alaskan bent.

To that end passengers were invited to participate in a Lumberjack Show on the Pool Deck on our sea day up from Seattle along with The Great Alaskan Race: an absurdly-fun gameshow where people place bets on crewmembers dressed up as Alaskan animals who then ""race"" across the stage in the main show lounge.

There was also an Ice Fishing Challenge held in the ship's soaring atrium that was composed of two parts: a trivia session that pitted teams together to outwit the competition on their knowledge of Alaska's fishing industry coupled with a fun group effort to toss rubber fish into a bucket -- and catch them -- without dropping any.

In Skagway veteran local entertainer and businessowner Steve Hites came onboard to perform his ""Skagway in Story and Song"" show before our ship left port. Hites regularly offers this performance on other lines including Princess and Holland America and it's nice to see him here onboard Carnival Spirit as well.

Think of this all as edutainment: it's more lighthearted and carefree than the activities on a luxury cruise or expedition vessel sailing in Alaska but make no mistake: the history and heritage of Alaska is being presented to passengers aboard Carnival Spirit. In fact Carnival's Alaska program exceeds some of its other mainstream competitors most of which don't customize anything onboard to reflect the destination.

Now if only they'd get some local brews onboard…

Carnival’s Alaska Shore Excursions Program Is Solid

We have also been impressed with Carnival's shore excursion program in Alaska which is diverse enough to include inexpensive tours that nonetheless offer a good time and showcase the ports of call alongside bucket-list experiences costing hundreds of dollars per person.

Pre-booking excursions is essential; many were already sold out by the time we had stepped aboard Carnival Spirit. And despite the high cost bucket-list items like flightseeing tours were some of the first to go.

A total of 123 individual shore excursions are offered on our sailing and choosing really is the hardest part. We ended up doing the Bordello Breakfast and Historical Tour in Skagway a reasonably-priced morning excursion that includes breakfast at the famous Red Onion Saloon along with a tour of the former Gold Rush-era brothel. The bawdy jokes may have been painfully obvious but the Red Onion is filled with history and should be toured if only to see the original surviving silk wallpaper that graced the brothel's rooms and artifacts that were found stashed underneath the floorboards 80 years earlier when the building underwent renovations in the 1970's.

Kudos to Carnival too for offering passengers a chance to hop off their ship during scenic cruising in Tracy Arm for a chance to get up close and personal with the North and South Sawyer Glaciers via one of the Allen Marine dayboats that are synonymous with Alaska. Not every cruise line offers this tour and the fact that Carnival Spirit spends enough time in Tracy Arm to allow for not one but two departures of this sightseeing tour is a pretty big win for passengers despite the $200/person cost and the ghastly meeting time of 6:30 a.m.

Moreover both tours were completely sold out with two boats chartered for each departure. Seeing the Sawyer glaciers up close and personal is a moving experience and was worth it despite the cold and the rain. Thanks to the relatively ice-free conditions Carnival Spirit was even able to make it all the way to the South Sawyer Glacier for the tour boats to rejoin the ship.

Is Alaska Still Having Shore Excursion Issues?

Carnival is like every other cruise line having some issues in Alaska with shore excursions needing to be modified or changed or in some cases canceled entirely due to tour operator staffing availability.

Shore excursion operators in Alaska are currently stretched to the max; all it takes is one motorcoach driver calling in sick to throw the entire day's program off track. Operators and cruise lines are doing their best to keep things running smoothly but as with anything these days staffing in Alaska does remain a problem that cruisers should be aware of.

Of the three excursions we've booked so far only one in Juneau was changed. We received a letter the evening before our arrival that our Juneau Gold Panning Adventure had been changed from a 7:30 a.m. departure to a 1:30 p.m. departure due to low enrollment numbers on the morning tour. Passengers were invited to visit Guest Services if that didn't work to come up with alternatives.

You don't need an excursion to enjoy Alaska; we spent an enjoyable day roaming around Icy Strait Point sampling the local seafood and admiring views of the ocean the whales and Carnival Spirit and Splendor docked nearby. But it's nice to have options.

Carnival Spirit Fits Alaska Better Than You'd Think

After four days onboard it's clear to see how well Carnival Spirit is suited to Alaska. This entire class of ship -- which encompasses Carnival Spirit Pride Miracle and Legend -- is already loved by cruisers for its relative spaciousness compared to other Carnival Cruise Line ships.

In Alaska Carnival Spirit really excels. The ship has great outdoor deck spaces that are easily accessible to passengers including a tucked-away viewing deck situated high atop the navigation bridge that provides for some excellent vistas. Additional open decks run from the pool deck upwards and even encircle Carnival's iconic ""Whale Tail"" funnel -- the base of which aboard Carnival Spirit actually acts as a skylight for the atrium and Nouveau Steakhouse below.

Even when the weather is inclement -- as it has been for most of our sailing which has featured high winds heavy seas and cooler-than-average temperatures -- Carnival Spirit is still spacious and cozy enough inside to keep passengers connected with Alaska and with the sea while still keeping everyone warm and toasty.

Public rooms for the most part work great here in Alaska. The Fountain Coffee Bar on Deck 2 is lined with 100 feet of oversized oceanview windows and offers great views as is the Alchemy Bar at the stern of Deck 3 which tends to be popular with the book crowd during the Bar's non-operating hours.

Even The Jungle Interior Promenade that encircles the forward end of Deck 3 -- an overbuilt space that offers a safari motif and eye-popping colors -- is a surprisingly lovely place to read during the day and escape the din of the rest of the ship. That too helps Carnival Spirit: as busy and brash as the public rooms can be at various times throughout the day the ship always seems to have some quiet tucked-away nook waiting just for you.

Sure there are some areas aboard Carnival Spirit that seem oddly out of place in Alaska: the tropical-themed Red Frog Pub a favorite of mine on Carnival sailings in the Caribbean seems weird in here in Alaska's cooler climate. Ditto for the reggae music that blares out on the bridge cam channel on the in-room television sets; there's nothing less Alaskan than hearing ""Cheeseburger in Paradise"" belted out while you sail up misty Lynn Canal towards Skagway.

But Carnival's greatest asset is the hardworking friendly crew aboard Carnival Spirit. The ship feels nearly full yet not understaffed (at least compared to 2019). Onboard food from the casual La Playa Grill Lido Café to the main dining room and extra-charge restaurants like the Nouveau Steakhouse has been universally great -- the latter in particular where we dined during our dramatic departure from Skagway on a meal of flank steak and red wine while the wind howled and shrieked outside. And I'd forgotten how soft and welcoming the beds in Carnival's staterooms are across all cabin categories.

There are a few random changes we noticed this year compared with our pre-pandemic Carnival cruises: stateroom stewards now only do one turndown service per day in the morning. Butter knives have disappeared from the dining room tables (though are still present in the steakhouse) and printed daily programs -- while still offered -- come on plain white paper and don't display all the activities shown on the Carnival FunHUB App.

The app though is remarkably convenient: you can view your current account balance make dining reservations and (unfortunately for your wallet) reserve shore excursions at the push of a button. And unlike many cruise line apps it actually works.

Bottom Line: Carnival Sprit is Fun and Affordable Way to Cruise Alaska

While I've met many repeat Carnival passengers here onboard Carnival Spirit I've also met many first timers to Alaska and indeed many first-time cruisers period. That to me is Carnival's greatest strength: it offers a superb cruise at a very reasonable price. Whether you're in an inside cabin or a suite you too can visit Alaska in comfort.

Carnival Spirit has been away from North America for a decade but next year it returns to Alaska once again joined by the newly-acquired Carnival Luminosa.

For a line that's always had a tepid presence in Alaska this year -- and next -- are different as Carnival makes Alaska its newest destination of choice; one it is already proving to have the chops to carry out as every bit well as its more expensive sister-lines.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMieGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZveDVkYy5jb20vbmV3cy9zdXNwZWN0LWFycmVzdGVkLWFmdGVyLTE2LXllYXItb2xkLXNob3Qta2lsbGVkLWF0LXNvdXRoZXJuLW1hcnlsYW5kLWZpcmUtZGVwYXJ0bWVudC1jYXJuaXZhbNIBfGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZveDVkYy5jb20vbmV3cy9zdXNwZWN0LWFycmVzdGVkLWFmdGVyLTE2LXllYXItb2xkLXNob3Qta2lsbGVkLWF0LXNvdXRoZXJuLW1hcnlsYW5kLWZpcmUtZGVwYXJ0bWVudC1jYXJuaXZhbC5hbXA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,16-year-old shot killed at Southern Maryland fire department carnival; Suspect in custody,"A man is facing charges for shooting and killing a 16-year-old at a fire department carnival in St. Mary’s County Maryland according to police.

HOLLYWOOD Md. — A 19-year-old was arrested and charged with murder in connection to a shooting at the Hollywood Volunteer Fire Department’s carnival on Friday evening that killed a 16-year-old boy and injured a man according to officials.

In a news release St. Mary's County Sheriff's Office said Devron Ny’Quez Murray 19 of Lexington Park who was already in custody is also facing charges of second-degree attempted murder and two counts of first-degree assault.

Sheriff deputies and emergency personnel were already in attendance before shots were heard around 11 p.m. in the parking lot of the carnival which was held at 24801 Three Notch Road in Hollywood.

When deputies arrived at the scene to investigate they found 16-year-old Syncere Kovey Smith suffering from multiple gunshot wounds. He was taken to MedStar St. Mary's Hospital in Leonardtown where he later died from his injuries.

In the same area deputies said they found another man struck by a bullet in the leg. He was taken to an area trauma center. His condition remains unknown at this time.

In a video posted on Tiktok a man attending carnival can be heard yelling that shots were fired and attendees should take shelter.

Commissioners of St. Mary’s County expressed his support and condolences early Saturday morning.

""The Commissioners of St. Mary's County wish to extend their sincere condolences to the victims families and witnesses of Friday night's shooting at the Hollywood Volunteer Fire Department Carnival. ""To the victims' families we express our sorrow and promise to stand with you in the coming days. To those who were at the carnival and witnessed the terrible events our hearts go out to you. We will pray for comfort for you and our entire community this time. We will also stand with the St. Mary's County Sheriff's Office and all law enforcement members to ensure full justice is brought to bear. This is a difficult time and we know there will be more difficult days ahead; as a community we will navigate through this with compassion and determination"" Commissioner President Randy Guy said.

According to police with the help of the numerous witnesses Murray was located in a matter of minutes at the Birdie's gas station in Hollywood along with a 9mm handgun.

He is prohibited from possessing a handgun because of his age.

A preliminary investigation revealed that this shooting wasn't random and stemmed from an ongoing dispute between ""two known rival groups of young offenders"" deputies said in a news release.

Lawrence Chase recorded the immediate aftermath of the shooting and helped people scurry to safety.

“I hear about seven shots go off and I knew right away I said well that's a pistol. I just felt like look if I can save somebody's life I'm good. I mean I feel like I'm right with God” he said.

Chase said prior to the shooting the carnival was winding down for the night.

“The night was going so peaceful! It’s like man ain't nothing happened no fight.! So it's crazy how things go on and all sudden right after that and hearing gunshots” Chase said.

Chase said now multiple families are ruined “You just brandish the gun your life is ruined. It is no good outcome it's nothing positive that comes out of it. It’s only negative and they don't think that far ahead of time” Chase said.

The investigation is ongoing by St. Mary's County Sherriff's office.

If so you're in luck as Delta allows these three types of animals to fly with you in-cabin for a small fee.

But before you go ahead and book your flight you'll want to be extremely aware of the Delta pet policy. There are some confusing rules and Delta doesn't allow a pet to fly with you on board on all routes aircraft and seats. Having all the information in advance will ensure that your pet can join you on your travels.

Here's everything you need to know about the Delta Air Lines pet policy.

With the Delta pet policy you can bring small dogs cats and household birds with you in-cabin to select destinations. All pets must fit into a pet carrier and be at least 10 weeks old for domestic travel at least 16 weeks old if traveling to the U.S. from another country and at least 15 weeks old when traveling to the EU.

Passengers are only allowed to bring one pet carrier on board but in some cases multiple pets are allowed per carrier. For example one female cat or dog can travel with her un-weaned litter (with no cap) if the kittens or puppies are between 10 weeks to six months of age. Additionally if you have two pets of the same breed and size between the ages of 10 weeks and six months those pets are allowed in one pet carrier as long as they fit. In these situations Delta will only charge you for one pet.

Delta also limits where you can sit if you bring a pet. Per the Delta pet policy you'll need to avoid selecting seats at the bulkhead and in emergency exit rows. Likewise avoid seats designated as ""no stowage"" which are rows 30 to 35 on the A330-200 aircraft rows 30 to 43 on the A330-300 aircraft and center seats on the B757-200 aircraft. Also know that carry-on pets are not allowed in any cabin with flat-bed seats international business class international Delta One or Delta Premium Select.

There are also additional restrictions when flying with a pet on Delta outside the U.S.:

You can only bring household birds on domestic U.S. flights (excluding Hawaii U.S. Virgin Islands Puerto Rico and Guam).

You can't bring pets to Hawaii the United Kingdom and Ireland.

You can't travel to or from Hong Kong South Africa Australia and New Zealand with pets.

The CDC currently bans dogs from entering the U.S. from high-risk countries for rabies such as Egypt.

Since country rules can change at any time make sure to review Delta's international pet travel restrictions.

Additionally at the onset of the pandemic the Delta pet cargo option was put on hold and has yet to come back. Per the Delta dog policy your dog must fit in an approved pet carrier tha can fit under the seat in front of you — so larger dogs usually can't travel with you on Delta.

Delta Air Lines recently decreased the cost of bringing a pet on board with you. For tickets purchased on or after Feb. 28 2022 the cost of flying with a pet on Delta is $95 for flights within the U.S. Canada Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands. For previously purchased flights the cost is $125.

However if you're flying internationally the cost is slightly different. For all international flights — except to or from Brazil — the price is significantly more expensive at $200. However flying with a pet on Delta to or from Brazil is only $75.

All fees are one-way and are collected when checking in for your flight at the airport.

The Delta Air Lines pet policy limited the number of pets on board and within each cabin. So you'll want to contact Delta as early as possible if you plan to bring a pet.

Finally if one of Delta's partners operates your flight you'll need to call the partner airline directly to learn more about its pet policies.

All pets on a Delta flight must fit into a pet carrier or kennel and that carrier or kennel must fit under the seat in front of you.

The pet carrier can be soft-sided or hard-sided but it must be leak-proof and ventilated (three side ventilation openings or four sides for international travel). The pet also must be able to move around and not protrude from the sides. All pets must stay in their carrier while in the boarding area on the aircraft and in Delta lounges.

Delta recommends a soft-sized kennel with a maximum size of 18 inches by 11 inches by 11 inches. But some seats may feature more under seat storage and fit a larger kennel. The agent will record your kennel dimensions when you contact Delta to add your pet to your reservation.

When flying with a pet on Delta remember that your pet carrier will count as one of your carry-on items. So in addition to your carrier you can also bring one personal item on board.

Bottom line

As long as you do your research regarding the aircraft and cabin you book bringing a small dog cat or bird with you on your next Delta flight is incredibly easy. While you can't bring larger dogs with you right now Delta may resume the Delta pet cargo program in the future.

Make sure to review all of the rules before booking your flight. By doing so and paying a modest fee you might be able to enjoy your next trip with your small dog cat or household bird.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiQmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmtlZGdsb2JhbC5jb20vZnV0dXJlLW1vYmlsaXR5L25ld3NWaWV3L2tlZDIwMjIwNzE3MDAwMtIBMWh0dHBzOi8vYW1wLmtlZGdsb2JhbC5jb20vbmV3c0FtcC9rZWQyMDIyMDcxNzAwMDI?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,SK Telecom to take lead in UAM biz with telco know-how,"Visitors to the 2022 Busan International Motor Show experience the UAM simulator at SK Telecom’s booth (Courtesy of SK Telecom)

BUSAN -- South Korea’s top mobile carrier SK Telecom Co. aims to dominate the urban air mobility market based on its expertise and know-how in mobile communication infrastructure. The company is targeting the UAM sector for future growth given the saturation of its existing telco business.SK Telecom plans to expand its services into air mobility from smartphones and the internet of things (IoT) said its Chief Development Officer Ha Min-yong at the Busan International Motor Show where the carrier showcased its UAM technology.“We aim to evolve into a leading connected intelligence company that smartly links UAM aircraft vertiports – platforms for takeoff and landing – and existing transportation on the ground” Ha told reporters.SK Telecom the only company among those that target the UAM market to participate at the motor show in South Korea’s No. 2 city exhibited a small-sized model of electric vertical take-off and landing (eVTOL) aircraft and allowed visitors to experience UAM flights by taking a ride on a giant robot arm simulator.The global UAM market is expected to surge to $61.5 billion by 2030 – at the time of initial commercialization – and further to $609 billion by 2040 from a forecast $6.1 billion in 2023 according to the Ministry of Land Infrastructure and Transport.The South Korean UAM market is also predicted to grow to 13 trillion won ($9.8 billion) by 2040 with services such as operations control communication and service platforms making up 75%.“That will open up enormous potential for Korean companies if we establish a world-leading service system through Korea’s advanced ICT infrastructure” Ha stressed.SK Telecom has been actively developing UAM technology and investing in the sector since late last year when it set up a task force team directly under CEO Ryu Young-sang. It began eyeing the UAM business in February 2019.SK Telecom in February this year signed an agreement with Joby Aviation Inc. a California-based electric passenger aircraft developer to cooperate in the entire UAM business including the aircraft and service platforms.The South Korean company said Joby currently has the most advanced technology among eVTOL aircraft makers around the world.In May SK Telecom applied for a transportation ministry-led UAM project alongside Hanwha Systems Co. Korea Airports Corp. and Korea Transport Institute competing with other telecommunication service providers that teamed up with major companies such as Hyundai Motor Co.The Ministry of Land Infrastructure and Transport in February launched the K-UAM Grand Challenge a large-scale demonstration project to commercialize UAM from 2025. The ministry plans to select participants in November of this year is scheduled to begin demonstration flights in open terrain next year.“It is expected to be used only for the tourism medical and logistics sectors in low-density areas in the early stages of commercialization” said Ha. “Its role will be expanded into public transportation once the industry builds up experience and more people accept the new transportation method.”Seung-Woo Lee at leeswoo@hankyung.com Jongwoo Cheon edited this article.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMie2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZsaWdodGdsb2JhbC5jb20vZml4ZWQtd2luZy9mL2EtMTgtY29udHJvbHMtdGhyZWUtdW5tYW5uZWQtYWlyLXZlaGljbGVzLWluLXVzLW5hdnktZGVtb25zdHJhdGlvbi8xNDk0MDYuYXJ0aWNsZdIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,F/A-18 controls three unmanned air vehicles in US Navy demonstration,"The pilot of a US Navy (USN) Boeing F/A-18 Super Hornet successfully controlled three unmanned air vehicles (UAVs) during a recent demonstration in California.

The US Naval Air Systems Command (NAVAIR) said on 15 July that using an on-board tablet the pilot was able to direct the UAVs to perform various aerial manoeuvres during a series of four flight tests near Ventura California.

The pairing of conventionally piloted aircraft and UAVs is a concept the US military calls “manned/unmanned teaming” or MUM-T.

“The MUM-T concept explores interoperability between manned aircraft and unmanned autonomous systems to conduct missions” says USN Captain Jason Denney programme manager for the F/A-18 and EA-18G Growler electronic attack variant of the Boeing twin-engined fighter.

“Such collaborative endeavours are imperative for resource and requirements planning to ensure the warfighter is equipped with best-in-class capabilities” Denney adds.

Commands were given to the undisclosed type of UAV using a tablet connected to the Block III F-18’s Distributed Targeting Processor – Networked (DTP-N) which communicated with the nearby aircraft.

All commands issued by the pilots were successfully completed NAVAIR says.

Dr Michael Yu experimentation and demonstration lead for NAVAIR’s F-18/EA-18 office says that exercises like the MUM-T test are carried out regularly with the USN’s industry to evaluate current and future technologies.

“The comprehensive analysis of data captured during these events further informs development and refinement of technologies that could potentially be incorporated into navy platforms” he explains.

Yu says that MUM-T could allow the navy to extend the reach of its aircrew while keeping them farther away from enemy fire.

Manned-unmanned pairing could also enable pilots to delegate tasks or incorporate UAVs into missions such as patrolling airspace fuelling aircraft or serving as a communication relay node NAVAIR notes.

With 435 of the fourth-generation fighter in service and 58 more on order according to FlightGlobal’s 2022 World Air Forces directory the Super Hornet forms “the backbone of carrier-based aviation power projection” NAVAIR says.

By comparison the USN only plans to procure some 230 carrier-based Lockheed Martin F-35C Lightning II fifth-generation fighters. That number does not include the additional short take-off and vertical landing F-35B variant airframes being acquired for the US Marine Corps.

The service’s Navy Aviation Vision 2030-2035 outlines blended carrier air wings using “a complimentary mix” of F/A-18s F-35s and a still-unnamed next generation strike fighter designated as F/A-XX.

That report says the Block III Super Hornet will remain the backbone of the carrier air wing through 2035 with the F-35C acting as a “force multiplier” through the use its advanced stealth and passive collection intelligence gathering sensors.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMicGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJsb29tYmVyZy5jb20vbmV3cy9hcnRpY2xlcy8yMDIyLTA3LTE3L21pZC1haXItbWFsZnVuY3Rpb25zLWNvbWUtb24tdG9wLW9mLXNwaWNlamV0LXMtZmluYW5jaWFsLXdvZXPSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Mid-Air Malfunctions Come on Top of SpiceJet's Financial Woes,"Why did this happen?

As Vermont navigates its second year amid a spongy moth outbreak scientists face an uncertain future on what the coming years will look like.

The outbreak began last summer and can last for two to five years according to Josh Halman the Forest Health Program Manager for the Vermont Department of Forests Parks and Recreation. Outbreaks typically occur every six to 10 years.

The caterpillar form of the spongy moth formerly known as the gypsy moth strips away huge swaths of leaves — known as defoliation — from several species of trees. They prefer to munch on oak trees but will dine on a range of other hardwoods such as maple apple and birch and will even dabble in softwood trees such as spruce and hemlock.

According to Judy Rosovsky the State Entomologist for Vermont spongy moth defoliation is not likely to kill a tree but the process adds another stressor to the tree’s stored energy. Many trees regrow their leaves in the same season especially hardwood species. Softwood species are more at risk of mortality as a result of defoliation.

In 2021 the Department of Forests mapped just under 51000 acres of defoliation across the state. The Champlain Valley along with the western side of the state was most affected but the defoliation spanned from Franklin to Rutland counties.

The Department of Forests has not determined the overall defoliated acreage this year but Halman reported that defoliation is on the rise from last year with new spots in the southeast corner of the state.

“That was kind of to be expected with what we found with our egg surveys which are our predictive tool that we use in the fall and winter to look at how many eggs were laid in different parts of the state” said Halman.

The state uses aerial mapping to determine the total acreage and Halman says they should have this year’s data by next month.

But even though this year’s defoliation total is proving higher than last year’s Halman said more caterpillars died this year which he referred to as “good news.”

The crawlers’ higher death rate can be attributed to the return of their “natural enemies” said Rosovsky.

The lack of drought conditions is the most notable return. According to the Department of Forests when an environment has more moisture the spongy moth’s natural predator the fungus Entomophaga maimaiga can grow more effectively to maintain the caterpillar population.

Vermont has faced a dry season every year since 2016 said Rosovsky. This spring the state had a much more wet spring than in previous years which helped the fungus control the number of caterpillars.

Rosovsky identifies climate change as a major indicator to the future of spongy moths. “If we continue to get a lot of dry weather we’re going to see a reduction in the fungal population” she said.

But as more areas become affected by the spongy moth Vermonters often look for at-home solutions to stop the mass defoliation.

Vermont Invasives — an online resource developed by the University of Vermont Extension; the Department of Forests Parks and Recreation; the Vermont Department of Environmental Conservation; and the Vermont Chapter of the Nature Conservancy — recommends trapping the caterpillars with burlap during the defoliation stage and scraping the egg masses off of trees in the fall. It also advises putting the caterpillars and eggs into a container of soapy water or alcohol to kill them.

Aerial spraying and chemical controls are also options for those with large infested areas.

Currently the state does take active control measures but offers education and outreach for those impacted by the spongy moths.

Rosovsky also highlighted that spongy moths can easily travel to new places through human-assisted movement and start infestations in previously untouched areas. Spongy moths lay their eggs across varying surfaces including cars bikes outdoor furniture and yard tools.

“When people pack up and move they can inadvertently bring a couple of egg masses with them and start a whole new infestation” Rosovsky said in an email.

While the spongy moth outbreak has its own characteristics and distinctions many scientists make the comparison between them and the forest tent caterpillar.

In 2018 the Department of Forests Parks and Recreation mapped just over 71000 acres of defoliated forest in Vermont due to the forest tent caterpillar.

Additionally forest tent caterpillars prefer to munch on sugar maple trees posing a potential problem for the maple syrup industry. Spongy moths if hungry enough will also dine on sugar maples.

According to Mark Isselhardt a maple specialist at UVM Extension spongy moths could have a negative impact on sap production when combined with other stressors and factors such as drought and weather conditions during the sugaring period.

Depending on when that theoretical tree loses its leaves he said the new leaves “are almost always stunted and less productive in terms of producing new sugar compared to the original settle leaves” Isselhardt said. “They’re just not as efficient at converting sun to sugar.”

Even though spongy moths aren’t as likely to defoliate a tree to the extreme as a forest tent caterpillar Isselhardt says they’re still something to watch out for in the sugarbush.

“Anything that impacts the forest even if it isn’t their crop trees we are concerned about” he said referring to the crop trees of maple sugaring.

But for scientists the answer to what the spongy moth outbreak will look like in the coming years is still undetermined. This year’s egg mass count conducted in the fall will be a good indicator of what to expect said Halman.

“Based on those numbers we’re able to predict whether or not the outbreak has peaked or if it’s in decline or if it’s still increasing” he said. “It’s pretty hard to say right now in July what this is going to look like in the years to come or even next year.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiLWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnBqc3Rhci5jb20vb2JpdHVhcmllcy9waWxzMDI1NTIzN9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Peter Donis Obituary,"Give to a forest in need in their memory

Normally sales for the Sunday show are a little slower. This year that is not the case said Kevin Franklin executive director of the air show (and president of Wright Brothers Aero Inc.)

What essentially remains at this point are general admission tickets both men said in an interview last week.

“I think we’re just about sold out of all of our seating” said Franklin who this spring succeeded longtime Dayton Air Show executive director Terry Grevious.

“It’s been a full court press for the last six months” Buchanan said.

Attendance in a “good year” amounts to about 60000 to 65000 over a weekend. Jacquelyn Powell a show board member as well as president and chief executive of the local Convention and Visitors Bureau has told the Dayton Daily News that the economic impact attached to the annual show goes beyond the $2.32 million in direct spending.

Last year an estimated 40000 people attended the show. That’s down compared to historical averages.

But 2021 was unique — that early July weekend saw light but steady drizzle. And Buchanan and Franklin note that in the space of about a month last spring the show went from an initially announced drive-in format to a more traditional set-up which may have been confusing for would be show-goers.

“We were glad just to get a show in last year” Buchanan said.

This year he expects a greater number of static or ground displays. He points to the expected appearance of the de Havilland Vampire making its Dayton debut and Kent Pietsch whom Buchanan called one of the best “stickflyers” in the country.

Other highlights include familiar favorites such as Tora Tora Tora! the C-130 “Fat Albert” the Air Force F-16 Viper Demo Team an Air Force F-15C Eagle the Army Golden Knights Parachute team and much more.

Of course the U.S. Navy Blue Angels and their six F/A-18 Hornets are headlining this year. The Air Force Thunderbirds and Navy Blue Angels alternate as the show’s top attraction each summer.

The show remains relevant symbolically and practically said Tim Gaffney who was involved with the show as a trustee and an aviation reporter for 35 years.

Flight exhibitions in Dayton stretch back to the early 1900s when the Wright Brothers refined powered piloted flight to the delight of spectators on Huffman Prairie. Well into the 21st century the show continues to reflect the heritage and the character of the community Gaffney said.

It gives thousands of people who work at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base and area defense contractors a chance to see their handiwork he said. Missions anchored at Wright-Patterson see to the development and sustainment of Air Force planes and weapons from cradle to grave.

“That’s what these folks make” Gaffney said. “It’s literally their work that we see on display.”

Gaffney remembered when the F-117 stealth fighter first visited the show as a static display in the early 1990s. The base brought a busload of workers to the show see the Lockheed plane in person.

“I remember one guy saying ‘Yeah I’ve been working on this for years and this is the first time I’ve ever seen it’” Gaffney recalled.

A solar array added to the company’s facility at 11811 E. 51st St. became operational last week. The 400 kilowatts of power will produce roughly 20% of the annual electricity needs for that 110000-square-foot building said David Rossi senior manager for the Atlanta-based Cox Enterprises’ engineering and sustainability team.

“Through clean renewable power coming from the sun it allows us reduce our carbon impact for this one facility by over 580 tons of carbon per year” Rossi said by phone.

Cox which employs about 500 people in Tulsa has sunk more than $130 million nationally in conservation and sustainability efforts since the start of Cox Conserves the company’s national sustainability program in 2007 he said. The company has done 53 solar projects nationwide in the past 15 years said Gene Coleman who manages operation and maintenance for the company’s renewable assets.

The Tulsa installation encompasses 900 roughly 20-square-foot panels Rossi said. The system also has five inverters devices that convert direct current electricity which a solar panel generates to alternating current which the electric grid uses.

“If there happens to be a time say on a weekend or a holiday when our facility is mostly vacant there could be some times when we push power back to the grid and share that renewable energy with the community” Rossi said. “But more than likely it’s all behind the meter which is true distributed generation with the intent that this power comes to our facility directly.”

Oklahoma ranks 45th nationally in solar energy with 0.18% of the state’s energy coming from the sun according to the Solar Energy Industries Association.

The U.S. Energy Information Administration said earlier this year that solar power is on track to account for nearly half of the country’s new electric generation.

In 2022 it expects 46.1 gigawatts of new utility-scale electric generating capacity to be added to the U.S. power grid. Almost half of the planned 2022 capacity additions are solar followed by natural gas at 21% and wind at 17%.

Since the mid-2000s the the federal government has incentivized homeowners and businesses to switch to solar through an investment tax credit also known as the federal solar tax credit. Currently it allows consumers to claim 26% of the total cost of their solar system installation on their federal taxes.

“Really just three years ago was when the door kind of opened up” Rossi said. “The price of solar has come down enough where we can start to work in areas where just a few years ago wouldn’t have penciled out for a project.”

Those areas of concentration have moved from the coasts to the middle of the country.

“California is a no-brainer for us financially” he said. “Their cost of power is extremely high and I can really make a pencil project there. But their grid is so green I don’t get a whole lot of carbon reduction from the same size project in California as I do in Oklahoma.

“While not as cost-effective in Oklahoma the carbon reduction we get from this project is quite extensive compared to the same-size project we can get elsewhere in the country.”

Tens of thousands of horseshoe crabs die every year along the East Coast as a result of such biomedical harvesting according to the Atlantic States Marine Fisheries Commission  while studies have found that the crabs after being bled move more slowly become less active and appear to spawn less frequently.

Charles River Laboratories is one of just four companies in the United States — and now the second on the Cape — licensed to harvest the blood of horseshoe crabs for a valuable component that’s used to identify harmful bacteria during the testing of new drugs..

HARWICH — Between the local dump and highway in a nondescript building that lacks any indication of who occupies it one of the world’s largest pharmaceutical companies recently began harvesting the milky-blue blood of an ancient creature plucked from the beaches and bays around Cape Cod.

The bleeding of crabs combined with their use as bait and losses to their coastal habitat has led them to be listed as “vulnerable” by the International Union for Conservation of Nature which maintains the world’s most comprehensive list of threatened species. The group considers the crabs “endangered” in the Gulf of Maine and the Mid-Atlantic areas that include Cape Cod though officials in Massachusetts have cited surveys suggesting the region’s population has increased.

Charles River began harvesting the crabs’ blood here last month after a series of lawsuits and bad publicity cast a pall over similar work in South Carolina. The state permit allows the multibillion-dollar company to harvest the blood from hundreds of thousands of horseshoe crabs a year in Massachusetts. Company officials wouldn’t say how many they plan to bleed or how much they expect to earn from the harvest.

They downplay their impact on a species that has survived for nearly 500 million years comparing their facility to a “spa” and describing the helmet-shaped aquatic arthropods as “donating” their valuable blood before most are returned safely to the wild.

“We’re stewards of horseshoe crabs” said Birgit Girshick the company’s chief operating officer who refused to let the Globe observe the Harwich operation. “We’re really proud of what we do. It’s all about patient safety.”

Environmental advocates have long raised concerns about the practice which one company has been doing for 50 years on the Cape and worry that allowing another facility to harvest their blood could gravely endanger the horseshoe crabs. The advocates contend the mortality rate is far higher than Charles River officials or regulators say and the mud-colored creatures’ ability to spawn can be harmed.

Diminishing the horseshoe crab population they say could have significant ecological consequences for a range of other species throughout the Cape’s fragile ecosystem and beyond including endangered shorebirds that rely on their eggs.

Advocates also note that Massachusetts unlike other states has few rules to protect horseshoe crabs.

“We are concerned that Massachusetts horseshoe crab populations might not be able to withstand the expected increase in harvest” said Mark Faherty science coordinator at Mass Audubon’s Wellfleet Bay Wildlife Sanctuary which conducts surveys of the horseshoe crab population on Cape Cod.

Faherty and others also raised concerns about Charles River’s record in South Carolina where they were sued two years ago for harvesting blood from crabs poached from a national wildlife refuge. This year they were sued for storing the crabs in long-term holding ponds before being bled depriving threatened shore birds such as red knots from dining on their nutrient-rich eggs.

“Anyone who cares about natural resources in Massachusetts should be alarmed by Charles River’s plans to open a bleeding facility there” said Catherine Wannamaker a senior attorney at the Southern Environmental Law Center one of the groups that sued the company.

Though company officials have been secretive about the amount of crabs they bleed Foster Jordan the company’s senior vice president last year acknowledged that Charles River bled up to 150000 a year in South Carolina.

The growing demand for their product as well as the backlash in South Carolina may have led Charles River to start harvesting operations in Massachusetts advocates say. The company uses the crabs’ blood — which is blue because of its copper content — to test more than half of the world’s injectable drugs and medical devices such as IV bags and dialysis solutions.

“The Massachusetts population is already under pressure; Charles River will only tighten the squeeze” said Christian Hunt an attorney with Defenders of Wildlife an environmental advocacy group that also sued Charles River.

State officials however say the population of horseshoe crabs in Massachusetts is rebounding making it safe for the company to harvest their blood. They issued a permit to Charles River that allows the company to bleed as many as 1000 crabs a day per licensed biomedical harvester. Company officials declined to say how many harvesters they plan to work with.

State officials also pointed to surveys done every spring for decades that show female horseshoe crabs at a near high in abundance. However a similar state survey in the fall — which officials didn’t acknowledge until the Globe asked about it — shows the number of female crabs actually decreasing substantially over the past five years.

Others said the surveys don’t account for the historical decline of the species in the region. “Compared to [that] plenty today’s spawning beaches are a desert” said Deborah Cramer author of “The Narrow Edge” which chronicles how red knots rely on horseshoe crab eggs for food.

When asked how many total crabs they’ll allow to be bled state officials wouldn’t provide an answer saying such data are subject to “state and federal confidentiality laws.” Associates of Cape Cod the other company that harvests horseshoe crab blood on the Cape also wouldn’t release the number of crabs they bleed.

“The division is prohibited from releasing the data” said Troy Wall a spokesman for state’s Executive Office of Energy and Environmental Affairs noting the state allows some 165000 additional crabs a year to be caught and sold for bait.

Wall added that state regulations don’t limit the number of crabs the company can bleed because it’s a “catch and release fishery that has limited mortality.”

Since bled crabs are rarely tracked after they’re released scientists and environmental advocates say it’s hard to know for sure how many crabs actually die or are otherwise harmed as a result of the bleeding which drains large amounts of their blood.

Charles River officials told the Globe that just 4 percent of their crabs die before being returned to the wild; however the South Carolina Department of Natural Resources has estimated more than 20 percent of female crabs die within two weeks of being bled by the company.

In its most recent stock assessment of horseshoe crabs the Atlantic States Marine Fisheries Commission which monitors the health of the species estimated that 15 percent die as a result of the bleeding process. Other estimates have found nearly one-third of females die after undergoing the procedure.

Charles River officials have defended the additional pressure on the species contending that the good from preventing the contamination of drugs outweighs the environmental impact. But there are now synthetic substitutes that rival companies say could reduce and eventually eliminate the need to rely on the crabs’ blood which has been used for testing drugs since the 1970s.

One pharmaceutical giant that has received government permission for a synthetic alternative Eli Lilly has used its substitute to test COVID-19 antibody drugs.

“It is scientifically sound a sustainable alternative to the animal-sourced testing” said Carrie Munk a spokeswoman for Eli Lilly noting the synthetic version has been approved by health authorities in other countries and could eventually be manufactured in sufficient quantities to replace the crabs’ blood.

Officials at Charles River said they’re developing their own synthetic versions but it would take years before they were ready and widely adopted.

“The synthetics we’ve tested are not sensitive enough to ensure patient safety” Girshick said. “We’re actually pushing for a synthetic ourselves and spending a lot of money to get there.”

Until then she said the company will be harvesting the blood from horseshoe crabs.

But his time at the University of Missouri-St. Louis prepared him for an unexpected career in information technology.

Eimer comes from a big family and is the youngest of 10 siblings. He was raised in Fenton Missouri and could actually see the Maritz complex being built from his home but he never imagined that would be the place where he’d start his professional life.

His family didn’t have much but he had drive. And with the help of a program that assisted youth in getting summer jobs Eimer landed a position working at Maritz in the corporate library as an assistant while in high school.

“I always joke that we didn’t have the silver spoon but we went out and earned it” Eimer said. “You have to kind of pull yourself up by your bootstraps and figure out how to do stuff.”

Eimer eventually developed a rapport with one of the librarians. He started helping her with her computer and then began assisting her colleagues.

Noticing his aptitude for this work the librarian told him about the college tuition assistance program at Maritz that helped full-time employees earn degrees.

In his senior year of high school Eimer began working as a co-op employee in the Maritz library full-time. After graduation he started attending St. Louis Community College–Meramec then transferred to UMSL where he got his BSBA in information systems and technology in 1992.

The assistance from Maritz was the first step on a journey that’s led him to his current role as the senior director of IT ERP at Charter Communications where he leads an IST team and offers enterprise scale software solutions.

Because of his experience at UMSL Eimer has stayed connected to the university even hiring several UMSL graduates over the years and serving on the IST Advisory Board. His connectedness to the university is also generational as he has two nephews and a niece who participated in the IST program to augment their learning and careers.

Brad Eimer graduated with his BSBA in information systems and technology last year and had a similarly positive experience as he followed in his uncle’s footsteps.

“I really enjoyed my time at UMSL“ Brad said. “I was able to learn and work with faculty who genuinely cared about our progress. I feel that UMSL and the program I completed prepared me to enter the work force.”

Joe Eimer believes a solid education directly impacts one’s quality of life.

“I’m a big believer in higher education” he said. “It offers a bigger opportunity for growth and upward mobility.”

As an advisory board member he has helped the IST department with strategy curricula research and service. He is consistently trying to find ways to make the department as effective for students as possible to prepare them for employment just as he was prepared upon entering the business world as a new graduate.

Eimer helped update the curriculum to provide practical job skills such as project management to give UMSL IST students an advantage over competitors.

“The curriculum matters as a practitioner because if you like to hire the students you want them to be learning things that are relevant and you want them to learn it the right way” Eimer said. “So my first interest when I got on the advisory board was curriculum.”

Eimer is in his third year on the IST Advisory Board and served one year as president helping lead its strategic planning. That was critical for the department’s five-year review as well as the accreditation review by the Association to Advance Collegiate Schools of Business which noted that the ISTAB served as a model industry standard.

His work throughout his career and with the advisory board earned him a Salute to Business Achievement award which he received in April.

“Joe has volunteered countless hours through the Information Systems Technology Advisory Board to create bridges between the IST department’s faculty students and St. Louis businesses” said Dinesh Mirchandani professor and chair of the Department of Information Systems and Technology. “He not only helped improve the curriculum of the department including initiatives in business intelligence and cybersecurity but also spearheaded community outreach efforts including the department’s summer camps and hackathons.”

In addition to serving on the IST advisory board Eimer has demonstrated his commitment to UMSL by performing exit interviews with graduating UMSL seniors and helping incorporate feedback into the IST department.

Eimer also helped launch an IST Alumni Affinity group in 2019 to connect with other alumni and coordinated fundraising efforts that involved applying for the Spectrum Employee Community Grant.

Growing up there was no accountability and little guidance regarding his education something he decided to give to others.

“I feel like jobs and education are so important” Eimer said. “But I think there are other things that go with it like having somebody to support you or hold you accountable – to give you that vision.”

Vision and opportunity are two things Eimer attempts to provide for any students or young people he encounters through working with the advisory board and his volunteer work with STL Youth Jobs. Giving back is a major part of his lifestyle a means of showing gratitude for his opportunities.

“It was my university so I wanted to give back to the same place that gave me so much” he said. “I just asked ‘How can I help?’”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmN0aW5zaWRlci5jb20vYnVzaW5lc3MvYXJ0aWNsZS9DVC1vZmZpY2UtbWFya2V0LXJlY292ZXJpbmctZnJvbS1DT1ZJRC0xNzMwODE2Ni5waHDSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,CT office market recovering from pandemic but 'clear bifurcation of demand' emerges,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.ctinsider.com/business/article/CT-office-market-recovering-from-COVID-17308166.php on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmN0aW5zaWRlci5jb20vYnVzaW5lc3MvYXJ0aWNsZS9DVC1vZmZpY2UtbWFya2V0LXJlY292ZXJpbmctZnJvbS1DT1ZJRC0xNzMwODE2Ni5waHDSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,,,,,,,,,

Worship attendance small group attendance and baptisms were up last year in the SBC’s annual statistical report released Tuesday while membership fell below 13 million.

2023 marks 17 straight years of decline for the country’s biggest Protestant denomination. It’s down 3.3 million from its peak with the steepest drops coming during the pandemic. The SBC lost 1.3 million members between 2020 and 2022 alone.

Beyond COVID-19 disruptions Southern Baptists have recently confronted some contentious issues within their convention responding to sexual abuse and clamping down on female preachers which have led some congregations to leave the SBC (including prominent megachurch Saddleback Church).

But statistics indicate that church departures aren’t a significant driver of membership decline; the SBC was down 292 churches last year just 0.63 percent of its total.

In 2023 membership fell by 241000 its smallest decrease since 2018. Yet attendance at SBC churches increased 6.5 percent reaching above 4 million a week for the first time since the pandemic.

Attendance at small groups and Bible studies ticked up 4 percent to 2.4 million.

With fewer Americans than ever attending church and religious disaffiliation on the rise leaders see even small increases in engagement and discipleship as worth celebrating.

It’s the first time in over a decade that SBC worship attendance has grown two years in a row though it still lags behind pre-pandemic numbers. Back in 2019 SBC churches saw over 5 million show up each Sunday.

“Outreach and discipleship are difficult today. They require time and commitment when our culture offers numerous distractions and alternatives. The pandemic was discouraging as fewer people engaged in these activities” said Scott McConnell executive director of Lifeway Research which releases the annual report.

“But as people have re-engaged and new people are participating there is much to celebrate in Southern Baptist churches today while we invite more to join.”

Baptisms the key metric for Southern Baptists also grew for the second year in a row.

“God has been stirring the waters and an upswing in baptisms has solidly begun” wrote SBC president Bart Barber a pastor in Texas.

“Not only have we experienced a second year of increased baptisms but we have also witnessed a year-over-year gain—25.94 percent more baptisms than in 2022—that leaves no room for doubt about what God is doing among our churches.”

Kevin Ezell president of the North American Mission Board said the baptism trend is widespread across regions. Out of 41 state conventions 35 reported more baptisms in 2023 than 2022.

“Pastors are the difference makers here” he said in a statement. “Despite all the distractions and challenges out there they are keeping the focus on evangelism and encouraging new believers to follow up with baptism.”

The report’s release falls about a month before the SBC’s annual meeting which gathers over 10000 messengers in Indianapolis in June. They are slated to address new mechanisms for overseeing abuse reform and reporting as well as clarifications to cooperation agreements and guidance around women in ministry.

The SBC’s current membership of 12982090 is the lowest since 1976. The membership size peaked at 16.3 million in 2006.

One bright spot leaders say is the generosity of members and churches who spent nearly $800 million on missions last year up 9 percent.

“We are sharing the gospel with more people gathering for worship and Bible study in increasing numbers giving billions to support churches serving communities across our country and sending millions to support mission enterprises around the world” said Jeff Iorg the SBC Executive Committee president-elect.

“Southern Baptists are not a perfect people” he added. “But we are a movement making a positive difference in our world and our most recent statistical report underscores this reality and motivates us to press forward.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNsdHJpYi5jb20vcmVsaWdpb24vMjAyNC8wNS8wNy9sZHMtd29tZW4tY2h1cmNoLWxlYWRlcnMtd2hlbi1kaWQv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,LDS women push back — again — against an address delivered by a Relief Society leader,"(The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints) Speaking on Friday at Brigham Young University’s Women’s Conference President Camille Johnson leader of the global Relief Society of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints explained that even though she worked outside the home her priority has always been motherhood.

For the second time in less than two months Latter-day Saint women have taken to social media to push back against an address delivered by a top female church leader.

Speaking on Friday at Brigham Young University’s Women’s Conference President Camille Johnson leader of the global Relief Society of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints encouraged women to rely on the words of President Russell M. Nelson and emphasized the need for women to prioritize motherhood.

“My primary orientation — that is my focus passion and calling as a woman — is toward motherhood” Johnson a former corporate lawyer said. “That is our primary orientation our sacred calling as daughters of Heavenly Parents.”

The Salt Lake Tribune submitted questions to a church spokesperson for the 60-year-old Johnson including how she and her husband managed child care while they both worked and her advice for Latter-day Saint women interested in pursuing a career but who feel guilty for doing so. No responses were provided.

“I had babies and my husband and I loved and nurtured them while we were both working” Johnson told her worldwide audience Friday. “It was busy sometimes hectic. We were stretched and sometimes tired. I supported him and he supported me. Family was and still is our top priority.”

Senior apostle Dallin Oaks Nelson’s top counselor in the governing First Presidency and next in line to lead the 17.2 million-member faith spoke on similar themes in a 2023 devotional. The 91-year-old father of six warned young single adults against delaying marriage and childbearing even for financial reasons.

He was among the first to comment on the church’s Instagram post quoting Johnson’s talk calling the Relief Society president a “wonderful role model.”

(The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints) President Dallin H. Oaks of the First Presidency of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints and wife Kristen speak to young adults at a worldwide devotional broadcast in May 2023. The couple urged young adults to stop delaying marriage and parenthood.

Some commenters however worried the call to prioritize motherhood could leave women particularly vulnerable to financial insecurity.

“Approaching 40 I have seen enough faithful LDS women abandoned by their husbands and left to care for their children — all with weak educational degrees starting from scratch and barely scraping by” wrote @anniemangelson. “Too many women and children end up in absolute crisis having simply ‘followed the prophet.’ We have to quit teaching like this and setting some women up for failure.”

And as many commenters pointed out Johnson’s own decision to pursue a career conflicted with previous prophetic counsel discouraging women from work that took them away from their husbands and children.

“I’m grateful for this message and example” said user @jsmileybug. “However I’m 25 and this is the very first time I’ve EVER heard a church leader suggest it’s acceptable for [mothers] to work outside the home.”

What Kimball and Benson said

(The Salt Lake Tribune_ President Spencer W Kimball of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints sits with apostle Ezra Taft Benson. Both leaders urged women to put motherhood ahead of careers.

Some of the more than 2000 comments pointed to the words of former President Spencer W. Kimball spoken in 1977 and shared a decade later during a Brigham Young University fireside by then-President Ezra Taft Benson as the kind of clear direction Johnson would have heard — and not heeded.

“No career approaches in importance that of wife homemaker mother — cooking meals washing dishes making beds for one’s precious husband and children” Benson quoted Kimball as saying. “Come home wives to your husbands. Make home a heaven for them. Come home wives to your children born and unborn.

Several Instagram commenters cited rhetoric like this as their own reason for forfeiting careers and instead having children sooner than they otherwise would have — decisions some said they now regretted. To have Johnson who chose otherwise now lauded as a role model they said was painful to watch.

One user @oils4us wrote that she was in the audience when Benson delivered his dramatic address. Taking the message to heart she said she proceeded to give birth to three children in three years.

“I used to get the BYU alumni magazine and every time I’d cry and feel sad because where was my paragraph?” she wrote. “Where were my accolades for having done what” Benson instructed?

Seeing Johnson praised now she said brought back that same ache.

“The women” she said “who went against the prophet’s very direct counsel get their paragraphs and fulfillment of becoming something else and a mom.”

Neither was the impact of such rhetoric constrained to a single generation.

“I’m sobbing reading this” commented the 35-year-old Linda Hamilton who in an interview with The Tribune said she gave up her dream of becoming a writer to devote herself to her family.

These days she mourns “for younger me. She gave up all her dreams and ambitions because she truly thought God would only accept her if she obeyed the prophets exactly.”

It’s not that Hamilton who lives in Southern California doesn’t want the church to celebrate working women. Rather she wishes Johnson and other church leaders would acknowledge that doing so represents a major break from the past.

Hamilton is hardly alone.

The ‘right thing to do’

(The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints) Relief Society General President Camille Johnson speaks at the European Union Parliament in Brussels in March 2024 on religious liberty for women.

“This would have been an even more beautiful message if it was coupled with an apology” wrote @ariabethards “to all the women who listened to President Benson and other prophets who pressured women into letting go of education and career dreams to stay home as housewives.”

Others meanwhile didn’t seem to know what to think in response to the talk.

“I’m starting to feel so confused” wrote @jameeandelin. “On the one hand I’m so happy that Camille Johnson listened to her own intuition and authority to make decisions for her life. …But I know someone who was not given a temple recommend because they chose to work instead of stay at home at the time. It’s so unfair. I don’t get it.”

Still others saw in the sermon an opportunity to emphasize the importance of following Johnson’s example and carving one’s own path.

“Let this celebratory post of a woman in the church choosing to go against the brethren” @edge_of_inside wrote “stand as a shining example to the rest of us that following our own personal revelation and authority will always be the right thing to do.”

The comments are reminiscent of the more than 13000 responses engendered by a church Instagram post from late March quoting a sermon by Johnson’s first counselor J. Anette Dennis.

In her speech and the associated post Dennis stated “There is no other religious organization in the world that I know of that has so broadly given power and authority to women.”

The women represented in the comments were less convinced arguing that their experience in the patriarchal faith did not align with Dennis’ description.

A Grade II* listed church is to be redesignated as a Minster in recognition of its work in the community.

St Mary le Tower in Ipswich will be given the status next year to coincide with the 825th anniversary of the town being granted a Royal Charter by King John.

The charter was signed by the King in the churchyard in 1200 - although the building was largely rebuilt in the mid 19th Century.

The Church of England in Suffolk made the official announcement on Thursday.

What is a minster?

The status of Minster is bestowed on major churches of regional significance within the Church of England.

The term dates back to the 7th Century and the status helps reflect the church's importance and contribution to the local communities it serves.

In the past 30 years just 15 churches have been granted the status nationally and in total there are only 31 Minsters in England.

Some of these include Hull Minster Lincoln Cathedral and York Minster.

The name of St Mary le Tower will remain in this case the church said.

Why is St Mary le Tower being granted Minster status?

St Mary le Tower earns the status as a vital contributor to local community life.

As well as church services and choral performances that encourage participation from young people it offers a ""top up shop"" for local residents facing financial hardship.

The church has a regular weekly food delivery from FairShare and also now collects additional food from a local supermarket.

A small number of essential toiletries are also generously provided from FIND and church members.

'Community work'

The Bishop of St Edmundsbury and Ipswich the Rt Revd Martin Seeley made the announcement following months of wide-ranging consultation to assess whether St Mary le Tower should receive this designation.

According to the church the decision ""sets in motion a development plan to strengthen St Mary le Tower's response to the needs of people living in and visiting central Ipswich"".

There will be no change to the way the church is governed or financed and there is no change to its legal status or name.

The honour acknowledges the church's work in the local community and does not alter its relationship with neighbouring churches.

What does Minster status mean for Ipswich?

The Bishop of St Edmundsbury and Ipswich the Rt Revd Martin Seeley said the church would continue to serve the local community [Church of England Suffolk]

The Bishop of St Edmundsbury and Ipswich the Rt Revd Martin Seeley said this recognition was ""a sign of the continued commitment to strengthen the ties between the Church and our civic and community partners as together we seek to service the people of Ipswich.

""I look forward to the new ways in which all churches including the newly created Ipswich Minster will be a part of the transformation and flourishing of the town’s future"" he added.

""Now we will focus on the minster-making process and share those important details in due course.""

The Reverend Tom Mumford vicar of St Mary le Tower said their mission was ""to be a welcoming inclusive and open church offering peace and sanctuary to the people of Ipswich"".

""We want to be a place that the people of Ipswich know as their home a place of care and support"" he explained.

""We also want to be a place that people come to Ipswich to visit to enjoy the beautiful and historic building as well as the remarkable town in which it is set.""

'A new chapter'

The Mayor of Ipswich Lynne Mortimer said the move was a ""testament both to the rich heritage and spiritual significance of St Mary le Tower to the town"".

She added it marked a ""new chapter"" in the life of the church.

Terry Baxter BID chair of Ipswich Central similarly welcomed the news.

""The church is currently recognised as the civic focal point for many in the town centre and plays such an important role in engaging with the people of Ipswich"" he said.

John Dugmore chief executive of the Suffolk Chamber of Commerce said Minster status gave the church ""an even more important role .. in bringing together the county town’s incredibly diverse communities"".

Here's what that means for the organization's future,"Bishop Karen Oliveto is retiring in a few months as a United Methodist bishop.

Oliveto was emotional saying those words aloud. As the church's first openly gay bishop her path was not always certain.

""Every day of my ministry I've had to wonder is this the day my ordination will be taken from me?"" Oliveto said.

That is until this year's United Methodist General Conference the church's global legislative body voted to overturn every ban on LGBTQ people. The historic changes include a new definition of marriage as a lifelong covenant between ""two people of faith"" rather than solely between a man and a woman and a repeal of its ban on LGBTQ clergy.

The General Conference also struck down a 52-year-old stance on homosexuality being ""incompatible with Christian teaching.""

""To hear someone say 'we need to repent of the harm we've done.' I didn't realize my body was waiting for that"" said Oliveto.

The changes which are effective immediately open new doors for LGBTQ members. One 24-year-old who wished to go by J.M. is working toward becoming ordained as a deacon in the United Methodist Church.

""We have been here and we have been fighting and our fight has been worth it"" they said. ""It shows that progress can happen and has happened.""

J.M. said they felt they needed to navigate around their identity as part of the LGBTQ community and not address it directly until the General Conference.

""Queer kids … the church once told them 'you're loved' but then made that love conditional when they started to question their sexual orientation or gender identity"" said Oliveto. ""They're going to hear 'We love you. We want you to be who God made you to be.' That is huge. Lives will be saved.""

The General Conference overwhelmingly supported the end of anti-LGBTQ church laws after more than 7600 mostly conservative congregations chose to disaffiliate from the United Methodist Church by the end of last year. That equates to about a quarter of U.S. Methodist churches.

Those U.S. congregations were able to leave because of a 2019 special General Conference that passed a plan for congregations that wished to depart for ""reasons of conscience"" regarding human sexuality.

There was widespread joy and celebration at the General Conference that concluded on Friday but there are still global members including those from central conferences in Africa Europe and the Philippines who do not stand by the new changes.

Some African delegates protested after the vote on changing the church's stance on marriage according to the United Methodist News Service.

Reverend Jerry Kulah a delegate from Liberia said at the rally ""We do not believe we know better than the Bible.""

The General Conference also passed a constitutional amendment known as worldwide regionalization which means many congregations that disagree with the church's new inclusive stance on LGBTQ people will likely be able to make adjustments that fit their beliefs.

Regional conferences could customize parts of the Book of Discipline which outlines church laws instead of needing to conform to judgments dominated by the U.S. That includes the ordination and marriage of LGBTQ members.

The regionalization amendment must receive support from at least two-thirds of annual conference voters who are part of local governing bodies. The votes will likely not be finalized until late next year.

Even with regionalization at play some congregations may choose to depart the United Methodist Church.

Many congregations that left by the end of 2023 joined the Global Methodist Church which launched in May of 2022 and has rules against LGBTQ ordination and marriage.

Keith Boyette a former United Methodist Church member who is overseeing the Global Methodist Church during its transitional period said the Global Methodist Church now has more than 4500 churches about 90% of which are in the U.S. It will hold its General Conference in San Jose Costa Rica in September.

Boyette does not think regionalization will be helpful for the United Methodist Church.

""I believe in the long run there will be a decline in the membership of the United Methodist Church because of the decisions it has made"" he said.

But Bishop Karen Malone the president of the Council of Bishops of the United Methodist Church is confident regionalization has the ability to strengthen the church.

""It allows for a more contextualized ministry in order to address the specific social and cultural contexts"" she said.

Malone recognizes that some congregations still may decide to leave following the decisions made at the General Conference. But she also believes that ""others will come home"" she said. ""That some were waiting and have left for a season.""

As the church moves forward Malone said there is a renewed spirit of hope with the stance that all people are fully welcomed into the total life of the church.

As Oliveto reflects on the changes and prepares for life beyond the ministry she said ""I feel like I'm leaving the church better than I found it."""

They are becoming more unbearable in urban areas where pollution asphalt and a shortage of green regions turn cities into “heat islands” that favor heat stress.

These high temperatures contribute to an increase in pathologies directly related to rising temperatures such as respiratory and cardiac problems or skin diseases related to excessive heat and sweating.

Given that this situation is not likely to improve in the short term (the latest predictions of the World Meteorological Organization revealed that there is a 20% chance that from 2024 onwards global temperatures will rise above the 1.5°C thresholds on average) it is essential to emphasize preventive measures.

Heat stress: how to combat it

Preventive measures offered by organizations such as the Red Cross and the health insurer Cigna during these days of heat wave: 1:

1.-Cigna underlines the effectiveness of early detection because it is very important to know the symptoms produced by heat stress to detect it in time so that the situation does not become more complicated.

Some of the most common symptoms are the acceleration of the cardiac pulse the elevation of the body temperature that can reach up to 42º C (107.6° F) intense fatigue dizziness or dizziness nausea general malaise disorientation or confusion cramps and interruption of sweating.

Among the preventive measures pointed out by Cigna are the expansion of green spaces because trees provide countless benefits for people and the environment for example the generation of oxygen that helps regulate temperature and humidity the fight against pollution the improvement of emotional well-being and physical health the promotion of outdoor life and greater environmental awareness in people.

2.- Adapting the pace and the workplace. One of the main measures to minimize the risk of heat stress is to acclimatize the workplace creating a cool space with low humidity levels through good ventilation or by reducing the indoor temperature.

Also if the work requires a lot of physical effort it is necessary to establish frequent breaks look for cool places to rest wear comfortable loose light-colored clothing and adapt the pace of work to each employee’s tolerance to heat.

3.- Monitor physical and mental exhaustion. In general heat negatively affects the brain. It makes it work worse causing a state of lethargy and constant fatigue due to the overexertion of this organ to self-regulate body temperature.

The rest of the body is also slowed down in any response. Therefore covering the head with a hat scarf or cap to avoid direct exposure to the sun and keeping properly hydrated and drinking water frequently is essential to prevent heat stroke caused by high temperatures.

Experts recommend drinking a glass of cool water (12ºC) every 15-20 minutes even if you are not thirsty and in small quantities.

4.- Light and easy-to-digest meals. Cigna also reminds us that food is essential at any time of the year especially in sweltering weather.

In the case of summer it is very important to eat foods rich in water such as vegetables and fruit as they are nutritious healthy and refreshing.

It is recommended to reduce the consumption of alcoholic and sugary drinks as they provide empty nutrients and contribute to dehydration of the body.

5.- Sleep well to live better. The ideal for quality and healthy sleep is to sleep between 7 and 9 hours which translates into better productivity and concentration and improves the immune system.

When the thermometer soars it is advisable to use light sheets avoid caffeine consumption and physical exercise in the hours before sleep or try a warm shower.

A good rest helps the brain to function properly and not to work excessively.

6.- Organize your activities in the street the countryside… and in the face of heat stress refer to the importance of centralizing outdoor activities during the first or last hours of the day and avoiding going out and performing strenuous activities during the hottest hours.

If you have to stay outdoors: try to stay in the shade or away from the heat; wear the recommended clothing accessories (hat sunglasses etc.) and footwear for the heat; apply adequate sun protection to your skin (including lipstick) before exposure (30 minutes before leaving home) and renew it regularly; drink water regularly; eat lightly; cool your head…

7.- They also remind that when leaving on a trip: Do not leave children older adults or animals in parked vehicles. Travel with the air conditioning or open the windows.

Be careful with sudden temperature changes when entering or leaving the car. Hydrate yourself abundantly during the trip.

8.- In case of health problems: Consult with your doctor about additional measures to be taken if you suffer from any disease. Continue taking your medications. Do not self-medicate.

Red Cross also advises keeping in touch with the people considered most vulnerable (calls or visits) to assess their specific situation and prevent severe effects of high temperatures.",,,,,,,,,,,,

Eventually scandals of his own making the impeachment of Bill Clinton and a drubbing in the 1998 midterms forced Gingrich to step down. But he did not leave public life.

The former Georgia congressman ran for the presidential nomination in 2012 seamlessly adapted to the rise of Donald Trump in 2016 and kept on publishing all the while. His latest book the catchily titled Defeating Big Government Socialism comes as his party anticipates another congressional takeover in November.

Tim Miller is another long-term Republican operative if not a frontline politician. He served in a number of GOP campaigns demonstrating media savvy and a knack for opposition research. After Jeb Bush left the presidential race in 2016 Miller emerged as vocal Trump critic. Now in the footsteps of Never Trumpers Rick Wilson and Stuart Stevens he has penned a political memoir. His subtitle – A Travelogue from the Republican Road to Hell – refers to a route many would say was partly paved by Gingrich.

The former speaker’s new book is heavy on familiar bombast and predictably short on introspection. Its opening pages deliver a familiar beat-down of China and its financial allies.

“Many of our elites refuse to even recognize the threat from Beijing” Gingrich writes. “For many it is because they make so much money from China.”

He would have done better to check his own financial disclosures.

By 2018 Newt and Callista Gingrich – ambassador to the Vatican under Trump – had invested at least $100000 and possibly as much as $250000 in certificates of deposit issued by the Bank of China.

For what it’s worth Trump maintained a bank account in China. Further in such spirit of US-Sino amity the late Sheldon Adelson funded Gingrich’s 2012 presidential run with $20m courtesy of the blackjack tables and roulette wheels of his casino in Macau.

In other words Gingrich was cool with China until he wasn’t. Government records also show a $368334 advance for a book with a simple working title: Trump vs China.

Gingrich has long known that reality need not be a constraint. He has compared himself to William Pitt the Younger the British prime minister who was in office for nearly 19 years rather than Gingrich’s four as speaker. Gingrich has also suggested Brad Pitt should play him onscreen.

A little more substantively Gingrich uses his new book to demand fiscal responsibility hammering Joe Biden and the Democrats for budgetary profligacy. The first chapter is titled “Big Government Socialism Isn’t Working and Can’t”. Once again Gingrich should have thought twice.

Gingrich’s presidential run to nowhere doubled as a poor man’s Trump University – the scheme by which Trump pulled in money for a product somewhere between shoddy and non-existent. According to the Federal Elections Commission the Gingrich 2012 campaign remains more than $4.6m in debt. As Business Insider put it “No presidential campaign from any election cycle owes creditors more money.”

As for extravagance in 2011 Gingrich maintained a credit line of between $250001 and $500000 at Tiffany’s the Fifth Avenue jeweler.

On the page Gingrich also blames the left for America’s high Covid death rate – despite significantly lower post-vaccine mortality in Democratic states. So it goes: at a recent rally in Alaska Trump declined to use the word “vaccine” lest he anger the crowd.

In Congress Gingrich wrapped himself in gun rights opposing the assault weapons ban in Clinton’s 1994 anti-crime bill and subsequently sending a written promise to the National Rifle Association that no gun control legislation would be considered as long as he was speaker.

The assault weapons ban expired almost 20 years ago. As Gingrich’s latest book comes out mass shootings fill the headlines. To the author no matter: “The Founding Fathers insisted on the second amendment so that armed citizens would make a dictatorship impossible.”

Amid all this Gingrich calls for civility. In case folks forgot he was the speaker who shut down the government in a snit after he was seated in the back of Air Force One en route to the funeral of Yitzhak Rabin and also called Hillary Clinton a bitch. How will his speakership be remembered? The late Robert Teeter pollster to George HW Bush accurately observed: “Gingrich makes a great backbencher.”

So to Tim Miller. Like Lot’s wife he cannot resist looking back. At the same time he is overly repentant. But his attempt to explain why he stuck with the Republican party for as long as he did is revealing.

Miller lets us know that he is gay married and a dad. His rationales for rejecting his party are understandable but not necessarily satisfying. For him and other Republican operatives the game was fun – until it wasn’t. The metamorphosis of the party of Lincoln into the party of Trump occurred in broad daylight a train wreck a long time coming. The Never Trumpers could have spoken out sooner.

As long ago as 1968 clashes between demonstrators and Chicago police during the 1968 Democratic convention offered a glimpse of simmering cultural tensions. At the same time the discontent and racism voiced by the Alabama governor George Wallace found a home with a Republican party following Richard Nixon’s southern strategy. Fast forward three decades and the 1995 Oklahoma City bombing and Pat Buchanan’s quests for the presidency revealed the darker impulses of the pre-Trump right.

Working-class resentment and pitchfork populism appeared long before the Iraq war and the great recession. The rise of Trumpism seems entirely predictable.

Miller does deliver a searing indictment of officials and appointees who became Trump’s enablers listing no less than 11 categories. His portraits of Lindsey Graham South Carolina’s senior senator and Sean Spicer Trump’s first press secretary are devastating.

“More than anything” he writes Graham “just wanted to be on the golf cart next to Trump. To be on the right hand of the father. Whether or not Trump did as Graham asked was merely icing on the cake.”

As reward for doubling as a human doormat Graham now battles a subpoena from prosecutors in Fulton county Georgia concerning his part in Trump’s attempt to overturn the 2020 election. The senator cloaks himself in congressional immunity and invokes the constitution. It turns out he was fine with attempting to subvert an election but doesn’t like the idea of appearing before a grand jury. Funny that.

As Miller puts it the same obsequious spirit made Spicer a peddler of lies for the ages “happy to put up with Trump’s lunacy as long as he became a star. He didn’t see anything wrong with shining a poison apple … And you’d better believe he’d do it all over again.”

Both Gingrich and Spicer may get another chance to ride the Trump rodeo. The 45th president is gearing up for 2024. By then Biden and Gingrich will be octogenarians Trump 78. Who says America is no country for old men?

Di Sepanjang pesisir pantai hanya batu berukuran kecil hingga besar tertata secara alami. Mungkin karena banyak batu Pulau Hiri kurang mendapat perhatian serius dari pemerintah karena pertimbangan ekonomis. Kira-kira begitu. Namun di balik itu semua terdapat sisi unik dari pilihan-pilihan hidup dan interaksi manusia yang berlangsung di pulau ini. Kita perlu membuka kesempatan seluas mungkin dalam melihat salah satunya melalui cerita tentang Fiko sapaan akrab pemuda Dorari Isa bernama lengkap Taufik Ayub.

Penggemar berat AC MILAN klub sepak bola asal Italia itu sejak Sekolah Dasar mahir mengerjakan soal matematika. Jangan ragu kalau hitung-hitungan. Saya angkat topi kalau perkara ini. Fiko menempuh pendidikan SD di kampung halaman Dorari Isa dan memilih meneruskan langkahnya bersama SMP 10 Kota Ternate di Togolobe. Seiring perjalanan waktu setelah lulus tahun 2009 dari SMA Makugawene di Sulamadaha tahun 2010 ia masuk jurusan Matematika di STKIP Kie Raha dalam keadaan serba terbatas.

Dalam ingatan saya sebagai teman sekaligus saudara bakat seseorang bisa terbentuk melalui masa transisi seperti ini setidaknya saya lihat dari potensi dan kondisi saudara Fiko. Tiga tahun kuliah bukanlah jaminan masa depan mengarungi hidup. Apalagi dalam rezim sertifikasi yang ketat saat ini. Berlatar keluarga sederhana dari masyarakat pesisir Dorari Isa membuat dirinya meninggalkan bangku kuliah pada tahun 2013. Keputusan yang sangat berkonsekuensi tetapi didasari pertimbangan matang.

Fiko kemudian menikahi gadis berdarah Faudu dan setahun setelah hengkang dari pendidikan formal ia menjatuhkan pilihan mengelola potensi alam Dorari Isa menjadi Petani Muda bergabung bersama kelompok Tani Mariolaha yang bergerak menumbuhkan tanaman holtikultura. Kelompok ini diketuai Dahlan Toniku termasuk di dalamnya ibu kandung sebagai anggota kelompok. Sepintas riwayat kehidupan orang Dorari Isa-Tafraka petani bukan mata pencaharian utama. Bekerja sebagai nelayan (Soma/Kalase) merupakan hal paling diminati tua dan muda. Ini seperti menghipnotis generasianak-anak muda bahkan yang masih SMP atau SMA sudah ikut-ikutan melaut bersama orang tua dan sanak saudaranya.

Salah satu tokoh pemuda Dorari Isa Irwan Basri dalam suatu percakapan dengan saya sekitar dua tahun lalu mengatakan Kalase itu bagus karena menyatukan warga tetapi pekerjaan ini berpengaruh kuat terhadap tingkat pendidikan generasi khususnya di Dorari Isa dan Tafraka. Banyak dari mereka putus sekolah karena tenggelam dalam keasyikan mengikuti Kalase. Barulaha pada tahun sekian ketika Menteri Perikanan dan Kelautan Republik Indonesia mengeluarkan kebijakan pelarangan khususnya jenis alat tangkap jaring (Kalase) karena dianggap merusak ekosistem laut (Baca: alat tangkap nelayan).

Transformasi pekerjaan warga akibat kebijakan struktural ini begitu terasa di Soa Dorari Isa. Dari sebelumnya bermayoritas sebagai nelayan warga berbondong mengais rezki melalui pekerjaan kuli bangunan di pelbagai tempat penggali pasir tanah (Duwong Kaha) di wilayah diantara Dorari Isa dan Tomajiko mulai mendirikan kelompok tani hingga menjadi tukang ojek (baik di Hiri maupun di Ternate). Pasca kebijakan Kementerian Perikanan dan Kelautan memberi peta kebertahanan ekonomi masyarakat Dorari Isa yang ”terpaksa” menggeluti pelbagai profesi untuk beberapa tahun.

Barulah dalam dua atau tiga tahun terakhir ini potensi perikanan mulai masif lagi di kampung ini dengan kehadiran kelompok nelayan (Pajeko). Secara sosiologis pekerjaan nelayan di Dorari Isa membuka interaksi antar generasi begitu besar. Solidaritas warga diikat dengan aktivitas melaut yang sudah terwarisi beberapa generasi di belakang.

Lelaki 31 tahun itu selain harus menghidupi anak dan istri ia juga bertanggung jawab atas Ibu dan biaya pendidikan adik semata wayang Sasmita Ayub. Ada hal diluar nalar kebanyakan anak muda Pulau Hiri yang terpatri dalam diri seorang Fiko. Ketika pergeseran ruang ekonomi dan peminatan untuk mengenyam pendidikan formal semakin besar bagi kalangan anak muda Fiko memilih bertahan di kampung mengelola potensi alam perkebunan dengan topografi dan struktur tanah-tanah bebatuan Dorari Isa.

Ini bukan hal gampang untuk ukuran seorang pemuda di Soa Dorari Isa yang mayoritasnya sudah lama “terpapar” mata pencaharian nelayan. Butuh etos kultural yang sanggup “memanenkan” cipta dan karsa orang Kepulauan dalam “rumah” sendiri. Hanya orang-orang (pemuda) bermental kuat yang dapat melakukan ini.

Sekarang ini semua serba cepat. Generasi muda kebanyakan ingin hidup “instan” tidak mau berproses bekerja keras menghadapi tangan zaman. Mental konsumtif mendominasi watak produktif. Terlihat dari Jumlah penduduk berpendidikan formal meningkat impian menjadi Pegawai Negeri makin luas dan ketergantungan semacam ini sudah menjelaskan mayoritas kita ketika berpendidikan formal. Apalagi imingan kerja di perusahaan tambang ribuan sarjana berlomba-lomba menjadi buruh di investor asing dalam negeri sendiri di Maluku Utara. Fakta ini mengonfirmasi jika menjadi pekerja keras dan tekun menjadi petani bukanlah impian dasar anak muda masa kini.

Bisa jadi petani dianggap tidak “tren” atau tidak “gaul” atau bukan generasi “milenial” kesemuanya itu merupakan bahasa bias strata sosial. Hasil dari tata ekonomi yang terus memengaruhi struktur sosial masyarakat lokal. Jika jeli memahami tren menjadi PNS atau bekerja di perusahaan tambang di dalamnya ada relasi dominasi hegemoni eksploitasi dan ketidakadilan. Apa yang disebut bekerja di ruang publik saat ini tidak lepas dari resiko: baik resiko kecelakaan maupun resiko tidak dipandang setara atas prinsip-prinsip kemanusiaan dan keadilan.

Melalui lahan pertanian di Dorari Isa Fiko memberi kita tanda kemandirian secara ekonomi dan budaya. Betapa tidak dalam konteks Kota Ternate menanam Tomat Rica dan Sayuran merupakan tindakan berbudaya yang mengurangi relasi ketergantungan dengan daerah lain. Dinas Pertanian Kota Ternate memperlihatkan untuk kebutuhan Tomat dan rica (Cabe) dipasok oleh petani lokal sekitar 80 persen tetapi bukan berarti hilang ketergantungan pasokan dari Sulawesi (tandaseru.com 2022). Walau demikian kontribusi para Petani lokal terhadap kebutuhan warga Kota Ternate tak bisa dipandang sepele.

Pada tahun 2022 akumulasi lahan garapan budidaya holtikultura di Kota Ternate seluas 10 hektar tersebar di 6 kecamatan dengan jumlah produksi tomat mencapai 70 ton (rri.co.id 2022). Dinas Pertanian menyebut untuk kebutuhan Cabai ada 11 titik lahan budidaya pertanian yang disiapkan dengan target produksi sekitar 50 ton stok cabai hasil garapan petani lokal (tandaseru.com 2022). Sedangkan Jumlah produksi terbesar untuk tanaman Tomat dan Cabai dipasok dari kecamatan Ternate Barat.

Jumlah ini dirasa mencukupi kebutuhan warga kota selain memerhatikan fluktuatifnya harga pasar karena pasokan dan permintaan sering tidak seimbang terlebih menjelang momen-momen tertentu di Kota Ternate.

Hal tersebut bisa dipahami dari penurunan pasokan tomat dari petani lokal Ternate per 9 Juni 2022 yang hanya dibawah 50 kilogram. Saat yang sama pasokan tersisa dari Halmahera Timur kisaran 2 Ton dan Tidore sebanyak 1 Ton sementara sisanya pasokan dari luar provinsi Maluku Utara (rri.co.id 2022). Artinya ketergantungan Kota Ternate terhadap pasokan pangan dari luar daerah masih sangat besar. Permintaan tinggi dan pasokan terbatas menciptakan harga melonjak. Tomat di pasar Barito yang harga semula per-kilogram hanya Rp12.000 naik menjadi Rp26.000-Rp28.000. Sedangkan Cabai nona dari harga perkilogram Rp60.000 menjadi Rp80.000 (tvonenews.com Juni 2022).

Secara ekonomi ini lumrah dalam mekanisme pasar. Namun secara politik pangan kita butuh proteksi dan perencanaan yang terukur dalam rangka mengatasi keterbatasan lahan dan memperhitungkan kebutuhan serta besaran produksi setiap tahun. Disinilah peran pemerintah perlu diperluas memastikan kebutuhan dasar bahan pokok terjangkau oleh semua lapisan warga Kota Ternate. Termasuk mengantisipasi ketergantungan dari luar. Karena masalah ketahanan pangan lokal bukanlah tanggungjawab petani semata melainkan membutuhkan intervensi kebijakan dari pemerintah daerah.

Perihal besar kecilnya kontribusi Pulau Hiri memang belum masuk kategori pemasok tomat dan cabai terbesar karena belum banyak warga yang bertani secara konsisten dan meminati pekerjaan ini selain lahan yang juga terbatas. Tetapi dari pulau ini juga kita bisa melihat komitmen dan konsistensi kelompok tani Mariolaha dan beberapa kelompok lainnya memberi kontribusi terhadap daerah Kota Ternate menghidupi tanaman holtikulturameski dalam skala yang masih terbatas.

Oleh karena itu Fiko melalui kelompok Tani Mariolaha telah menunjukkan keberadaannya sebagai pemuda yang produktif dan mandiri secara ekonomi di sisi lainnya “mengajarkan” pemuda menyatu bersama alam melalui budaya mengelola tanah. Saya menaruh hormat kepada pemuda bermental produktif seperti Fiko. Di tengah gempuran arus globalisasi dan arus informasi saat ini sulit mendapati anak muda yang siap sedia mencangkul dan menanam dalam jumlah yang gede. Fiko adalah figur petani muda dari Hiri yang patut diapresiasi perlu dicontohi khususnya bagi warga muda di wilayah Pulau Hiri Kota Ternate.

Sesuai luasan lahan serta kontur bebatuan dan tanah berpasir yang mereka kelola di Dorari Isa secara terbatas kelompok Mariolaha bisa menghasilkan 3-4 Ton tomat selama masa panen. Ukuran ini menurut Fiko sudah bisa mencukupi kebutuhan rumah tangga dan hasil dari profesi mampu mengawal adiknya masuk di Perguruan Tinggi. Ditengah kesempatan kerja yang makin sulit Fiko kelihatan enjoy sekali bersama alam tekun dalam profesinya sebagai petani. Bekas pemain sayap kiri tim sepak bola Ofu Rube ini mengatakan; “Karena petani merupakan satu diantara banyaknya profesi yang begitu asyik dan seru untuk digeluti. Sebab petani merupakan pekerjaan yang menghubungkan kita dengan alam. Dan tak ada yang memerintah kita. Sehingga di samping bertani kita juga belajar menjadi pribadi yang tekun sabar tawakal dan ikhlas”.

Kreativitas Mengelola

Apakah menjadi petani di Pulau kecil seperti pulau Hiri dapat mengantarkan Fiko ke kota-kota besar Indonesia? Jangan ragu. Pada suatu sore menjelang studi akhir saya di Yogyakarta 2018 Fiko menelpon saya dan meminta saya mendatangi Hotel Horaioz Malioboro. Di sana tempat menginap Fiko bersama bapak Dahlan Tuniku karena selama kurang lebih satu minggu mereka studi banding di Yogyakarta. Setahun berikutnya Fiko kembali mendarat di Bandar Udara Internasional Soekarno-Hatta. Kali ini menuju Jakarta Barat tepatnya di Menara Peninsula dalam rangka kegiatan pertanian. Sedangkan pada 2020-2021 ia mengikuti diklat via daring karena pemerintah memperhitungkan Covid-19. Sepakterjang petani muda Pulau Hiri ini kembali berlanjut awal 2022 di Kota Makassar dan di Kota Ambon daerah yang terakhir ini mengenal budaya pela gandong.

Pengalaman dipanggil mengikuti pelatihan dan diklat berulangkali merupakan bagian internal dari menanamkan rasa percaya dirinya menggeluti dunia pertanian. Jadi jangan dikira Petani cuma bisa hidup di hutan dan menginjak tanah dan batu saja doooong!!! Tuh Fiko udah keliling Indonesia naik pesawat nginap di hotel mewah gratis pula. Keren kan? Tapi ingat belum selesai di sini masih ada kreativitas mereka mengelola potensi diri melalui ide-ide produktif bernilai sosial dan ekonomi.

Selain bergerak mengelola holtikultura melalui kelompok Mariolaha Fiko juga menggerakkan tani jenis hutan produksi bukan kayu maka dibentuklah kelompok Tani Hutan bernama Buku Manyeku bersama bapak Dahlan Tuniku. Lagi-lagi ini luar biasa. Mereka memproduksi minyak gosok dari daun cengkeh kering dan minyak wangi dari daun sere wangi (sere merah) serta pupuk kompos hasil fermentasi dedak kotoran Ternak (Sapi Kambing Ayam) dan dedaunan hijau.

Saya jadi ingat pepatah Cina; “lahan ekonomi terbesar di dunia adalah otak manusia”. Paling tidak berkat kerja otak bapak Dahlan Toniku dan Fiko kelompok tani Buku Manyeku mampu menunjukkan kepada khalayak bahwa keterbatasan material atau istilah kerennya-kondisi objektif- tidak menjadi halangan dalam memenuhi kebutuhan ekonomi keluarga bertindak secara kultural memaknai akal sebagai potensi yang terpatri dalam diri manusia.

Bukankah pekerjaan semacam ini menunjukkan sifat-sifat orang yang berakal?

Berdasarkan cakupan produktivitas dengan memanfaatkan potensi perhutanan yang terdapat di Dorari Isa maka kelompok ini menerima izin pengelolaan melalui SK Menteri Lingkungan Hidup dan Kehutanan Republik Indonesia No. SK.2063/MENLHK-PSKL/PKPS/PSL.0/4/2017 Tanggal: 11 APRIL 2017. Adalah izin kelola hutan desa skala 85 Hektar memanfaatkan hasil hutan bukan kayu di Dorari Isa kecamatan Pulau Hiri. Kalau berbicara tentang diversifikasi pangan atau politik pangan lokal sebetulnya dimensi “kreativitas” masyarakat lokal menjadi garda depanyang perlu dimediasi pemerintah secara menyeluruh.

Proses diversifikasi tinggal memilih bahan pokok pangan. Nilai utama politis dari diversifikasi adalah mengutamakan produksi pangan lokal mencintai potensi budaya lokal sekaligus membentuk komitmen untuk tidak membuat warga bergantung pada satu produk pangan. Apalagi jika bahan pangan didatangkan dari luar. Adakah di Maluku Utara pemerintah betul-betul serius menerapkan politik diversifikasi pangan lokal? Pembabatan hutan penghancuran lingkungan penghilangan lahan perkebunan akibat industri ekstraktif di Maluku Utara adalah wujud dari tidak adanya usaha serius pemerintah dalam memproteksi pasokan pangan bernilai lokal di negeri ini. Itu masalah didepan mata pemerintah dan warga Maluku Utara.

Ekowisata: Suatu Kesinambungan

Setiap kali saya bincang-bincang dengan Fiko dan bapak Dahlan di seputar pertanian selalu saja ide-ide kreatif keluar dari kepala mereka. Saya garis bawahi satu ide menarik tentang ekowisata. Pikiran mereka jauh memandang ke depan dalam soal keberlanjutan ekonomi dan budaya mengelola alam di Pulau Hiri. Lahan perkebunan yang ditumbuhi tanaman tomat rica dan sayuran di Pulau Hiri bagi mereka harus dijadikan “objek” wisata selain potensi bebatuan di pesisir pantai Hiri sebagaimana adanya sekarang. Konsep ini menggabungkan pemahaman ekologi dengan aktivitas warga “menikmati” alam.

Dalam konteks ini ada makna kesinambungan sekaligus berkelanjutan dari pelbagai bidang. Jika pemerintah Kota Ternate hendak mengembangkan Pulau Hiri sebagai destinasi baru wisata Kota Ternate pemerintah harus memerhatikan relasi timbal balik antara pariwisata dan pertanian dengan sektor lain. Dalam relasi itu kita butuh infrastuktur dasar seperti pelabuhan dan jalan yang layak. Kita butuh pasokan air. Kita bahkan membutuhkan jaringan komunikasi dan lain sebagainya yang berkaitan dengan ini semua. Karena aspek kesinambungan itulah saya melihat bertani bukan sekedar perilaku bercocok tanam melainkan jauh lebih besar adalah wujud cinta terhadap alam dan bentuk perjuangan sosial secara kolektif. Dalam hal ini Fiko seorang muda telah memulai khususnya di Pulau Hiri.

Perihal ia harus putus kuliah jurusan Matematika tahun 2013 saya anggap bukan masalah serius. Sekarang ilmunya sudah bermanfaat bahkan terhadap banyak orang. Karena dalam gagasan pendidikan John Dewey tentang learning by doing (belajar sambil melakukan) Fiko mempraktekkan banyak ilmu dalam satu aktivitas pertanian. Ilmu bercocok tanam untuk menanam ilmu matematika untuk membagi lahan menghitung harga dan jumlah produksi ilmu ekonomi dalam membaca pasar ilmu komunikasi dalam soal marketing dan lain sebagainya. Saya kira langkah Fiko di Pulau Hiri harus dijadikan inspirasi.

Milanisti Ternate ini sudah memulai dengan prinsipnya yang sederhana: “mari bato i ahu si foloi ua joro rica tamate se uge-uge adi” (batu aja tumbuh apalagi tanaman tomat rica dan sayuran). Selebihnya adalah persoalan etos dan kreativitas sebagai manusia yang menentukan bagaimana kontribusi kita terhadap masyarakat. Salam hangat dan cinta.

Dengan mengembangkan sikap selalu bersyukur berarti belajar bersyukur atas semua yang Anda miliki daripada berfokus pada hal-hal yang tidak Anda miliki. Anda bisa memulainya dengan menuliskan 10 hal yang Anda syukuri dalam hidup.

Lakukan cara ini setiap hari untuk menumbuhkan rasa syukur dan untuk benar-benar mendapatkan hasil maksimal dari hukum tarik-menarik.

2. Cintai diri sendiri terlebih dahulu

Meski terdengar klise Anda harus mencintai diri sendiri terlebih dahulu. Anda bisa memulainya dengan menulis daftar semua hal yang Anda sukai tentang diri Anda. Selanjutnya setiap kali Anda mengatakan sesuatu yang jahat tentang diri Anda gantilah dengan pikiran positif.

3. Hargai hubungan

Kapan pun Anda menghabiskan waktu dengan seseorang atau mendapati diri Anda memikirkan mereka ingatlah untuk mempertimbangkan mengapa Anda bersyukur memilikinya dalam hidup Anda. Maka dari itu hargai hubungan yang Anda miliki sehingga Anda dapat menarik lebih banyak ke dalam hidup Anda.

4 . Ganti pikiran negatif ​​ tentang cinta dengan yang positif

Ketika pemikiran negatif tentang terus mengganggu pikiran cobalah menggantinya dengan ide positif yang kontraaktif seperti ""Saya pantas mendapatkan cinta dan ada orang baik di luar sana."" Ulangi mantra ini setiap hari untuk efek maksimal.

5 . Bentengi diri dengan hal positif

Apa dan dengan siapa Anda yang mengelilingi diri Anda dapat membentuk pemikiran Anda tentang cinta. Misalnya berkumpul dengan teman-teman Anda dan terus-menerus mengeluh tentang kesengsaraan hubungan hanya akan membuat Anda tetap berpikiran negatif.

Sebaliknya kelilingi diri Anda dengan pandangan positif tentang cinta. Misalnya Anda dapat menonton komedi romantis dengan akhir yang bahagia mendengarkan lagu cinta yang ceria atau bahkan mengikuti influencer yang berbicara positif tentang cinta dan hubungan.

6 . Jelaskan apa yang anda inginkan dalam hubungan

Anda harus memiliki gagasan yang jelas tentang apa yang Anda hargai dan cari dalam hal cinta akan memudahkan untuk melihat orang yang tepat ketika mereka datang ke dalam hidup Anda. Ini adalah salah satu bagian terpenting dalam menggunakan hukum tarik-menarik secara maksimal.

7 . B uat goals

Papan visi atau goals adalah kumpulan gambar dan kata-kata yang mewakili impian dan tujuan Anda. Ini merupakan alat yang ampuh untuk menemukan cinta menggunakan hukum tarik-menarik.

Untuk memulai kumpulkan gambar dan kata-kata yang mewakili jenis hubungan yang Anda inginkan. Kemudian rekatkan ke papan poster atau sematkan ke papan gabus dan gantung di tempat yang sering Anda lihat. Setiap kali Anda melihatnya lihatlah dengan seksama dan bayangkan betapa menakjubkan rasanya setelah Anda menemukan cinta.

8 . Visualisasi kan pasangan impianmu

Jika Anda mencoba untuk menarik cinta ke dalam hidup Anda Anda bisa menggunakan visualisasi dengan menutup mata Anda dan menciptakan gambaran tentang apa yang akan terlihat ketika Anda menemukan cinta.

Setelah itu pastikan untuk melihatnya sejelas mungkin sampai ke detailnya dan biarkan diri Anda merasakannya seolah-olah itu terjadi. Setiap kali Anda melakukan ini Anda akan merasa lebih positif dan terbuka terhadap peluang yang dapat mengarah pada menemukan cinta.

9 . Mulai hidup seperti anda sudah menemukan cint a

Menurut hukum tarik-menarik Anda harus mulai menjalani hidup seolah-olah Anda telah menemukan cinta untuk menarik cinta. Ketika Anda melihat hidup Anda apakah ada ruang untuk cinta? Jika tidak bagaimana Anda bisa menciptakan ruang untuk cinta? Luangkan waktu untuk memikirkan hal ini dan membuat perubahan yang diperlukan.

10 . Cinta sudah dalam perjalanan

Hal terakhir yang perlu diketahui saat menggunakan hukum tarik-menarik untuk menemukan cinta adalah percaya bahwa cinta sudah dalam perjalanan. Lagi pula hukum tarik-menarik adalah tentang menarik apa yang Anda pikirkan jadi jika ada keraguan dalam pikiran Anda itu tidak akan berhasil.

Not so long ago chief sustainability officers were a corporate novelty. “Is this a fad or a role that will endure?” asked a Financial Times think-piece in 2011.

By now the answer is clear. The CSO has become a crucial member of the management team a rise reflecting sustainability’s increasing prominence on the corporate agenda.

That in turn has changed the mix of skills demanded. While the ability to manage climate risks and to navigate an ever tougher regulatory landscape is vital so too is expertise at handling corporate matters at the highest level.

Rachael De Renzy Channer who leads the sustainability practice at executive search firm Egon Zehnder says “the requirement for deep climate expertise” is less important than it used to be. “It is actually the ability to operate at the C-suite [level] to have those conversations with the CFO [chief financial officer] about reporting” she says.

Ten years ago corporate CSOs often came into the role from the investor relations or human resources departments says Scott Atkinson a partner at executive search firm Heidrick & Struggles and co-head of its sustainability practice. These were people who “raised their hands” to say they were interested in sustainability.

Now “a lot of [the job] has to do with what is most material to the business and what is the strategy” Atkinson observes. CSOs “need to be able to speak to legal issues supply chains and also being able to sit within the boardroom and articulate a vision to the board.”

Last year 28 per cent of 1640 public companies surveyed by management consultancy PwC reported that their CSO was part of the C-suite — the highest executive level — up from just 9 per cent in 2016. For example Honeywell’s CSO reports to the industrial group’s senior vice-president and general counsel. At food company Kelloggs the CSO reports to the senior vice-president for corporate affairs.

At other companies with well-known brands the CSO might be reporting to the chief executive says Cheryl D’Cruz-Young a senior client partner at recruitment firm Korn Ferry.

CSOs’ growing influence goes hand in hand with increasing corporate nervousness over environmental risk as activist investors pursue businesses they regard as sustainability laggards and regulators crack down on greenwashing.

In the finance sector exposure to climate change risk — a focus of recent regulatory “stress tests” — is another area of concern.

Emissions impossible?: Citigroup’s net zero task force is led by its CSO © Bloomberg

Last year banking giant Citigroup established a net zero carbon emissions task force led by its CSO. It helped to develop and launch Citi’s net zero plan — no small task for one of the largest financiers to fossil fuel businesses.

“Activist investors [are] driving change” D’Cruz-Young says noting that oil giants ExxonMobil and Shell were targeted last year. For companies “there is a fear factor. Commitments have been made.”

These pressures are being felt across all sectors. Software group Oracle for example has an environmental steering committee that includes the CSO. In regulatory filings it notes that a failure by this committee to identify climate and environmental risks could hurt the business’s reputation and financial performance.

A higher profile does not necessarily mean greater job security however. Last year for example Desiree Fixler was fired from her job as sustainability officer at DWS the asset management division of Deutsche Bank. Fixler says she was sacked for warning that the company’s statements about its environmental social and governance (ESG) investing criteria were misleading — that it was in effect greenwashing. DWS whose offices were raided in May by the German police in connection with the case denies these allegations.

But since Fixler went public with her allegations whistleblower attorneys have taken notice. Former officials from the Securities and Exchange Commission — the US financial regulator — who now represent potential whistleblowers have told the Financial Times that Fixler’s case demonstrates that CSOs can be a useful source of tip-offs.

CSOs can provide valuable evidence if greenwashing is suspected the lawyers say. The SEC has a task force in its enforcement division dedicated to hunting for greenwashing; it also has a programme that pays out rewards to people whose tip-offs result in fines.

With sustainability occupying ever more corporate bandwidth some companies have also started to rethink the CSO role with the job of ESG reporting starting to be split off. That means the CSO can then focus more on finding ESG-related revenue opportunities Atkinson explains.

“It could be that over the next six months there is more of a bifurcation of the CSO role” he says.



",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiV2h0dHBzOi8vYm9ybmVvYnVsbGV0aW4uY29tLmJuL3N0b2Nrcy1lbmQtaGlnaGVyLW9uLXdhbGwtc3RyZWV0LXN0aWxsLWRvd24tZm9yLXRoZS13ZWVrL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Stocks end higher on Wall Street still down for the week,"AP – Wall Street capped a week of losses with a broad rally for stocks on Friday as investors welcomed solid earnings from big companies and an encouraging report on consumer sentiment and inflation expectations.

A July survey from the University of Michigan showed that inflation expectations have held steady or improved along with general consumer sentiment. The report was welcomed following several government reports this week that showed consumer prices remained extremely hot in June along with wholesale prices for businesses.

The report also bodes well for investors looking for signs that the Federal Reserve might eventually ease off its aggressive policy to fight inflation.

The S&P 500 rose 1.9 per cent snapping a five-day losing streak. Still the gains weren’t enough to pull the benchmark index out of the red for the week.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 2.1 per cent and the Nasdaq gained 1.8 per cent. Smaller company stocks outgained the broader market sending the Russell 2000 index 2.2 per cent higher. Those indexes also posted losses for the week however.

“Investors are saying look ‘we’ve seen this before where the market goes up smartly one day only to turn back around the next day'” said chief investment strategist at CFRA Sam Stovall.

Technology stocks banks and healthcare companies made some of the biggest gains. PayPal climbed 6.3 per cent. UnitedHealth Group rose 5.4 per cent after raising its profit forecast for the year following a strong earnings report. Citigroup jumped 13.2 per cent for the biggest gain in the S&P 500 after reporting encouraging financial results.

Bond yields mostly fell. The yield on the 10-year Treasury slipped to 2.92 per cent from 2.96 per cent late Thursday. The yield on the two-year Treasury rose to 3.14 per cent from 3.13 per cent late on Thursday.

Inflation and its impact on businesses and consumers remains a key focus for Wall Street. The Federal Reserve has been raising interest rates in an effort to hit the brakes on economic growth and curtail rising inflation. The Fed has already raised rates three times this year.

Wall Street has been worried that the Fed could go too far in raising rates and actually bring on a recession.

Investors have been closely watching economic reports for clues as to how the central bank might react and the latest upbeat consumer sentiment report raises the chance of the Fed softening its current policy.

Traders have eased off of their bets that the Fed will issue a monster rate hike of one per cent at its next policy meeting in two weeks. They now see a 30.9-per-cent chance of that happening according to CME Group. That’s down significantly from Thursday.

They now see a 69.1 per cent chance of a three-quarters of a percentage point rate hike. Economic data also shows that retail sales remain strong. A government report showed that retail sales rose one per cent in June from May topping economists’ expectations while prices for everything from food to clothing rose.

All told the S&P 500 rose 72.78 points to 3863.16. The index has resisted dropping below 3800 noted Stovall. “Whenever we come down to about 3800 and we bounce off it it’s a confirmation there are a lot of buyers at that level” he said. “And we saw that yesterday as the market retested that level only to be pushed higher and then today with encouraging fundamentals to go along with it.”

The Dow rose 658.09 points to 31288.26 and the Nasdaq rose 201.24 points to 11452.42. The Russell 2000 gained 36.87 points to 1744.37.

Overseas stocks in Hong Kong and Shanghai fell following a report that showed the Chinese economy shrank by 2.6 per cent compared with the January-March period’s already weak quarter-on-quarter rate of 1.4 per cent.

China locked down major cities earlier this year to try and contain COVID-19 cases and more outbreaks this week in China and elsewhere in Asia have raised worries that COVID-19 controls might be restored on top of existing precautions.",,,,,,

Read more

Philadelphians had their third and final chance to say goodbye to Elton John at Citizens Bank Park on Friday night as the legendary showman opened the last North American leg of his valedictory Farewell Yellow Brick Road tour.

Rock and roll retirements are a notoriously retractable prospect though Sir Elton sounded genuine as he thanked the stadium full of fans for their “loyalty love and kindness” near the end of his 2½-hour performance.

“America made me famous” he continued. “How could I ever forget you?”

Equally genuine was the weariness in John’s voice as he noted that there were still more than 100 dates left in the tour which kicked off in September 2018. The veteran singer had planned to be a private citizen by now as the original three-year tour has been extended to nearly five by pandemic postponements delaying the day when he can stop to spend more time with his children and husband as he explained his plans.

Noting that this was his “52nd and last concert in Philadelphia” he recalled his first in September 1970 at the Electric Factory. Given that history the 1975 hit “Philadelphia Freedom” arrived with remarkably little fanfare as the second song of Friday’s set. A far greater response greeted the first song of John’s encore “Cold Heart (Pnau Remix)” which he sang alone to a backing track that included Dua Lipa’s vocal quoting “Rocket Man.” The song was a No. 1 hit for John last year in the U.K. which the 75-year-old marveled at achieving at his age.

Those accumulated years failed to dim John’s exuberant spirit throughout the evening though they did take their toll on his vocal range. He no longer attempts the high notes that once were routine robbing songs like “Tiny Dancer” and “Rocket Man” of some of their drama. Still he sounded strong within the confines of his current range and summoned powerful emotion through classics like “Levon” and “Someone Saved My Life Tonight.”

The concert began with a relaxed “Bennie and the Jets” Elton clad in a rhinestone-trimmed white jacket with tails. His skilled six-piece band featured several veteran collaborators including drummer Nigel Olsson animated percussionist Ray Cooper and guitarist Davey Johnstone who was too often buried in the bass-heavy mix but unleashed blistering solos on “Levon” and an extended jam appended to “Rocket Man.”

The stage was surrounded by a gold rose-bedecked frame evoking a more glamorous variation on the brick-and-plaster border of the Goodbye Yellow Brick Road album cover. A plexiglass awning arced out overhead between huge video screens that occasionally revisited key moments from John’s history but too often beamed Gap-ad-style montages that proved more distraction than accompaniment.

One of the more egregious showed a series of models sporting T-shirts featuring rock and/or civil rights icons as the band performed an otherwise impassioned rendition of “Border Song” from 1970′s self-titled Elton John album. Beforehand the singer took the opportunity to sing the praises of Aretha Franklin who covered the song later that year dedicating the tune to the Queen of Soul.

While the majority of the set was unsurprisingly a parade of hits (and there are plenty in John’s history to choose from) he did reach a little deeper into the catalog for a few surprises that proved to be highlights in part because they haven’t become quite so routine over the decades. “Have Mercy on the Criminal” from 1973′s Don’t Shoot Me I’m Only the Piano Player was especially moving while both “All the Girls Love Alice” and “Mona Lisas and Mad Hatters” were new additions to the setlist.

The piano glided across the stage as John sang his Marilyn Monroe tribute “Candle in the Wind” signaling a brief intermission while storm clouds played across the screens heralding the cinematic overture of “Funeral for a Friend (Love Lies Bleeding)” — and a costume change with John reemerging in a powder-blue jacket sporting a diamond-studded kitten’s silhouette on the back.

The second half roared to its conclusion with “The Bitch Is Back” “I’m Still Standing” “Crocodile Rock” and “Saturday Night’s Alright for Fighting” the latter still as chainsaw-edged as ever. Following “Cold Heart” John segued from his most recent hit to his first for a tender “Your Song” before bidding adieu to Philly with one last “Goodbye Yellow Brick Road.”

Shedding the pink sequined bathrobe he’d donned for the encore in favor of a personalized tracksuit Sir Elton ascended in a hydraulic lift to exit through a door atop the stage and into a video screen Oz. It felt like an appropriately over-the-top exit for one of rock’s most flamboyant figures.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiamh0dHBzOi8vYXBuZXdzLmNvbS9hcnRpY2xlL2VudGVydGFpbm1lbnQtbXVzaWMtcGhpbGFkZWxwaGlhLW5vcnRoLWFtZXJpY2EtMmU4ZTU2YzNiOTBkYWRjNmViZTY3MDYxNzUxOGIzOGbSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,From the end of the world to your town Elton John's goodbye,"PHILADELPHIA (AP) — I think it’s gonna be a long long time until we see another songwriter and performer like Elton John.

Wrapping up a 50-plus year career with a farewell tour the British pianist and vocalist has created some of the most memorable and enduring music in the history of pop-rock songs burned into the collective DNA of humanity.

They may be quite simple like the basic four-chord glory of “Crocodile Rock” or dazzlingly complex like the 11-minute magnum opus “Funeral For A Friend/Love Lies Bleeding.”

But now that it’s almost done I hope you don’t mind that I put down in words how wonderful it has been to have Elton John on our radios and in our ears since the late 1960s.

The artist born 75 years ago as Reginald Kenneth Dwight kicked off the final leg of his North American farewell tour Friday night at Citizens Bank Park home of baseball’s Philadelphia Phillies. And yes he felt the love that night.

“America made me famous and I can’t thank this country enough” he told the audience. “Thank you for the loyalty the love the kindness you showed me.”

He has sold over 300 million records worldwide has played over 4000 shows in 80 countries and recorded one of the best-selling singles of all-time his 1997 reworking of “Candle In The Wind” to eulogize Princess Diana which sold 33 million copies.

Sir Elton (he was knighted in 1998) has scored over 70 top 40 hits including nine No. 1s and released seven No. 1 albums in the 3 1/2-year period from 1972 to 1975 a pace second only to that of the Beatles.

He has five Grammy awards as well as a Tony award for “Aida.” His crooning of “Can You Feel The Love Tonight” in “The Lion King” motion picture has serenaded millions of children and will entertain future generations of little ones.

The outrageous costumes and oversized glasses he was known for in his early ‘70s heyday are gone now (he dressed as Donald Duck Pac-Man the Statue of Liberty Minnie Mouse and a Los Angeles Dodgers baseball player among others). And while the man has not met a sequin or a feather he doesn’t adore his wardrobe is (by Elton standards) somewhat tamer these days.

He took the stage in a white tuxedo with black lapels and purple sparkly glasses walking somewhat tentatively to his shiny black piano to pound out the instantly recognizable opening chord to “Bennie And The Jets.”

Next up was “Philadelphia Freedom” which he dedicated to the hometown crowd as “one of the greatest cities I’ve ever played in.” It was his 52nd concert in the City of Brotherly Love.

Throughout the night John rolled out a dazzling array of smash hits spanning musical styles and genres. The gospel phrasings and cadences that so influenced his early work were evident on “Border Song” and “Take Me To The Pilot” and even the straightforward radio staple “Levon” got a come-to-meeting revved-up ending.

He showed off the prototypical power ballad “Don’t Let The Sun Go Down On Me” with its close cousin “Someone Saved My Life Tonight.”

And when longtime guitar sidekick Davey Johnstone donned an inverted Flying-V guitar it was time for the power chord arena rockers including Elton’s hardest-rocking song ever “Saturday Night’s Alright For Fighting” and the brash boastful and Elton-to-the-bone anthem “The Bitch Is Back.”

Elton largely eschewed his famous falsetto; he still has 100 shows to go on the worldwide farewell tour that runs through next year and he’s learned over the years how to conserve his voice without sacrificing his style and authenticity.

No matter: the crowd happily supplied the falsetto parts for him including a mass sing-along of the “la-la-la” chorus on “Crocodile Rock.”

He reached back for only one deep track “Have Mercy On The Criminal” featuring Johnstone’s bluesy guitar licks tucking it amid the dozens of smash hits.

And he avoided tear-jerkers like “Sorry Seems To Be The Hardest Word” and the gut-wrenching “The Last Song” about a farewell between a father and his son who’s dying of AIDS in favor of an upbeat celebratory mood.

“All The Girls Love Alice” one of the earliest mainstream rock songs to focus on lesbian relationships in the early ‘70s is an enduring concert staple as is the straight-from-the-heart “Your Song.”

Before the closing number “Goodbye Yellow Brick Road” Elton peered toward the finish line of his final tour.

“I’m really looking forward to spending the rest of my life with my children and my husband” he said. “Be kind to yourself. Love each other.”

The consummate showman to the very end Elton finished the song and was elevated into the sky on a hydraulic lift as a hole opened in a brick wall atop the stage engulfed him and closed again.

So while Elton John will soon be gone from the stage thank God his music’s still alive.

But Elton John continues to usher out his extraordinary career with grace and enthusiasm while ensuring fans savor a spate of highlights from his colossal catalog.

At Citizens Bank Park on Friday a beaming John and his legendary band emerged before the sunset and more than two hours and 23 songs later the first date of the final U.S. leg of his Farewell Yellow Brick Road tour was a footnote in history.

The show also marked the launch of the stadium portion of the tour which will wrap in Los Angeles in November before bouncing back to Europe for the concluding run. It feels like another lifetime ago that John embarked on his long and winding goodbye; indeed the world looked much different in 2018 when the show made its debut in Allentown Pennsylvania.

But he’s still enticing baby boomer devotees and millennial newcomers alike a refreshing span of ages evident among the sold-out crowd of more than 40000.

During the encore John noted – with a bit of humble disbelief – that he was playing a recent hit “Cold Cold Heart” his mashup with Dua Lipa (who appeared on video) in tandem with his first top 10 single from 1971 the truly timeless “Your Song.”

Throughout the night John in a bejeweled white tux jacket black pants and lavender-framed glasses appeared refreshed and happy behind his black Yamaha grand piano. The hit parade began with the familiar plinking notes of “Bennie and the Jets” followed by “Philadelphia Freedom” with guitarist Davey Johnstone casually unfurling the song’s jangly riff.

80 for 80: Ranking some of the best Paul McCartney songs for his birthday

John 75 was delightfully hammy between songs popping up from his piano bench to point and grin at the crowd while mouthing thanks and leading a concert that felt brisk but never rote.

While some songs (“I’m Still Standing” “Tiny Dancer”) contained noticeably lower keys to suit John’s range he mostly sounded robust adding vocal embellishments to the end of an easy-swinging “I Guess That’s Why They Call It the Blues” and injecting “Someone Saved My Life Tonight” with emphatic emotion.

The highlights along this trip down sentimental street were numerous. The hazy effects on the video accompanying the ever-ethereal “Rocket Man” added a gauzy coating as the dreamy chorus segued into an elongated piano coda. “Levon” one of the underrated beauties in John’s cache of creativity with lyricist Bernie Taupin escalated into a gospel throwdown before weaving back into the melody. And the epic instrumental “Funeral for a Friend” a sonic eruption that melts into “Love Lies Bleeding” remains a master class in musicianship.

Though John’s teammates never earned a moniker a la the E Street Band these exceptional players have been an integral part of his live shows. Many such as dapper drummer Nigel Olsson (sporting his trademark gloves headphones and a pink pocket square in his suit) the treasure that is percussionist Ray Cooper and the distinctive Johnstone have shared stages with the maestro since the earliest gigs.

Percussionist John Mahon keyboardist Kim Bullard and bassist Matt Bissonette also add musical flair that prompted John to comment on how much he has relished playing with this group.

Concert review: The Weeknd tour is an apocalyptic rave

While their tautness was expected given the volume of shows they’ve played the band also leaned into a couple of surprises in the set list.

The rollicking “All the Girls Love Alice” from 1973’s “Goodbye Yellow Brick Road” album arrived for the first time this year (John did unearth the album track during many pre-pandemic farewell dates). But more unexpected was the tour debut of “Mona Lisas and Mad Hatters” John’s swoony 1972 ode to New York City that he hasn’t performed live since his 2018 Las Vegas run. It was as always enchanting.

As the concert crept toward its conclusion – with fans realizing the wind down of their time in John’s orbit – the musician offered sincere thanks and told the audience to “love each other” while wishing them “health happiness and success.”

Then as he has throughout the tour John unwrapped “Goodbye Yellow Brick Road” his delicate rumination of life in transition and the ideal summary of a career that will be forever celebrated.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiaGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmVsaXphYmV0aHRvbi5jb20vMjAyMi8wNy8xNy93aW5uZXJzLW9mLXBpdGNoLWhpdC1hbmQtcnVuLWNvbXBldGl0aW9uLWF3YXJkZWQtc2F0dXJkYXktbmlnaHQv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Winners of Pitch Hit and Run Competition Awarded Saturday night,"Winners of Pitch Hit and Run Competition Awarded Saturday night Published 6:36 pm Sunday July 17 2022

It shows that the market has failed to recover from the historical damage done in the second quarter of this year.

Volume Slump Persists

Crypto trading volumes closely contingent on the broader market sentiment dipped over 28% in June to $1.41 trillion reaching the lowest levels seen since December 2020 Bloomberg reported. The situation did not get much better in July as the current volume is still down over 15% from May.

Katie Stockton the co-founder of Fairlead Strategies said the static and low volume will likely persist until a market reversal occurs:

“Volume has declined given the reduced excitement from investors in a cyclical bear market until crypto prices break out of their bear-market cycle which could take months we can expect volume to be below average.”

In June Bitcoin futures contracts at the CME Group only reached $29 billion the lowest level since July 2021. It’s worth noting that the primary cryptocurrency closed the worst quarter in the past decade as BTC sat below the key $20000 mark on July 1st.

In such a bearish condition JP Morgan’s strategists even predicted on Thursday that BTC would continue plunging as its average production cost sunk from $24000 at the beginning of June to $13000 at its current level.

Coinbase’s Lead in Question

The violent drop in trading volume – as translated to the declined interest in cryptocurrency among investors – has been reflected in the diminished dominance of leading exchanges such as Coinbase.

The US giant experienced a severe slump in volume amid the ongoing crypto winter resulting in its fallout from the list of the top 10 crypto exchanges ranked by trading volume.

Bloomberg’s report indicated that it only had a 2.9% average market share among the top 30 in June – down from 3.6% average in Q2 and 5.3% in Q1. Structural issues in its business model had made it suffer from competition with other challengers Mizuho Securities USA analyst Dan Dolev commented.

Amidst growing concern regarding if the profit trajectory is on schedule Coinbase decided to cut expenses as revenue dropped 27% in Q1 YoY. Later it announced cutting 18% of its headcount citing the perceivable impacts of impending recession and aggressive rate hikes by the Fed.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiV2h0dHBzOi8vYm9ybmVvYnVsbGV0aW4uY29tLmJuL3N0b2Nrcy1lbmQtaGlnaGVyLW9uLXdhbGwtc3RyZWV0LXN0aWxsLWRvd24tZm9yLXRoZS13ZWVrL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Stocks end higher on Wall Street still down for the week,"AP – Wall Street capped a week of losses with a broad rally for stocks on Friday as investors welcomed solid earnings from big companies and an encouraging report on consumer sentiment and inflation expectations.

A July survey from the University of Michigan showed that inflation expectations have held steady or improved along with general consumer sentiment. The report was welcomed following several government reports this week that showed consumer prices remained extremely hot in June along with wholesale prices for businesses.

The report also bodes well for investors looking for signs that the Federal Reserve might eventually ease off its aggressive policy to fight inflation.

The S&P 500 rose 1.9 per cent snapping a five-day losing streak. Still the gains weren’t enough to pull the benchmark index out of the red for the week.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 2.1 per cent and the Nasdaq gained 1.8 per cent. Smaller company stocks outgained the broader market sending the Russell 2000 index 2.2 per cent higher. Those indexes also posted losses for the week however.

“Investors are saying look ‘we’ve seen this before where the market goes up smartly one day only to turn back around the next day'” said chief investment strategist at CFRA Sam Stovall.

Technology stocks banks and healthcare companies made some of the biggest gains. PayPal climbed 6.3 per cent. UnitedHealth Group rose 5.4 per cent after raising its profit forecast for the year following a strong earnings report. Citigroup jumped 13.2 per cent for the biggest gain in the S&P 500 after reporting encouraging financial results.

Bond yields mostly fell. The yield on the 10-year Treasury slipped to 2.92 per cent from 2.96 per cent late Thursday. The yield on the two-year Treasury rose to 3.14 per cent from 3.13 per cent late on Thursday.

Inflation and its impact on businesses and consumers remains a key focus for Wall Street. The Federal Reserve has been raising interest rates in an effort to hit the brakes on economic growth and curtail rising inflation. The Fed has already raised rates three times this year.

Wall Street has been worried that the Fed could go too far in raising rates and actually bring on a recession.

Investors have been closely watching economic reports for clues as to how the central bank might react and the latest upbeat consumer sentiment report raises the chance of the Fed softening its current policy.

Traders have eased off of their bets that the Fed will issue a monster rate hike of one per cent at its next policy meeting in two weeks. They now see a 30.9-per-cent chance of that happening according to CME Group. That’s down significantly from Thursday.

They now see a 69.1 per cent chance of a three-quarters of a percentage point rate hike. Economic data also shows that retail sales remain strong. A government report showed that retail sales rose one per cent in June from May topping economists’ expectations while prices for everything from food to clothing rose.

All told the S&P 500 rose 72.78 points to 3863.16. The index has resisted dropping below 3800 noted Stovall. “Whenever we come down to about 3800 and we bounce off it it’s a confirmation there are a lot of buyers at that level” he said. “And we saw that yesterday as the market retested that level only to be pushed higher and then today with encouraging fundamentals to go along with it.”

The Dow rose 658.09 points to 31288.26 and the Nasdaq rose 201.24 points to 11452.42. The Russell 2000 gained 36.87 points to 1744.37.

Overseas stocks in Hong Kong and Shanghai fell following a report that showed the Chinese economy shrank by 2.6 per cent compared with the January-March period’s already weak quarter-on-quarter rate of 1.4 per cent.

‘Good Luck Jerry’ is just about to be released. Comparisons with the Tamil original 'Kolamaavu Kokila' are bound to be there...

How did you prepare for the role of Jigar?



How was it working with Janhvi Kapoor? What aspects of her personality did you discover that people are not usually aware of?





Recently a debate was sparked about South vs Hindi cinema. What's your take on remaking South films in Bollywood?

Sahil Mehta who made his mark in the web space with his roles in 'Made in Heaven' 'Guilty' and 'Tabbar' has his hands full with two much-awaited films in the pipeline ready for release. He shares screen with Janhvi Kapoor in ' Good Luck Jerry ' that hits the OTT screens on July 29. He will also be seen alongside Akshay Kumar in Anand L Rai’s ' Raksha Bandhan ' that is slated for a theatrical release on August 11.Sahil who plays the role of a 20-year-old Sikh boy from Punjab learning the business of drugs and crime sat for an exclusive chat with ETimes and spoke at length about his role working with Janhvi Kapoor and more. Excerpts:Well I would say I am really excited for ‘Good Luck Jerry’ but yes comparisons are definitely going to be there. But what I believe is if a film is that worthy enough to be remade then there is something interesting in that particular film and it should reach the mass audience and that is why ‘Good Luck Jerry’ is made. When I got to know about ‘Good Luck Jerry’ I did not know about the original film and when I read the script I thought it has that element to entertain the audience and that’s all we are here for right? To take the pain and entertain. ‘Good Luck Jerry’ is a very nice quirky funny comedy film.Well I would not say it was tough but it was quite challenging for me. If there is no challenge in preparing for a role then I don’t think so you get the satisfaction as an actor. When I read the script I got to know that Jigar is such a sharp guy and such a smart guy. Every single time when you get to portray a character you get to explore a side of yourself. And here I got to explore a side of Sahil and that was a very good experience. I remember I did not cut my hair and was sitting under the sunlight to get a natural tan but did not get much so I had to use makeup. Sardars don’t cut their hair so I did not cut my hair for six-seven months not just the facial hair but the entire body. It was such a great experience to play Jigar and also I had an excellent coordination with the other co-actor right now I cannot disclose much about his character. Sometimes you get to make bonds in real life as well even when you are working on a project.Janhvi Kapoor is such a sweetheart. I mean of course for me as an outsider I was like let’s see how the first day would be but it was very nice. She is such a sweetheart she calms you down she is very nice to you very sweet to you and slowly we bonded well and played games in between the scenes. I remember I taught Janhvi a card game and every single time she was like 'let’s play it'. She is very hardworking she was shuffling between the shoots. I remember we were shooting the climax of ‘Good Luck Jerry’ and Janhvi’s other movie 'Roohi' was releasing. Ao she was constantly shuffling between Punjab and Mumbai for her promotions and shooting for 'Good Luck Jerry' back and forth and I was so amazed to see that what an energy she has!I think there is no harm in remaking any film be it a South film or an International film the purpose is to be a part of good stories and tell good stories. Like what I said earlier it is all about entertaining. So I think there is no harm in remaking it is just that good stories should reach more people.",,,,,,,,,

Coca-Cola Company which has trimmed over 200 brands of late recently launched its first bottled Chinese herbal tea Self-Heal Spike extending a healthy beverage line acquired in 2006.

The tea contains Prunella vulgaris a medicinal herb related to mint and known as ha fu chou or xia ku cao (夏枯草). Also known as self-heal heal-all and woundwort the herb is marketed as an analgesic anti-inflammatory and antibacterial with anti-coagulation properties. Self-heal is used in beverages to reduce blood viscosity and improve microcirculation.

In addition to self-heal the new Coca-Cola blend includes momordica fruit licorice and pagoda tree flower buds. Other products in the HealthWorks line include Sugarcane Rhizoma Imperatae & Sea Coconut Hawthorn Apple Rock Sugar with Pear and Lemon Yiyiren.

China’s beverage market is lucrative at RMB578.5 billion ($85.6 billion in 2019) but crowded according to Daxue Consulting. “In recent years with the expansion of vending machine outlets and the rapid development of Internet sales platforms China’s beverage industry has diversified its distribution channels” reports Daxue. Ninety percent of sales are via conventional stores.

Self-Heal Spike is marketed online and sells for $1.80 per bottle on TMall. The 500 ml drink is bottled by HealthWorks a Hong Kong-based beverage company Coca-Cola acquired in 2006.

Herbal teas are a growing niche in China. Traditional RTD tea (mainly green) is the largest segment with almost 50% market share. But reduced-calorie tea-based drinks are on the rise as Chinese consumers seek products perceived as healthier. Even a small niche can represent 10 million consumers in a market of 1.4 billion people.

Consumers view RTD herbal infusions as convenient extensions of the traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) regimen. According to marketers teas are consumed to aid the stomach clear heat remove dampness and detoxify the body.

China's bottled herbal drinks category is dominated by Wanglaoji a brand that outsells the top four competitors combined. However Coca-Cola as an “omni-category” giant is expected to gain market share quickly.

Bottled Wong Lo Kat (also pronounced Wanglaoji) is the original and most famous of China’s bottled herbals. The infusion was formulated in 1828 by a Guangdong physician. His descendants retain rights to sales outside China. JDB Group a subsidiary of Guangzhou Pharmaceutical owns the trademark within China.

Either way greenwashing is a harmful and deceitful way of advertising that a company is more sustainable than it actually is. Companies that make false claims should be held accountable. Here are 10 companies that have been caught greenwashing in various ways.

—

1. Volkswagen

A classic example of greenwashing is when Volkswagen admitted to cheating emissions tests by fitting various vehicles with a “defect” device with software that could detect when it was undergoing an emissions test and altering the performance to reduce the emissions level.

This was going on while to the public the company was touting the low-emissions and eco-friendly features of its vehicles in marketing campaigns. In actuality these engines were emitting up to 40 times the allowed limit for nitrogen oxide pollutants.

2. BP

Fossil fuel giant BP changed their name to Beyond Petroleum and publicly added solar panels on their gas stations. In December 2019 an environmental group called ClientEarth lodged a complaint against BP for misleading the public with its advertisements that focused on BP’s low-carbon energy products when more than 96% of its annual spend is on oil and gas.

3. ExxonMobil

Oil giant ExxonMobil has a long history of damaging the environment. In 1989 an Exxon oil tanker spilled 11 million gallons of crude oil into Alaska’s Prince William Sound in what was the worst oil spill in US history until the Deepwater Horizon oil spill in 2010. The Exxon oil spill covered 1300 miles of coastline and killed hundreds of thousands of seabirds otters seals and whales. More than 30 years later pockets of crude oil remain in some locations.

Recently ExxonMobil came under fire for advertising that suggested that its experimental algae biofuels could one day reduce transport emissions while it has no company-wide net zero target and its 2025 emission reduction targets do not include the vast majority of emissions resulting from its products.

4. Nestlé

In 2018 Nestlé released a statement saying that it had “ambitions” for its packaging to be 100% recyclable or reusable by 2025. However environmental groups and other critics pointed out that the company hadn’t released clear targets a timeline to accompany its ambitions or additional efforts to help facilitate recycling by consumers. Greenpeace reacted to this by releasing its own statement in which it said “Nestlé’s statement on plastic packaging includes more of the same greenwashing baby steps to tackle a crisis it helped to create. It will not actually move the needle toward the reduction of single-use plastics in a meaningful way and sets an incredibly low standard as the largest food and beverage company in the world.” In Break Free From Plastic’s 2020 annual report Nestlé along with Coca-Cola and PepsiCo were named the world’s top plastic polluters for the third year in a row.

5. Coca-Cola

In the annual report mentioned above by Break Free From Plastic Coca-Cola was ranked as the world’s number 1 plastic polluter it’s second consecutive year at the top. In 2020 the company came under fire when it announced that it would not abandon plastic bottles saying that they were popular with customers.

Despite this the company is adamant that it is making progress in tackling packaging waste. At the time a spokesperson said “Globally we have a commitment to get every bottle back by 2030 so that none of it ends up as litter or in the oceans and the plastic can be recycled into new bottles. Bottles with 100% recycled plastic are now available in 18 markets around the world and this is continually growing.”

Then in June 2021 environmental organisation Earth Island Institute filed a lawsuit against the beverage giant for falsely advertising that it is sustainable and eco-friendly despite being the largest plastic polluter in the world.

6. Starbucks

In 2018 Starbucks released a “straw-less lid” as part of its sustainability drive however this lid contained more plastic than the old lid and straw combination. The company didn’t dispute this but claimed that it is made from polypropylene a commonly-accepted recyclable plastic that “can be captured in recycling infrastructure.” Critics were quick to point out that only 9% of the world’s plastic is recycled so the company shouldn’t assume all the lids would be recycled. Further the US exports about one-third of its recycling to developing countries so it is simply passing its responsibility to poorer countries.

7. IKEA

IKEA was considered a beacon of a major corporation being sustainable before June 2020 when the furniture retailer was linked with illegal logging in Ukraine. In a report by NGO Earthsight the wood certification scheme IKEA uses Forest Stewardship Council was described as an organisation that greenwashes the timber industry. It was accused of failing to catch IKEA’s sourcing of conflict wood and act on it.

Further when IKEA built its “most sustainable store” yet in London in 2019 it did so on top of another sustainable store that was demolished after just 17 years of use.

8. Plastic Bottle Water Companies

A more subtle form of greenwashing can be seen in plastic water bottle companies like Poland Spring Evian and Deer Park that all have nature on their labels. This is laughably ironic considering that plastic water bottles are designed to be single-use and are contributing to the massive plastic waste crisis around the world.

9. Major Banks

The past several years have seen major financial institutions talking a big game about combating climate change yet these are more examples of companies exercising greenwashing strategies. JP Morgan Citibank and Bank of America have issued new “green investment” opportunities. However a report released last year by the Rainforest Action Network showed that big banks – the ones mentioned above but also including Wells Fargo Barclays Bank of China HSBC Goldman Sachs and Deutsche Bank – were still lending enormous sums to the industries that contribute the most to global warming like fossil fuels and deforestations while boasting that they’re the leaders of the green transition.

10. Fast Fashion Brands

H&M Zara and Uniqlo are among the companies that were caught greenwashing over the years. These fashion brands contribute to the massive amounts of textile waste caused by the clothing industry. According to the fashion nonprofit ReMake 80% of discarded textiles globally are incinerated or landfill-bound with just 20% being reused or recycled.

Fast fashion brands also have a habit of advertising its green initiatives widely despite it being a tiny part of its operations. For example in 2019 H&M launched its own line of “green” clothing titled “Conscious.” The company claims to use “organic” cotton and recycled polyester. However the line is nothing but a marketing tactic used to make themselves appear more environmentally friendly. When looking at H&M’s “Conscious” line its mission states: “Shop our selection of sustainable fashion pieces that make you both look and feel good.” However there is no single legal definition for marketing-friendly words such as “sustainable” “green” or “environmentally-friendly.” H&M was then criticised by the Norwegian Customer Authority for “misleading” marketing of their Conscious Collection because “the information given regarding sustainability was not sufficient especially given that the Conscious Collection is advertised as a collection with environmental benefits.”

What Can I Do?

1. On A Personal Level

Ways to approach climate action within our personal lives (hint – it evolves personal action but is not focused on small behavioural changes which whilst worthwhile will not get us there):

Joining a community can be one of the best ways to increase your impact.

First it can enable you to make hundreds of connections in one go.

Second a group of people working together can have more impact than individuals. If you are not already take action by becoming an EO Member to support our mission to encourage a billion climate activists .

If you’re a younger read ask your parents to take action by bringing your whole family on board as a Family Member.

Reflect on the concept of Effective Altruism  a project that aims to find the best ways to help others and put them into practice.

2. On A Professional Level

Ways to approach climate action within the workplace:

Maintain your career path but consider donating a portion of your income to organisations that are focused on achieving meaningful & impactful goals and call out your boss if the company or organisation you work for does not have clear policies that will result in reduced harm to the environment and a pathway to Net Zero.

Ask your boss to support EO by bringing the whole team onboard with EO company membership – and take action together.

Reconsider your career path with excellent advice here .

3. On A Political Level

Ways to approach climate action as a voter or political actor (even if you can’t vote):

Protest – make your feelings known – become a vocal and passionate advocate with friends and family (without being over pushy) of the need for climate action. We need a billion activists to turn this ship around.

Join organisations that are organising climate actions and protests locally whether in your city district or even at school.

Vote (if you can) for politicians who will champion effective climate action by governments.

Vote for parties or organisations that espouse self-reform and the adoption of ‘ Ministers of the Future ’ into government.

That’s right the GRAMMY-nominated performer is reimagining the classic summer sip in a limited time flavor and no — it doesn’t taste like marshmallows. Here’s the rundown on everything you need to know about Marshmello’s Limited Edition Coca-Cola including a review of the sip where to buy it and more.

Everyone loves a remix for summer which is why Coke has tapped Marshmello to give the old school flavor a major refresh just in time for the warm weather season. Marshmello’s Limited Edition Coca-Cola as the company is calling it was announced on June 29 and the special edition flavor launched in-stores on July 11 along with a Zero Sugar version. Despite the drink being served in a frosty white 12-ounce can (and its creator’s name-spiration) the remixed sip doesn’t have any hints of marshmallow flavor. Instead the unique sip mixes the same Coke taste you know and love with the producer’s favorite flavors strawberry and watermelon. No seriously. It doesn’t get more summery than that.

Marshmello’s Limited Edition Coca-Cola is the latest sip to join the Coca-Cola Creations lineup aka the initiative launched by Coke in February 2022 to reimagine the brand with new collaborations and ideas. (As a refresher the company’s past Creations included Coca-Cola Zero Byte and Coca-Cola Starlight.)

According to Coca-Cola this is the first time the company has released a sip with these flavors I know it doesn’t sound like the flavors would go together but I tried the Zero Sugar version of the fruity Coke sip for myself and the flavors work together better than you’d expect.

Marshmello’s Limited-Edition Coca-Cola Review

If you’re eager to try the sip for its fruity flavors you should know the hints of strawberry and watermelon were really only present at the beginning. In fact the scent of the flavors was so strong at first that I thought the Coke had an aroma similar to that of a cocktail and upon my first sip I almost couldn’t taste the Coke flavor at all. The watermelon and strawberry blended together to create a superfruit-like flavor that reminded me of a day at the pool.

The classic Coke flavor definitely came through on my second sip without overpowering the taste of the strawberry and watermelon but the summertime fruits continued to fade into the background with every subsequent sip. I’m not sure if that was intentional on the producer’s part or if I had gotten used to the flavor but either way it’s enough to make the drink taste like summer without losing its Coca-Cola roots.

Oh and BTW — even though the sip features flavors from two of the summer’s pinkest fruits the drink still maintains its typical brown Coke color. So make sure to prepare your brain for a serious mindf*ck before trying it for yourself because it totally threw me for a loop TBH.

Where To Buy Marshmello’s Limited-Edition Coca-Cola Flavor

According to Coca-Cola the company’s latest Creation is available now at all Coke retailers nationwide. Target Walmart CVS you name it. There’s no official end date but you’ll be able to find the sip on store shelves throughout the summer while supplies last. The best part is the drink costs the same as a regular Coke which means you won’t have to shell out any extra cash to test the Creation.

If you want to get your hands on a can though be prepared to make a run in person. According to Coca-Cola the limited edition flavor will not be available for purchase online. Luckily you can find the nearest store stocked with the stuff online by using the product finder on the Marshmello’s Limited Edition Coca-Cola page on the Coke website.

Marshmello’s Limited Edition Coca-Cola Flavor is only available to purchase in single 12-ounce cans according to the company.

Prices are rising on one of Europe's most popular islands,"A seaside restaurant charges 30 euros ($30) for a burger. A large sunbed at an upscale beach club can cost 500 euros in August. And a table at a ""VIP"" nightclub can run into the thousands. Though Spain is generally considered a reasonably priced travel destination the Spanish island of Ibiza has long been known as a place for living the high life. ""The pricing is silly"" said Ben Pundole a luxury hotel consultant and longtime Ibiza visitor in an email to CNBC. ""After 23 years in New York I can only compare it to the Hamptons in the height of [the] season.""

Yet Ibiza's visitors are happy to spend big Pundole said. ""Ibiza is very expensive it's always been expensive"" he said. ""But people are willing to pay.""

Rising prices

While hippies were drawn to Ibiza for its rumored ""magnetic"" vibrations in the 1960s it was arguably British-Australian Tony Pike who put the island on the map when he opened the Pikes Hotel now known as Pikes Ibiza in 1980. The small hotel transformed a 500-year-old estate in the hills into a party haven. Pike's rich and famous friends such as Freddie Mercury George Michael and Kylie Minogue stayed at the hotel — and it's still a place that draws crowds to its rooms restaurant and dancefloor. The 1980s also saw the rise of clubs such as Amnesia Space (now home to Hi Ibiza) and Pacha with the latter currently charging 13 euros ($13) for a regular can of Coca-Cola. More clubs have since opened including Ushuaia which was named the third best club in the world in 2019 by the International Nightlife Association.

Restaurants clubs holiday rentals and taxis have all noticeably hiked prices this year Pundole said. ""It's an island it's seasonal businesses are making up for two years of lost revenue there's supply chain issues and the pent-up demand is enormous"" he said. Indeed the number of tourists visiting the Balearic Islands was up 300% year over year in May according to Spain's National Institute of Statistics.

Ibiza's reputation as an upscale destination evolved over a few decades said Carolyn Addison head of product at luxury travel specialist Black Tomato. ""It has this kind of … established glamour. So there's a lot on offer that is expensive"" she told CNBC by phone. ""You would have to trace it back to the '60s when there was this sort of … hippie crowd that washed up"" she said. ""As that crowd maybe got older richer more established [it] defined the island in a new way."" A six-night trip organized by Black Tomato starts from around £6100 ($7260) per person including accommodations breakfast and a one-day private yacht charter (the price excludes flights).

Six Senses Ibiza is popular with Black Tomato's clients said Addison. The luxury hotel announced the addition of 19 private residences and two ""mansions"" in June. Mansions cost around $16000 per night in the summer according to the hotel's website. Guests have access to a spa kids' club and daily activities such as kayaking and cliff jumping. Each comes with a ""Guest Experience Maker"" who can organize nightclub entry and boat trips according to the hotel. Also new at Six Senses this year is Beach Caves a venue with a restaurant live music space recording studio and six suites with extra-large beds near the town of Portinatx on Ibiza's north coast. Pundole who is Beach Caves' creative director described the area as having ""a different vibe"" and called it ""curious mystical equally as hedonistic and as bohemian as anywhere you could imagine."" Beach Caves suites start from 1565 euros a night in the summer.

This year also saw luxury hotel group Mandarin Oriental take over management of Tagomago a private island off Ibiza's eastern coast. The entire island is available to rent for around 30000 euros a night during the high season which includes a private villa chef concierge butler villa host and yacht captain according to a promotional brochure. Luca Finardi operations director of Mandarin Oriental Exclusive Homes said Tagomago's clientele comprise ""a variety of high-end individuals from all over the world.""

Luxury demands

Asked why Ibiza is so expensive Finardi said by email that the island is popular with upmarket travelers who want a combination of ""beautiful scenery high quality restaurants and bars chic shopping experiences and lively nightlife."" ""It also provides lovely areas where guests can find quiet corners to escape the crowds"" he said. ""It represents value for money to people seeking these experiences.""

This unique day is additionally planned to show the moral dimensions of the working of new technologies and the opportunities for the advancement of modern societies.

Clear approaches to deciding A.I. sentience and clear guidelines regulations and freedoms should be investigated and solidified before we coincidentally or intentionally concoct a cognizant A.I.

What was ordinarily a field of the creative mind of sci-fiction writers Artificial Intelligence(AI) is flourishing in our regular day-to-day existences.

Artificial intelligence as of now has a significant impact on our regular daily existence in numerous ways weather forecasting google’s voice recognition search forecasts email spam filtering and Siri in Apple phones are a portion of the models.

Other than this advancement there’s something else to find in the approaching future we are as yet a couple of years from having robots doing all kinds of work for us.

What are AI and the way that it works?

Artificial Intelligence is one of the branches of computer engineering that deals with the improvement of smart and self-operating machines.

Simulated intelligence is especially the field of study which aims to make machines intelligent like people artificially or to simulate intelligence in a machine. To characterize AI all the more extravagantly the capacity of a system to accurately decipher introduced information and gain from that information.

The research in the field of Artificial Intelligence frequently rotates around smart algorithms. The algorithm is a bunch of precise instructions that a machine can perform and draw results.

A complex algorithm is worked by joining a few basic and little algorithms. Numerous algorithms are equipped for gaining from the current information itself they can improve themselves by updating with new issues and scenarios are composed of new algorithms all alone.

Origin of AI

Artificial intelligence is certainly not another idea the beginning of AI follows back to a very nearly century ago in the time of World War when Alan Turing concocted a thought of machines ready to think. Alan Turing was quite possibly the earliest scientist to work in the field of Artificial Intelligence and smart algorithms.

The actual hypothesis of AI technology lies in its capacity to gain from the information gathered by it. In any case there are so many Hollywood and Bollywood movies that show like AI is coming to get us or there will be no human civilization once AI comes.

Maybe actually way less surprising there are various stages that AI needs to go through before it arrives at the high level and finds every one of the avenues.

To give some clarity on the plausible advancement trajectory we can part it into seven unique stages of the progress of AI.

This article will give experiences into the seven plausible stages through which AI would need to go and which could assist it with its creation. This article will likewise attempt to foresee the potential avenues of AI in the following 15-20 years.

The 7 Stages of the Future Evolution of AI

Stage 1-Rule Bases System

In this stage AI encompasses us in everything from Robot Process Automation utilized in business to autopilots utilized in aircraft.

Stage 2-Context-awareness and Retention

The machines in view of algorithms are prepared on the best human knowledge and involvement in information in light of explicit spaces. The current information base can be updated once new questions and solutions emerge.

The most widely recognized application is Robo-advisors or chatbots which can be utilized in a forward client request that can help humans in all things.

Stage 3-Domain-specific aptitude

In this stage the high-level systems can develop mastery specifically domains. Because of the capacity to store and handle a wide volume of data to pursue choices the capacities of these machines can be more than humans.

Cancer diagnosis determination is one of the applications and Google Deepmind’s system that defeated 18 times world go champion Lee Sadol proved the domain-specific expertise.

Stage 4-Reasoning systems

This machine algorithm has an idea of mind expectations information and its own logic. They have the ability to reason interact and deal with different machines and humans as well. Such algorithms will be in the commercial field in certain years.

Stage 5-Artificial General Intelligence

This is the principal objective of numerous scientists working in the field of AI-to develop a machine with intelligence like people. Artificial general intelligence or self-aware systems are not in application to date but rather relatively few years left to find this avenue.

This is the stage addressed in numerous sci-fiction movies where machines are leading humans in intelligence.

Stage 6-Artificial Super Intelligence(ASI)

This stage is one score of the Artificial General Intelligence the algorithms will be equipped for overcoming the smartest of the humans in every one of the domains.

This stage can be the genuine answer for the issues that are as yet complex for the human psyche like destitution appetite and environmental change. This will be the stage where machines made by humans will outfox humans as well.

Stage 7-Singularity and excellency

The improvement way led by ASI will lead us directly to a time when the capacities of humans will see a huge extension.

With the assistance of this ASI technology humans would have the option to associate the personalities of one another and resemble the human internet.

The technology would be similar to an imaginary life where ideas and thoughts could be shared by only one flick of the psyche. Humans would be equipped for associating with different types of life-like animals plants and other natural exercises.

While some contend that humans won’t ever arrive at such levels and some say that it is doable and with this exponential growth rate would be accomplished someplace in 2045.",,,,,,,,,

I’m Wayne Simmonds in this bitch.

As people know Bundy is a third of the Snow the Goalie podcast with Ant SanFilippo and Russ Joy. He’s not afraid to go after the Flyers organization over the last couple of years for being what they truly are. The funny thing is this tweet was probably the most tepid shot he’s fired across the bow:

Well isn't this interesting #Flyers peops. But hey we still got the 30th pick in the first round! Life is always about finding that silver lining gang! Have a great weekend everyone! https://t.co/ha5lgyt26U — Chris Therien (@ctherien6) July 16 2022

Well Scott Hartnell whose checks are signed by Comcast must have gotten a call from Comcast Spectacor CEO Dave Scott to fire back in exchange for a front office position in 2023. It’s the only logical explanation. What’s another former Flyer in the building right?

@ctherien6 I just love your positivity with the @NHLFlyers organization!! A team that you played pretty much your whole career for! Man it would of been fun to be your teammate! Sick of it! Glass half empty for you!!! #uncle https://t.co/dEECNz1gjf — Scott Hartnell (@Hartsy43) July 16 2022

This take:

Bundy being as beauty as ever took the high road with that typical Ottawan class:

Honest-to-God Hartsy this has been painful to watch happen. And it’s heart breaking. Sad actually. No way to spin it. I did that for years. — Chris Therien (@ctherien6) July 16 2022

Too bad I was born south of the border…

I’ll give one point to Hartnell. He knows better than anyone what a bad teammate looks like. If Kyle Scott was running Crossing Broad into the ground from the Jersey shore instead of a golf course in Florida like Scott and he asked me to defend the good name of CB to someone on Twitter I’d tell him to kick rocks. (No I wouldn’t. I would just lie and say my phone is broken so I didn’t see his text. Then again. if Kyle guaranteed me a blogging chair next to Taryn Hatcher for 80 plus days out of the year maybe I would. The best part is Kyle doesn’t even have my number saved in his phone anyway and I’ve been here for six months. Every time I call him he hits me with a cautious “Hello?” thinking I’m going to ask him about his car’s extended warranty or something.)

Alright back to Hartnell. Imagine deciding out of all weeks to carry the water for the Flyers you pick one of the worst weeks in franchise history. Have a backbone. You’re sticking your neck out for an organization and company that doesn’t give a fuck about you. Even the staunchest Flyers supporter can’t look at last week’s moves and support the organization. There’s a GoFundMe halfway to its goal to create a billboard outside the arena for the Flyers to sell the team.

The irony of this whole situation is Hartsy is going after the guy he replaced at the desk who NBCS Philly laid off at the height of COVID. Reach out to D-Gunn Katie Emmer the Breakfast on Broad cast that 700Level guy and long time employees behind the scenes. You’re a warm body until they decide they want a new toy and I promise you this tweet ain’t gonna make it on the sizzle reel your agent creates.

Wait?!? What’s this? Scott Hartnell calling the team soft last year? Interesting.

Conagra Brands Inc. the maker of Slim Jim jerky and Hunts tomato sauce anticipates raising prices on more of its food products in the coming months despite acknowledging that the price increase is beginning to hurt demand reports Bloomberg.

To compensate for higher costs the company announced on July 15 that it would impose additional price increases over the next two quarters. As a result of inflation-driven price hikes the Chicago-based manufacturer's sales rose in the three months ended May 29 but volume dropped by 6.4%.

Conagra is trying to maintain a delicate balance to preserve margins in the face of the highest U.S. inflation in four decades. Since rate increases have not kept pace with surging costs the business anticipates further price hikes in the coming year will significantly impact consumer demand.

The company's earnings declined in the quarter ended February 27 due to higher-than-expected costs. ""The environment isn't getting much easier in the near term"" Chief Executive Sean Connolly told Wall Street Journal in April.

Conagra said higher market prices for meat and dairy were affecting its frozen- and refrigerated-foods and snacks businesses. Due to shortages of drivers and trucks and higher fuel prices after Russia's invasion of Ukraine transporting food has become more expensive.

Another factor is the ongoing labor shortages worsened by the spread of the Omicron coronavirus variant earlier this year. ""There's nothing normal about the current environment"" Chief Financial Officer David Marberger told WSJ. ""I've been in [the] food [industry] a long time and I've never seen anything like that.""

Despite Conagra's decision to charge more in grocery stores Connolly said the company's revenue has remained strong. ""It's still a superior value relative to eating out"" he said. According to him Conagra's innovations and modernization of its brands make consumers want to pay more for its products. ""We're not seeing that in a lot of our competitors' products"" he said.

Analysts and retailers say consumers are beginning to switch to store brands or alternative cheaper food options in order to cut back on grocery staples. Conagra however expects earnings per share to rise 1% to 5% this fiscal year compared with the previous one. According to Bloomberg's average estimate analysts expected 8% growth.

""We'd expect investors to ask the question whether this guidance is prudently conservative or if the company is less well able than a number of its peers to handle the current challenging industry dynamics"" Bloomberg reported Barclays analyst Andrew Lazar said in a note to clients. More than 1 billion Slim Jims are produced by Conagra a year with about 569 million of the cylindrical meat sticks made annually in at least 21 varieties.",,,,,,,,,

While the idea of using nuclear power to replace the fossil fuels burned in oilsands production has been bandied about for years some experts say the reality could be just a decade or so away. On paper at least there is more potential to deploy small modular reactor (SMR) technology in the oilsands region of Alberta than anywhere else in the country.

""Without a doubt the oilsands is the biggest market for small modular reactors in Canada"" said John Gorman president and chief executive of the Canadian Nuclear Association. ""It's something that some companies are very actively looking at.""

Small modular reactors are a type of nuclear design that is far smaller than a traditional nuclear reactor. Generating between 10 and 300 MW of energy SMRs are fully scalable and are designed to be built economically in factory conditions rather than on site like a large-scale conventional reactor.

While SMRs are not yet commercially available the technology is getting close. The International Atomic Energy Agency estimates that nearly 100 SMRs could be operating around the world by 2030. In Canada four provinces — New Brunswick Ontario Saskatchewan and Alberta — have agreed to collaborate on the advancement of SMRs as a clean energy option and Canadian researchers are working on new materials and designs that could make SMRs practical in a large range of new uses.

Proponents say SMRs could potentially be used not only to provide clean electricity to smaller electricity grids like those in rural areas but also to provide heat for natural resource industries. In the oilsands operators use massive amounts of high-temperature heat to produce the steam needed to extract bitumen from sand — and they get that heat by burning natural gas.

In total the oil and gas industry is responsible for 30 per cent of Canada's natural gas consumption which means confronting the industry's fossil fuel usage will be key if Canada is to meet its climate commitments.

The oilsands industry itself — through an organization called Pathways Alliance which is made up of Canadian Natural Resources Ltd. Cenovus Energy Inc. ConocoPhillips Canada Imperial Oil Ltd. MEG Energy Corp. and Suncor Energy Inc. — has committed to reducing greenhouse gas emissions from oilsands production by 22 million tonnes annually by 2030 and reaching a goal of net-zero emissions by 2050.

To help get there the Pathways Alliance has proposed a major carbon capture and storage transportation line that would capture CO2 from oilsands facilities and transport it to a storage facility near Cold Lake Alta. That project alone could deliver about 10 million tonnes of emissions reductions per year and could be up and running by the end of the decade.

But Pathways has also formed a committee to formally explore nuclear as an alternative to natural gas in oilsands production.

""Absolutely we are looking at SMRs as a low or no-emission source of the high temperature heat we need"" said Martha Hall Findlay chief climate officer for Suncor Energy Inc. ""But it has to be economically viable. It has to make sense.""

Findlay said the industry will need clarity around what level of government financial support if any will be available for SMRs. There are also questions around the regulatory process given the energy sector's frustrating experience in recent years getting large-scale projects approved.

""It's Canada — it takes a really long time to build anything"" she said. ""But if we want to see implementation by 2030 or into the early 2030s we have to be doing this stuff now. We have to be looking at it now.""

Dan Wicklum president and CEO of non-profit advisory group The Transition Accelerator and the former CEO of the Canadian Oilsands Innovation Alliance said the energy industry has formally evaluated the nuclear opportunity in the past and discarded it largely because of cost.

But he said the industry's new target of net-zero emissions ""changes everything.""

""We can no longer just do the things we were going to do to reduce emissions. Optionality has fallen off the table for us"" Wicklum said. ""In an emissions elimination paradigm there's no question that nuclear is being taken very seriously.""

However Wicklum added that for any large-scale emissions reductions projects to get off the ground governments and industry will have to come to an agreement about whose responsibility it is to pay for them.

""Industry is looking to the federal government to say 'Make it worth our while'"" he said. ""They want more taxpayer dollars. They've essentially said there's not enough public support right now for them to act. And because of that I think the feasibility of SMRs — as well as carbon capture and storage and so on — is completely in question.""",,,,,,,,,,,,

De subir sus primeras canciones a YouTube a colaborar con Ed Sheeran o Bizarrap,"Quevedo no solo es un cantante y compositor español. También es una joven promesa de la música urbana de nuestro país gracias a la calidad de sus versos y el contenido de su lírica. Y no es para menos pues varios de sus temas se han posicionado entre las 50 canciones más virales de Spotify y los videos de sus singles acumulan millones de vistas en YouTube. Además su carrera parece que dentro de poco su carrera dará un salto gigantesco porque hace poco realizó una colaboración con nada más y nada menos que Ed Sheeran artista británico que ha ocupado más de una vez el podio de las estadísticas globales de Spotify.

La colaboración ha dado como resultado un remix de ""2step"". Sin embargo lo que desconcierta a muchas personas es el ascenso de este cantante que comenzó a grabar sus propios temas en 2019. Y que con apenas 30 singles ha llegado a firmar un remix con uno de los artistas más exitosos del mundo.

Orígenes

Pedro Domínguez Quevedo nació el 7 de diciembre de 2001 en Madrid pero cuando aún era un bebé su familia se mudó a Brasil lugar en el que vivió hasta los cinco años además de aprender de muchos géneros musicales como el Hip Hop y los ritmos latinos. Desde que era un niño ha disfrutado cantando. De hecho mostraba a sus familiares y amigos su talento musical ya sea en forma de improvisaciones o de poesías. Él mismo aseguró en una entrevista que desde pequeño le ha gustado mucho escribir y expresarse. Tras unos años viviendo en Brasil volvió a España concretamente a Las Palmas en Gran Canaria. Es por este motivo por el que su trabajo se ve influenciado por la cultura musical de la isla.

Trayectoria musical

Su carrera musical comenzó haciendo freestyle. Pero fue en 2020 cuando decidió continuar su carrera a nivel profesional con la publicación de su single ""Planteamiento Erróneo"" el 20 de junio 2020. Fue a partir de ese momento que su trayectoria no ha hecho más que crecer incorporando a su repertorio singles de varios millones de reproducciones. De hecho a finales de 2021 subió a YouTube uno de sus temas más populares ""Ahora y siempre"" que ya ha sumado 31 millones de reproducciones hasta el día de hoy.

El 13 de enero de 2022 su carrera daría pasos de gigante con ""Cayó la noche remix"" junto a artistas como La Pantera Juseph Bejo Cruz Cafuné Abhir Hathic y El Ima obteniendo más de 74 millones de reproducciones en YouTube y convirtiéndose en uno de los temas más exitosos de su repertorio.El 31 de marzo publicó su colaboración con Duki y De La Guetto ""Si quieren frontear"" que en menos de dos meses consiguió más de 33 millones de reproducciones. Pero si nos referimos a sencillos propios encontramos temas como ""Respuesta Cero"" con Bluefire ""Nonstop"" y ""Chamaquita"" con Juseph. Cabe destacar que su último éxito ha sido una sesión musical grabada con el productor argentino BZRP.

Actualmente se encuentra trabajando en su primer álbum de estudio pero aún no se sabe ningún detalle sobre la tracklist portada o el nombre del mismo. Pero según cree su manager gran parte de su éxito ""puede deberse a su actitud. Es un chico sencillo que trabaja y no se complica mucho la vida"".

Canciones

Pero ¿de dónde salen sus canciones? Según ha dicho el propio artista en una entrevista al periódico 'El Mundo' muchas veces hace música pensando en un ritmo más comercial porque ""al final son ritmos bailables y las letras son un poco menos reales"". ""Normalmente esas la suelo hacer en el estudio en el momento en el que hace la pista el productor me van saliendo melodías guapas y voy escribiendo una letra que tenga ese toque para bailar"".",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMilAFodHRwczovL2VscG9wdWxhci5wZS9kZXBvcnRlcy8yMDIyLzA3LzE1L3JpY2FyZG8tZ2FyZWNhLWhhYnJpYS1hY2VwdGFkby1yZXVuaXJzZS1hZ3VzdGluLWxvemFuby1wcmVzaWRlbnRlLWZwZi1zZWd1bi1sYXRpbmEtc2VsZWNjaW9uLXBlcnVhbmEtMTM5NTUx0gGYAWh0dHBzOi8vZWxwb3B1bGFyLnBlL2FtcC9kZXBvcnRlcy8yMDIyLzA3LzE1L3JpY2FyZG8tZ2FyZWNhLWhhYnJpYS1hY2VwdGFkby1yZXVuaXJzZS1hZ3VzdGluLWxvemFuby1wcmVzaWRlbnRlLWZwZi1zZWd1bi1sYXRpbmEtc2VsZWNjaW9uLXBlcnVhbmEtMTM5NTUx?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,¿Ricardo Gareca da última oportunidad a la FPF?

(KWQC) - FEMA presented early findings Friday on July 12th’s emergency preparedness exercises at the Constellation Quad Cities Generating Station.

Located just outside of Cordova the station’s two nuclear reactors make more than 1500 megawatts of energy enough energy to power more than one million homes. According to officials creating that much energy is a constant learning process.

“One out of every six weeks the crew is up here in the simulator in the classroom” said Brian Wake the vice president at the station. “They’re learning about changes to procedures learning about different activities that may have happened in the industry and incorporating these learnings as well as maintaining proficiency.”

Safety is always a priority.

“Everything that we do is looked at through the lens of protecting the health and safety of the public” said Wake. “So that’s really when we’re grading at the end of the day that’s what we’re looking at.”

Bi-annually FEMA holds an exercise to test the plant response to an emergency as well as a 10 mile surrounding area called an “emergency planning zone”.

“We came here this week with our evaluation team over 20 people and we went to Rock Island County Whiteside County” said Stephen Tulley a supervisor with FEMA. “What we actually look at is the performance demonstration of everything that we have looked at over the last two years.”

The plant operates in two different FEMA regions serving parts of both Illinois and Iowa. Because of this range FEMA’s exercise on Tuesday included a wide range of organizations everything from EMS Fire and Sheriff’s Departments to public communication and emergency warning facilities. Back at the plant’s training building representatives from the Nuclear Regulatory Commission observe employees in a simulated control room.

“So we have an inspector in there that is watching them respond real time to what is occurring in the plant the simulated conditions. And then they activate the other facilities” said Gregg Hansen a senior emergency preparedness inspector with the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. “A lot of command and control and communication is key.”

At Friday’s public press briefing FEMA representatives shared the very early results of the exercise.

“The process went well there was a lot of great coordination between the counties the state other organizations involved” said Tom Morgan chief of technological hazards for FEMA Region 7. ”The overall result of the exercise was that they did demonstrate the ability to respond effectively and protect the health and safety of the public.”

Officials say it will take FEMA a bit more time to compile a full report on the exercise usually around 90 days.

For now the Quad Cities Generating Station goes back to preparing for the next review coming up in just two more years.

Reddick then won two Xfinity Series junior motorsports championships and then was moved up to the NASCAR cup series.

After five second place finishes and in his 92nd start for Richard Childress Racing the 26-year-old Reddick got his first NASCAR win on July 3 at Road America in Elkhart Lake Wisconsin. Reddick raced in the No. 8 car and became the first driver to win a race in the No. 8 car since Dale Earnhardt Jr. in 2006.

Reddick became the fifth first-time NASCAR winner this season.

Reddick edged out the 2021 Race To America winner Chase Elliott defeating Elliott by 3.304 seconds. After trailing Elliott for much of the race Reddick passed Elliott on turn six on lap 47 of the 62 lap race and held on for the victory. Elliott pulled up beside Reddick on the racetrack and congratulated his competitor Childress got on the microphone and congratulated his driver and Reddick pulled into turn five in front of the fans and did several doughnuts and blew smoke before getting out of his car and saluting the fans.

Fellow NorCal-based NASCAR driver Kyle Larson who grew up in Elk Grove and raced at Cycleland with Reddick finished third in the race and had high praises for his competitor.

“We grew up racing together at Cycleland and a little bit in Red Bluff. He got out of California pretty early but I’ve always followed his career. Our paths kind of met back on the NASCAR circuit and he’s done a really good job winning a couple Xfinity championships and been really close to winning a handful of cup races so it was awesome to see him get it done yesterday” Larson said the next day at the Fourth of July race at Silver Dollar Speedway. “It was cool I was proud of him and I’m sure there’s a lot of people from this region that are proud of him as well.”

Reddick said in a post-race interview that he and his crew knew they could stay with Elliott in the long run and if they could cycle through the last pit sequence and be close or get around him they would be close and have a great shot at winning. Reddick said in the interview he loved the track and loved the fans and being there on Fourth of July weekend was special.

Potential buyers in New Jersey are shopping in a high-end mall across the hall from an Apple store. And from Denver to Washington state they are using virtual reality instead of kicking the tires.

Electric vehicle makers are racing to roll out showrooms across the country looking to create a new type of display space for their sleek and pricey cars and in the process becoming a growing tenant type for retail properties.

Just last week VinFast a Vietnamese electric car maker with much fanfare debuted a half-dozen showrooms in California most in the Los Angeles area. The company which has its U.S. headquarters in the Playa Vista section of Los Angeles said it plans to open several dozen more in the Golden State with the goal of having 30 total by the end of the year.

While VinFast is joined in a fast-growth strategy by some of the biggest electric car makers these companies don’t all share the same vernacular when it comes to naming the new showrooms popping up. So Lucid Group based in Newark California is continuing to build out a network of U.S. ""studios"" and service centers opening its 28th location — its first in the Pacific Northwest — in Seattle last month. Polestar the Swedish electric car maker aims to have 35 ""spaces"" across North America by year’s end.

They are jockeying to compete with dominant electric vehicle maker Tesla headquartered in Austin Texas. Tesla has the most retail ""galleries"" initially locating them in upscale malls.

Santa Monica California was one city where VinFast debuted its first electric vehicle stores outside of Vietnam last week. (VinFast)

""Tesla being the first to expand utilizing retail found a tremendous amount of success in attracting a consumer base"" and competitors are ""following a very similar path"" to the one that the legacy electric car maker laid out said Jason Greenstone an executive director of retail services at real estate firm Cushman & Wakefield.

Electric vehicles are looking more alluring to some Americans as gasoline prices soar. But competition in that auto sector has increased with more players emerging to take on incumbent Tesla. The newer entrants are trying to get their cars out in front of the public and showrooms in spots with high foot traffic act to get exposure for the brands.

""It’s a growing trend"" said Chuck Lanyard president of The Goldstein Group a retail broker in Paramus New Jersey.

New Way To Sell Cars

Electric vehicle makers have always had a much different model for selling their cars than traditional carmakers — offering them direct to consumers rather than through dealerships — and their leasing of sites at malls and other locations for showrooms is done to augment online sales.

Some states including New Jersey don’t permit automakers to operate their own dealerships to sell new cars so showrooms are the only option to get a vehicle in front of consumers to peruse in person or to nail down the features the buyer wants for the car he or she plans to order. Even if a state allows an electric vehicle company to have a dealership there is no need for those manufacturers to have a huge space like a traditional dealer since they often are only selling a handful of models in some cases just two or three Lanyard said.

But it’s been a rocky road for some electric car makers. At least one company that originally announced showroom openings has pulled back on those plans: Rivian Automotive which is headquartered in Irvine California.

VinFast which will be offering all-electric SUVs is making an audacious debut in the United States where it is opening its first stores outside of Vietnam. It held grand openings for six retail sites in California on Wednesday.

They are located at:

VinFast part of the conglomerate Vingroup owns a highly automated automotive manufacturing plant in Hai Phong Vietnam. In addition to targeting 24 more stores in California this year the company plans to open retail locations in Canada Germany France and the Netherlands.

""As the birthplace of car culture in the U.S. California is a natural focus market for VinFast. ... California is leading the way in the EV revolution so there is no better place for us to begin our U.S. expansion than in California"" Craig Westbrook VinFast’s chief service officer said in a statement.

Lucid Revs Openings

Lucid also has been ramping up its retail expansion. In recent months it’s opened showrooms at The Mall at Short Hills in Short Hills New Jersey; Cherry Creek Shopping Center in Denver; and most recently at University Village in Seattle where it also has a service center at 3412 Airport Way S.

""The response to Lucid in Washington state has been tremendous which reflects the region’s unique embrace of both innovation and the environment"" Zak Edson Lucid’s vice president of sales and service said in a statement about the showroom’s debut adding that there’s a growing number of Lucid Air sedan owners in the Seattle market.

Lucid recently opened a studio showroom at the Cherry Creek Shopping Center in Denver. (Lucid)

Like most auto showrooms Lucid’s retail sites offer samples of the interior and exterior elements of its cars. In Lucid’s case the elements are modeled and named after different parts of California. In addition to actually seeing some of Lucid’s vehicles visitors can sit in a virtual reality configurator for a demonstration of how the interior finishes and exterior color they are interested in will look when put together.

Lucid didn’t respond to several emails seeking a comment.

Its studio at the Short Hills mall is across from an Apple store the kind of retail site that Tesla pioneered according to Greenstone. Tesla’s strategy — and now that of other electric vehicle makers — was to open its galleries in upscale high-traffic malls or streets near lifestyle brands such as Apple Peloton and Lululemon he said.

""When you go to Short Hills mall you are paying for a billboard"" said Bill Read an executive vice president at brokerage Retail Specialists.

Patrons of those retailers are more likely to be physically active and concerned about issues such as the environment and pollution therefore more likely candidates to purchase an electric vehicle Greenstone said. And they are often affluent able to afford the price tags. Lucid’s luxury Air Grand Touring vehicle sells for $154000 while Rivian’s R1T truck will set a buyer back $73000.

These electric vehicle showrooms only have to be 2500 to 4000 square feet big enough to display a couple of vehicles he said. And in a mall setting an electric car maker can easily have some vehicles parked outside in the lot for test drives and it doesn’t have to have inventory in stock on-site according to Greenstone.

Tesla Turns to Big Boxes

Tesla has recently been moving away from mall locations evolving its real estate strategy to lease large vacant free-standing retail sites for combined showrooms and service centers. For example last week Wayne New Jersey granted approval for Tesla to take over a former Bloomingdale’s furniture outlet at 469 Route 46. Tesla plans to use the largest building at the site for vehicle service. A smaller building will incorporate a 3120-square-foot showroom with the rest of the building used to store vehicles awaiting pickup by customers.

And in Atlanta Tesla has filed plans to lease a former Whole Foods Market store at 2111 Briarcliff Road as a sales and service center according to a report in Atlanta Tomorrow’s News Today.

Tesla didn’t respond to several emails seeking comment.

Tesla has 165 sites — showrooms and combined showroom-and-service centers — according to CoStar data. It has two locations that are 60000 square feet and over former department store boxes said Brandon Svec CoStar Group’s national director of retail analytics. The Tesla locations include 35 that are 30000 to 38000 square feet; 29 that are 10000 to 20000 square feet; and 27 that are 20000 to 30000 square feet. The automaker has 51 sites that are 1000 to 5000 square feet according to CoStar.

Tesla is ""keeping and renewing"" stores at malls that are performing well Greenstone said.

Retail expansion hasn’t been without its pullbacks by electric vehicle makers with not only Tesla shuttering some mall showrooms during the past few years but Rivian dropping plans to open a showroom at 932 W. Randolph St. in the Fulton Market area of Chicago.

""The Randolph Street location is no longer in our plans though we are still exploring our options in Chicago and look forward to sharing when the time is right"" Rivian spokewoman Miranda Jimenez said in an email adding that the company has shifted its ""physical footprint focus"" to its service centers.

Rivian only operates one U.S. showroom or ""hub"" in Venice California which it opened in October.

Former Substation and Gallery

""This space caters to anyone ranging from the EV-curious to Rivian pre-order holders and owners to families"" Jimenez said. ""Visitors can come together to share and connect through the site’s offerings and programming. ... The space is just over 3500 square feet and emphasizes adaptive reuse as it was formerly the site of author Ray Bradbury’s private residence an electric utility substation and an art gallery at separate times. You’ll find a library communal hall two display vehicles and open-air spaces for adults and children alike on-site.""

Rivian has more than 20 service centers across the United States in major cities such as Los Angeles and Chicago as well as smaller markets such as Olathe Kansas and Garfield Heights Ohio.

But there’s still a swell of retail activity by electric vehicle makers with newcomers beyond even VinFast and Lucid.

Faraday Future Intelligent Electric will also be establishing a foothold in the retail world in California. It will be opening what it calls a ""flagship-brand experience center"" at 464 N. Beverly Road in Beverly Hills. The company plans to debut its core vehicle the FF 91 in the third quarter.

""In the near future our cars will not only be in store windows but will also be on the streets of California and beyond available to all who wish to experience this new species of the ultimate intelligent TechLuxury vehicle” Carsten Breitfeld global CEO of Faraday Future said in a statement.

The company has received its dealer license from California which allows it to sell directly to buyers in the state and to sell vehicles online to users outside of California. Its Beverly Hills center will feature a retail area a sales lounge a cafe a virtual-reality experience a co-creation lab and a VIP lounge ""making the in-store sales experience complementary to the driving experience of the FF 91"" according to Faraday Future.

Faraday has said it aims to have flagship showrooms in the largest 20 cities around the world including New York by 2025.

Swedish electric vehicle maker Polestar aims to have 35 showrooms across North America by the end of 2022. (Polestar)

And Polestar aims to have 35 of its spaces across North America by the end of 2022 according to company spokesman Donny Nordlicht. Right now it has nearly 25.

""Our sales model is digital-first but also includes teaming up with our space partners for the physical footprint"" Nordlicht said in an email. ""Those partners are franchised retailers; we are not subject to any state laws regarding direct-sales as we do not sell direct to the customer.""

Polestar also has mall sites including the Short Hills mall where Lucid opened in February.",,,,,,,,,,,,

Costco’s member renewal rate was 91% in the U.S. and Canada and 89% worldwide. On the most recent earnings call Richard Galanti executive vice president and chief financial officer for Costco stated that member renewal rates were increasing due to members using the auto-renew feature.

He also said an increasing number of Executive members were renewing at a higher rate than Gold Star or Business members. Membership fees are currently $60 for Gold Star members and $120 for Executive members. Total sales for Costco in 2021 were $192 billion an increase of 18% from 2020. Costco’s net income or profit increased by 25% to $5 billion. Last year Costco brought in $3.9 billion in membership fees a 9% increase from the prior year. One way to look at Costco’s numbers is that its membership fees made up almost 80% of its profit.

Costco has over half of the wholesale club market (55.5%) and a single Costco location makes on average $526000 per day close to $200 million a year. Costco saw incredible growth in 2021 with its revenue increasing by almost one-fifth from the previous year. Costco has a devoted following who enjoy the savings made possible by shopping at the warehouse store and there is no sign that member loyalty or their spending habits are fading.

This Beloved Snack Is Back at Costco and After Trying It I Have Some Thoughts

August Openings

These four warehouses are just putting the finishing touches on before they open their doors in Florida Texas California and Wisconsin. According to local news publication The St. Augustine Record the first Costco in St. John's County Fla. will be checking memberships on August 3 and will feature a liquor store a tire center and a gas station. College Station Texas home to Texas A&M University will follow closely behind on August 4.6254a4d1642c605c54bf1cab17d50f1e

For the Murrieta Calif. location an exact opening date has not yet been confirmed but the building efforts have been in the works since 2018. It was initially put on hold due to nearby residents' concerns about the environmental and traffic impacts of a 151000-square-foot store The Press-Enterprise reported.

Last but not least opening in late August Verona Wis. will be the third Costco in the Madison area though there is no confirmed launch date as of yet.

October Openings

The Kirkland expansion takes no breaks but the beginning of fall will start off slow with just two ribbon-cutting ceremonies in the Southwestern and Pacific-Northwest regions of the country.

The warehouse in Queen Creek Ariz. a suburb of Phoenix will be developed as part of a wider retail center called ""Queen Creek Center"" ABC15 reported in July 2021.

The second opening will take place in Lake Stevens Wash. despite some construction setbacks. According to local news the project broke ground in June 2021 but was met with opposition from a neighborhood coalition over ecological concerns. The work was able to move forward however and they are set to open sometime in October as the fourth Costco in Snohomish County.

November Openings

The end of the year is a bustling time for Costco launching locations just in time for new members to experience all the holiday wonders the warehouse aisles have to offer.

Shoppers can expect to welcome stores in the South (Athens Ga. and University City Miss.) the Midwest (Ankeny Iowa and Liberty Township Ohio) and the West (Redding Calif. and Logan Utah).

International Openings

The Costco shopping experience isn't just reserved for consumers in the United States. There are currently 11 countries outside of the U.S. with a Costco footprint including Canada Mexico Japan South Korea and the United Kingdom. This fall Costco is adding New Zealand to the list as well as extending its reach in South Korea.

The very first warehouse in New Zealand has been placed in Auckland a city with over 1.5 million residents. An Oceania-based news outlet MiNDFOOD reported that though the opening is set for August membership sales started in March 2022 when ""customers were seen queuing for hours outside the Costco New Zealand store in Westgate Auckland to get their hands on a membership."" The location will be a mega-store spanning three floors and offering groceries homewares liquor an optometrist a food court and a gas station for members.

Meanwhile South Korea will add two more storefronts to their existing 10. Gimhae a city next to the Nakdong River will be the first to open its doors this August with Gocheok a town in Seoul to follow in October.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiR2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZS1zdW4uY29tL21vbmV5LzU3OTUzOTcvaGVhbHRoeS1kZXNzZXJ0LWl0ZW1zLWJ1eS1jb3N0Y28v0gFLaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cudGhlLXN1bi5jb20vbW9uZXkvNTc5NTM5Ny9oZWFsdGh5LWRlc3NlcnQtaXRlbXMtYnV5LWNvc3Rjby9hbXAv?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,I’m a chef – the three healthy items at Costco you need to buy for your kids including desserts as low as 6...,"THERE are plenty of healthy items that you can buy for your kids at Costco and potentially save money doing so.

Many know Costco for the savings it provides on products in bulk.

2 The food expert said the desserts are a buy thanks to its high-quality ingredients

2 You can save 50% on this turkey compared with other retailers according to Bobby

To shop at the store you need to be a member which will cost $60 or $120 per year depending on the benefits you want.

For Costco shoppers looking to eat on the healthy side chef and cookbook author Bobby Parrish has you covered with a few products.

He also describes himself as a grocery shopping expert who educates people on what they put in their bodies so they can thrive while saving money.

Here’s what he shared with his more than 1million Instagram followers a recent video on what you can buy for your kids.

1. Healthy Choice Organic Fudge Bars

Healthy Choice certainly lives up to its name – and it’s no different even with a fudge bar snack.

The snack contains organic non-genetically modified organism (GMO) skim milk no processed oils and vanilla extract.

But the best part is the low sugar content.

“They only have eight grams of sugar” Bobby said.

“It’s a great dessert option.”

As far as pricing goes keep in mind that this could vary by location.

But an 18-count in the Costco Bobby was in had it listed for $11.99.

That’s about 67 cents a bar.

2. Deep Dark Chocolate Avocado ice cream

But more chocolatey dessert items could be good options for your kids.

Just like with the fudge bars Bobby is focused on low sugar.

The avocado fudge bars contain 12 grams of it – which isn’t high for ice cream.

A four-pack of pints at the store was listed for $13.99 or about $3.50 each.

While it’s a bit pricier it has Bobby’s approval for high-quality ingredients including organic avocados.

3. Dietz & Watson organic sliced turkey

Bobby is a fan of the value of a 3/9-ounce turkey at Costco.

While the price might seem high at $14.59 he said that the price is 50% less when compared to other grocery stores when it comes to organic turkey.

The item at Costco includes less than 2% of sea salt water and organic vinegar.

He describes them as ""best-in-class ingredients.”

And he added that the organic brand is “one of the best turkeys on the market for the best-ever price.”

Meanwhile Bobby said that he noticed that shoppers were buying a Columbus brand of sliced turkey because it’s cheaper.

But he recommends avoiding it because it has soy protein isolate brown sugar and GMO turkey.

As food costs skyrocket and inflation hits record highs even for wholesalers Costco will hold steady on its iconic dog-and-drink deal.

The combo has cost $1.50 since it first arrived in food courts in 1985 even though the Bureau of Labor Statistics’ inflation calculator says it’s worth more than $4 today.

Jelinek once suggested raising the price but in a now-legendary exchange co-founder Jim Sinegal shut him down quickly allegedly responding with “If you raise (the price of) the effing hot dog I will kill you.” Instead of increasing prices Costco switched from Hebrew National franks to making its own Kirkland Signature brand hot dogs at a plant in Los Angeles Mental Floss reported.

But while the deal’s price tag has aged well some loyalists question whether they’re still getting as good a deal as they once did. (There are many loyalists. In fiscal year 2019 the wholesaler sold 151 million combos according to the Puget Sound Business Journal.)

Pat and Monty McCormick have been Costco members for 35 years. They’re frequent buyers of the hot dog-and-a-soda combo and have fond memories of bringing their children and grandchildren to the food court. But ever since the stores removed the sauerkraut and onions from the condiments bar they don’t find themselves buying franks as often.

“Sometimes I don’t think stores realize how much the changes they make affect customers” Pat McCormick said. “The store might think it’s just a little thing but to the customer it can make a big difference.”

The longer customers pay fixed prices for iconic products like $1.50 for the hot dog combo or 5 cents for a bottle of Coca-Cola the harder it is to change those prices without backlash said Jeff Shulman marketing professor at the University of Washington’s Foster School of Business.

Since Costco shoppers know precisely how much a hot dog combo is worth any increase in price would be highly noticeable and in theory give people the impression that Costco is becoming a more expensive place to shop.

However a period of mass inflation provides the perfect opportunity to raise prices since the business could blame higher supply costs Shulman said. That Costco chose to keep its price steady will only make it more difficult to adjust in the future.

“I can’t imagine if things continue as they are that it’ll still continue to be the best economic decision” Shulman said. “Enjoy it while it lasts!”

Public-listed stated-owned enterprise Phnom Penh Autonomous Port (PPAP) recorded a 29 percent increase in unaudited revenue to $19.76 million in January-June period this year.

PPAP said in a filing to the Cambodia Securities Exchange (CSX) last week that the number of cargo vessels handled at the river port in the first semester increased by 85.66 percent to 2124 as oil gas and cargo throughput rose by 8.60 percent to 2.10. million tonnes.

The container throughput surged by 42.02 percent to 209176 TEUs (twenty-foot equivalent units) read the report.

In the June alone the port posted $3.59 million in unaudited revenue a 28 percent increase year-on-year.

The port’s revenue increase reflects the recovery of regional and global business activity as the Covid-19 crisis eases.

The port has unveiled plans to build seven river-based ports to boost agricultural and tourism transportation ensuring greater accessibility for customers and reducing costs. Chea Vannak – AKP",,,,,,,,,,,,

There was rarely a ‘normal day’ for Connie Cummins in her role as the top supervisor for Superior National Forest.

“Every day is different. And that’s what I love about the job” Cummins told WTIP in a recent interview. “There is variety. And so is there a normal day? There really isn’t. It’s a big forest there’s a lot going on in so many different program areas. It’s well loved by so many people so many people are interested in it.”

After leading the expansive Superior National Forest for the U.S. Forest Service for the past six years Cummins is set to retire at the end of the month. Her last day is July 30.

Cummins was very familiar with the complexities of Superior National Forest – which includes the entire Boundary Waters Canoe Area Wilderness – long before she arrived to her current post in 2016. She served as a district ranger on the La Croix District for nine years. Previous to becoming the supervisor at Superior National Forest Cummins also worked on the Fremont-Winema National Forest in Lakeview Ore. where she severed as the forest supervisor for approximately two years.

When it comes to leading what is nationally-known as one of the most complex national forests across the country Cummins said the job leading Superior National Forest was both rewarding in that regard though not without its challenges.

“It is complex. And it this does get a lot of attention beyond just the state of Minnesota” she said. “II just think it’s because so many people love it and so many people are interested in it that it just gets a lot of attention.”

Among the notable decisions or issues Cummins faced during her tenure are the proposed expansion of Lutsen Mountains the complete closure of the BWCA in 2021 due to wildfires a quota reduction for permits in the BWCA for the 2022 paddling season campsite closures due to bear activity in the wilderness copper-nickel mining on the edge of the wilderness just to name a few.

Shannon Rische currently the deputy forest supervisor on Superior National Forest will serve as acting forest supervisor until someone is hired permanently to replace Cummins.

And when they're cared for properly diesel trucks can last for hundreds of thousands of miles.

Given the current state of the U.S. economy with fuel prices continually rising and new-vehicle availability limited by supply chain issues and higher production costs (which typically are passed on to the buyer) many of the brand-new and expensive diesel trucks we drool over may not be as great a bargain as some of the older rigs that are available in the used-truck market.

The question ""What is the most reliable diesel truck?"" opens a war-zone of debate where differing opinions and fierce brand loyalty make coming up with a universally accepted answer extremely difficult.

Results

Teagan O’Dell clocked a few of the fastest times this season nationally among 15-year-old girls during the 2022 So Cal Invite last weekend in Irvine California.

O’Dell opened the women’s 200-meter medley relay with a 28.67 backstroke leg to help host Irvine Novaquatics claim first place in a total time of 1:56.57. Her split marked the third-fastest time this season for her age and improved upon her previous best by .17 seconds. Kaitlin Nguyen (33.42 breaststroke leg) Sammy Cummins (28.29 butterfly leg) and Ariel Lin (26.19 freestyle anchor) combined for the second-fastest time this season among 15-year-old girls.

In the women’s 400 freestyle O’Dell placed second with a 4:17.67 shaving more than five seconds off her previous best to move up to No. 4 this season among 15-year-old girls. Her 55.66 split ranked as the fastest on her victorious 400 free relay squad that also featured Lin and Cummins along with rising Cal senior Ayla Spitz. O’Dell also placed fourth in the 200 fly with a 2:17.49 .12 off her personal best that ranks seventh this season for her age.

Twenty-year-old Blake Tierney posted a pair of personal bests for his University of British Columbia Thunderbirds squad. In the men’s 100 free he lowered his personal best from prelims by nearly a second en route to a runner-up finish.

Tierney touched first in both the 200 back (2:03.03) and 200 free (1:50.69) the latter representing a personal best by .08 seconds. In the 200 back he was nearly four seconds off his personal best in the event that almost earned him an Olympic berth last year. He went 1:59.49 at Canadian Olympic Trials to place second but he wasn’t selected for the team because he missed the FINA ‘A’ cut. As a first-year student this past season for the Thunderbirds Tierney swam the anchor leg for the men’s 400 free relay team that lowered the program’s own U SPORTS record in the event with a 3:29.74. Tierney’s UBC teammate Liam Lawson-Honeyman set a new personal best by more than two seconds en route to a first-place finish in the men’s 1500 free.

Sixteen-year-old Daniel Li swept the breaststroke events while setting personal bests in the process. The Rose Bowl Aquatics swimmer won the 100 breast in 1:02.58 third-fastest this season among 16-year-old boys and .27 seconds faster than his previous best. In the 200 breast Li went .55 seconds faster than his previous best to win in 2:15.72 which ranks as the second-fastest time this season for his age. His Rose Bowl Aquatics group brought home more medals (18) than any club at the meet.

Rising University of Texas junior David Johnston also won multiple events at the meet. He triumphed in the 400 IM with a 4:17.59 four seconds away from his personal best before winning the 400 free in 3:52.19 — just two-hundredths slower than his personal best. Johnston also qualified first in the 1500 free but he didn’t end up swimming the final.

Soon-to-be USC sophomore Caroline Pennington showed off her distance freestyle prowess by sweeping the women’s 400 800 and 1500 free events but she was well off her personal bests in all three victories. Her teammate rising USC junior Hanna Henderson took first place in the women’s 50 free in 26.16 less than a second slower than her personal best.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMimgFodHRwczovL3RoZXdlc3QuY29tLmF1L25ld3MvZWR1Y2F0aW9uL2Zvcm1lci1idXNzZWx0b24tdGVhY2hlci1tYXJrLWN1bW1pbnMtc3RlcHMtdXAtZmlnaHQtZm9yLWlucXVpcnktaW50by1zY2hvb2wtc3VpY2lkZS1wcmV2ZW50aW9uLWd1aWRlbGluZXMtYy03NTMwMzQ30gGeAWh0dHBzOi8vdGhld2VzdC5jb20uYXUvbmV3cy9lZHVjYXRpb24vZm9ybWVyLWJ1c3NlbHRvbi10ZWFjaGVyLW1hcmstY3VtbWlucy1zdGVwcy11cC1maWdodC1mb3ItaW5xdWlyeS1pbnRvLXNjaG9vbC1zdWljaWRlLXByZXZlbnRpb24tZ3VpZGVsaW5lcy1jLTc1MzAzNDcuYW1w?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Former Busselton teacher Mark Cummins steps up fight for inquiry into school suicide prevention guidelines,"A teacher who quit his job to sound the alarm over concerns WA schools are ignoring critical suicide prevention guidelines is gaining support for his call for a Parliamentary inquiry.

Mark Cummins and three other staff members recently resigned from Busselton’s St Mary MacKillop College after the death of a student last year claiming it failed to notify parents or put risk-management plans in place when students disclosed thoughts of self-harm or suicide.

As revealed by The West Australian they alleged the college failed to follow protocols known as the School Response and Planning Guidelines for Students with Suicidal Behaviour and Non-Suicidal Self-Injury. The college and Catholic Education WA have rejected the claims.

Mr Cummins says he has since discovered staff at many other schools are also unaware of the guidelines.

TheNightly Get in front of tomorrow's news for FREE Journalism for the curious Australian across politics business culture and opinion. READ NOW

He has won the backing of South West MP and Shadow Treasurer Steve Thomas who helped lodge an e-petition on Friday calling for Parliament to hold an inquiry into “the extent all schools in WA adopted and complied with” the guidelines since they were endorsed in 2018 by all three educational sectors — Catholic public and independent.

Dr Thomas who is also the leader of the Opposition in the Legislative Council said the petition focused on whether the agreed protocols were actually being applied — and whether the Education Department was monitoring the compliance of individual schools.

“Because anecdotally it would appear to be very much on a school-by-school basis despite the fact this is a universally accepted strategy” Dr Thomas said.

“When you get people saying they work in a school where they don’t seem to know the guidelines even exist then there’s obviously an issue.”

“The Education Department needs to assure itself and reassure the community that the guidelines are being properly applied across the board and that’s the step that the petition is particularly focused on.”

“I would have thought that the Education Department should be doing those things. And if they’re not we want to know”

Dr Thomas said lodging the petition in the upper house meant the government was formally required to respond.

Mr Cummins said he believed many schools had failed to adopt or comply with the critical guidelines.

“I think we deserve answers.” he said. “These are our kids this is our money these are our schools. This is not good enough.”

“Governance within each sector has failed to regulate and audit their schools to ensure compliance and ensure that our children are receiving the necessary supports when they are at their most vulnerable.”

“The consequences of these failures are immeasurable and devastating across the State.

“I want answers and an explanation as to why so many families have been let down and I am willing to fight for that and accept the cost.”

Education Minister Sue Ellery has previously said she had asked the Education Department to inquire into the concerns raised by Mr Cummins and to work with CEWA to make sure any issues identified were addressed."

Behind the shiny veneer of the pharmacy chain's discount programs and coupons there are some major concerns you'll want to be aware of from store cleanliness to price-gauging schemes to employee treatment. Read on for five behind-the-scenes alerts from ex-CVS employees.

1 Stores and pharmacies may not be as clean as you'd hope.

A former CVS employee took to the press to reveal how infrequently certain parts of the store are cleaned. In an interview with The Sun they said ""The shelves are super dusty and dirty. We would have to clean them and it was so gross."" They blamed this on the fact that staff can only clean during their downtime which isn't often.

Similarly the ex-employee said that the trays pharmacists use to count prescriptions are not always washed between uses a big no-no since ""some medications can't be mixed or touched by other [medications]"" they explain. Another snafu went viral on TikTok when a user posted a video of a pharmacist using non-gloved hands to fill her prescription after handling money in the cash register.

2 Pharmacy techs are overworked which can lead to mistakes.

For the past few years many CVS pharmacists have claimed to be burnt out. Even before the pandemic hit the New York Times published an investigative report detailing how ""understaffed and chaotic"" many CVS pharmacies are. The story quoted an anonymous pharmacist who wrote to the Pennsylvania Board of Pharmacy: ""The amount of busywork we must do while verifying prescriptions is absolutely dangerous. Mistakes are going to be made and the patients are going to be the ones suffering."" Likewise a North Carolina-based pharmacist who quit his job over the situation detailed to the Times how he had worked a 13-hour shift with no meal break and filled 552 prescriptions during that time in addition to handling the phones and giving shots.

Earlier this year the Times published a follow-up story that made clear how pharmacists were perhaps even more overworked due to Covid-19 vaccines and tests as well as a nationwide labor shortage. To address the issue in February 2022 the pharmacy department began closing daily from 1:30 pm to 2:00 p.m. for personnel to take a ""pre-scheduled uninterrupted lunch break"" as a CVS spokesperson told Drug Store News. It's not clear if this has helped. A former employee wrote on Indeed in July 2022 that ""workers [are] not given notice on schedule changes expected to work past schedule hours and unable to take breaks due to understaffing and unrealistic expectations.""

3 Beware of being overcharged for prescriptions.

In June 2022 a former senior CVS executive filed a whistleblower lawsuit that claimed CVS Health ""intentionally prevented certain Medicare beneficiaries from accessing less expensive generic prescriptions"" according to MedCity News. The scheme which was allegedly targeting elderly patients since 2015 resulted in the company garnering ""astonishing profits for itself while passing the increased costs onto taxpayers and Part D beneficiaries"" the complaint read.ae0fcc31ae342fd3a1346ebb1f342fcb

This lawsuit puts CVS Caremark the pharmacy benefit manager (PBM) for CVS Health under scrutiny. PBMs are third-party entities that manage prescription drug benefits for large companies but they're often criticized for the fact that they receive rebates from drug manufacturers.

4 Think twice before signing up for CarePass.

CarePass is a CVS membership program that costs $5/month but also comes with a $10/month promotion. So if you take advantage of that perk you're actually $5 ahead of the game. However just like a gym membership CarePass can become yet another subscription that you don't end up using but the corporate strategy is to push employees to meet sign-up goals.

Entire Reddit threads are devoted to the pressure put on store workers to sell CarePass which in some cases has caused them to resort to less-than-ethical tactics in order to keep their jobs. One commenter explained how his co-worker lies to elderly shoppers when the CarePass prompt appears on their checkout screens telling them ""it's just an upgrade to your ExtraCare card it's free"" when in fact it's only free for the first month.

5 Don't have inappropriate photos printed.

CVS is known for its easy-to-use photo center where customers can upload images via the website or the app and then just swing by to pick them up and pay. But if you're considering printing anything racy think again. On TikTok a CVS employee captioned her video: ""idk how many times I have to say this. don't print your nudes at CVS i do in fact see every single one."" You also run the risk of getting flagged by CVS as their photo policy states that it ""prohibits the uploading of adult or offensive content."" Another TikTok user confirmed this sharing a video about how she received a censorship notice from the store after trying to print ""sensual photos"" for her boyfriend.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMid2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm96YXJrc2ZpcnN0LmNvbS9uZXdzL3NwcmluZ2ZpZWxkLW5ld3MvbG9jYWwtbGlxdWlkYXRpb24tY29tcGFueS1idXlzLWhpc3RvcmljLWJ1aWxkaW5nLW9uLWdsZW5zdG9uZS1hdmVudWUv0gF7aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cub3phcmtzZmlyc3QuY29tL25ld3Mvc3ByaW5nZmllbGQtbmV3cy9sb2NhbC1saXF1aWRhdGlvbi1jb21wYW55LWJ1eXMtaGlzdG9yaWMtYnVpbGRpbmctb24tZ2xlbnN0b25lLWF2ZW51ZS9hbXAv?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Local liquidation company buys historic building on Glenstone Avenue,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 429 Client Error: Unknown Error for url: https://www.ozarksfirst.com/news/springfield-news/local-liquidation-company-buys-historic-building-on-glenstone-avenue/ on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMid2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm96YXJrc2ZpcnN0LmNvbS9uZXdzL3NwcmluZ2ZpZWxkLW5ld3MvbG9jYWwtbGlxdWlkYXRpb24tY29tcGFueS1idXlzLWhpc3RvcmljLWJ1aWxkaW5nLW9uLWdsZW5zdG9uZS1hdmVudWUv0gF7aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cub3phcmtzZmlyc3QuY29tL25ld3Mvc3ByaW5nZmllbGQtbmV3cy9sb2NhbC1saXF1aWRhdGlvbi1jb21wYW55LWJ1eXMtaGlzdG9yaWMtYnVpbGRpbmctb24tZ2xlbnN0b25lLWF2ZW51ZS9hbXAv?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUGh0dHBzOi8vZmluYW5jZS55YWhvby5jb20vbmV3cy9qZW5uaWZlci1sb3Blei1iZW4tYWZmbGVjay1tYXJyaWVkLTIyMzcwMDc4NC5odG1s0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Jennifer Lopez and Ben Affleck are married,"Congratulations are in order for Jennifer Lopez and Ben Affleck who are now married three months after announcing their engagement for the second time.

The pair began dating in 2002 and announced their first engagement later the same year but in 2004 they called it off before reuniting last year.

Revealing all in her newsletter On the JLO she revealed that the pair ran off to Las Vegas to get hitched - the exact opposite of what most people imagined they would do - in the Little White Wedding Chapel.

She called it the ""best night of our lives"" and it was exactly what they wanted it to be writing ""We did it. Love is beautiful. Love is kind. And it turns out love is patient. Twenty years patient"".

Jennifer explained that they queued for a marriage license and headed to the chapel around midnight.

""We barely made it to the little white wedding chapel by midnight. They graciously stayed open late a few minutes let us take pictures in a pink Cadillac convertible evidently once used by the king himself (but if we wanted Elvis himself to show that cost extra and he was in bed).

""So with the best witnesses you could ever imagine a dress from an old movie and a jacket from Ben's closet we read our own vows in the little chapel and gave one another the rings we'll wear for the rest of our lives.""





She's also signed the newsletter from Jennifer Lynn Affleck so it's official; it's actually happened.



While promoting her latest movie ironically titled Marry Me Lopez spoke about her second shot at love with Affleck.

""I would say we learned our lesson the first time"" she explained. ""To hold it sacred. ""You have to do what feels good to you all the time. But at the same time you learn from the past you do things better the second time.

""There's a part of it that yes we're together. But there's a part of it that's not you know being so open the way we were when we were so young and in love many years ago.""

Warren Buffett is a stickler for consistency and it's no surprise why. Businesses that are capable of doing the same thing year after year while still posting decent growth regardless of whatever's happening in the market and in the world tend to be winners in the long run. And for Buffett it's no big problem to wait out decades as his investments compound in value like clockwork.

Companies like Walgreens Boots Alliance (WBA -0.69%) seem like obvious candidates for investors like Buffett. As a pharmacy and retailer there's little it needs to do differently to keep collecting money from the millions of people who rely on its stores. But the picture is a bit more complicated than that upon closer inspection so let's dive in.

It's a mixed bag

One of Buffett's biggest points of emphasis in investing is whether or not a business has an economic moat and if it does how wide. Wide moats tend to lead to robust and sturdy profit margins whether or not there are competitors in play. So they're a crucial aspect of a company's potential to make long-lived returns. In Walgreens' case the moat consists of the locations of its retail stores especially in high-value areas where commercial real estate may be sparse or too expensive for late-coming competitors to justify having a footprint.

But as you may have realized that isn't exactly a wide moat so it isn't particularly a point in the stock's favor as far as Buffett might be concerned. Nor is Walgreens' profitability particularly durable over time; in the last 10 years its gross margin has shrunk and it has had a number of unprofitable periods.

Nonetheless the company's sales grow with a consistency that would probably appeal to Buffett. Since 2002 its trailing 12-month revenue has risen by 369% reaching more than $134.5 billion. At a minimum that points to the enduring demand for its pharmacy goods and services.

Buffett might be pleased with Walgreens' low spending on research and development; it hasn't claimed any such expenses in the past decade. For Buffett spending a lot on making new products or improving old ones is a sign that the company's business model may not be evergreen enough and is at risk of competition that could drive down margins.

That's not to say that Walgreens isn't changing its offerings over time to chase new growth opportunities though. With its new plans to offer health insurance and some basic primary care services out of its branded Health Corners it's conceivable that its growth could accelerate.

Plus services like health insurance tend to be inconvenient to switch away from once customers are signed up which should mean that at least some of the new revenue from selling insurance could be persistent. And health insurance is a line of business that definitely features wide and often unassailable moats thanks to the legal hurdles necessary to participate in the market.

He'd probably like its price

So far Walgreens doesn't have the makings of a traditional Buffett stock like Moody's or Visa even if there are a few indications it's getting into lines of business that he might find more favorable. But there is one thing that Buffett would find very appealing compared to the company's competitors: its valuation. Take a look at this chart:

As you can see Walgreens has a significantly lower price-to-sales (P/S) ratio price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio and price-to-book (P/B) ratio in a head-to-head matchup against its archrival CVS Health. That doesn't mean Buffett would be jumping to buy it but it does mean that he'd interpret its potential for future growth as being at a discount today which could be an important influence.

Given that Buffett prefers to buy high-quality companies at a fair price rather than average companies at a discount it's still hard to say that he'd be very tempted. It's not beyond the realm of possibility for that to change over the next few years especially if the pharmacy can demonstrate that its new services are going to lead to permanent improvements to its margin.

Until then there's no rule that says you shouldn't buy stocks that the Oracle of Omaha wouldn't be interested in even though it's hard to justify a purchase if you use his traditional value investing framework."

""Another restaurant we went to had open seats outside but when we went to the host they mentioned that the kitchen was short-staffed"" Rothenberg an operations director at a California-based fintech firm told CNBC. ""So although he had seating he was going to put us on a 30-minute waitlist to be seated.""

Rothenberg was on the 30-minute waitlist for nearly an hour he said. Then after he was seated he waited another 45 minutes for his food to arrive.

""It was the type of experience that makes me not want to eat out as much"" he said. ""I felt bad for the servers because they were trying but they could only do so much not having enough cooks.""

It's a scenario that has been repeated across the food service industry since the Covid pandemic began in 2020 and it's taking a toll on restaurants and their staff as well.

Lockdowns in spring of that year led to layoffs and furloughs for many cooks and waitstaff prompting the federal government to back billions of dollars in forgivable loans for small businesses. The disease ravaged the U.S. workforce killing more than a million people over the course of two-plus years while sickening many millions more according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

As states relaxed their restrictions restaurant employment recovered although the industry is still down 750000 jobs — roughly 6.1% of its workforce — from pre-pandemic levels as of May according to the National Restaurant Association.

Customers are noticing the difference. In the first quarter of 2022 customers mentioned short staffing three times more often in their Yelp reviews than in the year-ago period according to the restaurant review site. Mentions of long waits rose 23%.

""I think the experience has been different since Covid. I see that the restaurant industry has changed a lot"" Nev Wright a health-care worker told CNBC outside Firebirds Wood Fired Grill in Eatontown New Jersey. ""It wasn't always like this — now it takes time with expenses and shortages of staff and everything.""

The American Customer Satisfaction Index found that consumers were less happy with fast-food chains this year compared with 2021 — the sector's score slipped to 76 out of 100 from 78. Customers were less satisfied about the speed and accuracy of their orders and about the cleanliness and layout of the restaurant.

The customer satisfaction scores for independent and small chain restaurants also dropped this year to 80 out of 100 from 81 according to ACSI's annual report. Some national full-service chains saw their scores fall even more year over year: Dine Brands' Applebees dropped 5% Darden Restaurants ' Olive Garden 4% and Inspire Brands' Buffalo Wild Wings 3%.",,,,,,,,,,,,

Neil Dahlstrom oversees the vast archives that have been amassed during the company's 185 years. In that position Dahlstrom has a unique opportunity to reveal the rich history of one of the nation's older companies and its impact on agriculture.

Dahlstrom recently released a book offering a compelling historical look at a crucial time not only in John Deere's history but also in the development of the tractor. Tractor Wars: John Deere Henry Ford International Harvester and the Birth of Modern Agriculture reveals the dynamic interactions that took place among these companies providing an insider's view of a story that weaves together characters plots and secret plans.

You can order Tractor Wars for $17.95 from amazon.com.

SF: Describe Tractor Wars in a nutshell.

ND: Tractor Wars is an origins story a behind-the-scenes view into the people machines companies strategies and decisions that introduced power farming in the early 20th century and ushered in a new era of agriculture.

SF: Did serving as chief archivist at Deere & Co. give you a unique perspective to write the book?

ND: Certainly. I've had the chance to research many primary records over the years that I don't think I would have uncovered elsewhere. Archives can be difficult to navigate and it requires patience to work through records and follow leads. Working in the archives allowed me to go back and check something without having to make an appointment several months in advance like I had to do elsewhere. Research is iterative and sometimes you learn something new that requires you to go back into something you've already reviewed so that was a great luxury.

SF: Was there one particular incident that you reported in the book that most surprised you?

ND: This is difficult because there are so many incredible stories but one that stood out to me was a conversation between Henry Ford and Deere engineer Theo Brown. The two sat on a railroad track and talked as if they were old friends. Each was frustrated at their partnership but saw no way forward. Ford asked for a relic from John Deere and Brown tried to work up the courage to ask for an autographed copy of Ford's autobiography. Nothing important came of the discussion but it personalized the era for me and reminded me that decisions and machines are made by people who are all trying to do what they believe to be right. It's my favorite scene in the book.

SF: There appears to be a great deal of drama during this period of the development of the tractor. Was this one of the crucial make-or-break times in John Deere's history?

ND: Definitely! Deere was one of many companies trying to get the tractor question right. A good comparison is the Emerson-Brantingham Co. which acquired the Gas Traction Co. and its Big Four 30 a large prairie tractor. Deere focused instead on the emerging market for smaller tractors and then decided to stay with the two-cylinder engine while others were moving to four cylinders. Two decisions with two very different outcomes.

SF: Is there a particular item in the John Deere archives that most fascinates you?

ND: There's so many that it's hard to choose. But a recent acquisition is very interesting. Its a pair of horse rosettes featuring the Waterloo Boy tractor. It's fascinating that a horse bridle was used to advertise a tractor which was developed to replace the horse!

SF: What is your next book project?

ND: Right now I don't have a specific project in mind. Tractor Wars ends just before the Great Depression and that's an era that I find fascinating so I may continue the story. But I'm always looking for great stories so we'll see what develops.

SF: Have you ever sat at John Deere's desk?

ND: Sadly no. John Deere's desk does not exist (to my knowledge at least). But our collection does include his night table an Eastlake-style table with a marble top. It's as close as I may get.

So on Friday and Saturday July 15-16 county officials company executives committed customers and longtime employees gathered at MTS’s newest location on Billingsley Drive to celebrate the grand opening of the business’s fourth location with an official ribbon-cutting sponsored by the Buckhannon-Upshur Chamber of Commerce.

Buckhannon’s new MTS location which offers compact tractors tractors for farmers landscapers gators side-by-sides compact construction equipment used equipment and a parts and service department as well as tools and equipment for lawn and garden tractors celebrated two years in that location as well as the Middletown Tractor Sales’s 70th anniversary.

As their slogan goes enough people had made Middletown Tractor “their main factor” by visiting the certified John Deere dealer to bolster the local family business through the trying times brought on by the COVID pandemic.

At Friday’s ribbon cutting and grand opening ceremony MTS president Adam Boyers said he was grateful to be standing at the podium welcoming everyone to MTS’s grand opening.

“As the saying goes it has not been easy sailing the past couple of years but we’ve managed to navigate the treacherous waters and we’re super excited to be here today” Adam Boyers said. He told the story of how his grandparents Dallas and Elaine Boyers had started a small ‘feed-and-seed’ farm supply store in Mannington W.Va. in 1952 and they had “on the side done some John Deere sales.”

“Over the years as the seed and feed fell to the wayside the lawn tractors and the farm tractors became more and more of the business” he said. “My father got involved and spent most of his life in it; I spent most of my life in it and we’ve grown to four locations in two states and are just super proud of the brand that is Middletown Tractor Sales.”

Adam Boyers recounted how Upshur County Commission president Kristie Tenney had reached out to him when MTS was searching for land for a fourth location in 2019 and the plot he saw at 136 Billingsley Dr. in Buckhannon and Upshur County seemed like an ideal place to grow the business.

“It was a great location the building was the right size it’s got enough land for us to do what we needed to do” Boyers said. “Tom Shaw the former owner was a great guy to work with and so we were able to make a deal.”

“We began making renovations inside they were going well they were on time we wanted to get open before our busy season and on a Wednesday in February – February 12 2020 – we opened the doors to the business” Boyers recounted. “Everything was going great and then about 30 days later the world kind of shut down and COVID and the pandemic put everyone into havoc.”

“The havoc has maintained over the past couple of years but we are super excited to be able to be here today” Adam Boyers added. “It’s not ideal to have a grand opening a couple of years after you open your doors but that’s the hand we were dealt and because of the community support that we’ve had here in Buckhannon we were able to still be here in business today to celebrate this day. I’m excited to be here to open this facility today to open this facility in the great City of Buckhannon in the great county of Upshur in the great State of West Virginia so I really appreciate everyone coming out today and recognizing us.”

Adam Boyers thanked his employees and Buckhannon store manager John Gladwell for showing up every day and “putting their best foot forward” regardless of the particular pandemic restrictions they were facing.

Jim Boyers Adam’s father said he was proud to have grown the business into one that serves four locations in two states – Buckhannon and Fairmont in West Virginia and Uniontown and Washington in Pennsylvania.

“It’s hard to maintain a business that many years now through plague … pandemics through financial problems through employees through inventory” Jim Boyers remarked at the July 15 ribbon cutting. “It’s really hard to maintain but we’ve done it and we continue to grow and we hope to maintain that. I’m very very proud of what’s going on as a family as a West Virginian and I hope Upshur County and the local counties realize it and help support it.”

Jim Boyers reiterated Adam’s thanks to MTS many dedicated employees whom he called “huge assets.”

Upshur County Commission president Kristie Tenney and commission Sam Nolte were on hand to thank the business for its investment in Upshur County.

“I was really hoping COVID wouldn’t derail your plans” Nolte said. “I hear it all over the community that everybody is super happy to have you here. We appreciate you and we thank you for making this investment.”

Regional representative for Governor Jim Justice Lynn Phillips offered a few words on the governor’s behalf saying that MTS meets the needs of every outdoor equipment necessity “whether you are homeowner farmer or landscaper they have the equipment that will tackle any workload.”

Additionally representatives from the offices of U.S. Senator Joe Manchin D-WV and Rep. Alex Mooney R-2 intimated that the Mountain State was lucky to have family-owned businesses like Middletown Tractor Sales doing business in and throughout north and south central W.Va.

“I thank all three generations of Boyers who have steered this family-owned business with great success their employees and everyone else responsible for making today’s ribbon cutting a reality” Manchin’s representative Michael Garcia said reading a letter on the senator’s behalf. “Truly West Virginia is fortunate to have local businesses like Middletown who have exceptional workforces of this caliber …. I worked in a small business all my life and I can attest that there is no more challenging or rewarding endeavor.”

Rhett Dusenbury district representative for Mooney also offered the congressman’s well wishes to MTS and presented the Boyers family with a Certificate of Special Congressional Recognition.

“The history of your company is a wonderful story of a family-owned business and how through hard work you can achieve the American dream” Dusenbury read on behalf of Mooney’s office. “[Middletown Tractors Sales] has provided the citizens of Upshur County with an option for farm and lawn equipment at competitive prices” as well as “much needed local jobs. This notable achievement demonstrates your dedication to excellence and your commitment to quality.”

Thanks to the generosity of local residents Jake Livingston has a new ride.

Jake who is autistic is an iconic member of the Century community selling snacks from his trademark “Hazzard County Snacks” John Deere Gator. He is a local fixture at home games as “Northview’s Biggest Fan” and always Northwest Escambia Chiefs Football. He also raises money for autism awareness and even had a little library named after him.

Everybody around Century and pretty much every Northview High School student or fan ever just loves Jake. And he loves them back. He does not know a stranger.

Jake’s previous Gator — his only form of transportation — was old and worn out and repairs were becoming frequent and harder to complete.

And then several people stepped up to raise the funds needed to buy Jake a brand new John Deere Gator.

“My brand new ride” Jake exclaimed Saturday afternoon as his new Gator was delivered.

Community members raised a total of $7788 for the new vehicle through a GoFundMe page auctions and other efforts. And the fine folks at Smith Tractor Company sold the Gator to the group at cost and tossed in some no-cost extras.

“We got me a new ride here. It’s going to be all over NorthEscambia” Jake said when he hopped in the driver’s seat of his new ride happy that NorthEscambia.com was there in Hazzard County on his very special day.

Hazzard County you say? That’s another story and a big part of Jake.

The sign outside Jake’s residence in Century reads “Welcome to Hazzard County Home of J.D. ‘Boss’ Hogg Sheriff Jake”. Jake loves the character “Boss Hogg” on that classic television series and operates a little side hustle he calls “Hazzard County Snacks”.

If you see Jake in his Gator around Century he’ll happily sell you a snack to help pay for his living expenses. But he’s been known on more than one occasion to just give away snacks to kids that can’t afford them. That’s just the kind of guy he is always willing to help or offer a word of prayer.

Jake who is now in his middle 40s had always lived with relatives until a change in life circumstances pretty much left his homeless just over a decade ago. The community stepped up then too. A neighbor found him an old FEMA trailer and helped him set it up. Area residents helped pay for the trailer and other necessities. A state-assigned caregiver helped teach him independent living skills.

“Look at this brand new thing…let me go get my hat” Jake said Saturday afternoon before riding off for a late afternoon lunch of Mexican food at a local business. “We are going now!”

She was not scared. To her family this will forever be known as Karen’s Independence Day. Her life began in Hempstead New York on January 14 1944 the middle daughter (Leslie Blatz now of Tarrytown New York older and Jane Lawlis now of Burlington Vermont younger) of William M. Dickenson and Katherine Nichols Dickenson. While she was an honor student at Hempstead High School Class of ‘61 she was particularly fond of playing hooky at Jones Beach and paying a quarter to get into baseball games at Ebbets Field with her grandmother. She finished her Math Degree at Bucknell University in 3 years and later used it to become the longtime bookkeeper at the Carmel Racquet Club and then to advance from teller to Vice President at American National Bank (Society and Key) as well as in her competitive card games with family and friends in College Meadows and Cool Creek North. But her first priority was always family. She was in her 60th year of marriage to Edward Barry Smalstig originally of Beaver Pennsylvania & now caretaker of her beloved Acorn Acres in Carmel and mother to Edward Scott Smalstig (born in Lawton Oklahoma Fort Sill and currently of Yorktown Indiana wife Tara McDowell Smalstig) and Eric David Smalstig (born in Indianapolis Indiana and currently of Tustin California wife Merija Jansons Smalstig). A perfect “boy mom” Karen not only shuffled the boys to football basketball soccer and baseball practices but played catch with them until the boys’ arms were sore and her hand was swollen. Between yelling “Watch that ball…and smack it” at each of her boys’ at bats she kept score of every one of their baseball games. She was a good athlete herself completing several Indy Mini-Marathons not to mention beating her sons in several sports (tennis bowling a round of h-o-r-s-e). Earlier years found her waterskiing at Lake George in upstate New York and golfing at Sycamore Springs and Woodland Golf Club in Carmel. She didn’t think she was much of a cook but people who had her chicken cacciatore baked clams fresh lobster lamb with mint jelly meatloaf three bean salad homemade sourdough bread homemade grape jelly fried zucchini pumpkin bread homemade ice cream or Christmas egg casserole would disagree as would Barry’s well-earned belly. Karen lived for Christmas and shopped year-round for the perfect gifts most often from a mountain of catalogs that the mail man delivered daily. Back surgeries limited her mobility to a Zoomer chair in her later years but not before her Acorn Acres had the most manicured flower beds and perfectly cut lawn. The only man she loved as much as Barry was John Deere. When her wheelchair claimed most of her days she used those days to assemble family frames and albums of trips to favorite spots like the California coast Vermont Pennsylvania the Outer Banks of North Carolina Hawaii Bermuda St. Thomas and Costa Rica not to mention the myriad of camping and canoeing trips in Indiana state parks. And there was not a puzzle made that she couldn’t conquer. Her most relished role was as Tutu (grandma) which she anointed herself so she could have as cool a name as Pop Pop. Madison Gehrig Markus and Athena loved their Tutu-time because it always involved puzzles games puttering around the property and making up new recipes. She relished her time at all of their activities. Tutu-time also involved grilling though not the cooking kind so you had better be ready with thoughtful answers to her questions. And she left this world her way family and friends at her bedside delivering loving and directive last words. Heaven help St. Peter - I hope he has the right answers and a good arm. Tutu will test both. Karen would love your flowers but instead please consider making a gift to one of the following charities that she supported: • Ronald McDonald House (supporting family members with intense medical needs like her autistic grandson Markus whom she saw in the lyrics of the song Beautiful Boy by Celine Dion) • Parkinson’s Foundation (supporting those like her brother-in-law and family affected by this condition) • Habitat for Humanity (supporting folks who need a helping hand) A celebration of life is planned for the afternoon of August 13th at a location to be announced via Facebook and the Leppert Mortuaries website (www.leppertmortuary.com). The Smalstig family is grateful for the phenomenal care provided Karen in her final days by the ER ICU and Hospice staff at IU North in Carmel.

If so you're in luck as Delta allows these three types of animals to fly with you in-cabin for a small fee.

But before you go ahead and book your flight you'll want to be extremely aware of the Delta pet policy. There are some confusing rules and Delta doesn't allow a pet to fly with you on board on all routes aircraft and seats. Having all the information in advance will ensure that your pet can join you on your travels.

Here's everything you need to know about the Delta Air Lines pet policy.

Delta Air Lines pet policy

With the Delta pet policy you can bring small dogs cats and household birds with you in-cabin to select destinations. All pets must fit into a pet carrier and be at least 10 weeks old for domestic travel at least 16 weeks old if traveling to the U.S. from another country and at least 15 weeks old when traveling to the EU.

Passengers are only allowed to bring one pet carrier on board but in some cases multiple pets are allowed per carrier. For example one female cat or dog can travel with her un-weaned litter (with no cap) if the kittens or puppies are between 10 weeks to six months of age. Additionally if you have two pets of the same breed and size between the ages of 10 weeks and six months those pets are allowed in one pet carrier as long as they fit. In these situations Delta will only charge you for one pet.

Delta also limits where you can sit if you bring a pet. Per the Delta pet policy you'll need to avoid selecting seats at the bulkhead and in emergency exit rows. Likewise avoid seats designated as ""no stowage"" which are rows 30 to 35 on the A330-200 aircraft rows 30 to 43 on the A330-300 aircraft and center seats on the B757-200 aircraft. Also know that carry-on pets are not allowed in any cabin with flat-bed seats international business class international Delta One or Delta Premium Select.

There are also additional restrictions when flying with a pet on Delta outside the U.S.:

You can only bring household birds on domestic U.S. flights (excluding Hawaii U.S. Virgin Islands Puerto Rico and Guam).

You can't bring pets to Hawaii the United Kingdom and Ireland.

You can't travel to or from Hong Kong South Africa Australia and New Zealand with pets.

The CDC currently bans dogs from entering the U.S. from high-risk countries for rabies such as Egypt.

Since country rules can change at any time make sure to review Delta's international pet travel restrictions.

Additionally at the onset of the pandemic the Delta pet cargo option was put on hold and has yet to come back. Per the Delta dog policy your dog must fit in an approved pet carrier tha can fit under the seat in front of you — so larger dogs usually can't travel with you on Delta.

Flying with a pet on Delta

Delta Air Lines recently decreased the cost of bringing a pet on board with you. For tickets purchased on or after Feb. 28 2022 the cost of flying with a pet on Delta is $95 for flights within the U.S. Canada Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands. For previously purchased flights the cost is $125.

However if you're flying internationally the cost is slightly different. For all international flights — except to or from Brazil — the price is significantly more expensive at $200. However flying with a pet on Delta to or from Brazil is only $75.

All fees are one-way and are collected when checking in for your flight at the airport.

The Delta Air Lines pet policy limited the number of pets on board and within each cabin. So you'll want to contact Delta as early as possible if you plan to bring a pet.

Finally if one of Delta's partners operates your flight you'll need to call the partner airline directly to learn more about its pet policies.

Delta Air Lines' pet carrier requirements

(Photo by vasiliki/Getty Images)

All pets on a Delta flight must fit into a pet carrier or kennel and that carrier or kennel must fit under the seat in front of you.

The pet carrier can be soft-sided or hard-sided but it must be leak-proof and ventilated (three side ventilation openings or four sides for international travel). The pet also must be able to move around and not protrude from the sides. All pets must stay in their carrier while in the boarding area on the aircraft and in Delta lounges.

Delta recommends a soft-sized kennel with a maximum size of 18 inches by 11 inches by 11 inches. But some seats may feature more under seat storage and fit a larger kennel. The agent will record your kennel dimensions when you contact Delta to add your pet to your reservation.

When flying with a pet on Delta remember that your pet carrier will count as one of your carry-on items. So in addition to your carrier you can also bring one personal item on board.

Bottom line

As long as you do your research regarding the aircraft and cabin you book bringing a small dog cat or bird with you on your next Delta flight is incredibly easy. While you can't bring larger dogs with you right now Delta may resume the Delta pet cargo program in the future.

Make sure to review all of the rules before booking your flight. By doing so and paying a modest fee you might be able to enjoy your next trip with your small dog cat or household bird.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiR2h0dHBzOi8vc2ltcGxlZmx5aW5nLmNvbS9kZWx0YS1pbmF1Z3VyYXRlLW5ldy15b3JrLWJlcmxpbi1mbGlnaHRzLTIwMjMv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Delta To Start New York - Berlin Flights In May 2023,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with ('Connection aborted.', RemoteDisconnected('Remote end closed connection without response')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiR2h0dHBzOi8vc2ltcGxlZmx5aW5nLmNvbS9kZWx0YS1pbmF1Z3VyYXRlLW5ldy15b3JrLWJlcmxpbi1mbGlnaHRzLTIwMjMv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMieGh0dHBzOi8vcGVvcGxlLmNvbS90cmF2ZWwvZGVsdGEtZmxpZ2h0LWZyb20tbG9uZG9uLWNhcnJpZXMtemVyby1wYXNzZW5nZXJzLWJ1dC1kZWxpdmVycy0xMDAwLXBpZWNlcy1vZi1zdHJhbmRlZC1sdWdnYWdlL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Delta Sends 1000 Suitcases On A Passenger-Free Flight To Detroit,"A Delta flight brought 1000 bags stateside this week.

London-Heathrow Airport has been struggling to keep up with the demands of summer travel due to staffing shortages and an increase in tourists coming through the travel hub. This week Heathrow announced they would be limiting capacities in their facility and asked airlines to cancel flights.

Delta in compliance with the cancellation request had the opportunity to work on ""a creative solution"" to move the delayed luggage and sent the luggage-only flight to Detroit where they ""forwarded the bags on.""

Travelers who were booked on the canceled flight were rebooked. In a statement to PEOPLE a representative from Delta said it was an ""operational decision made as the opportunity presented itself and to accelerate movement of delayed bags.""

The price of travel has not seemed to stop any would-be jetsetters from enjoying their vacation time this year. As reported by AAA the average lowest airfare is 6% more than last year and gas prices are still high. Nonetheless ""have time off will travel"" appears to be the motto for many.

The resulting high volumes of travelers have meant that Europe at large has been bogged down by the volume of travelers as reported by The New York Times.

All of which make for one of the most chaotic travel seasons in recent memory.

It’s so bad that Delta Air Lines sent an empty plane to one of the world’s biggest hubs London Heathrow just to fly over 1000 lost pieces of luggage back to the U.S.

This Wednesday Delta became the first airline to release quarterly earnings shedding a light on the situation. It revealed some issues bubbling under the surface.

The company is experiencing a “training and experience bubble” CEO Ed Bastian said in the company’s quarterly earnings call on Wednesday.

Nowhere is this clearer than the gap between staffing and air travel capacity: Bastian reported that Delta had recovered to 95% of the staffing level from 2019 pre-pandemic levels but the airline was only operating at 82% of air travel capacity. In other words a nearly fully staffed Delta is operating close to 20% below its peak level. To understand why you have to go back to the brief pandemic recession of 2020 when Delta was one of several airlines to lay off staff—and accept government bailout money.

2022’s summer travel chaos has roots in 2020

The lower air-travel capacity is intentional on Delta’s part Bastian explained.

“By ensuring capacity does not outstrip our resources and working through our training pipeline we’ll continue to further improve our operational integrity” Bastian said on the earnings call.

The airline said it had increased staff numbers at airports and in its reservations department but still had to complete its hiring in pilots flight attendants and mechanics. This means that while the company may have been equipped to deal with the increased demand in air travel from a ticketing perspective it is still ramping up with regards to its actual flights.

On the same earnings call Bastian said the company has about 1500 new pilots in training and more “waiting to be trained.” He specified that this number was “larger than we would normally carry.”

When asked about the financial and operational implications of the training backlog Bastian said it was part of the company’s planned rollout to return to its 2019 flight schedule.

“The good news is that we’ve got all our folks” Bastian said. “So we’re at peak with respect to ‘training’ and I wouldn’t call it inefficiency but the cost of efficiency. Every month that goes by it’s going to get better.”

In June 2020 a little over two years ago 2000 Delta pilots opted to take early retirement as the airline sought to reduce headcount in the earliest days of the pandemic when the number of global flights plummeted roughly 80%. In April 2020 Delta had received $5.4 billion including a $1.6 billion loan from a taxpayer-funded airline bailout.

As spending and travel resumed at first slowly in 2021 and then dramatically in 2022 Delta has still dealt with the fallout of a pandemic-era labor shortage so even as companies staff back up to 2019 levels it’s just not so easy for its new staff to perform at that level.

Much of the training backlog is intentional according to Bastian because overall airline industry capacity still hasn’t returned to 2019 levels—his estimate is it’s currently between 90% to 95%—and he foresees continued pent-up demand for air travel as consumers become comfortable flying.

“It’s not just people that haven’t traveled” Bastian said. “It’s volumes of trips that we anticipate people will take looking forward as they start to catch up on all the experience and all the opportunities that they lost.”

The discrepancy between flight numbers—82%—and newly filled positions—95%—is part of Bastian’s strategic plan to run what he referred to as a “quality operation” to meet the full demand which Delta estimates will return in the summer of 2023.

“We’re going to have the capacity to grow when we’re ready but we want to make sure we’re focused on serving what we have” Bastian said. “…You run a better airline everything runs better and the efficiencies start to materialize.”

In the meantime the “training and experience bubble” will take some time to sort out.

A Delta plane with just lost luggage was flown from London to Detroit last week and no they didn’t fly first class.

Airlines have been working through cancellations delays and lost luggage issues for several weeks especially through the summer holiday seasons.

“Delta teams worked a creative solution to move delayed checked bags from London-Heathrow on July 11 after a regularly scheduled flight had to be canceled given airport passenger volume restrictions at Heathrow” Delta said in a statement to Local 4.

“Delta flight 9888 from Heathrow to Delta’s Detroit hub flew 1000 bags back to the U.S. where teams then forwarded the bags on to our customers.”

The bags flew in the designated area for baggage not in first class. That would have been a sight to see.

Delta said the aircraft would have had to fly back to Detroit anyway so the bags were added on to what would’ve been a “repositioning” flight.

The bags that arrived in Detroit were then forwarded onto other flights from Detroit Metro Airport to get to where they needed to go. So now you’re competing with fellow travelers -- and bags -- for bookings."

When you mention Hong Kong what’s the first thing that pops into your head? Bruce Lee? The city’s famous food scene? There’s one other blooming flower that attracts students from all around the world: the world-class tertiary education in Hong Kong.

The city’s political situation has dominated headlines lately but as the dust begins to settle prospective international students shouldn’t discount this bustling financial hub as a potential study abroad destination.

Hong Kong is home to many of the world’s top universities three of which – University of Hong Kong Chinese University of Hong Kong and Hong Kong University of Science and Technology – made it to the top 10 of the Times Higher Education Asian University Rankings 2022.

How much does it really cost to study abroad?

But the indispensable thing that makes any place stand out is the work-related opportunities it provides. Fortunately Hong Kong comes with lots of them. According to Study in Hong Kong a site operated by the Education Bureau that encourages students to pursue their studies in the city there are plenty of opportunities for international students to find internships as well as part-time work options on campus to support themselves.

International students can also appreciate the city’s fusion of cultures. Hong Kong is a unique city which blends both Eastern and Western cultures. But there’s more to this than meets the eye; people from many different nationalities and religions live in the city. In fact diversity is a key part of Hong Kong’s identity.

Finally who isn’t aware of the excellent public transport in Hong Kong? Options range from ferries to the metro system (MTR). Hong Kong’s MTR has been called the world’s cleanest and its railway system covers most of the city. All these transport options can be used with a convenient payment method in the form of the Octopus Card.

In just a short period of time you can go from densely packed streets to the seaside and beautiful hiking trails. What better way is there to escape the concrete jungle and take a break?

With so many communities calling the city home its fantastic public transport and its internship and job options for students Hong Kong is an excellent study abroad option.

5 ways to deal with homesickness while abroad

As an international city and Asia’s financial hub Hong Kong seems like the ideal study abroad destination. Looks are deceiving however and I daresay the city is not a good place for foreign students.

Firstly foreign students may find it difficult to adapt to Hong Kong’s study and work style. Most Hong Kong students communicate with each other using Cantonese at school and foreign students may find it hard to adapt to school life and struggle with daily communication due to language barriers and cultural differences and they would end up feeling lonely.

Language barriers may frustrate international students. Photo: Shutterstock

Secondly Hong Kong’s education system fails to inspire students to be inquisitive learners. Hong Kong has an exam-focused culture forcing students to become test-taking robots. This leads to a competitive learning environment which may negatively impact students’ mental health. Hong Kong study culture is definitely too tough for foreign students – and local ones as well.

What’s more although Hong Kong is an international city its global exposure in many fields remains restricted. Hong Kong is famous for its financial and medical industries so foreign students interested in these fields will benefit if they study here. However if someone is more interested in technology or the arts they may not find the experience as useful and may feel like they have wasted their time.

Things you should leave at home when you head to university

Employment and career opportunities are crucial factors foreign students need to keep in mind when deciding if they should study in Hong Kong. They may struggle to find internships and if they stay long-term employment due to language barriers. This could prevent them from gaining experience in their chosen field.

And finally Hong Kong has a high cost of living and foreign students would likely have to pay for expensive accommodation in one of the city’s notoriously small flats. Many students simply don’t have the money for this.

Katie Ann Taylor 39 who lists a Matthews Drive address was taken into custody shortly before 3 a.m. and charged with theft of property over $5000 and possession of a controlled substance meth each punishable by up to 10 years in prison and possession of drug paraphernalia punishable by up to six years.

Taylor who lists no prior felony history was being held on $9500 bond and is set to appear on Aug. 4 in Garland County District Court although she will likely be arraigned sooner if unable to post bond.

According to the probable cause affidavit on the theft the manager 36 of Dollar General 717 Carpenter Dam Road told Hot Springs police an ex-employee identified as Taylor had not made daily store deposits from Jan. 8 to Jan. 13 a total of six missing deposits for a total of $9847.05.

The manager noted Taylor could be seen on security video taking the money from the store safe and leaving the store.

According to the bank deposit log Taylor was allegedly using other store employees' names when taking the cash out of the safe. The manager noted Taylor ""stopped showing up for work"" after Jan. 13.

HSPD Detective Shawn Woodall reviewed the security video and was reportedly able to identify Taylor as the suspect by matching her image to her driver's license photo and social media photos from Facebook and TikTok. He later issued a warrant for her arrest on the theft charge.

Around 2:45 a.m. Friday Officer Chris Gibson was patrolling in the 3600 block of Central Avenue when he spotted Taylor sitting in a 2005 Cadillac Deville in the parking lot of Walgreen's 3631 Central and recognized her as having a warrant.

He made contact with her and took her into custody on the warrant and then conducted an inventory of her vehicle prior to towing. In searching the car officers allegedly located a small blue bag inside a pink purse in the front seat that contained a baggie with 2.0 grams of what later tested positive for meth.

Officers also reportedly found a set of digital scales with meth residue on the center console. When asked Taylor reportedly admitted the pink purse belonged to her so she was charged with the additional felony counts.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMidGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZveDE3b25saW5lLmNvbS9uZXdzL2xvY2FsLW5ld3MvcG9saWNlLWludmVzdGlnYXRpbmctYXJtZWQtcm9iYmVyeS1hdC1kb2xsYXItZ2VuZXJhbC1pbi1vcm9ub2tvLXRvd25zaGlw0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Police investigating attempted robbery at Dollar General in Oronoko Township,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='news.google.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /articles/CBMidGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZveDE3b25saW5lLmNvbS9uZXdzL2xvY2FsLW5ld3MvcG9saWNlLWludmVzdGlnYXRpbmctYXJtZWQtcm9iYmVyeS1hdC1kb2xsYXItZ2VuZXJhbC1pbi1vcm9ub2tvLXRvd25zaGlw0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen (Caused by NewConnectionError('<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x0000021859A94850>: Failed to establish a new connection: [WinError 10051] A socket operation was attempted to an unreachable network')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMidGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZveDE3b25saW5lLmNvbS9uZXdzL2xvY2FsLW5ld3MvcG9saWNlLWludmVzdGlnYXRpbmctYXJtZWQtcm9iYmVyeS1hdC1kb2xsYXItZ2VuZXJhbC1pbi1vcm9ub2tvLXRvd25zaGlw0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiP2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZXN0YXRlLmNvbS9uZXdzL2xvY2FsL2NyaW1lL2FydGljbGUyNjM1NDEyMTguaHRtbNIBP2h0dHBzOi8vYW1wLnRoZXN0YXRlLmNvbS9uZXdzL2xvY2FsL2NyaW1lL2FydGljbGUyNjM1NDEyMTguaHRtbA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Workers at Midlands Dollar General strike over allegations of robberies wage theft,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='www.thestate.com', port=443): Read timed out.

Customers often believe they are getting a steal at the budget shop but may be actually paying more than they should.

Shoppers at the renowned retailer have been warned to be wary of what they pick up while whizzing down the aisles.

As although you may think you have saved some cash you could be forking out more for your favorite brands.

That's because certain labels are not as well priced as you may think.

Michael Bonebright former senior editor at DealNews.com has revealed grocery stores usually have better deals than the likes of Dollar Tree.

He explained: ""Dollar stores typically offer brand-name items but in smaller quantities than you’d see at the grocery store.

""This means you can end up overpaying per ounce or per count.

""For example Dollar General offers a 22-ounce bottle of Lysol All Purpose Cleaner for $2 but Walmart has a 32-ounce bottle of the same product for just a few cents more.""

So to get more for your money it's best to check out the labels and size of the item to ensure you secure the best deal.

We previously told how a shopping superfan revealed the 10 items you should avoid picking up at Dollar Tree.

Sarah who goes by sensationalfinds on TikTok recently posted a video about what Dollar Tree items to buy and which ones to bypass.

She told other discount fans to avoid shampoo flip flops batteries and trash bags and instead suggested money-saving alternatives.

Unique attractive pieces often come at a high price.

3 A budgeting pro and DIY lover created a statement mirror out of Dollar Tree buys

3 He used painter's tape to plot out his design

One man named Rob Rivera who goes by @onthecheaptip on TikTok has become known for his affordable design hacks DIYs and Dollar Tree finds.

He recently revealed how he built a trendy chic wall mirror without spending much at all.

“This wall in my apartment needed a little spicing up” he said pointing to a dull wall with a single mirror.

Rob headed to his local Dollar Tree for inspiration.

“I found these round black framed mirrors and thought ‘Let’s make a floor to ceiling mirror feature wall.’”

The Dollar Tree super fan grabbed all the mirrors from the store shelf which each cost $1.25 and started planning his design.

“I started by placing command strips on the back of every mirror.

“Then I put painter’s tape in an L shape on the wall just to give myself a guide and make sure that everything is even.”

He began with the bottom row lining up each mirror against the edge of the tape so that it was in a straight line.

“Once you get that first row going it goes by pretty fast. It’s like laying bricks.”

He continued taping the mirrors up the wall ensuring that each one was touching the other.

The final result looked even better than his inspiration photo.

“It’s sophisticated cheap and definitely does not look like it came from the Dollar Tree.”

The clip received over one million views and thousands of praising comments.

“That looks fantastic!!! Love it!! The painter’s tape was genius” one viewer wrote.

“I love it. I think I would spray paint the frames champagne gold” added another.

Nyack Apartment Complex Sells For $4.1 Million

A 19-unit market rate multi-family apartment rental complex in Nyack at 26-28 Upper Depew Ave. has sold for $4.1 million. The cost per unit was $216000 for the 16350 square foot property; the cap rate was 4.4 percent. Brokers on the sale were Michael Scrima and Thomas Gorman Jr. from Redwood Realty. The complex built in 1975 was sold by the Frankel family the original developers to the Rabbani Group both of Bergen County NJ.

“There is strong demand for quality rentals” said Scrima. “The rents on these large apartments are probably 30 percent to 40 percent below market value.”

Scrima said the new owners plan to gradually renovate the apartments but not spike rental rates.

“As people move out they will renovate and up the rentals” he added. “The buyers have bought this as a long-term family asset. They plan to turn the units into Class A apartments over time.”

Scrima and other brokers agree multifamily properties move lightening fast with negotiations favoring sellers due to tight inventory and high demand. “It’s a seller’s market” said Scrima. “Sellers are demanding fast due diligence periods and no mortgage contingencies. Buyers may have 60 days to get a mortgage but they don’t have the luxury for contingencies. They have to do their due diligence up front and line up financing.”"

According to WRIC.com the proposed site would accommodate approximately 7500 people with the ability to expand the capacity to more than 10000 people for major shows and events. The projected shows per year would equal 25 to 30.

Richmond currently boasts many venues for indoor performances (The Camel The National Richmond Music Hall Dominion Energy Center) and the city is looking to fill a gap with an outdoor venue as top musicians tend to visit Charlottesville or Northern VA venues instead.

Coran Capshaw a name synonymous with the Charlottesville VA area and the founder of Red Light Ventures (alongside NewMarket) is leading the effort to bring the outdoor amphitheater to the Richmond area. Capshaw is also the head of Starr Hill Presents the promo wing of Red Light Management and according to the PR manages artists such as the Dave Matthews Band Chris Stapleton Luke Bryan Phish Brandi Carlile and others.

The current plan stated in the release said that the venue will highlight the location’s historic features by using the brick Company Store building as the box office and preserving stonework along the canal. The design firm serving as architect for the project 3North has a history of historical restoration and preservation in the Richmond area.

“Not only is it on the riverfront but it has some of the most dramatic views of the city skyline” said 3North Managing Principal Jay Hugo. “We really want to capitalize on that and knit it into its setting.”

The PR states that easy access will make the amphitheater ideal for hosting a multitude of events in addition to live concerts. The Richmond Amphitheater could also host community-based activities and offer to be the primary stage for popular annual festivals such as The Richmond Folk Festival.",,,,,,,,,,,,

National pizza chains have never been shy about jumping on trends. There's the polarizing ""Hawaiian"" pizza which started a widespread and pineapple-filled craze after a Canadian restauranteur invented it in 1962 (via Atlas Obscura). And who could forget the rise of stuffed crusts in the late 1980s or the 30-minute delivery guarantee that Ranker says Dominos popularized in 1979? Now it seems the newest pizza fad could be catering to diners who are looking to avoid gluten.

There are several ways to make a pizza without gluten. Examples like MOD Pizza's cauliflower crust show us that pizza crust doesn't necessarily even need to be made with flour at all! But a cauliflower crust isn't the only way to slice that pie. Dominos' offering lists rice flour among its crust's primary ingredients. Dominos does note however that its pizza is merely gluten-friendly not absolutely gluten-free.

What's the difference? As Epicuren explains gluten-free foods come from kitchens that are completely devoid of any glutenous ingredients. That way there's zero chance of contamination. Gluten-friendly products on the other hand are prepared in the same kitchens as gluten-containing foods so the people making the products cannot guarantee the foods won't have trace amounts of gluten.

For people who seriously need to avoid all gluten like those with Celiac disease gluten-free is a must. But if you're one of those people who can tolerate gluten-friendly choices you now have a new pizza option that could be right in your neighborhood.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMicmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lmluc2lkZWVkaXRpb24uY29tL21lZGlhL3ZpZGVvcy9kb21pbm9zLXBpenphLWRlbGl2ZXJ5LW1hbi1yZXNjdWVzLWluZGlhbmEtZmFtaWx5LWZyb20taG91c2UtZmlyZS03NTk0NtIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Domino's Pizza Delivery Man Rescues Indiana Family From House Fire,An Indiana Domino’s pizza delivery man is being regarded as a hero after saving a family's life.

Border Force staff at Dover's now-closed Tug Haven holding centre used government credit cards to pay for the food over just five months last year.

On one occasion last July the Home Office's Clandestine Operational Response Team bought 200 in one go putting the pizza boxes into a van and taking them to migrants.

Images at Tug Haven centre were taken last November. According to reports officials would buy 3900 of the chain's £9.99 medium pizzas

Officials spent more than £38000 in taxpayers' cash at a Domino's branch buying pizza for migrants. Piles of pizza boxes and some uneaten leftovers were left strewn outside the centre in images taken in November 2021.

Staff at the Domino's branch said they were 'rushed off their feet' each time migrants arrived according to The Sun.

According to reports officials would buy 3900 of the chain's £9.99 medium pizzas with various toppings including popular choices such as Texas BBQ or the Veggie Supreme.

Purchases ground to a halt in December last year when a catering firm took over according to The Sun.

Last year around 28526 people crossed the Channel in small boats. This year alone more than 14000 have made the dangerous journey so far.

Government figures confirmed that 173 migrants arrived in four small boats on Thursday and the MOD said 119 migrants in three boats were detected yesterday.

The total number of arrivals so far this year now exceeds 14330.

Border Force officers also intercepted 442 migrants from 15 incidents on Monday - the highest number for nearly a month despite a Europe-wide crackdown on people smugglers and warnings migrants could be re-homed in Rwanda in central Africa.

The new crossings come after Irish premier Micheal Martin warned the UK Government's plan to send migrants to Rwanda may have resulted in an increase in international protection applicants in the Republic.

On one occasion last July the Home Office's Clandestine Operational Response Team bought 200 in one go after stashing the pizza boxes into a van and taking them to migrants. Pictured migrants being brought ashore to Kent by the Dover lifeboat

The Government has reportedly put fresh attempts to get the first deportation flight to the East African nation off the ground on hold until after the Conservative Party has elected a new prime minister over fears it could generate too much controversy during the leadership contest. The plane was grounded in June amid legal challenges.

Alp Mehmet Chairman of MigrationWatch UK an organisation which represents the immigration concerns of British people told The Sun: 'The fact that the Border Force is having to resort to fast-food takeaways is symptomatic of the large numbers arriving.

'What it points to is the need to stem the flow of dinghy-migrants.'

A spokesperson for the Home Office said: 'The asylum system is broken and is costing the tax-payer an eye watering amount of money.

'Our New Plan for Immigration will fix this broken system by breaking the business model of criminal gangs to prevent dangerous and unnecessary crossings.'"

The new Resident Evil live-action series has arrived on Netflix telling a brand new story with (mostly) fresh characters. Fans and critics have so far had mixed feelings about the gory video game adaptation. Still there’s one thing many viewers can agree on: The show has done a fantastic job with eerie pre- and post-apocalyptic settings. So where was Netflix’s Resident Evil filmed? Here’s what to know.

Where does Netflix’s ‘Resident Evil’ take place?

The Resident Evil TV series covers two different years: 2022 and 2036. Like the Resident Evil games and other adaptations the fictional location of Raccoon City South Africa is prominently featured. However this is a newer version of the city aptly named New Raccoon City. The 2036 timeline also includes other parts of the world like London and Dover England.

Resident Evil sees virologist Albert Wesker (Lance Reddick) move to New Raccoon City with his teen daughters Jade (Tamara Smart) and Billie (Siena Agudong). He works for the Umbrella Corporation to create a new antidepressant called Joy. However the drug contains the T-virus a disease formerly used in bioweaponry. The Umbrella Corp. mass produces Joy despite the T-virus side effects which include becoming a mutated zombie.

Fourteen years later an older Jade (Ella Balinska) navigates a post-apocalyptic world overrun by monsters. She sets out to find answers about Billie who went missing. However while Jade searches for her sister there are people searching for Jade.

Netflix’s ‘Resident Evil’ series filming locations include South Africa and England

Raccoon City doesn’t exist but Netflix still filmed many Resident Evil scenes in South Africa — specifically Cape Town. As Netflix Life notes many interior scenes were shot at Cape Town Film Studios. Meanwhile to get that wasteland feel of a post-apocalyptic world the show filmed on location at abandoned structures like the Werdmuller Center (a shopping mall) and the Maitland Abattoir (a slaughterhouse) in South Africa.

As fans may have noticed several scenes in Resident Evil take place aboard a ship. Two vessels Sarah Baartman and S. A. Agulhas were used for these shots. The former is an environmental protection ship while the latter was once used for polar research. Resident Evil enlisted a company called Frog Squad which specializes in water-based filming for help with these scenes.

Finally Resident Evil visited London England for a few more shooting locations. Viewers can see landmarks like Big Ben and London Underground in some scenes.

How does this ‘Resident Evil’ adaptation connect to the video game franchise?

Netflix's #ResidentEvil series is a winner whether you're new to the franchise or a diehard counting every Easter Egg. Love love love Lance Reddick as Wesker. As a RESIDENT EVIL fan I'm digging the adaptation's focus on Umbrella viral mysteries and yes zombie action. pic.twitter.com/VKyaPaCykq — Matt Donato (@DoNatoBomb) July 12 2022

While Netflix’s Resident Evil is mostly a new story the video games do serve as a “backstory” according to showrunner Andrew Dabb. That means that all the events that happened in the games also happened in this Resident Evil universe and some will even be referenced in Netflix’s show. As for the other Resident Evil films and series this adaptation doesn’t really have a connection to those.

""When Apple a $2.4 trillion dollar company market cap-wise rolls over it's obviously going to have a pronounced impact on the headline indices and it just reminds people that companies are buckling down because of what they're seeing out there"" said Peter Boockvar chief investment officer at Bleakley Advisory Group.

The late-day pullback follows a Bloomberg report that said Apple plans to slow hiring and spending on growth next year to deal with a possible downturn. Shares of Apple declined nearly 2.1%.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 215.65 points or 0.69% to 31072.61 — accelerating losses in the final hour of trading and erasing a 356 point jump earlier in the day. The S&P 500 fell 0.84% to 3830.85. The Nasdaq Composite declined 0.81% to 11360.05

A stock rally on Wall Street lost steam on Monday with the Dow Jones Industrial Average losing a more than 350 point gain from earlier in the session.

""People are not going to keep buying laptops every year and they're not going to replace their phone every year"" Boockvar added.

A strong earnings report from Goldman Sachs initially buoyed stocks following mixed results last week from banks JPMorgan Chase and Morgan Stanley though some on Wall Street warned investors to err on the side of caution during what's expected to be a choppy earnings season.

""We anticipate volatility to remain elevated as the market toggles between pricing recession risk and soft landing probabilities with each piece of data"" Citi's Scott Chronert said in a recent note.

On Monday Goldman Sachs posted earnings and revenue that easily beat expectations even as CEO David Solomon said during an earnings call that inflation is ""deeply entrenched"" in the economy. Shares popped 5.6% at one point before easing and ending the day with a 2.5% gain.

Strong results from its fixed income operations helped Goldman Sachs offset a drop in investment banking revenue. Bond traders at the bank generated about $700 million more revenue than expected following increased trading in interest rates commodities and currencies.

Bank of America reported quarterly revenue that beat analyst expectations with shares ticking slightly higher. IBM will post results after the closing bell.

Other major companies set to report earnings this week include Johnson & Johnson Netflix Lockheed Martin Tesla United Airlines Union Pacific and Verizon.

Earnings expectations

Despite the growing recession fears S&P 500 companies are expected to post a 4.2% year-over-year increase in second-quarter profit according to consensus analyst estimates gathered by FactSet. S&P 500 revenues are seen expanding 10.2% in the quarters according to FactSet.

Profit expectations for the full year are still high with analysts estimating S&P 500 companies will lift 2022 earnings by 9.9% data collected by FactSet show.

""We expect the results to be generally okay"" said Terry Sandven chief equity strategist at U.S. Bank Wealth Management. ""Focus will primarily be on margins and to the extent to which companies are able to pass along higher input costs that'll dictate where perhaps valuations can go.""

Energy stocks gained in the broader market index. Shares of Hess jumped 4.8%. Devon Energy gained 3.6% and Marathon Oil climbed nearly 3.5%.

Meanwhile Boeing shares dipped slightly on news that Delta Air Lines was buying 100 737 Max 10 planes. Shares of Delta jumped about 3.5%.

Less aggressive Fed?

Investors assessed the likelihood that the Fed will be less aggressive than feared at its meeting later this month. A Wall Street Journal report Sunday said the central bank is on track to lift interest rates by 75 basis points instead of the full percentage point increase forecast by some market participants.

Goldman Sachs chief economist Jan Hatzius also said in an overnight note that he expected the Fed to raise rates by three quarters of a point.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxwZ2EuY29tL25ld3MvMjAyMi9qZW5uaWZlci1rdXBjaG8tYW5kLWxpemV0dGUtc2FsYXMtd2luLWRvdy1ncmVhdC1sYWtlcy1iYXktaW52aXRhdGlvbmFs0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Jennifer Kupcho and Lizette Salas win Dow Great Lakes Bay Invitational,"MIDLAND Mich. (AP) - Jennifer Kupcho and Lizette Salas won the Dow Great Lakes Bay Invitational on Saturday closing with a 9-under 61 in best-ball play for a five-stroke victory in the LPGA Tour's lone team event.

The U.S. Solheim Cup partners finished at 26-under 254 at Midland Country Club. They opened Wednesday with a 68 in alternate shot shot a best-ball 61 on Thursday and took a four-stroke lead Friday with an alternate-shot 64.

""It was amazing to be alongside Lizette"" Kupcho said. ""I think I was a little nervous coming into today just because I didn't want to let her down. I'm sure she probably felt the same way.""

Kupcho won for the third time this year and in her career while Salas won her second tour title. Kupcho won the major Chevron Championship in early April in the California desert and the Meijer LPGA Classic last month in Belmont Michigan. Salas also won the 2014 Kingsmill Championship.

""It's been a long time"" Salas said. ""I couldn't have done it without her. She's a great competitor a great friend and an mazing partner on the golf course. We played some amazing golf this week. My job was - or my goal was - to play well for her. We showcased how our games can complement each other.""

They were 2-0-1 as partners in the 2021 Solheim Cup.

""We were clicking all week"" Kupcho said. ""I think we just have a lot of faith in each other. We make each other comfortable. So we just know that if we mess up the other person has got us. That has worked really well for us.""

Matilda Castren and Kelly Tan were second after a 62.

""It's been an unbelievable week"" Tan said. ""It's just so awesome that I got to do it with my best friend Matilda and to have my best finish on the LPGA Tour and being able to have so much fun on the week as well. That was amazing. I can't ask for anything else.""

Former Arkansas players Stacy Lewis and Maria Fassi shot a 59 to finish third at 20 under.

""I think it's confidence for both of us"" Lewis said. ""I felt like I played some better golf this year and maybe the results haven't showed and talking to her I think she could probably say the same thing. Just for both of us to see some putts go in and see some shots go in and doing what you are trying to do it doesn't matter what format it is.""

Cheyenne Knight and Elizabeth Szokol had a 61 to match Tiffany Chan and Haeji Kang at 19 under Chan and Kang shot a 62.

Annika Sorenstam and Madelene Sagstrom tied for the first-round lead closed with a 66 to tie for 28th at 11 under.

The 51-year-old Sorenstam made her second LPGA Tour start of the year and only her third since retiring after the 2008 season. The Hall of Famer missed the cut last month in the U.S. Women's Open.

""I think this has been a great experience great tournament"" Sorenstam said. ""Dow the way they support the LPGA is fantastic in this town. We felt so welcome. Everybody is friendly and happy. It's been a great golf course.""

The tournament ended Saturday so players could head to France for the fourth major of the year at the Evian Championship. That will start the European portion of the LPGA Tour schedule that includes the Women's British Open at Muirfield.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMicWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJsb29tYmVyZy5jb20vbmV3cy9hcnRpY2xlcy8yMDIyLTA3LTE3L2FzaWEtc3RvY2tzLW1heS1nZXQtdGFpbHdpbmQtZnJvbS11cy1kb2xsYXItbWl4ZWQtbWFya2V0cy13cmFw0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Stock Market Today: Dow S&P Live Updates for July 18,"Why did this happen?

After going 2-0-1 at Inverness the Kupcho and Salas remain undefeated after a commanding five-stroke victory at the Dow Great Lakes Bay Invitational. Their closing 61 put them 26-under 254 within one stroke of the tournament record.

“I think we just have a lot of faith in each other” said Kupcho. “We make each other comfortable.”

Kupcho now a three-time winner on the LPGA including a major is a leading contender for LPGA Player of the Year. She came into this event No. 9 in the world and heads into next week’s Amundi Evian Championship as a player to watch. The 25-year-old tied for second at Evian as a rookie in 2019.

For Salas the win at Midland Country Club marked her first LPGA victory in eight years. In that span she has posted six runner-up finishes including three at major championships. Salas turns 33 on Sunday.

“Man it’s been a long time” she said “but if I were to win again it would be with Jennifer. We got to spend the whole week together and to continue the momentum that we had back in September. I don’t want to get emotional but it’s just been a magical week.”

Matilda Castren nearly aced the par-3 18th to lock up solo second alongside partner Kelly Tan. This marks the first top-10 finish of Tan’s career. The pair became close friends while competing on the Epson Tour.

Tan asked Castren who became the first player from Finland to win on the LPGA last year to be her maid of honor at her wedding in December.

“I feel like if you would wind back the clock and stop us there and literally tell us in a few years you guys are going to be playing this tournament and you’re going to finish second I think it was going to be really hard for both of us to believe because we both were really just – I just feel like at the lowest point of our career” said Tan.

“It just feels really good that we got out of the hole and being able to compete at such (a) high level and finish second this week proving to us that we could do it.”

Stacy Lewis and Maria Fassi closed with a 59 to jump up to third. Last year this event served as a springboard for Fassi who learned a lot playing alongside the fellow Razorback star.

“I mean I think it’s confidence for both of us” said Lewis. “I felt like I played some better golf this year and maybe the results haven’t showed and talking to her I think she could probably say the same thing.

“Just for both of us to see some putts go in and see some shots go in and doing what you are trying to do it doesn’t matter what format it is.”

Fassi credited the time spent with Lewis last year for improving her course management. This year Fassi focused more on the mental side.

“I think the last two days were very good on that regard” she said. “We’ve been talking a lot and it’s just been cool to see why she’s the player she is. A lot of it comes from her head.”

Sisters Nelly Korda and Jessica Korda closed with a 10-under 60 to move into a share of eighth.

“I was kind of just making pars and coming in for reads” said Jessica with a laugh.

Former No. 1 Nelly made eight birdies and an eagle on her own ball.

“It’s nice to know that I can still shoot that low and to make some clutch putts which was really nice” said Nelly. “It was a lot of fun. We had fun this week and hopefully I can carry it into the next couple of weeks as well.”

Today wasn’t great but we’re thankful we even went. @ANNIKA59 strained her neck stretching an hour before the round. Could hardly warm up but decided to try. Played great considering.

After co-leading the tournament on Wednesday Annika Sorenstam and Madelene Sagstrom finished in a share of 28th. A third-round 72 derailed their efforts.

Turns out Sorenstam strained her neck prior to Friday’s round while stretching about an hour before their tee time. She felt better on Saturday which bodes well for the 10-major winner as she heads to the Senior LPGA next week in Kansas.

“I feel it’s been a great week in a lot of ways” said Sorenstam. “Haven’t really thought about next week yet. I mean I’m just one day at a time. As a matter of fact I’m heading to Minnesota in between so I’m sure my mind will be a little bit there first.”

Karrie Webb and Marina Alex took a share of 15th. This marked the first time Sorenstam and Webb were in the same field at an LPGA event since 2008. Webb heads next to Kansas too for her debut in a senior major.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMia2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1lbnNoZWFsdGguY29tL2VudGVydGFpbm1lbnQvYTQwNjMzODI2L3N0cmFuZ2VyLXRoaW5ncy1yb2Jpbi1hZGhkLXRoZXJhcGlzdC1yZWFjdHMtZ2VvcmdpYS1kb3cv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,A Therapist Reacts to Robin's ADHD Symptoms in 'Stranger Things 4',"When Maya Hawke joined the cast of Stranger Things 3 as Robin Buckley Steve Harrington got a new best friend—and fans of the show got a new favorite character. Stranger Things 4 brings Robin even more closely into the plot pairing her up with Nancy Wheeler in an investigation into the Creel killings. Not only does this give Robin somebody new to interact with in the story but it also highlights aspects of her behavior that were either not present or conveyed more subtly in her earlier performance.

In a video on her YouTub channel psychotherapist Georgia Dow reviews several key scenes from Season 4 in which Robin exhibits what she believes to be typical symptoms of ADHD. This is expressed in moments where an overwhelmed Robin speaks incredibly rapidly vocalizing every thought that comes to her and seemingly missing the non-verbal cues that Nancy is becoming irritated.

""The thinking part of your brain kind of turns off and with it your ability to filter out when you should speak and when you shouldn't"" says Dow. ""And other people's reactions you're not reading them as effectively as you would when you're really calm... That talking and all those exuberant hand gestures that's a way of burning off adrenaline that anxiety that she might feel.""

However there are other instances where Robin is able to pick up on some of the subtleties in her interactions with Nancy like when she detects a hint of jealousy at how close she is with Steve. Because she has no filter she directly tells Nancy that their relationship is platonic and even goes so far as to ask whether she is being too ""annoying.""

Dow points out that while Robin is aware that some people might be annoyed by her she doesn't take it personally because she's used to it. ""She has the amount of self-awareness to know that sometimes she doesn't have that much self-awareness"" says Dow.

Robin also demonstrates the traits of a ""super feeler"" such as when she is able to correctly read the situation at the institution well enough to launch into a monologue that eventually gets her and Nancy access to Victor Creel.

""That ability of social engineering is a huge skill"" says Dow. ""As long as she's calm enough to pay attention."""

We shed some light on who to call.,"Question: Who and how do I notify if a street light is burned out?

— E.D.

Answer: Duke Energy installs and maintains street lights. Jimmy Flythe a director of community relations for the utility sheds some light on the issue.

“For lighting repair requests we have an easy to use online tool that can be accessed from a computer or mobile device. The link is: www.duke-energy.com/outdoorlightingrepair. There is a short video tutorial available. There is a map showing street lights and also indicates if a repair is in progress.

“Area lights for individuals and businesses are not mapped but customers can select the location and submit a repair request.

“Light repairs can include dim lights replacing purple lights (which is due to a manufacturing defect) damaged lights in addition to lights that are just out or that stay on during the day.

“Customers can also call our contact center at 800-777-9898 but reporting online is the preferred and most accurate way to report issues.”

Q: My 95-year-old mother needs to have her state-issued ID renewed. I tried to renew it online but discovered it can’t be renewed online. You have to make an appointment and go to a DMV office in person. She uses a walker and it’s difficult for her to do that. Is there another way we can renew her ID? — S.J.P.

A: John Brockwell a spokesman for the N.C. Division of Motor Vehicles said office staff will need to contact you.

“Before anything can be done we will need to know the person’s name address email address and a contact phone number” he said. “Each person has their own set of circumstances. We would need to communicate with that person before a next course of action in assisting them could take place.”

The Supreme Court last month limited how the nation’s main anti-air pollution law can be used to reduce carbon dioxide emissions from power plants. Then late Thursday Sen. Joe Manchin D-W.Va. said he wants to delay sweeping environmental legislation that Democrats have pushed as central to achieving Biden’s ambitious climate goals.

Biden who has pledged to cut greenhouse gas emissions in half by 2030 compared with 2005 levels said Friday that “action on climate change and clean energy remains more urgent than ever.”

If the Senate will not act to address climate change and boost clean energy “I will take strong executive action to meet this moment” Biden said in a statement from Saudi Arabia where he met Friday with Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman.

Biden did not specify what actions he will take on climate but said they will create jobs improve energy security bolster domestic manufacturing and protect consumers from oil and gas price increases. “I will not back down” he promised.

Some advocates urged Biden to use the moment to declare a national climate emergency and reinstate a ban on crude oil exports among other steps.

Declaring a climate emergency would allow Biden to redirect spending to accelerate renewable energy such as wind and solar and speed the nation’s transition away from fossil fuels such as coal oil and natural gas.

Climate advocates including some of Manchin’s Democratic colleagues in the Senate said Manchin’s announcement that he cannot back the climate provisions in the Senate bill — at least for now — frees Biden of the obligation to cater to a powerful coal-state senator eager to protect his energy-producing home state. Manchin’s vote is decisive in the evenly divided Senate where Republicans unanimously oppose climate action.

“Free at last. Let’s roll. Do it all and start it now” tweeted Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse D-R.I. who has long pushed stronger action on climate. “With legislative climate options now closed it’s now time for executive Beast Mode” Whitehouse wrote.

Whitehouse suggested a series of actions Biden could take including “a robust social cost of carbon rule″ that would force energy producers to account for greenhouse gas emissions as a cost of doing business. The senator also urged Biden to require major polluters to use technology to capture carbon dioxide emissions and impose stronger pollution controls on cars light trucks and heavy-duty vehicles.

Advocates also urged Biden to reject all onshore and offshore drilling on federal lands and in federal waters — a step he promised during the 2020 campaign but has not enacted — and restrict approval of natural gas pipelines and other fossil fuel projects.

“For too long we’ve been waiting on a single legislative package to save us and a single legislator to determine our fate” said Sen. Jeff Merkley D-Ore. “Now that it’s clear legislation to address our climate crisis is dead President Biden needs to put us on an emergency footing to address this disaster.”

Citing Biden’s campaign promise to end new drilling on federal lands and waters Merkley said “Now is the time to show the American people he’s serious by saying ‘no’ to expanding our addiction to fossil fuels.”

Even before Manchin’s apparent rejection of the climate measures Democrats had slimmed their down their plan from about $555 billion in climate spending to just over $300 billion in a bid to secure his support. Proposed tax credits for wind solar and nuclear energy along with still-unproven carbon-capture technology could reduce emissions by up to 40% by 2030 advocates said.

Manchin had already forced Democrats to drop two tax provisions he opposes: direct payments of clean energy credits and tax credits for drivers who purchase electric vehicles. Manchin forced other concessions last year including killing a proposal that would have paid utilities that increase clean energy while penalizing those that do not.

Sen. Ron Wyden D-Ore. chairman of the Senate Finance Committee said he still hopes to salvage the clean energy tax provisions and said failure “really is not an option here.”

Manchin’s request to postpone action on the climate measure follows a June 30 ruling by the Supreme Court which said in a 6-3 vote that the Clean Air Act does not give the Environmental Protection Agency broad authority to regulate greenhouse gas emissions from power plants.

The ruling by the court’s conservative majority likely complicates the Biden administration’s plan to manage power plant pollution but does not eliminate its authority to regulate greenhouse gases. EPA Administrator Michael Regan has said the agency is moving forward with proposed rules for power plants in the coming months.

Ann Clancy associate climate policy director for Indivisible a progressive advocacy group said it was time for Biden to “stop waiting for corporate-backed Democrats and their bad faith negotiations and deliver real wins for the American people on climate.”

“We don’t have any more time to waste” Clancy said.

Manchin in a radio interview Friday said climate activists want an immediate end to U.S. use of oil coal and gas. “That’s crazy” he told West Virginia talk show host Hoppy Kercheval. “I’m not throwing caution to the wind. I think we need an energy policy that works for our country.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiiQFodHRwczovL3NwZWN0cnVtbmV3czEuY29tL2t5L25vcnRoZXJuLWt5L25ld3MvMjAyMi8wNy8xNS90cnV0aC0tLWluc3BpcmF0aW9uLWFydGlzdC1zaG93Y2FzZS1vZmZlcnMtd2Vla2VuZC1mdWxsLW9mLWV4aGliaXRpb25zLS1wcm9ncmFtc9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Artist showcase offers weekend of exhibitions programs,"CINCINNATI — Live artistic performances and a film festival will take place at museums across downtown Cincinnati this weekend to mark the opening of the Truth and Inspiration Artist Showcase.

What You Need To Know The Truth and Inspiration Artist Showcase opens this weekend at three different downtown Cincinnati museums



Events include a mixture of onetime and ongoing displays including a mural gallery to performances pieces to a film festival



Organizers said the pieces will lead to a mixture of emotions ranging pain and heartache to hope



Some exhibits are free but others require admission to the museum

Featuring a mix of artistic disciplines and style the works of 22 local artists aim to represent a range of perspectives on the theme of truth and reconciliation. Styles of work include visual art film music dance and children’s literature.

To mark the return of the showcase a ribbon-cutting Friday at the Cincinnati Art Museum one of the event sites. Musician Margaret Tung played selections from the work ""New Music for the Queen City and Beyond"" in the museum’s Great Hall.

The full weekend program schedule is below.

“The themes of this year’s exhibition align closely with the museum’s mission to contribute to a more vibrant Cincinnati by inspiring and connecting our communities through the power of art” said David Linnenberg the Cincinnati Art Museum’s acting director. “We hope that the show’s artwork sparks conversations among our visitors and communities.”

While there are specific events taking place at multiple locations downtown this weekend there’s also an ongoing visual art show at the Cincinnati Art Museum. Included in that exhibition are works by the following artists:

“NEW MOON” by Asha Ama

“Mood Altering” by Asha the Artist

“REST” by Darnell Pierre Benjamin

“It is Art” by Means Cameron

“12 Commandments” by Michael Coppage

“Amid Exhibition” by Iman Jabrah

“Tepozzanilli: Live Stream Transmission” by Rebecca Nava Soto

“Sanctuaries” by Michael Thompson

“Story Share” by Kailah Ware

This exhibit is open daily in the Schiff Gallery at the Cincinnati Art Museum. It will remain open through Aug. 14.

Artists involved in the showcase received support from ArtsWave a major funding source for many Cincinnati-area artists and arts organizations. The funds came from its Black and Brown Artist Program.

Organizers described Truth and Inspiration as displaying a mixture of emotions – pain and heartache skepticism and futility. But they also display hope imagination and commitment.

Started in 2020 the showcase expanded this year to three locations — the Cincinnati Art Museum the Cincinnati Museum Center and the National Underground Railroad Freedom Center. Events will take place at each site throughout the weekend.

Woody Keown the Freedom Center’s president and COO invited guests to come to visit his riverfront museum both Saturday and Sunday.

On Saturday the Freedom Center will host “Monarca - Lost Butterfly (In Memoriam)” a contemporary dance with film by Gabriel Martinez Rubio. Immediately after that will be a documentary on Japanese American’s incarceration in the United States during World War II. There will be a question-and-answer session that follows.

Keown also invited guests to visit Sunday to view artist Brent Billingsley’s ongoing mural showcase “I’m Listening…”. The piece combines art with months of conversations between officers from the Cincinnati Police Department and residents in the communities they serve.

Guests will need to pay normal admission on Saturday. Admission on Sunday is free at the Freedom Center thanks to a corporate sponsor.

Keown described the showcase as “something that can truly move our community forward” through “dialogue about equity and empathy.”

“Artists have a unique ability to stir something inside that moves you to emotion and inspires you to action” he added. “Last year’s showcase did exactly that and as you will see this year’s will be just as powerful.”

Beyond capturing the themes of “truth” and/or “reconciliation” each artist aimed to create works that involve an aspect of collaboration with community members and other partners.

The goal was to allow the public to take part in what ArtsWave described as “reconciling the moment and imagining a more just and equitable future” for the Cincinnati region. They also wanted to showcase the role the arts can play in that process.

Other project partners include City of Cincinnati Duke Energy Macy’s the Greater Cincinnati Foundation Fifth Third Bank The Jewish Foundation of Cincinnati Hard Rock Casino and Cincinnati Children’s Hospital Medical Center.

I’ve subscribed to the duPont Registry for many years. I love looking at the exotic cars and supercars and I’m amazed at the prices of the Lamborghinis and Ferraris….hey a guy can dream right!

But when I got my July 2022 issue this week much to my surprise there was a very dramatic shot of the center exhaust of the new C8 Z06! I anxiously open my magazine to page 14 and there’s a two-page cover shot of an orange C8 Z06/Z07 with the title of the article reading “Made In America.”



I was so excited – I thought to myself “Hey we’ve really made it-the duPont Registry is covering the new Z06!” The article talks about the cockpit of the C8 being inspired by fighter jets raves about the new LT6 engine while going into great detail about its specs and claims that “Chevrolet has created a true American supercar that will be cherished and driven for decades to come”.

It looks like there are two covers to this July 2022 issue – I got the better one of the two with the center exhaust featured.

Check out issue #446 of the duPont Registry. I’m keeping mine!

Heading into the 2022 season cornerback depth remains a question mark for the Oklahoma Sooners. Oklahoma looks solid on the outside headlined by Woodi Washington and D.J. Graham. Hoping to help answer the position depth question is junior cornerback Joshua Eaton.

Eaton has appeared in 15 games in a reserve role over his first two seasons with the Oklahoma Sooners. In 2021 he played 10 or more defensive snaps in a game three times: Tulane Western Carolina and TCU. Over his first two seasons he has been targeted 10 times allowing six receptions for 93 yards and one touchdown. The touchdown came in 2021 when the Sooners faced TCU and 2022 preseason All-Big 12 selection Quentin Johnston.

With 122 snaps over his first two seasons Eaton has some experience to build on and he has the size to be disruptive as an outside cornerback for the Oklahoma Sooners defense.

For those of you planning on visiting Markeaton Park on a weekend there are plenty of attractions that can keep you and the kids entertained. From the paddling pool to the boating lake the mini golf to the craft village there is plenty to do on hot summer days.

But there is one attraction which you may not have visited but which attracts attention from around the world. Famous Trains Model Railway opened to the public in a previously-empty building at the park in April 2014 as the brainchild of some passing rail enthusiasts who thought it would be good to have a model railway on the site.

Despite the coronavirus pandemic drastically reducing visitor numbers in 2020 and 2021 the attraction has now welcomed its 50000th visitor after just eight years and boasts a five out of five rating on TripAdvisor from more than 45 reviews. The previous 49999 visitors have come from as far afield as France Canada and New Zealand just to see the model railway which is run entirely by volunteers who continue to find innovative ways to refresh the look of the attraction with new routes trains and displays.

One of the volunteers Owen Stevenson 21 travels from his home in Nottingham around the country because of his interest in trains. This is one of the closest model railways to him so he comes almost every weekend to help out.

He said: ""I feel welcome here and I enjoy operating and maintaining locos and things like that. It gets me out of the house or I'd end up being on my computer all day.

""I like volunteering and my main hobby is trains I've been into them ever since I was little. I've got a set of locos at home and I bring them here and run them as and when I can.""

Getting to the site is easy enough with the building closest to the main car park just off the ring road and close to bus routes and it is accessible for wheelchair users. There is also a gift shop on site with plenty of material which could come in handy for model railway enthusiasts of all ages.

At the time of writing there are hundreds of listings on eBay US for the Jotnar edition being resold for between $400 – $500. Officially the edition retails for $260.

The God of War Ragnarok Jotnar edition which includes several collectable items such as a 16” Mjölnir replica first went on sale in Australia for $399.99 AUSD but instantly sold out.

It would later go on sale in the UK where it was briefly available from UK retailer Game for £220. Customers were unable to purchase the item 2 minutes after it went on sale.

The item which is currently listed on Ebay for as much as triple its RRP was added to various US retailers on Friday including Walmart PlayStation Direct and GameStop but outside of a small amount of stock that was added to Walmart around 90 minutes after preorders opened it was similarily difficult for players to get their hands on it.

While the God of War Ragnarok Jotnar edition launched in the US on PlayStation Direct the UK version of Sony’s storefront has yet to open preorders despite it being expected on Friday. The website still lists the item as “coming soon” however it’s unknown when or if PlayStation Direct will offer the item in the UK.

A Collector’s edition of the game which also includes 16” Mjölnir replica but not the 7inch vinyl also went on sale and faces a similar scalping issue although it isn’t being sold at quite the markup that the Jotnar edition is.

Retailer listings for the game have revealed several new features including the supported graphics modes on PS5. “Switch between full 4K resolution at a targeted 30 frames per second or dynamic resolution upscaled to 4K at a targeted 60fps” reads the product description on retail sites.

It just makes sense for gaming companies — an immensely lucrative source of revenue the microtransactions market was worth at $60 billion in 2021 and projected to hit $106 billion by 2026.

Typically offered as in-game collectibles currencies or chance-based loot boxes microtransactions are now better received than they were a few years ago. Loot boxes which are a way for players to receive random in-game rewards in exchange for real money have been disparaged for a while now and they’re now increasingly subject to government scrutiny.

Loot boxes have become an issue because they encourage spending real money for a miniscule chance at obtaining valuable in-game items more often than not leaving players with nothing to show except a desire to continue gambling for better items. Companies have been known to employ predatory sales tactics to sell loot boxes and in the process introduce to minors an avenue to gambling. Despite Electronic Arts’ (EA) insistence that loot boxes are not gambling and are in fact “surprise mechanics” several studies have shown there is a link between loot boxes and gambling addiction.

Red tape redemption

When Belgium banned loot boxes in 2018 it looked like the first domino had fallen and further regulation from other countries would follow soon. The ensuing response was sluggish though despite countries like the U.K. agreeing that loot boxes are an issue that needs to be addressed.

One of the biggest hurdles faced by countries attempting to regulate loot boxes is that they do not fit their present definitions of what constitutes gambling allowing companies to offer them and continue operating outside traditional gambling regulations.

The Netherlands following in the footsteps of Belgium’s ban tried to get the gears moving as well by fining Electronic Arts in 2019 over the inclusion of loot boxes in its popular FIFA franchise. This fine was overturned earlier this year after an appeal.

EA couldn’t celebrate its win for long though as the Netherlands has now pushed to update its legal definition of gambling to ensure better regulation of loot boxes. It remains to be seen if this results in an outright ban or leads to EA requiring a gambling license and all the regulation that goes with it. When it does happen it’s likely that EA will simply remove the offending loot boxes from the games sold in the Netherlands similar to its response to the ban in Belgium.

Activision Blizzard opted for a different route with its new mobile game Diablo Immortal by simply not releasing the game in Belgium and the Netherlands. The company’s decision has been vindicated as the game made nearly $50 million in its first month. It will be interesting to see how companies will respond to similar regulations in bigger markets.

Should similar bans and regulations be enforced globally the video game industry won’t likely be affected very much. However it will severely impact the earnings of companies that have bet heavily on loot boxes.

To EA or not to EA

Given the controversy around loot boxes a lot of developers and publishers have moved towards allowing players to buy exactly what they want instead of leaving it to chance.

The mobile gaming market which relies heavily on microtransactions has enough diversity in microtransaction offerings to remain relatively unscathed if loot boxes are regulated globally. Measures like China’s decision to implement a maximum monthly spending limit on microtransactions for minors is more likely to wreak havoc on the mobile gaming industry if other markets adopt a similar approach.

EA has fought tooth and nail against any attempted regulation of loot boxes and it looks like it will continue to do so. After all loot boxes drew in a cool $1.6 billion from FIFA alone in 2021 — for context EA’s net revenue for that period was $5.6 billion. It isn’t difficult to see why the company is so adamant on keeping its golden goose going as long as it can.

Smaller studios who develop their games without the support of big name publishers have generally adopted a different approach. They typically implement a free-to-play (F2P) model for mobile games that encourages users to purchase microtransactions. Of the top 10 most downloaded mobile games of 2021 half were made by smaller studios and all included some form of microtransactions. Interestingly most games from such studios do not include loot boxes.

Paid loot boxes aren’t common in games made by smaller studios for traditional platforms like video game consoles and PC. And the majority of games that include microtransactions tend to stick to value-adds like cosmetics and in-game currency. Successful indie games like Stardew Valley and Hollow Knight eschew all forms of microtransactions entirely.

Despite their allure a lot of the smaller studios have forgone loot boxes as they are often wary of having their games delisted in specific regions due to the prospect of regulations. Other studios though may want to avoid the controversy around loot boxes altogether.

Leveling up regulation

Ethically speaking it’s clear that there’s a problem here. But given the money that loot boxes bring in it’s difficult to trust the industry to self-regulate.

It’s unlikely that other countries will follow Belgium and the Netherlands’ outright bans but they might be more open to regulation that bars loot box sales to minors as proposed by Australia.

Of course such regulations are difficult to enforce and slapping an 18+ sticker on a game and calling it a day won’t do much to deter parents from buying a sports game for their children. Once the game has been bought there’s little that can be done to prevent children from engaging with loot boxes barring invasive age verification at multiple steps. While an 18+ rating on games that feature loot boxes may raise some awareness it’s unlikely that anyone following these trends isn’t already aware of the pros and cons of the model.

There’s hope though. The wheels are turning slowly but they certainly are in motion. The topic keeps popping up in legislative discussions across the globe and it’s likely that we will see some form of regulation in most countries in the coming years.

While regulation will certainly slow down the earnings from loot boxes they will likely continue to remain a lucrative offering especially since any regulation regarding it (barring an outright ban) will be difficult to enforce.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYWh0dHBzOi8vamFtYWljYS1nbGVhbmVyLmNvbS9hcnRpY2xlL2FydC1sZWlzdXJlLzIwMjIwNzE3L3VzaW5nLWRpZ2l0YWwtYXJ0LWFkdm9jYXRlLXNvY2lhbC1jaGFuZ2XSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Using digital art to advocate social change | Art & Leisure,"Two years of curfews and restrictions left many Jamaicans feeling like we missed out. Therefore it was no surprise that as the restrictions lifted many of us raced to make up for lost time by hitting every possible party lyme and social event.

In anticipation of what would inevitably become a period of partying and accompanied by alcohol consumption Red Stripe ramped its advocacy on Drink and Live Responsibly Campaign. An extension of the campaign was a consumer call to action competition specifically targeting amateur film-makers to submit 60-second Instagram Reels depicting how they drink and live responsibly.

From May 30-June 24 almost 50 students answered the call to use their talents as a force for good and a chance to win a 2-year Associated Degree scholarship to Edna Manley College of the Visual & Performing Arts courtesy of the Desnoes & Geddes Foundation and a share of $325000 in cash.

POWERFUL MESSAGE

The submissions drew on comedy and dramatisation to convey their message while others incorporated music and other elements of Jamaican culture. Highlights from the videos included statements and jingles like: “Me drink you drive mek we live responsibly” “Eat before and while you are drinking” and “Me drive you just relax and drink yu zimmi”.

Dean of the School of Dance at the Edna Manley College of the Visual and Performing Arts Marlon Simms noted “The reel responsibility campaign is an excellent one because you’re using art to spread a very powerful message. I love the use of art and social media to tackle an issue that is so deeply personal for a lot of people. This campaign is aligned with the values we promote at Edna Manley including looking out for each other and personal responsibility so it’s fitting that the winner will be joining our community to further explore her creative passions.”

Red Stripe Head of Corporate Affairs Dianne Ashton-Smith stated “With the reopening of the entertainment sector we believed it was important to increase our advocacy around drinking responsibly. It’s very tempting to head back into social life and quickly try to make up for it. However the whole point of this campaign is to say you can head back out and enjoy yourself and you can do so safely responsibly and in moderation.”

Ashton-Smith explained why Instagram was chosen as the platform for the campaign. “Social media reaches millions of people daily. It is a place people go to not only for jokes gossip and fun but also for information and news and to stay up to date with what is happening globally. This initiative allows young people to express their innovativeness through digital art while contributing to a culture of responsibility.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiOWh0dHBzOi8vYm9ybmVvYnVsbGV0aW4uY29tLmJuL2YxLTIyLXJvYXJzLWludG8tYS1uZXctZXJhL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,‘F1 22’ roars into a new era,"Gregory Leporati

THE WASHINGTON POST – This year marks a new era for Formula One and its annual video game series is keeping pace.

The global motor sport introduced sweeping new regulations this season to promote more competitive racing forcing teams to redesign their cars from the ground up. Codemasters – the United Kingdom (UK)-based development team owned by Electronic Arts that has designed each year’s F1 video game since 2009 – found itself in a similar boat feverishly working over the past few months to reproduce those new changes in its latest installment F1 22.

“It was a daunting task that’s for sure” said Senior Creative Director at Electronic Arts Lee Mather in an interview with The Washington Post. “But any time there are big changes like this that’s also a lot of fun for us.”

Mapping out the new cars began as a sort of theoretical experiment. Based on the 2022 regulations the cars would have a variety of new features aimed at promoting more overtakes and closer racing including over-wheel winglets a completely redone front wing and nose rolled tips on the rear wings and low-profile tires.

At the beginning of the year teams provided Codemasters with the physical dimensions specifications and early renderings of their new cars which the developers used as a starting point to generate initial 3D models. Then in February Codemasters sent a team member to F1’s preseason testing in Barcelona to get an up-close look at the cars and see them in action.

“We had a developer stand at key parts of the circuit and watch how each car squirmed into a corner – where each one starts to brake when they go back on the throttle and how they handle” Mather said.

The impact of the new regulations he added was obvious: This year’s cars are heavier with a redesigned floor that generates significantly more downforce (which is exactly what it sounds like) to allow drivers to follow one another more closely. Because the car is lower to the ground cutting corners and riding over kerbs – essentially rumble strips – is far less forgiving. And larger 18-inch Pirelli tires have impacted the vehicles’ weight and cornering.

Codemasters revamped and reexamined nearly every aspect of its physics engine fine-tuning it until the 3D models were registering identical lap times as their real-life counterparts.

The development team regularly consulted with current F1 team bosses drivers and F1 esports pros – and has been pouring over data of each race so far this season including last weekend’s Canadian Grand Prix – resulting in a video game that Mather believes will not only be accurate but feel like a fresh experience for longtime fans.

“We’ve done a huge amount of work on so many aspects: our aero models the suspension updating the physics and the tire models” he said. “So really the on-track experience feels significantly different.”

While the game does strive for accuracy Mather and his team decided to exercise creative licence on one significant aspect of the new cars: “porpoising” an unexpected design quirk in which the fluctuating amounts of downforce cause some cars to bounce aggressively on straightaways similar to how a porpoise bobs up and down on the surface of the water.

It has been a major plotline of the early F1 season and one of the reasons Mercedes the defending Constructors’ title champion has struggled to contend for podiums.

Replicating that in the game Mather said had a clear negative impact on the user experience.

“Here’s how I explain it to people: If I were to shake your computer monitor up and down you wouldn’t be able to focus and you’d feel really ill” he said. “That’s essentially what you get with porpoising in the game. We tried it in VR as well and it was equally disturbing.”

Formula One and the International Automobile Federation the sport’s governing body recently announced plans to tweak the cars to eliminate porpoising this season so Mather is confident that most fans won’t be too upset with Codemasters’ decision to exclude it from the game.

“Some people might call for it but it’s really punishing yourself for no reason” he said.

Aside from the revamped physics Codemasters also aimed to make F1 22 its most approachable game yet with plenty of features to make it playable for even the most casual Formula One fans.

In addition to the player assists seen in previous entries – steering and braking for example – F1 22 introduces adaptive AI where the difficulty of the game will fluctuate midrace based on the player’s performance to ensure it remains competitive from start to finish.

“’Drive to Survive’ has brought in a whole new audience” said Mather referring to the Netflix series about Formula One that has helped fuel the sport’s recent popularity surge. “Some new fans have no experience with racing games whatsoever so adaptive AI gives the game a real breadth of appeal and lets gamers choose how they want to play it.”

Other new features include: “Pirelli Hot Laps” where you can drive supercars around the track (an increasingly popular part of each Grand Prix weekend); cross-platform multiplayer which Mather said will be added post launch; and an accurate reproduction of this year’s new track the Miami International Autodrome which was designed around the city’s Hard Rock Stadium.

Having worked on F1 video games for more than 13 years now Mather is convinced that F1 22 is the most accurate and engrossing entry yet. He chalks that up in part to how seriously F1 teams are taking esports and video games. Every F1 team now participates in the Formula One Esports Series which has grown substantially since the pandemic and drivers like McLaren’s Lando Norris have made esports and live-streaming on Twitch a major part of their careers.

“I never thought we’d be in a position to be talking with bosses drivers and engineers about what we do” Mather said. “But all of their insights have been phenomenal and it’s really helped push this series further.”",,,,,,

In a newly released list of the 100 fittest cities in America Chicago came in at No. 10.

Thanks to our sponsors: View all sponsors

The American Fitness Index published annually by the American College of Sports Medicine and the Elevance Health Foundation evaluated cities on a number of personal health indicators such as the percentage of smokers in the population chronic health problems like the prevalence of obesity in the population and the percentage of people exercising in the last 30 days as well as community and environmental indicators which include a city’s walkability and access to recreational facilities.

This is the first time the Windy City has cracked the top 10 in the report’s 15-year history and an improvement over last year’s No. 14 ranking. Arlington Virginia was ranked the fittest city – a title its held for the past five years.

Chicago’s ranking can be attributed to its high walk and bike scores and accessibility to parks.

“Chicago has a strong physical activity infrastructure to support active lifestyles” said Amanda Paluch who serves on the American College of Sports Medicine’s American Fitness Index Advisory Board.

In addition to providing people with active transportation options like walking or biking to work and school the city also has abundant opportunities for people to be active at one’s leisure.

“Ninety-eight percent of residents live within a 10-minute walk to a park in Chicago” said Paluch who spotlighted the city’s lakefront trail as another asset. “Think about how long that bike path is. It’s uninterrupted along the lake and provides people an active transportation option and also an option to be active during leisure time.”

While the city has the infrastructure to promote healthy lifestyles more could be done to encourage residents to use them according to Paluch.

“For example the city could have more programs in existing parks creating awareness and community around a park. Companies could have bike to work incentives” she said. “The infrastructure is there. It’s just how do you get more people to use them.”

Chicago’s been rising in the fitness index rankings since 2018 and got a shout out in the report for “setting a great example for other cities to follow.”

Declining smoking rates strokes and percentage of residents in poor physical health are among the behaviors that boosted the city’s ranking over last year according to Paluch.

Sebastien has type 1 diabetes but he didn’t let that stop him racing 4800 kilometres across twelve US states.

Here at PezCyclingNews we’re no strangers to talking to athletes who live with type 1 diabetes Team Novo Nordisk rider Sam Brand has featured several times as has the man behind Sam’s team – which is made up of riders who all live with type 1 diabetes – Phil Southerland. But Milano-Sanremo at 300K is one thing the RAAM – Race across America at 4800 kilometres is another.

But it’s not just the distance; it climbs some 175000 feet across 12 different states.

And this is no ‘take it at your own pace jolly’ it’s a competitive race with a 12 day cut off if you’re 12 days and two minutes then you’re not classified as a finisher.

But that’s what Canada’s Sebastien Sasseville who lives with type 1 diabetes qualified for rode and finished. Best have a word with the dude.

PEZ: The basics first please Sebastien.

Sebastien Sasseville: I’m 43 years-old from Quebec in Canada and I’m a motivational speaker.

PEZ: Why the RAAM?

Why not? I’m an endurance guy I love to go long it’s where I shine and my interest in ultra-distance cycling has grown over time. I was aware of the RAAM but didn’t understand how it could be done apart from the physical and mental challenge there’s the funding logistics and putting together a team for the project.

PEZ: How do nutrition and managing your condition dovetail on a ride like that?

The first consideration is to fuel my body as an athlete; but of course the diabetes puts a layer of complexity on top of that I have an insulin pump and CGM – continuous glucose monitoring system to assist in advising what I have to do with my insulin intake.

PEZ: Did you have previous ultra-distance experience?

Last year I rode across Canada in 15 days 17 hours that’s 6000 kilometres which is longer than the RAAM but with less elevation.

PEZ: Tell us about your coaching and training.

My coach is Cliff Scherb of Glucose Advisors – but I’ve been training for and competing in long distance sport for the last 10 years including six Ironman Triathlons and the Sahara ultramarathon. There were a lot of long preparatory training rides involved – 100 200 300 400 kilometres before the RAAM.

PEZ: Who are your sponsors?

My three main sponsors are: Dexcom a company that develops manufactures and distributes continuous glucose monitoring systems for diabetes management. Lilly Canada an affiliate of Eli Lilly and Company one of the world’s largest research-based pharmaceutical companies; Lilly produced the world’s first commercially available insulin. Tandem Diabetes Care who manufacture my insulin pump which is integrated with my Dexcom G6 continuous glucose monitoring system.

PEZ: Tell us about your support team.

I had 10 people in my team we have two mini-vans and an RV; I thought it would be for me sleeping in but it became more of an oasis for the support crew. You have to get the culture of your support team right – I probably wouldn’t have finished without them.

PEZ: And you finished sixth were you happy with that?

I was sixth in my age category and 12th overall in 11 days 22 hours – and ‘yes’ I’m proud of what we achieved as a rookie team. I was hoping for a little better and was riding in sixth overall position for a long time but my body came apart on day nine; I made mistakes with my sleeping. The important thing was to beat the 12 day cut off and we achieved that – but it was just as important to make it to start line. It sends a huge message to folks who live with type 1 diabetes reminding them to: Dream big! Take that first step! Take care of yourself!

PEZ: Am I correct in saying that no drafting is allowed in the race?

That’s correct no drafting; just like any race there are rules which have to be adhered to. But the officials are great their concerns are more about your safety than any other aspect not just rules for rules sake.

PEZ: Your bike?

It’s a Trek Madone with aero bars you have to be as comfortable as possible for an endeavour like RAAM. I love it I did the trans-Canada ride on it. People were saying I should bring; ‘a spare everything’ but I’ve ridden 20000 kilometres on that machine with no mechanical issues – I’ve had punctures but that’s to be expected.

PEZ: Bad patches?

Day nine – my body just fell apart I just wasn’t getting enough sleep. I couldn’t get to sleep and over the first 1500 kilometres I only managed about two-and-a-half hours sleep; I was having bad nights when it came to trying to get to sleep. But day nine I had no fire left so the team decided to take me off the bike for five hours – that enabled me to ‘reset’ I came back to life and that enabled me to finish. There were a lot of guys DNF the weather wasn’t the best but my support team convinced me to go. I’m a resilient person but if you over-work your resilience then it gets tired – that’s why having a good support team is so important.

PEZ: Will we see you back in the RAAM – and with what lessons learned?

I’d love to do it again it’s such a challenge the preparation the logistics the ride… If I ride the RAAM again I’d have a different strategy for the RV and for sleeping.

And another big problem is that for a lot of the ride there’s no cel. phone signal so the team don’t have access to my data – that’s something we’d have to think about. . .

His involvement in title bouts began at UFC 262 in May 2021 when he knocked out Michael Chandler to claim the strap that had been relinquished by Khabib Nurmagomedov when he retired. “Do Bronx” subsequently submitted Dustin Poirier for the first defense of his reign.

But then Oliveira missed weight ahead of his scheduled title defense against Justin Gaethje at UFC 274 earlier this year and was forced to forfeit the gold. He went on to submit Gaethje and UFC president Dana White promised he would be part of the next title fight. Oliveira has since campaigned for a showdown with Conor McGregor in his next fight but he ultimately signed on for Makhachev.

No. 3 Makhachev meanwhile will bring a 10-fight winning streak into his first UFC title opportunity. The pupil of UFC Hall of Famer Khabib Nurmagomedov has been dominant outside of a lone loss in October 2015 racking up wins over the likes of Bobby Green Dan Hooker Arman Tsarukyan and Gleison Tibau.

Rapper Kodak Black was arrested Friday on drug charges during a traffic stop in Ft. Lauderdale Fla. after a search of his car allegedly turned up oxycodone.

The incident took place when the performer whose real name is Bill K. Kapri was pulled over for driving a purple Dodge Durango that allegedly had an expired registration tag.

According to the official police report the 25-year-old was initially stopped by Florida Highway Patrol over his window tints ""which appeared to be darker than the legal limit."" A subsequent records check revealed his driver's license had also expired more than 30 days ago police said.

Police then inspected the car and said they discovered nearly $75000 in cash and a small clear bag that contained 31 tablets of oxycodone. Online records show Black was charged with trafficking in oxycodone and possession of a controlled substance.

He's currently being held in Broward County Jail without bond.

Black's attorney Bradford Cohen shared a statement on Twitter Saturday: ""Never Judge a case based on an arrest. There are always additional facts and circumstances that give rise to a defense especially in this case. We will get him a bond today and move forward with resolving the matter quickly.""

Known for his hit track ""Tunnel Vision"" Black was previously arrested on weapons charges in 2019. The Pompano Beach Fla. native pleaded guilty to making false written statements when purchasing firearms from a federally licensed dealer. He was sentenced to three years in prison but the charges were lessened when then President Donald Trump commuted his sentence in 2021.

In a statement released by the White House at the time Black was described as a ""prominent artist and community leader."" It also acknowledged his involvement in ""numerous philanthropic efforts"" including his $50000 donation to David Portnoy's Barstool Fund which helps small businesses affected by the COVID-19 pandemic.At the time of his release Black had served nearly half of his sentence.

Black has been plagued by legal troubles since his budding rap career began. He was arrested in October 2015 and April 2016 for a string of offenses including robbery false imprisonment battery possession of marijuana possession of a firearm by a delinquent and fleeing a law enforcement officer.

In February he was injured in a shooting outside the after-party following a Justin Bieber concert in Los Angeles.

EW has reached out to Black's reps for further comment.

A portmanteau to describe both gender identity and sexual orientation cishet comes from combining ""cisgender"" and ""heterosexual."" To break the term down more being cisgender means you identify with the gender or biological sex you were assigned at birth and ""heterosexual"" is generally understood to mean someone who is sexually attracted to people of the opposite sex. (But more on that later.)

While that all might seem pretty straightforward like all genders and sexual identities there’s no one way to experience being cishet.

""I don’t see the combination of those two as being a singular type of identity"" says Dr. Penny Harvey (she/they) assistant professor of sexuality studies at the California Institute of Integral Studies. ""They’re more of identity markers or labels of the experience of gender and sexuality for the two.""

In many ways being cishet is seen as the default in our society Harvey adds. If you identify as such you likely haven't experienced gender dysmorphia—the sense that your biological sex and your gender identity are mismatched—nor do you identify as transgender or another identity that falls under the umbrella of LGBTQ+.

Harvey adds that some people view being called ""cishet"" as an insult but believes that feeling might be more of a reaction to the ""challenge of not having to think about being cishet and then suddenly having to think about it; it makes folks feel uneasy.""

Self-growth isn't necessarily a painless process but if you're ready to learn more here's everything you need to know about what it means to be cishet according to experts.

What does it mean to be cishet exactly?

As a quick reminder being cishet means that you identify as both cisgender and heterosexual. However the term needs to be unpacked a little especially with the growing understanding that the concepts of gender and sexuality both exist on a spectrum.

""You could define heterosexual as someone who is attracted to the other sex but that recreates the binary that we’re really trying to move away from"" says Jey Saung (they/them) a doctoral candidate in the Gender Women and Sexuality Studies Department at the University of Washington Seattle. ""I think defining both of these terms is hard because we can only do it through the lens of other concepts that we’ve constructed.""

What's the difference between being 'straight' and 'cishet'?

Though the identities may seem similar the distinction lies in what each term encompasses. When someone is described as ""straight"" it is usually a reference to their sexual orientation only signifying that they are heterosexual explains Harvey. Noting that someone is ""cishet"" is both a description of someone’s sexual orientation (heterosexual) and gender identity (cisgender).

Being cishet comes with privilege.

First let’s take a step back. For the most part society in the U.S. is heteronormative meaning that it’s set up with the assumption that most people are heterosexual and cisgender says Harvey. For example there’s not a coming out process associated with being cishet as there is for individuals who identify as part of the LGBTQ+ community.

Because of that everything from legal systems and medical forms to children’s books and the variety of greeting cards available at your local CVS is geared toward being cishet. If you don’t identify as such the experience can run the gamut from isolating to dangerous to everything in between.

For those who identify as cishet to be more inclusive it's important to think about the language you use not make assumptions about someone’s sexual or gender identity and generally ""try to walk around with an active mind"" says Harvey. ""There’s just so much engrained stuff around gender and sexuality that it can be really hard to undo that.""

Saung adds that conversations about privilege often define the term as being a special advantage in society. Certainly privilege can manifest in that way but they say you should instead think about the idea as ""a lack of additional barriers.""\

One way to educate yourself is learning about the symbolism of the LGBTQ+ pride flags:

""It’s less about it being a kind of positive step up and more of an absence of obstacles or things that get in your way based on who you are"" Saung explains.

When you’re in a position of privilege it’s important to realize that not everyone has the same opportunities or access as you do. That said Saung notes that it’s less about helping those with less privilege than you and more about understanding how all of our systems—gender included—hurt all of us. Making legislative tweaks and passing laws that address issues that affect the LGBTQ+ community one at a time can make a positive difference sure but recognizing your privilege and how it allows you to move easily through the world compels you to ask the question how can we create a new system that values everyone?

And that sounds like a future worth fighting for.

In past years the World squad has faced off against a USA squad offering shades of the WBC but over the past couple years MLB switched to a more traditional East-West division. The Futures Game always takes place on the weekend right before the All-Star Game to officially kick off All-Star festivities as many players who appear in the Futures Game will go on to play in the All-Star Game. In fact Julio Rodríguez who was named to the 2021 Futures Game squad will appear in the All-Star Game the only player from that squad to be in back-to-back Futures Games and All-Star Games.

The Mariners were also represented by OF Jarred Kelenic and RHP Emerson Hancock in 2021; this year they will send just one representative Hancock.

Like its big brother the Futures Game will also be held at Dodger Stadium although it’s just a seven-inning contest. The game airs tonight Saturday July 16 at 4 PM PT. Tonight’s game will be broadcast exclusively on Peacock and Sirius XM radio but will be re-aired on Sunday on MLB Network at 6 a.m. PT if you want to set your DVRs.

Here are the full rosters:

National League:

Arizona: OF Corbin Carroll SS Jordan Lawlar

Carroll is a graduate of Lakeside and a Seattle native; the pure hitter is one of the best prospects in all of baseball along with the athletic Lawlar. This duo is largely the reason Arizona has one of the highest-ranked systems in baseball.

Atlanta: LHP Jared Shuster

Chicago: OF Pete Crow-Armstrong

Cincinnati: INF Elly De La Cruz LHP Andrew Abbott

Colorado: OF Zac Veen

John’s favorite in the draft in 2020 Veen possesses maybe the best raw power in the minors.

Los Angeles: C Diego Cartaya RHP Bobby Miller INF Miguel Vargas

Bobby Miller was electric when I saw him in the Arizona Fall League; he’s a strong candidate to get a callup to help out the Dodgers pen in their playoff push.

Miami: RHP Eury Perez

Milwaukee: OF Jackson Chourio OF Joey Wiemer LHP Antoine Kelly

New York: C Francisco Alvarez

Philadelphia: C Logan O’Hoppe LHP Erik Miller

Pittsburgh: RHP Mike Burrows

San Diego: OF Robert Hassell III

No offense to Hancock but this was the player I wanted in 2020’s draft; Bobby Three Sticks has answered questions about his power as he’s climbed the ladder of the minors and he’ll be one of the youngest players on the field.

San Francisco: LHP Kyle Harrison 3B David Villar

St. Louis: 3B Jordan Walker SS Mason Winn

St. Louis has an embarrassment of infield talent with these two.

Washington: 2B Darren Baker LHP Jose A. Ferrer

American League

Baltimore: INF Gunnar Henderson

Boston: INF Ceddanne Rafaela

Cleveland: OF George Valera INF Jhonkensy Noel

Chicago: OF Oscar Colas

Detroit: C Dillon Dingler RHP Wilmer Flores

Houston: RHP Hunter Brown C Yainer Diaz

Brown is a former D2 pitcher the Astros are turning into their next diamond in the rough although he still has command issues on his second tour through Triple-A. Yainer Diaz currently has a 76 wRC+ in Triple-A but has posted big numbers as a Cleveland prospect before being traded to the Astros for Myles Straw.

Kansas City: RHP Alec Marsh

Los Angeles: LHP Ky Bush

Bush was the second-rounder in the Angels’ 2021 Oops! All Pitchers! draft.

Minnesota: INF Spencer Steer OF Matt Wallner

New York: SS Anthony Volpe OF Jasson Dominguez LHP Ken Waldichuk

Dominguez is the one they call “The Martian.” You’ll be able to pick him out because he’s the one who will look like a coach walking around among Little Leaguers.

Oakland: C Shea Langeliers OF Denzel Clarke

Prepare for Langeliers to be a problem. It was looking for a while there like Langeliers would be a defense-first backup catcher but the bat has caught up as he’s reached Triple-A (albeit with a significant assist from playing in the PCL in general and Las Vegas’s bounce house in particular)—there’s a reason there are suddenly Sean Murphy trade rumors.

Seattle: RHP Emerson Hancock

Tampa Bay: RHP Taj Bradley INF Curtis Mead

Texas: RHP Jack Leiter INF Dustin Harris

If you don’t watch the Arkansas games treat yourself to a sneak peek of Jack Leiter who will be torturing Mariner batters for years.

Toronto: LHP Ricky Tiedemann RHP Yosver Zuleta

Tiedemann is one of the highest-ranked pitching prospects in baseball but Edwin Arroyo—who deserves to be here and will be here next year—took him deep last time the Modesto Nuts faced him.

Mariners who just missed:

Unfortunately both Noelvi Marte and Edwin Arroyo play one of the most talent-rich positions in the minors as shortstops. Marte’s underwhelming first half likely cost him a shot at a Futures Game spot—although it seems like past performance when he was tearing up Modesto should be considered. Priority is also given in Futures Games selections to players who are closer to the upper minors and therefore more likely for fans to see in future years. However Arroyo’s line in Modesto—a 129 wRC+ holding steady for the majority of the season—shows he wouldn’t be out of place with his peers especially Lawlar who was only recently promoted to High-A himself. Look for both of these Mariners prospects to get the nod next year and likely Harry Ford as well who has the fortune of playing one of the least talent-rich positions in baseball and doing so with style.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMikQFodHRwczovL3R1bHNhd29ybGQuY29tL25ld3MvbG9jYWwvY294LWNvbW11bmljYXRpb25zLWFkZHMtdHVsc2EtdG8tMTMwbS1zb2xhci1lbmVyZ3ktY29tbWl0bWVudC9hcnRpY2xlX2I5YzJlMzRlLTAyMTAtMTFlZC04YWIxLTVmYjhiZWRjNTRmYi5odG1s0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Cox Communications adds Tulsa to $130M solar energy commitment,"Cox Communications in Tulsa recently became a shining example of sun-generated energy.

A solar array added to the company’s facility at 11811 E. 51st St. became operational last week. The 400 kilowatts of power will produce roughly 20% of the annual electricity needs for that 110000-square-foot building said David Rossi senior manager for the Atlanta-based Cox Enterprises’ engineering and sustainability team.

“Through clean renewable power coming from the sun it allows us reduce our carbon impact for this one facility by over 580 tons of carbon per year” Rossi said by phone.

Cox which employs about 500 people in Tulsa has sunk more than $130 million nationally in conservation and sustainability efforts since the start of Cox Conserves the company’s national sustainability program in 2007 he said. The company has done 53 solar projects nationwide in the past 15 years said Gene Coleman who manages operation and maintenance for the company’s renewable assets.

The Tulsa installation encompasses 900 roughly 20-square-foot panels Rossi said. The system also has five inverters devices that convert direct current electricity which a solar panel generates to alternating current which the electric grid uses.

“If there happens to be a time say on a weekend or a holiday when our facility is mostly vacant there could be some times when we push power back to the grid and share that renewable energy with the community” Rossi said. “But more than likely it’s all behind the meter which is true distributed generation with the intent that this power comes to our facility directly.”

Oklahoma ranks 45th nationally in solar energy with 0.18% of the state’s energy coming from the sun according to the Solar Energy Industries Association.

The U.S. Energy Information Administration said earlier this year that solar power is on track to account for nearly half of the country’s new electric generation.

In 2022 it expects 46.1 gigawatts of new utility-scale electric generating capacity to be added to the U.S. power grid. Almost half of the planned 2022 capacity additions are solar followed by natural gas at 21% and wind at 17%.

Since the mid-2000s the the federal government has incentivized homeowners and businesses to switch to solar through an investment tax credit also known as the federal solar tax credit. Currently it allows consumers to claim 26% of the total cost of their solar system installation on their federal taxes.

“Really just three years ago was when the door kind of opened up” Rossi said. “The price of solar has come down enough where we can start to work in areas where just a few years ago wouldn’t have penciled out for a project.”

Those areas of concentration have moved from the coasts to the middle of the country.

“California is a no-brainer for us financially” he said. “Their cost of power is extremely high and I can really make a pencil project there. But their grid is so green I don’t get a whole lot of carbon reduction from the same size project in California as I do in Oklahoma.

“While not as cost-effective in Oklahoma the carbon reduction we get from this project is quite extensive compared to the same-size project we can get elsewhere in the country.”

The utility company warned its customers their utility bill will go up because of previous storm repair costs and higher natural gas prices. Public Service Commissioner Foster Campbell still believes the power company is charging ratepayers too much.

“The price of natural gas has gone up it’s almost double we make a lot of electricity out of natural gas I can understand that but I don’t think Entergy has a lot of sympathy” said Campbell.

But fellow Public Service Commissioner Eric Skrmetta told Fox 8 TV in New Orleans that Louisiana has some of the lowest rates in the nation.

But Campbell believes rates would go down in Louisiana if Entergy didn’t have a monopoly on most of the state.

“Maybe we need to open up for competition or at least study it” said Campbell. “A lot of other people around the country have competition and they are doing better I don’t know we gotta do something.”

Baton Rouge area Public Service Commissioner Dr. Craig Greene told WAFB-TV he also wants to see more competition among utility providers. Greene says in just the last two to three weeks they’ve received more than 300 complaints about high utility bills.

Campbell says he’s upset rising energy prices are making it difficult on Louisiana families while Entergy’s stockholders and CEO see more money.

“For the last three years Entergy has been giving billion dollar dividends to its stockholders probably saw in the paper that their president went from $16-million a year to $17-million a year” said Campbell.

Entergy says it can not stop paying dividends to its shareholders.",,,,,,,,,,,,

Circuit Judge David W. Hummel Jr. who oversees cases in the tiny city of New Martinsville repeatedly told The Daily Beast it never happened. When reached by phone in March he initially professed shock at the allegations. On subsequent phone calls however his story kept changing as he claimed to recall more details about the incident.

“I did not have my 1911 at any point during that trial” he said then referring to a common type of semi-automatic pistol. “It was secreted in a drawer on the bench. I never showed my 1911 at the trial whatsoever—at any point during that trial.”

That judge is now under investigation by the state’s judiciary for violating the profession’s code of conduct according to three witnesses now sharing information with law enforcement and official communications about the investigation reviewed by The Daily Beast. The judge’s own staff has since told an investigator that the judge did in fact display his gun openly during an attorneys-only hearing and boasted about having it in his possession according to two of those witnesses.

Hummel insisted to The Daily Beast that there was no recording of the incident that would back up these accusations but two witnesses say the state investigator has acquired a videotape of the interaction.

“You don’t understand what a terrible victimization it is” said Lauren Varnado the attorney who was standing at the podium when the judge pulled out his gun. “It was pretty traumatic for multiple people. The whole trial was insane.”

“We have no power in this situation” she said. “It was way scarier than even just a normal person on the sidewalk. You need more power over us than you already have right now? That’s frightening because he could order us to do whatever. Why would you ever need to pull out a gun?”

The judge’s show of force was the culmination of months of building tension between him and Varnado’s team of corporate lawyers. The Daily Beast has reviewed hundreds of pages of court transcripts and spoken to several people involved.

As with many legal battles in West Virginia it all started with fossil fuels.

“ It was too stunning to even process it. My brain didn’t even process it until after the hearing concluded. I was on edge. I don’t know if it was loaded. ” — Lauren Varnado

Until the case settled recently Hummel oversaw a dispute involving West Virginia landowners who sued over the royalty payments they get from the natural gas giant EQT for fossil fuels extracted from the earth hundreds of feet below their property.

But the gas company’s lawyers accused the judge of never disclosing that his parents get gas company royalties that may someday pass on to him—sparking questions about a glaring conflict of interest. When the gas company’s lawyers sought to disqualify him court transcripts show he grew increasingly aggravated at Varnado and her team.

At an April 2021 court hearing in which he was asked about his family’s gas interests the transcript shows how the judge patronized EQT’s lawyers as he detailed his family tree and dismissed their concerns ranting about how his cousin “Christy” got mad at him for not recognizing her at a wedding. When the attempt to have higher state courts disqualify him failed Hummel started the next court hearing in similar fashion.

“Okay. Excellent. And I’m Judge Hummel and I have no conflicts Supreme Court said so here we are. And this time I don’t have to talk about my Aunt Rose’s numerals or which shoe I put on first or anything” he said on July 19 2021 according to another transcript.

The eventual trial was always going to be fiercely contentious. EQT cut its royalty payments nearly a decade ago shortly before the energy value of the state’s natural gas production began to overtake coal. While the state has relied heavily on the exports of coal and oil since the 1800s natural gas from the fracking of the massive Marcellus Shale underground has the promise to enrich the state.

By the time the two-week trial started in February in New Martinsville the locals were so angry at how the gas company had cut their royalties in recent years that EQT lawyers felt the need to be escorted by ex-CIA private security contractors according to three members of that team. But when lawyers on both sides were called into the century-old sandstone courthouse for a special hearing on Saturday March 12 bailiffs at the entrance surprised the legal teams with a new rule for the day.

""Trial counsel only today” they said according to three witnesses who spoke to The Daily Beast on condition of anonymity fearing potential reprisal.

Varnado’s private security guard and a paralegal were turned away. The lawyers made their way into the courtroom on the second floor. Once there according to a transcript the judge castigated the gas company’s lawyers for having private guards noting that if there were any concerns about safety “I promise you I’ll take care of them.”

“We were never told these folks were security until most recently” the judge said according to a court transcript. “I got this man here carrying a man purse which I make fun of him every damn day for wearing such a sissy-ass contraption. And I hear he has blood coagulant. I have blood coagulant up here too and I’ve got lots of guns. Like bigger ones too.”

Hummel then pulled out a black handgun from an over-the-belt leather holster beneath his robe and started waving it around the room according to Varnado and another person in the room.

Hummel then put it down on his wooden desk known as a judge’s bench and left the barrel pointing at Varnado her New York law partner David R. Dehoney and their local West Virginia attorney Jennifer Hicks.

The gun stayed there for the rest of the hearing. When the attorneys were directed to negotiate in a private room they found the handgun still waiting for them when they returned. When lawyers had to approach the judge the resting gun remained pointed at their faces.

“It’s just a violation of basic gun safety having it out like that pointing at people” Varnado said. “It was too stunning to even process it. My brain didn’t even process it until after the hearing concluded. I was on edge. I don’t know if it was loaded.”

Indeed pointing a firearm at anything but a target violates the National Rifle Association’s primary rule on gun safety which is to keep a barrel pointed away from people at all times. And the judge seems to have broken a second rule of safe gun handling which is to check whether a firearm’s chamber is empty and clear of ammunition—then say so out loud.

In the days after the hearing Varnado reached out to the FBI to report what happened. But she decided to seek help from the feds 100 miles away in Pittsburgh concerned that local law enforcement might be untrustworthy given the judge’s position of power and influence.

Varnado still feels confident that was the right move. When The Daily Beast reached out to Wetzel County Sheriff Michael L. Koontz whose deputies provide security outside the courthouse the sheriff remembered that a special hearing happened that Saturday morning—but denied any knowledge about the judge pulling out the gun.

However two sources with direct knowledge say a sheriff’s deputy who was in the courtroom that day has since confirmed to the state investigator that the judge brandished his pistol.

When reached by phone a few weeks after the episode Hummel first denied anything remarkable ever occurred.

“There is no incident… I absolutely categorically deny I had a gun that day in the courtroom” he said. “It was just me and the attorneys. I had no reason to have a firearm that day… I've never shown a gun in my courtroom to anybody. I don’t want them to know that I have it. I do not display my firearm at any time during trial.”

“My job is not to protect anyone with firearms” he said. “That’s what my bailiffs and deputy sheriffs are for.”

Minutes later the judge called back and said he now recalled having a holstered gun on him beneath his robe during the trial the previous week. But it wasn’t the 1911 pistol he said. It was a long classic-looking revolver that hails from the days of the Wild West.

“I wore the Colt Peacemaker” he said. “The Peacemaker never ever came out of the holster during that trial.”

When the judge called back a third time he acknowledged showing something to the attorneys in the courtroom that day. But he said it wasn’t a gun.

“I did pull out a small red first aid kit. But it was casual. I did show her a foiled packet and said this is blood coagulant. We have preparations for active shooter situations” he said.

In April a spokeswoman with the Supreme Court of Appeals of West Virginia told The Daily Beast that she was not aware of the gun incident. And records showed that Hummel had not been the subject of an admonishment or formal statement of charges.

But in the weeks since Judicial Investigation Commission of West Virginia investigator David Hudson has been gathering evidence about the incident asking witnesses to describe the firearm and how they felt about it being displayed by the judge according to communications reviewed by The Daily Beast.

In a signed affidavit submitted to the investigator Varnado who hails from Texas described the judge’s gun as a “Colt 45” a widely recognized pistol otherwise known as a 1911.

The judge his court clerk a secretary and a court reporter have all submitted sworn affidavits describing the events that day to the investigator court reporter Holly A. Kocher told The Daily Beast on Wednesday.

Since March the FBI’s Pittsburgh field office has repeatedly declined to confirm that a special agent there has been assigned to look into the incident. The judge did not respond to requests for comment on Wednesday.

The state judiciary citing policy declined to provide details about the ongoing ethics investigation. But its staff pointed to its website which indicates that judges who violate the rules face a one-year suspension.",,,,,,,,,

Mortgage rates are nearly double what they were a year ago reflecting the Federal Reserve's campaign to rein in inflation. But they have also been volatile including some sharp declines from week to week.

Home prices remain stuck at historic highs with bidding wars reported in some places even as the inventory of homes for sale begins to grow and housing markets across the country including some of the biggest in the states below begin to cool.

Where is everything heading? Realtor.com recently revised its 2022 forecast now calling for sales to decline by 6.7% this year. Forecasters previously called for a 6.6% increase.

Sydney's rental crisis is escalating as the cost of homes skyrockets and the number of vacant properties plummets and now domestic violence victims are facing a shortage of housing options.

An analysis of vacancy rates shows the city's south-west – including Campbelltown Liverpool and Bankstown – is facing an extremely low vacancy rate of 0.65 per cent.

Sydney's west is facing a major shortage of rentals which is impacting domestic violence victims. (9News)

Not only have vacancy rates sunk but rental prices have increased by 19.1 per cent in Sydney in the last 12 months.

Everybody's Home spokesperson Kate Colvin told 9news.com.au the low vacancy rate makes it ""really difficult"" for victims of domestic violence to find housing.

""It is a very low vacancy rate and a competitive market with a lot more people looking for rentals than there are available"" she said.

""Unfortunately real estate agents choose the highest-income household that is seeking a property and the common issue for women fleeing violence is a loss of income so then they are going to struggle to compete on income grounds.""

Everybody's Home commissioned a report in 2021 with Equity Economics which estimated 7690 women a year return to violent partners and 9120 women become homeless due to the lack of social and available housing in Australia.

Colvin said it has only gotten worse in 2022 for victims of domestic violence.

""One of the elements that have gotten worse is low vacancy rates but the other problem is the cost of renting is going up but the income isn't going up"" she said.

Data shows Sydney's south-west has already recorded an 11 per cent annual increase in rent with the average asking rent pushing $500.

Out of almost 30000 rental properties only 196 are vacant.

*Data from SQM analysed by Everybody's Home

Domestic Violence Service Management works in Sydney's west to provide housing to people experiencing domestic and family violence.

General manager Sally Grimsley Ballard said staff and clients are facing an uphill battle to find and provide affordable housing due to the limited rental vacancies and surging prices across Greater Sydney.

""Many of our clients have struggled to find and be approved for properties due to the high cost of rentals when on a low income"" she said.

""The time spent looking for a suitable property has increased.

""The recent mortgage interest rate rises are further exacerbating the challenges with increases being passed straight onto the renters meaning the majority of rental properties are now unaffordable.""

Grimsley Ballard added the homes that are available are in disrepair and have major mould issues.

Both Colvin and Grimsley Ballard called for all levels of government to invest in social housing to help victims of domestic violence into rentals and to prevent homelessness.

Colvin said victims of domestic violence are often not accepted by rental properties however social housing can fill that gap.

""There isn't enough social housing to go around you can be waiting months or years to get into a social housing program"" she said.

""Australians expect if women and children are fleeing there should be somewhere for them to go.""

Kate Colvin from Everybody's Home said more social housing is needed for domestic violence survivors. (9News)

She referenced the recent report by researcher Anne Summers which found one in eight women who are fleeing family violence have spent time sleeping in their car on the street or in tents.

""Her research showed around 90000 women who were experiencing family violence had never left but wanted to and nearly half about 45000 the reason they didn't leave is that they didn't have the money or there was nowhere to go"" Colvin added.

To prevent victims of domestic violence from becoming homeless Colvin said the government needs to invest in 25000 social housing complexes across the country per year.",,,,,,

“Webb’s image is approximately the size of a grain of sand held at arm’s length a tiny sliver of the vast universe” NASA said.

The JWST considered a successor to the Hubble Space Telescope captured the galaxies shown in Webb’s First Deep Field over the course of 12.5 hours.

In what seems like a similarly short timespan images taken by the telescope have sprung up on light-up signs sweatshirts fanny packs and mugs. Other renowned space images like the Pillars of Creation have similarly become a fixture on products: jigsaw puzzles pillow cases jewelry and all sorts of other trinkets.

Retailers are free to use these images because they exist in the public domain. NASA images — along with videos audio and other content — are typically not copyrighted according to the agency’s website.

How changes in manufacturing changed online shops

On-demand manufacturing a production model has enabled some online sellers to become more nimble than ever creating listings within days. They don’t have to worry about how many items to pre-order or whether they’ll be able to sell all of their inventory.

Within 48 hours after Webb’s First Deep Field was unveiled the online store StemCell Science Shop listed a fanny pack and sweatshirt featuring the image. It also announced that it would give away free Deep Field posters with every purchase this week.

“Just in the same way that a magazine might jump on the latest gossip news or an app might jump on the latest software update it’s our responsibility to jump on the latest scientific observations” said Terry Mudge the owner of StemCell ScienceShop a five-staff-member operation that also has an Etsy store.

Mudge opened up his store back in 2015 inspired by his love of science. Growing up he recalls being captivated by a book filled with images from the Hubble Space Telescope.

The store uses a made-to-order manufacturer called Gooten named after the inventor of the printing press Johannes Gutenberg. Gooten is one in a series of companies that offer these services including Printful CustomCat and Prodigi.

Companies such as Gooten will print the fabric cut it assemble the product made-to-order and then ship it directly to customers.

“This has been really great for businesses like mine that want to offer apparel and everything without it being our primary revenue. It’s just sort of something fun on the side for our customers” Mudge said.

Gooten he explained allows him to do that without forcing his shop to pre-purchase large amounts of merchandise in advance. They don’t have to guess what sizes people will want and it creates less waste.

“Products ship as soon as they’re assembled which usually only takes a couple of days” Mudge said. “It’s all made in the U.S. and it prevents us from having stagnant inventory. It’s a win-win all around.”

Anna D’Elia who’s selling merchandise featuring images from the James Webb telescope also uses on-demand manufacturing to fulfill orders.

This week on her shop ProductiveSlacker she’s put up listings for mugs leggings yoga mats and bluetooth speakers that showcase both First Deep Field and the Carina Nebula which was also taken by the James Webb telescope. (The Hubble telescope has also taken images of the star-forming region but the newly released images show it in greater detail.)

While some online sellers might use on-demand companies others might have the capability to create products in-house. It’s now easier than ever to own a high-quality printer or other equipment needed to produce these products quickly said Lorynn Divita an associate professor in apparel design and merchandising at Baylor University.

“That is why so many small vendors are able to exist in this marketplace” Divita said. “Now anybody can have a shop.”

How lucrative is this market?

While a method like on-demand manufacturing is convenient for sellers it’s not necessarily profitable.

Mudge said the shop pretty much breaks even for Webb’s Deep Field products. Their team actually makes greater profits on items that aren’t made-to-order like their subscription boxes samples of elements from the periodic table and fossils.

“But it’s always fun to have some extra trending things like the Webb Deep Field available” he said.

D’Elia who just launched her shop last year said it hasn’t been that lucrative so far. The New Jersey-based resident works as a school counselor and runs her shop as a side hobby.

So far she’s raked in about $2500 in profits. “I would love to do this for a living. But I don’t think I could live off of Etsy” D’Elia said.

It’s not the most profitable venture but those online sellers who use public domain images avoid the risks that come with improperly using copyrighted material.

“It definitely is a safe market” Divita said. “If they’re found guilty of copyright infringement they might have to pay damages as well as attorney fees and court costs. And for a small vendor like an Etsy vendor that could bankrupt them.”

There will be plenty more images of space to come — this is only the start for the James Webb Space Telescope.

Astronomers after seeing the telescope’s capabilities will likely have “more challenging or impressive targets” wrote Brett Tingley for Space.com.

“Perhaps the biggest immediate source of value will be to scientists and science in general — it is going to propel the careers of some scientists and universities and help us discover important new facts about the universe” said Abhishek Nagaraj an assistant professor in the management of organizations group at the University of California Berkeley.

Doubling as EPCOT’s signature park symbol Spaceship Earth allows guests to “travel through time and explore the remarkable history of human communication from the Stone Age to the computer age” per the ride’s description. The attraction is open to all ages.

Nathanbacon87 received such a positive response to his innovation that he replicated the product and started a shop on Etsy. He also took to Reddit to share a bit about his creative process.

On his shop aptly named SpaceshipEarthBags the bag creator shared the following update about future sales:

RESTOCKING EARLY/MID AUGUST Thank you all so much for your interest in my bags! I just ordered supplies for 11 backpacks and I plan to get to work on them as soon as I’m done visiting the mouse 🙂 No pre-sales or waitlists at the moment.

Previous sales featured bags listed for $100 USD.

Spaceship Earth’s show recently changed to a special presentation just in time for EPCOT’s 2022 Food & Wine Festival. Walt Disney Imagineering Chief Portfolio Executive Zach Riddley shared the news on Instagram this week posting the following:

Our Lighting Design team at Walt Disney Imagineering continues to explore the artistic and technical possibilities of the new Spaceship Earth lighting. For our newest limited time sequence we were inspired by the vibrant colors and strong movement in the 1991 Walt Disney Animation Studios classic “Beauty and the Beast” and infused both into the programming of the show. Be on the lookout for some fun subtle easter eggs such as rising champagne bubbles and the multicolor spotlights from the finale of the song plus a special tri-color celebration to France the setting and inspiration of this tale as old as time. It is with deepest pride and greatest pleasure that we welcome you to “Be Our Guest” for an amazing new sequence inspired by the Academy-Award winning song just in time for the EPCOT International Food & Wine Festival. For the music we always enjoy the chance to put an EPCOT twist on the shows we create for Spaceship Earth. The lyrics from this song as known by heart to millions – I know I can recite them by heart every time the song comes on and I’m sure I am note alone… By blending both the original English and French versions of Be Our Guest (known in French as “C’est la Fete”) we create a unique cross-cultural experience that’s a spectacle in any and all languages.

With the SpaceshipEarthBags owner teasing additional show incorporations for his product time will tell if we’ll start to see Be Our Guest-inspired backpacks around the parks.

The stabbing occurred at 6:55 a.m. Friday in the parking lot of the SpringHill Suites Hotel at 72-322 Highway 111.

Killed were Jesus Sanchez 30 of Cathedral City and Yiyang Wu 31 of Palm Desert. They were pronounced dead at the scene shortly after deputies arrived sheriff's Sgt. Ben Ramirez said in a press release issued late Friday.

Wu was the wife of suspect Kenny Wu 34 of Palm Desert whom first responders found wounded at the scene. Ramirez said Wu was hospitalized in critical condition. He said Wu would be arrested on suspicion of murder when he is released from the hospital.

""Through the course of the investigation and video surveillance review this incident was determined to be a case of domestic violence"" Ramirez said. He did not give further details.

As of Saturday afternoon Riverside County jail records did not show Wu had been arrested.

Kenny Wu is a licensed registered nurse California state records show and his Facebook account indicated he studied at College of the Desert.

According to information on their social media accounts the couple married about 10 years ago. Yaying Wu also known as Kasey or Yaya was from Shanghai and sold jewelry on Etsy. She said on her Etsy page she had a bachelor's degree in art specializing in floral acrylic and oil paintings.

Public records show the couple owned a home less than two miles from the hotel. The small neighborhood street was quiet Saturday afternoon. There was a red convertible parked in the driveway of the Wus' home but the house was quiet and no one answered the doorbell. One neighbor said he didn't know the Wus.

Sheriff's officials did not say how Sanchez may have been associated with either of the Wus. Nor has it been disclosed if any of the three were staying at SpringHill Suites.

Through the course of the investigation and the review of video surveillance it was determined that the incident was ""a domestic violence case"" the sheriff's department said though no additional details were released.

These are the first homicides reported in Palm Desert this year. In 2021 there were three within the city limits tied for the most in a decade.

SpringHill Suites which opened in November 2019 is situated just east of Fred Waring Drive on the busy Highway 111 corridor that is sprawling with retailers and restaurants — the big box chain stores and restaurants as well as locally owned businesses.

The hotel which is under the Marriott brand is in the spot that was formerly occupied by a Fairfield Inn. Also a Marriott hotel the Fairfield Inn closed in 2014 due to major damage following an electrical fire.

Anyone with information regarding the incident is asked to call (760) 836-1600 or (951) 955-2777.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxlZ2FjeS5jb20vdXMvb2JpdHVhcmllcy9uYW1lL21pY2hlbGxlLWFkZXJob2x0LW9iaXR1YXJ5P2lkPTM1ODI0MzI50gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Michelle Aderholt Obituary - Vondel Smith Mortuary North - 2022,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.legacy.com/us/obituaries/name/michelle-aderholt-obituary?id=35824329 on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxlZ2FjeS5jb20vdXMvb2JpdHVhcmllcy9uYW1lL21pY2hlbGxlLWFkZXJob2x0LW9iaXR1YXJ5P2lkPTM1ODI0MzI50gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiQ2h0dHBzOi8vZ2lybHN0eWxlLmNvbS9zZy9hcnRpY2xlLzExNjQ3NS9tYXplLW1hemUtbWl4LXB1bml0YXBpLWNoYW7SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Bandai Has A “Tamagotchi” Perfect For Bubble Tea Lovers That Lets You Make Your Own Drinks,The bubble tea obsession is real in Asia with flavours and toppings that have gone far beyond what we started with—a simple milk tea with tapioca pearls.

The Eagles Band: A Part of Berkshire County History

PITTSFIELD Mass. — The Eagles Community Band has been performing music in the Berkshires and beyond for nearly 90 years.

In its second year back since the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic lockdown fans can look forward to free summer concerts at The Common and Springside Park as well as numerous other performances throughout the year.

""I would say they were as eager to get back to playing as they were to see their friends"" principal conductor Carl Jenkins said about the musicians. ""It was really was very special for some.""

Band manager Deanna Fraher added that people will come up to band members after performances thank them and say how they have been waiting for their return.

There are different ensembles within the band including a concert band stage band brass ensemble and trombone ensemble. The musicians try to get together at least once a week for practice.

Board President and stage band conductor James Stakenas likes that the band is a social outlet for people.

""There are some friends in the band that I've had for 30 years"" he said.

""Not all the time in the band but we've made some good friendships and we've made some great music and it's one of the things that I really like about the organization it' s social organization as much as a musical organization.""

He said the board met frequently during the worst of the pandemic to brainstorm how to keep members safe and allow them to participate.

""All the board members rallied to participate and it really was a smooth opening"" Stakenas added. ""And we've not rested we've continued to look at the numbers we continue to look at the policies.""

Musicians 12 years or older can become members and the players cover a wide range of ages. In the summer there are around 45 members and the rest of the year there are around 65.

Founded in 1936 it is the oldest continuing performance ensemble in the Berkshires. The band was originally sponsored by the Fraternal Order of Eagles Aerie 358 and became a nonprofit organization in 1993.

Fraher explained that it started as a marching unit and transitioned into becoming more of a concert band in the mid- to late 1990s. This was primarily due to the age of the members as most of the trumpet players were in their 70s and 80s.

The Eagles Band has three premier concerts: a spring concert at First United Methodist Church a free concert at the Colonial Theatre in November and a holiday concert also at the church.

""The second one and the most important one for us is the one at the Colonial on the first Friday of November"" Fraher said. ""We usually fill the house it's a free concert for anybody that attends so it gives the community a chance to come to something at the Colonial that doesn't cost them much of anything and it gives us a chance to be in a more formal concert venue.""

With the Colonial Theatre concert the band has brought in soloists to feature from different avenues.

The free outdoor concerts are called the ""Concert in The Park Series."" There will be four this summer: three at the Common under the pavilion and one at Springside.

""The summer concerts are far more of a pops-oriented kind of lighter weight music a lot of Broadway show tunes and marches patriotic tunes folk tunes"" Jenkins said. ""Anything that might be a little bit more familiar to the audience.""

Before the pandemic there were about 200 people attending the outdoor concerts. In past years the organization has played about 30 performances annually.

The band also plays one concert a year with another high school group which Jenkins said has been well received by the public school community.

When asked what their goals are for this year band members had varied answers.

Jenkins would like to see how much he can challenge the musicians with musical material. Stakenas would like this to be a growth year returning to some kind of normal building audiences and getting additional venues.

Fraher explained that the organization is looking into getting a larger rehearsal space because they have had to turn people away due to limited capacity.

As final outages were totaled the number of Delmarva Power customers impacted by severe weather was approximately 24000 a decrease from earlier estimates of more than 32000.

The contingent of resources included Delmarva Power field and support personnel and local contractors. Delmarva Power also received support from crews based at its sister Exelon companies Atlantic City Electric and PECO in Philadelphia.

“I want to express sincere gratitude to our customers for their patience and understanding especially throughout periods of extreme heat this week” said Doug Mokoid Delmarva Power region president. “Our crews along with crews from our sister utilities who joined our efforts worked around the clock to get customers restored safely and as quickly as possible. We are extremely grateful for the intricate planning outstanding teamwork and skills of all our employees contractors and other personnel which was essential to get our customers back online.”

As with all storm responses Delmarva Power took a systematic approach prioritizing repairs to equipment that would restore power to the greatest number of customers first. In the first 24 hours crews focused on addressing life-threatening safety and health situations assessing the damage and completing repairs to transmission equipment. Crews then focused on addressing main distribution lines serving large numbers of customers. The final stages were the most labor intensive and included completing repairs to secondary lines serving neighborhoods and service lines to individual homes and businesses.

The extensive damage made restoring service to customers especially complex. Responding to the storm required a significant amount of tree work by arborists who had to remove damaged and downed trees from equipment before repairs could be completed.

Storms like these demonstrate the critical importance of the reliability enhancements Delmarva Power has been implementing across its service area to help reduce outages and improve the resiliency of the local energy grid. This effort includes modernizing infrastructure such as replacing aging wood poles that are more vulnerable to storm damage with stronger state-of-the-art steel utility poles capable of withstanding winds up to 120 mph and adding greater automation on the local energy grid with new substations and equipment. For more information on reliability enhancement projects across Delmarva Power’s service area visit delmarva.com/Reliability.

This is also a timely reminder for communities to be prepared for severe weather and other emergencies. To help customers plan and prepare for an emergency Delmarva Power offers the following tips:

Keep a flashlight with fresh batteries on each floor of your home.

Identify an alternate location for you and/or your family in case of an extended outage.

Check on elderly neighbors and relatives.

Review the manufacturer’s instructions for safe operation of your generator. Do not connect a generator directly to your home’s wiring. Never use a generator indoors or any enclosed area.

Follow the advice of local emergency management officials.

Stay away from any storm damaged electrical equipment especially downed lines. You should always assume downed lines are energized. Report a downed wire immediately by calling 800-898-8042.

Do people on your team multitask in meetings or focus on the person speaking?

The answer to that question will help to demonstrate how much your organization prioritizes attention which is one of the “7 Forms of Respect” in the framework and new book of that name by Julie Pham.

Don’t worry this isn’t about setting rules. Pham is not giving advice on having laptops open or closed in meetings for example. Instead she’s providing a way to establish and communicate the priorities of different people teams and companies — defining organizational culture not by abstract concepts but by desired behaviors.

That insight is key to understanding and benefiting from the new book by Pham a Seattle-based entrepreneur marketer consultant journalist historian and former non-profit executive. It’s called 7 Forms of Respect: A Guide to Transforming Your Communication and Relationships at Work.

“One of the big misconceptions about the 7 Forms of Respect is that I’m telling people how to be respectful — that these are the seven forms and you have to be respectful in all of these different ways” Pham says. Instead she explains “you will prioritize some and deprioritize others and you might actually think of some as not being a form of respect.”

As defined by Pham the “7 Forms of Respect” are: procedure punctuality information candor consideration acknowledgement and attention.

For example on an accounting team procedure might be the most important form of respect. On an engineering team it might be candor. The idea is to communicate and understand what matters most to different people and teams.

“People say ‘Oh I don’t like the company culture” she says. “Part of that is because they actually haven’t articulated what is the company culture. … Oftentimes when people describe company culture they use these big vision words like we’re innovative we’re forward-looking. But they don’t use behavior words.”

Prioritizing desired behaviors is especially important for morale during times of great change like now Pham says. “Then it’s clear to people ‘Should I stay here? … Is this the right place for me? … Should I join this company?”

Pham who has a PhD in history from Cambridge University is known to many in Seattle tech for her past work as vice president of community engagement at the Washington Technology Industry Association. Her experience also includes running her family’s Vietnamese-language newspaper Northwest Vietnamese News in Seattle.

On this episode of the GeekWire Podcast Pham discusses the practical applications and benefits of the “7 Forms of Respect” with GeekWire co-founder John Cook.

And with the new aircraft model the British carrier wants to further personalize every customer’s trip with a focus on its premium business cabin Upper Class as well as onboard social spaces.

First announced before the pandemic Virgin Atlantic was become the first U.K. airline to order for 16 Airbus A330-900neos with an additional six as options in a deal worth $4.7 billion.

The British airline is on track to replace all of its planes replaced over a ten-year period creating one of the youngest fleets in the skies with an average age of just 5.3 years. The A330neo has an average operating range of 13334 kilometers (7200 nautical miles).

At least 19 airlines are flying the A330neo currently—including Delta Air Lines and TAP Air Portugal—with 77 aircraft delivered to-date operating 155 routes on more than 44000 revenue flights. Airbus has 273 orders globally to date flying across all six continents.

The aircraft will be exclusively powered by the Rolls Royce Trent 7000 engine drawing on more than 50 million flying hours of experience from the Trent 700 which powers the original version of the A330.

The new planes are designed to be 13% more fuel and carbon efficient than the A330-300s they will replace with a 50% eduction in airport noise exposure. With this addition Virgin Atlantic says its fleet will have improved fuel efficiency by 32% over a decade (2014-2024).

The plane’s design will also contribute to efficiency. With a “sharklet” wingtip design this new shape is touted to be faster with the neo wing offering overall greater aerodynamic efficiency with lower induced

drag and higher lift at all speeds.

The Loft is an exclusive spot for Upper Class passengers.With space for eight people customers can sit and chat grab a drink or snack from the self-service fridge-freezer connect Bluetooth headphones to the touch screens or just enjoy a change of scene mid-flight. Courtesy of Virgin Atlantic

The new aircraft will host all of Virgin Atlantic’s international cabins of service: Upper Class Premium and Economy (three tiers at Delight Classic and Light). The A330neo will offer 30 brand new Upper Class suites.

Virgin Atlantic has long wowed (and maybe even wooed) long-haul passengers with its unique social space The Loft. Open to Upper Class passengers the space fits eight people across four plush love-seats in the sky. Visitors can watch movies together on the 27-inch touch screens as well as grab a snack or a beverage (including nonalcoholic cocktails) from the self-service refrigerator and freezer (fully stocked with single-serving ice cream cups).

And just as many five-star hotels strive to be a destination and not just a place to sleep Virgin Atlantic is making a case that the flight is as much a part of the travel experience than just a way to get from point A to point B. With the Airbus 330-900neo Virgin Atlantic will debut The Retreat Suite a pair of private suites at the front of the cabin.

In what might be among the most private seating and sleeping options on a commercial airliner the seating in these suites can fully flatten out into six-foot seven-inch beds after takeoff and passengers can get much more privacy with electronic privacy dividers and fully closing aisle privacy doors.

For families or groups traveling together who opt to book the Retreat Suite seats the area can be reconfigured for social settings similar to the Loft. Each suite can fit up to four people where they can set up a celebratory dining service and/or play games and watch movies together versus individually at their seats.

While most of the focus is obviously on shiniest new amenities in premium cabins the economy cabins were not forgotten. Seating fabric was upgraded across the board and the airline sized up its seat-back screens to 13.3-inch displays—the biggest yet in Virgin Atlantic economy service—with intuitive touch screens and Bluetooth support for headphones as well as the option to use phones as remote controls. And crucially everyone has access to more USB ports and AC outlets to charge mobile devices in the air.

Delivery of the first aircraft is expected to arrive during the third quarter of 2022. Virgin Atlantic should have four new Airbus planes by February 2023 and the airline expects to receive all aircraft by the end of 2026.

Upon launch this fall the aircraft will operate on routes worldwide with bases at London Heathrow and Manchester airports. Virgin Atlantic’s A330neo’s inaugural flight to Boston is expected to takeoff in early October. Tickets will go on sale later this month.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJ1c2luZXNzaW5zaWRlci5jb20vcml2aWFuLXIxcy1yZXZpZXctZWxlY3RyaWMtc3V2LWludGVyaW9yLWNhcmdvLWFyZWEtMjAyMi030gFdaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYnVzaW5lc3NpbnNpZGVyLmNvbS9yaXZpYW4tcjFzLXJldmlldy1lbGVjdHJpYy1zdXYtaW50ZXJpb3ItY2FyZ28tYXJlYS0yMDIyLTc_YW1w?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Rivian R1S photos: Tour the luxury SUV's versatile cargo area,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='news.google.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /articles/CBMiWWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJ1c2luZXNzaW5zaWRlci5jb20vcml2aWFuLXIxcy1yZXZpZXctZWxlY3RyaWMtc3V2LWludGVyaW9yLWNhcmdvLWFyZWEtMjAyMi030gFdaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYnVzaW5lc3NpbnNpZGVyLmNvbS9yaXZpYW4tcjFzLXJldmlldy1lbGVjdHJpYy1zdXYtaW50ZXJpb3ItY2FyZ28tYXJlYS0yMDIyLTc_YW1w?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen (Caused by NewConnectionError('<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x000002185A918250>: Failed to establish a new connection: [WinError 10051] A socket operation was attempted to an unreachable network')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJ1c2luZXNzaW5zaWRlci5jb20vcml2aWFuLXIxcy1yZXZpZXctZWxlY3RyaWMtc3V2LWludGVyaW9yLWNhcmdvLWFyZWEtMjAyMi030gFdaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYnVzaW5lc3NpbnNpZGVyLmNvbS9yaXZpYW4tcjFzLXJldmlldy1lbGVjdHJpYy1zdXYtaW50ZXJpb3ItY2FyZ28tYXJlYS0yMDIyLTc_YW1w?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUWh0dHBzOi8vaG9vdmVyc3VuLmNvbS9uZXdzL21ldHJvLXJvdW5kdXAtbmV3LWFwYXJ0bWVudC1jb21wbGV4LWluLW1vdW50YWluLWJyb29rL9IBWWh0dHBzOi8vaG9vdmVyc3VuLmNvbS9hcGkvYW1wL25ld3MvbWV0cm8tcm91bmR1cC1uZXctYXBhcnRtZW50LWNvbXBsZXgtaW4tbW91bnRhaW4tYnJvb2sv?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Metro Roundup: New apartment complex in Mountain Brook,"× Expand Photo courtesy of Novare Group and Batson-Cook Development Co. Two views of Tributary Rise a new residential complex with 286 units surrounded by 100 acres of natural beauty and located off U.S. 280 in Mountain Brook near The Summit.

Getting back to nature and apartment living don’t always go hand-in-hand but a new complex near 280 in Mountain Brook promises to make that possible developers say.

That new complex is the four-story Tributary Rise with 286 units surrounded by 100 acres of natural beauty across from The Summit and developed by Novare Group and Batson-Cook Development Co. Developers describe the acreage around the complex as a nature preserve.

The apartment development is named for a tributary of the nearby Cahaba River which with the surrounding land drew the developers to the spot.

“When we originally envisioned the community it was before the adjacent Held tract which was 60 acres of woods became available” said Executive Vice President of Development Frank Reese of Novare Group. “We ended up buying that tract and were able to add the nature preserve and hiking trails as beautiful and unique amenities for Tributary Rise. That property coupled with the lake which we just restocked for fishing make this a great place to live.”

“We’re excited to bring this unique community to Birmingham in a once-in-a-lifetime setting and we look forward to welcoming all of our new residents” said Jim Borders president of Novare Group. “Our ideal resident wants to spend time outdoors for their health and wellness while remaining close to jobs entertainment and shopping.”

The Summit with retail and entertainment venues restaurants and white-collar jobs located at the corner of U.S. 280 and Interstate 459 means those urban necessities are right in the neighborhood.

Tributary Rise has studio apartments as well as 1- to 3-bedroom floor plans. The apartments include balconies “hardwood-style flooring” granite countertops and stainless appliances.

The complex has a two-story clubhouse “full of activities” according to a press release as well as a saltwater pool with a sun ledge a fitness studio covered deck parking and a lounge designed for co-working. Residents will have access to a 3-mile private hiking trail system that goes around the property.

Other amenities include a spring-fed lake with a dock called The Cove a lounging area around a lakeside firepit and kayak and paddle boat rentals.

Tributary Rise came together from a collaboration between Batson-Cook Development Co. [BCDC] a venerable real estate company focused on the Southeast and dating back to 1963 and Atlanta-based Novare Group a real estate development and investment company which has developed more than 17500 multifamily residences in the South and western U.S.

Novare Group’s work is not new to the area. The company was responsible for example for the five-story 268-unit Foundry Yards a mixed-use complex that opened in 2021 on 12th Street South in Birmingham not far from Regions Field. Novare also developed the 490-unit four-story Madison which is under construction in Madison Alabama.

BCDC is a subsidiary of Kajima U.S.A. Inc. which is itself a subsidiary of Kajima Corporation a Tokyo-based construction engineering and design firm established in 1840. BCDC also has left footprints in Alabama with a Vestavia Hills-located project Extra Space Storage on Acton Road. BCDC also partnered with Novare Group on Foundry Yards in Birmingham and the Madison in North Alabama.

""I have two of these shelves in white/oak and they're just what I was looking for. Sure they're more expensive than the units you can get at Ikea but you can tell the difference in quality. Last time my mom visited (oh pre-quarantine life) she actually asked if they came with the apartment because they fit so well in my living room."" —Chelsea Stuart BuzzFeed editor

Promising review: ""I love this shelf! I needed something tall to fill empty space and store books and plants. Each shelf is very heavy duty so I can't imagine any bowing would occur in the future unless it's got too much humidity. Before we put weight on the shelves it had gaps between itself and the wall but it balanced itself out after adding books. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND this shelf. It's definitely going to last longer than anything you could buy at Ikea and it has VERY little wasted/unusable space. Just do it! I put it together myself but I had to hold it steady/leveled while hubby secured it to the wall. It's not impossible to do alone but get a second person to at least hold it still for you."" —Mrs K3NNYB0Y

U.S. energy giant ExxonMobil has sought to emphasize continuity at the leadership handover in its Hungarian operation.

The fact that the outgoing country manager Jeroen Kirschbaum will maintain some work connections with teams based in Budapest and that the new manager Byung Kim worked in Hungary for four years 10 years ago helps. The two have also been able to attend several events in person together making the transition visibly clear.

By Kirschbaum’s own admission the change in leadership has come quicker than he expected. Postings typically last three years and he has completed two. Indeed our first interview with him was in July 2020 (see “Dealing With Uncertainty Investing in the Future” online). So how much notice did he get?

“Not much. I guess the best opportunities often come somewhat unexpectedly and this was no different.” It was a similar story for Kim. “However I didn’t have to think twice about accepting the job” he says.

How did Kirschbaum process the sudden promotion? “I had very mixed emotions” he admits. “I didn’t feel like I was done here. Since May 1 Byung and I have been talking. And now I feel honestly that I can leave things in really good hands” he says.

“We spent a lot of time discussing why I felt I wasn’t done yet as part of the transition. We think very much alike; we lead very much alike. So I have full trust in that continuity of what maybe I had as a vision which was partially started by my predecessors here in Budapest; that will help with continuity in the organization.”

We’ll get Kim’s take on that in a moment but first we should understand what is taking Kirschbaum back across the Atlantic to ExxonMobil’s HQ in Houston.

Corporate Restructuring

“We’re restructuring as a corporation and have formed a new company called Product Solutions. That business combines our fuels and lubricants and all of our chemical businesses into one company the largest independent petrochemical company in the world.” Product Solutions has roughly 30000 employees. Kirschbaum will be the assistant controller a new position.

“I’ll have controller oversight over our trading businesses global marine and pipelines merger and acquisitions portfolio management and ExxonMobil’s Product Solutions activities in the Americas in general” he says. There is as the Dutch national puts it “a lot of exciting new parts of the business that I’m looking forward to.”

With a current headcount of around 2000 ExxonMobil Hungary has more than 1000 employees directly or indirectly supporting Product Solutions. That includes roles linked to projects supporting the energy transition such as biofuels (where ExxonMobil recently acquired a company in Norway that uses wood waste to produce biofuels) or advanced chemical recycling and sustainable aviation fuels.

“ExxonMobil has taken a position that we want to be a leader in the energy transition and with that the whole dynamic of the corporation has changed. So I’m excited to be part of that from a headquarters perspective but also in knowing how big Budapest’s role is within Product Solutions.”

For Kim the new business represents both change and continuity in action. “One of the benefits of having a global company that’s integrated like ours is you’re always connected. […] Today we have interactions with the business headquarters and affiliates and that’s not going to change. How things get run may change as the business evolves. And that will be determined by how the market and society demand it evolves. But the interaction really doesn’t change; I think it just grows” Kim says.

“The integration of those companies makes us really efficient; it helps us meet some of those customer needs a lot more effectively. […] In terms of how we [Budapest] interact today we’re constantly engaged” he adds.

With migrations of around 100 new jobs to Hungary progressing in support of the Product Solutions business finding new colleagues is high on Kim’s agenda.

“What we’re very happy about is that these are going to be higher complexity roles that require a higher skill set and experience. We’re really excited about the opportunity that brings to Budapest associated with the Product Solutions business.”

Circular Investments

On the various challenges surrounding human resources be that finding people retaining them upskilling providing clearly defined career paths giving Hungarians experience abroad and bringing them back for senior managerial roles Kirschbaum and Kim agree that many of the factors are interrelated and in fact circular: being good in one of those areas helps in another.

The week of our interview coincided with the official opening of the new purpose-built Budapest HQ in the Pillar office building. The presumption is that staff will spend “the majority” of their time in the office.

With its recycled rainwater and recycled fishing net carpets the office is an obvious statement of the U.S.-based firm’s engagement with Budapest. Even more important than building bricks and mortar however is developing all aspects of human resources. Growing partly from the COVID lockdowns much more emphasis is placed on mental wellbeing for example. Letting staff know “It’s OK not to be OK” as Kim says. There’s also a focus on providing equal opportunities for women and general development into leadership roles; inclusivity and engagement are the watchwords.

“I always recognized the importance of human connections. But I don’t think I fully internalized how important it is for people to feel seen and heard and to be truly seen and heard” Kirschbaum says.

Kim agrees. “This is the largest organization I’ve ever led working 20 years at the company. And I think that sitting down with Jeroen has helped and I can tell you that he dedicates a lot of time to make sure messages are clear and that the people receiving them will interpret them in the way he wants. That to me is key; when you say something you need to be able to show and demonstrate that’s what you mean.”

It is time for final thoughts. How does Kirschbaum think he leaves ExxonMobil Hungary? “We’re seeing that we have broken the glass ceiling of the traditional shared services center. And I’m really proud of the organization that they were able to do that.”

The most significant change Kim sees since he last worked in Budapest is “how much the organization has matured. The talent has grown into being able to fill some of these more senior coordination project management and advisory roles that didn’t exist 10 years ago in the business services sector. I think the biggest thing when you’re leading a large organization is to invest in people.”

Either way greenwashing is a harmful and deceitful way of advertising that a company is more sustainable than it actually is. Companies that make false claims should be held accountable. Here are 10 companies that have been caught greenwashing in various ways.

—

1. Volkswagen

A classic example of greenwashing is when Volkswagen admitted to cheating emissions tests by fitting various vehicles with a “defect” device with software that could detect when it was undergoing an emissions test and altering the performance to reduce the emissions level.

This was going on while to the public the company was touting the low-emissions and eco-friendly features of its vehicles in marketing campaigns. In actuality these engines were emitting up to 40 times the allowed limit for nitrogen oxide pollutants.

2. BP

Fossil fuel giant BP changed their name to Beyond Petroleum and publicly added solar panels on their gas stations. In December 2019 an environmental group called ClientEarth lodged a complaint against BP for misleading the public with its advertisements that focused on BP’s low-carbon energy products when more than 96% of its annual spend is on oil and gas.

3. ExxonMobil

Oil giant ExxonMobil has a long history of damaging the environment. In 1989 an Exxon oil tanker spilled 11 million gallons of crude oil into Alaska’s Prince William Sound in what was the worst oil spill in US history until the Deepwater Horizon oil spill in 2010. The Exxon oil spill covered 1300 miles of coastline and killed hundreds of thousands of seabirds otters seals and whales. More than 30 years later pockets of crude oil remain in some locations.

Recently ExxonMobil came under fire for advertising that suggested that its experimental algae biofuels could one day reduce transport emissions while it has no company-wide net zero target and its 2025 emission reduction targets do not include the vast majority of emissions resulting from its products.

4. Nestlé

In 2018 Nestlé released a statement saying that it had “ambitions” for its packaging to be 100% recyclable or reusable by 2025. However environmental groups and other critics pointed out that the company hadn’t released clear targets a timeline to accompany its ambitions or additional efforts to help facilitate recycling by consumers. Greenpeace reacted to this by releasing its own statement in which it said “Nestlé’s statement on plastic packaging includes more of the same greenwashing baby steps to tackle a crisis it helped to create. It will not actually move the needle toward the reduction of single-use plastics in a meaningful way and sets an incredibly low standard as the largest food and beverage company in the world.” In Break Free From Plastic’s 2020 annual report Nestlé along with Coca-Cola and PepsiCo were named the world’s top plastic polluters for the third year in a row.

5. Coca-Cola

In the annual report mentioned above by Break Free From Plastic Coca-Cola was ranked as the world’s number 1 plastic polluter it’s second consecutive year at the top. In 2020 the company came under fire when it announced that it would not abandon plastic bottles saying that they were popular with customers.

Despite this the company is adamant that it is making progress in tackling packaging waste. At the time a spokesperson said “Globally we have a commitment to get every bottle back by 2030 so that none of it ends up as litter or in the oceans and the plastic can be recycled into new bottles. Bottles with 100% recycled plastic are now available in 18 markets around the world and this is continually growing.”

Then in June 2021 environmental organisation Earth Island Institute filed a lawsuit against the beverage giant for falsely advertising that it is sustainable and eco-friendly despite being the largest plastic polluter in the world.

6. Starbucks

In 2018 Starbucks released a “straw-less lid” as part of its sustainability drive however this lid contained more plastic than the old lid and straw combination. The company didn’t dispute this but claimed that it is made from polypropylene a commonly-accepted recyclable plastic that “can be captured in recycling infrastructure.” Critics were quick to point out that only 9% of the world’s plastic is recycled so the company shouldn’t assume all the lids would be recycled. Further the US exports about one-third of its recycling to developing countries so it is simply passing its responsibility to poorer countries.

7. IKEA

IKEA was considered a beacon of a major corporation being sustainable before June 2020 when the furniture retailer was linked with illegal logging in Ukraine. In a report by NGO Earthsight the wood certification scheme IKEA uses Forest Stewardship Council was described as an organisation that greenwashes the timber industry. It was accused of failing to catch IKEA’s sourcing of conflict wood and act on it.

Further when IKEA built its “most sustainable store” yet in London in 2019 it did so on top of another sustainable store that was demolished after just 17 years of use.

8. Plastic Bottle Water Companies

A more subtle form of greenwashing can be seen in plastic water bottle companies like Poland Spring Evian and Deer Park that all have nature on their labels. This is laughably ironic considering that plastic water bottles are designed to be single-use and are contributing to the massive plastic waste crisis around the world.

9. Major Banks

The past several years have seen major financial institutions talking a big game about combating climate change yet these are more examples of companies exercising greenwashing strategies. JP Morgan Citibank and Bank of America have issued new “green investment” opportunities. However a report released last year by the Rainforest Action Network showed that big banks – the ones mentioned above but also including Wells Fargo Barclays Bank of China HSBC Goldman Sachs and Deutsche Bank – were still lending enormous sums to the industries that contribute the most to global warming like fossil fuels and deforestations while boasting that they’re the leaders of the green transition.

10. Fast Fashion Brands

H&M Zara and Uniqlo are among the companies that were caught greenwashing over the years. These fashion brands contribute to the massive amounts of textile waste caused by the clothing industry. According to the fashion nonprofit ReMake 80% of discarded textiles globally are incinerated or landfill-bound with just 20% being reused or recycled.

Fast fashion brands also have a habit of advertising its green initiatives widely despite it being a tiny part of its operations. For example in 2019 H&M launched its own line of “green” clothing titled “Conscious.” The company claims to use “organic” cotton and recycled polyester. However the line is nothing but a marketing tactic used to make themselves appear more environmentally friendly. When looking at H&M’s “Conscious” line its mission states: “Shop our selection of sustainable fashion pieces that make you both look and feel good.” However there is no single legal definition for marketing-friendly words such as “sustainable” “green” or “environmentally-friendly.” H&M was then criticised by the Norwegian Customer Authority for “misleading” marketing of their Conscious Collection because “the information given regarding sustainability was not sufficient especially given that the Conscious Collection is advertised as a collection with environmental benefits.”

What Can I Do?

1. On A Personal Level

Ways to approach climate action within our personal lives (hint – it evolves personal action but is not focused on small behavioural changes which whilst worthwhile will not get us there):

Joining a community can be one of the best ways to increase your impact.

First it can enable you to make hundreds of connections in one go.

Second a group of people working together can have more impact than individuals. If you are not already take action by becoming an EO Member to support our mission to encourage a billion climate activists .

If you’re a younger read ask your parents to take action by bringing your whole family on board as a Family Member.

Reflect on the concept of Effective Altruism  a project that aims to find the best ways to help others and put them into practice.

2. On A Professional Level

Ways to approach climate action within the workplace:

Maintain your career path but consider donating a portion of your income to organisations that are focused on achieving meaningful & impactful goals and call out your boss if the company or organisation you work for does not have clear policies that will result in reduced harm to the environment and a pathway to Net Zero.

Ask your boss to support EO by bringing the whole team onboard with EO company membership – and take action together.

Reconsider your career path with excellent advice here .

3. On A Political Level

Ways to approach climate action as a voter or political actor (even if you can’t vote):

Protest – make your feelings known – become a vocal and passionate advocate with friends and family (without being over pushy) of the need for climate action. We need a billion activists to turn this ship around.

Join organisations that are organising climate actions and protests locally whether in your city district or even at school.

Vote (if you can) for politicians who will champion effective climate action by governments.

Vote for parties or organisations that espouse self-reform and the adoption of ‘ Ministers of the Future ’ into government.

Managed by the Navy’s Specialized and Proven Aircraft program office (PMA-226) the F-5N+/F+ Avionics Reconfiguration and Tactical Enhancement/Modernization for Inventory Standardization (ARTEMIS) program will reconfigure the airframe and incorporate a block upgrade consisting of emerging and existing commercial technology.

The PMA-226 Adversary Team is inducting 22 repatriated former Swiss Air Force F-5E/F aircraft into the ARTEMIS modification program to meet the Navy and Marine Corps requirement to increase fleet adversary training capacity with high-altitude tactical fighters.

In addition to airframe reconfiguration the project will convert the F-5E/F engines to the Navy and Marine Corps standard F-5N/F. Once that is complete the program will integrate the block upgrade which consists of a new glass cockpit and avionics suite that uses technology found in more modern aircraft to improve safety and capability. Subsequent to this upgrade the 22 aircraft will be in the F-5N+/F+ baseline configuration.

The Milestone C decision from June 28 follows the delivery of the first prototype F-5N to the Navy in September 2021.

The Adversary Team and industry partner Tactical Air Support Inc. (Tactical Air Support) will execute the F-5N+/F+ ARTEMIS program. Tactical Air Support owns and operates F-5AT aircraft currently supporting PMA-226 tactical fighter training and has performed similar modernization and safety upgrades on its own fleet of aircraft. The company assisted in the validation of the block upgrade F-5N+/F+ configuration on two of the prototype Navy F-5Ns completed earlier this year the navy said.

Capt. Gregory Sutton PMA-226 program manager said “This program will provide a fleet of upgraded safe and modernized adversary aircraft providing the realistic and relevant tactical training that our aviators need to win in the fight.”

To improve and enhance aircraft safety and mission effectiveness and to meet existing and emerging requirements and obsolescence issues the ARTEMIS program integrates fully digitized avionics instrumentation and provides increased safety and capability upgrades. These upgrades will also add tactical capabilities designed to improve air-to-air training.

The F-5 fighters the US Navy acquired from the Swiss Air Force include 16 F-5Es and six F-5Fs. Is US Navy service the F-5N accommodates a pilot in a pressurized heated and air conditioned cockpit and rocket-powered ejection seat while the F-5F is a two-seat combat-capable fighter.

“PMA-226’s Adversary Team drove to a successful milestone decision by challenging norms to tailor the program requirements using a blend of commercial solutions and the lessons learned by our industry partners with a focus on desired outcomes and risk mitigation” said Boyd Forsythe PMA-226 F-5 Adversary Team lead.",,,,,,,,,,,,

""When Apple a $2.4 trillion dollar company market cap-wise rolls over it's obviously going to have a pronounced impact on the headline indices and it just reminds people that companies are buckling down because of what they're seeing out there"" said Peter Boockvar chief investment officer at Bleakley Advisory Group.

The late-day pullback follows a Bloomberg report that said Apple plans to slow hiring and spending on growth next year to deal with a possible downturn. Shares of Apple declined nearly 2.1%.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 215.65 points or 0.69% to 31072.61 — accelerating losses in the final hour of trading and erasing a 356 point jump earlier in the day. The S&P 500 fell 0.84% to 3830.85. The Nasdaq Composite declined 0.81% to 11360.05

A stock rally on Wall Street lost steam on Monday with the Dow Jones Industrial Average losing a more than 350 point gain from earlier in the session.

""People are not going to keep buying laptops every year and they're not going to replace their phone every year"" Boockvar added.

A strong earnings report from Goldman Sachs initially buoyed stocks following mixed results last week from banks JPMorgan Chase and Morgan Stanley though some on Wall Street warned investors to err on the side of caution during what's expected to be a choppy earnings season.

""We anticipate volatility to remain elevated as the market toggles between pricing recession risk and soft landing probabilities with each piece of data"" Citi's Scott Chronert said in a recent note.

On Monday Goldman Sachs posted earnings and revenue that easily beat expectations even as CEO David Solomon said during an earnings call that inflation is ""deeply entrenched"" in the economy. Shares popped 5.6% at one point before easing and ending the day with a 2.5% gain.

Strong results from its fixed income operations helped Goldman Sachs offset a drop in investment banking revenue. Bond traders at the bank generated about $700 million more revenue than expected following increased trading in interest rates commodities and currencies.

Bank of America reported quarterly revenue that beat analyst expectations with shares ticking slightly higher. IBM will post results after the closing bell.

Other major companies set to report earnings this week include Johnson & Johnson Netflix Lockheed Martin Tesla United Airlines Union Pacific and Verizon.

Earnings expectations

Despite the growing recession fears S&P 500 companies are expected to post a 4.2% year-over-year increase in second-quarter profit according to consensus analyst estimates gathered by FactSet. S&P 500 revenues are seen expanding 10.2% in the quarters according to FactSet.

Profit expectations for the full year are still high with analysts estimating S&P 500 companies will lift 2022 earnings by 9.9% data collected by FactSet show.

""We expect the results to be generally okay"" said Terry Sandven chief equity strategist at U.S. Bank Wealth Management. ""Focus will primarily be on margins and to the extent to which companies are able to pass along higher input costs that'll dictate where perhaps valuations can go.""

Energy stocks gained in the broader market index. Shares of Hess jumped 4.8%. Devon Energy gained 3.6% and Marathon Oil climbed nearly 3.5%.

Meanwhile Boeing shares dipped slightly on news that Delta Air Lines was buying 100 737 Max 10 planes. Shares of Delta jumped about 3.5%.

Less aggressive Fed?

Investors assessed the likelihood that the Fed will be less aggressive than feared at its meeting later this month. A Wall Street Journal report Sunday said the central bank is on track to lift interest rates by 75 basis points instead of the full percentage point increase forecast by some market participants.

The dollar lubricates the global economy. It is one side of about 90 percent of all foreign exchange transactions accounting for $6 trillion in activity every day before the pandemic from tourists using their credit cards to companies making major international investments.

As the world’s most important currency the dollar often rises in times of turmoil in part because investors consider it to be relatively safe and stable. The dollar has gained in recent months as inflation has soared interest rates have increased and the worries over growth have worsened. “That’s a pretty tough mix” said Kamakshya Trivedi the co-head of a market research group at Goldman Sachs.

The main way to gauge the dollar’s strength is by indexing it against a basket of currencies of major trading partners like Japan and the eurozone. By that measure the dollar is at a 20-year high after gaining more than 10 percent this year a huge move for an index that typically shifts by tiny fractions each day.

In the past week the yen sank to a 24-year low against the dollar and the euro fell to parity a one-for-one exchange rate with the dollar for the first time since 2002. But pick just about any currency — the Colombian peso or the Indian rupee the Polish zloty or the South African rand — and it has probably lost value against the dollar especially over the past six months or so.

The factors roiling the global economy partly explain why the dollar has suddenly become so much stronger.

As central bankers around the world try to tame inflation by raising interest rates the Federal Reserve is moving more quickly and more aggressively than most. As a result rates are now markedly higher in the United States than they are in many other large economies luring investors attracted by the higher returns on even relatively conservative investments such as Treasury bonds. As money has poured in the value of the dollar has increased.

“It’s a very very strong dollar” said Mark Sobel a former Treasury official who now serves as the U.S. chair of the Official Monetary and Financial Institutions Forum a think tank. The currency has been stronger on only three occasions since the 1960s.

Analysts at Bank of America estimated that more than half the rise in the dollar this year could be explained by the Fed’s comparatively aggressive policy alone.

The analysts cited its status as a haven in times of worsening economic conditions and stock market turmoil. They also said the dollar was rising because high energy prices were hitting the economies of importers including most of Europe harder than the United States which is less reliant on buying oil and gas from abroad.

“Not only are recessionary fears rising but the U.S. also looks better off than the rest of the world” said Calvin Tse a markets strategist at BNP Paribas.

While a stronger dollar can be a mixed blessing for people and companies such a sharp quick move in the value of the world’s most widely used currency can have a destabilizing effect of its own.

Americans traveling abroad this summer will find that their money goes further. “One of the only ways an American can reap the rewards of a strong dollar is by going on holiday” said Max Gokhman the chief investment officer at AlphaTrAI an asset management firm. “But even then the airfare is going to be much more expensive because of the rise in oil prices.”

Companies based outside the United States have seen their sales bolstered by the strong dollar. Burberry the British luxury goods maker said on Friday that it would add more than $200 million to its revenue this year because of movements in the currency — helping to offset a decline in sales in China where the economy is slowing.

But American companies with large international operations are taking a hit when they convert foreign sales back into dollars. Profits at both Microsoft and Nike for example have recently eroded. Apple generates more than 60 percent of its sales outside the United States; it and other tech giants which dominate many stock indexes are likely to suffer from the dollar’s strength when they reveal their latest financial results in the coming weeks.

Ben Laidler global markets strategist at eToro estimates that the rise in the dollar will shave 5 percent off the earnings growth of S&P 500 companies this year or roughly $100 billion. That’s a sizable impact given that earnings among those companies are forecast to grow around 10 percent this year according to FactSet.

Reflecting the drag companies that generate most of their revenue in the United States have performed better than rivals with more international exposure according to indexes compiled by S&P Dow Jones Indices.

Many companies and governments abroad borrow in dollars and the currency’s strength is a big problem. This is particularly true for poorer countries attracted to dollar-denominated debt as an alternative to less developed local markets. As John B. Connally a former Treasury secretary famously told his counterparts at a summit in the early 1970s “The dollar is our currency but it’s your problem.”

Likely to be most affected are countries where dollar debt represents a large portion of their gross domestic product. Paying interest to creditors in dollars has become particularly difficult for countries with rapidly depreciating currencies like Argentina and Turkey especially as interest rates on any new debt will also go up. In some cases including for Sri Lanka it has become seemingly impossible.

The dollar however has not beaten every currency this year. The rise in energy and food prices which accelerated after Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has been a boon for the currencies of countries like Angola a major oil producer; Uruguay a major food exporter; and Brazil which sells a lot of energy and agricultural commodities.

The Russian ruble perhaps surprisingly has been one of the best-performing currencies against the dollar this year. High oil and gas prices as well as capital controls imposed by Russia to keep money inside the country have propped up the official exchange rate. What little ruble-dollar exchanges that ordinary Russians are able to make are likely at a weaker rate.

Can the buck be stopped? The U.S. economy is looking shakier but as Europe faces an energy crisis Japan resists raising interest rates China’s Covid-19 lockdown policies snarl its supply chains and other countries teeter under the weight of high inflation demand for the dollar looks robust. Though it remains unclear how long.

“For now we still expect the dollar to trade on the front foot” said Mr. Trivedi of Goldman Sachs. “There might be a bit more to go but probably the largest part of the dollar move may well be behind us.”

The Bank of America analysts noted that they were “struck by our investor conversations focusing on what could lead to a peak” in the dollar’s value “as opposed to what takes it another 10 percent stronger.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiV2h0dHBzOi8vYm9ybmVvYnVsbGV0aW4uY29tLmJuL3dlbGxzLWZhcmdvLXByb2ZpdC1mYWxscy1idXktbG9hbi1ncm93dGgtYnVveXMtaW52ZXN0b3JzL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Wells Fargo profit falls buy loan growth buoys investors,"AP – Wells Fargo United State’s (United States) largest mortgage lender saw its second-quarter revenue and profit decline as rising interest rates pushed people out of the housing market.

The San Francisco bank earned USD3.1 billion in the period or 74 cents per share coming up short of the 80 cents per share forecast by analysts surveyed by data provider FactSet.

Revenue was USD17 billion down 16 per cent from last year and below the USD17.5 billion Wall Street projected. The bank had revenue of USD20.3 billion and earnings per share of USD1.38 in the same period a year ago.

Investors appeared less concerned with the bank’s topline numbers and more impressed with an eight per cent increase in loan balances however. Wells saw growth in consumer and corporate lending and new credit card products.

Wells Fargo shares climbed seven per cent in afternoon trading. This week Wells Fargo launched its fourth new credit card since the beginning of the year and it expects to offer several more rewards-based cards.

The bank said its new credit card accounts are up more than 60 per cent from a year ago and credit card spending increased 28 per cent.

Wells’ revenue from its home lending division fell by 53 per cent in the quarter as the housing market cooled in the face of rapidly rising interest rates. Mortgage loan originations including refinancing fell sharply in the quarter. The Mortgage Bankers Association reported on Wednesday that mortgage applications have declined 14 per cent from last year and refinancings are down 80 per cent.

Sales of existing homes have fallen for four straight months during what is generally the busiest time of year in real estate.

Average long-term US mortgage rates rose to 5.51 per cent this week and are expected to move even higher as the Federal Reserve continues its aggressive measures to combat four-decade high inflation.

Most economists expect the Fed to raise its benchmark lending rate by at least another half-point when it meets later this month. Last month it raised the rate by three-quarters of a point it’s biggest single increase since 1994. Wells did see an increase in interest income which jumped 16 per cent to USD10.2 billion from USD8.8 billion in last year’s second quarter.

The bank said that its non-interest income declined by 40 per cent partly reflecting a decline in deals and fewer companies going public. The bank wrote down USD576 million in losses related to its venture capital investments as the stock market continued its decline in the second quarter.

Like other big banks Wells also added to its loan-loss provisions – setting aside USD580 million to cover potentially bad loans during economic downturns.",,,

A bear market occurs when the price of an asset or index falls by 20% (or more) from its all-time high. In the stock market's case this occurs every 3.6 years on average. In 2022 both the benchmark S&P 500 index and the technology-centric Nasdaq 100 index have crossed the bear-market threshold. The selling has been broad and relentless especially for tech stocks many of which have lost more than 50% of their value. But for long-term investors that has created some interesting opportunities.

These three companies are currently worth between $900 million and $2 billion but they each have the potential to amass valuations of $5 billion by 2030. That opens the door to a significant amount of upside for investors. Here's why.

1.Upstart: implied upside of 144%

Upstart Holdings (UPST -5.56%) is an artificial intelligence company that is changing the way banks assess potential borrowers. It says its algorithm can deliver loan decisions faster and more accurately than traditional methods of assessment which have historically relied on Fair Isaac's FICO credit scoring system.

Upstart has originated $25 billion worth of loans for its 60 bank and credit union partners since it started out and it earns fees for doing so. But the company just entered the automotive loan segment which is worth about $751 billion in originations annually so it has only tapped a small slice of its potential so far. What's more Upstart could be eyeing business loans and mortgages in the future which would take its opportunity to $6 trillion each year.

Upstart is showing exceptional growth increasing its revenue by a whopping compound annual rate of 96% between 2017 and 2021. But it's set for a slowdown after cutting its 2022 revenue guidance amid challenges like rising interest rates and a weakening economy though neither of these issues are likely to last for the long term.

Upstart stock has taken investors on a rollercoaster ride. After listing publicly in December 2020 at $20 per share it rose by over 20 times to an all-time high of $401 before crashing back to Earth now trading at $24 per share. It has a $2 billion market valuation at the moment so its stock price would need to rise by 144% to $59 in order to reach a $5 billion valuation by 2030.

That's only a fraction of Upstart's all-time high and considering the company's potential that goal seems very achievable by 2030.

2. Lemonade: implied upside of 323%

Lemonade (LMND -4.46%) is another financial technology company using artificial intelligence to transform an age-old industry -- this time insurance. The company has developed a web-based bot that can interact with customers to write a quote in under 90 seconds and pay claims within three minutes -- all without human input in most circumstances.

In the two years between the first quarter of 2020 and the recent first quarter of 2022 Lemonade has more than doubled its customer base to 1.5 million and more than tripled its in-force premium from $133 million to $419 million. It comes on the back of the company's entrance into the car insurance market its newest and potentially most lucrative segment. It could be worth over $316 billion in the U.S. during 2022 alone from a pool of 198 million policyholders.

Yet despite Lemonade's strong growth its stock has collapsed by 88% from its all-time high and its market valuation now sits at a modest $1.1 billion. The company is losing quite a bit of money as it builds scale and expands its business and investors have expressed little patience for this process amid the broader tech sell-off. But as the economy improves so should the appetite for high-growth stocks.

Lemonade had a market valuation of about $10 billion at its all-time high stock price so it would have to regain half of that level to reach $5 billion. It has the potential and the growth rate to achieve that by 2030 and if it does it would deliver investors a return of 323%.

3. Redfin: implied upside of 455%

In an economic environment where interest rates are rising real estate prices will typically fall so buying Redfin (RDFN -1.88%) stock is a contrarian play. But the company might be the future of the industry and it's too cheap to ignore right now.

Redfin has built an army of 2750 real estate brokers across the U.S. and it represents 1.18% of all home sales by value. That significant scale allows the company to charge listing fees as low as 1% far cheaper than the industry-standard 2.5%. Since Redfin started it has saved sellers over $1 billion.

The company also operates an iBuying segment that purchases homes directly from willing sellers then attempts to flip them for a profit. It's a risky practice especially if real estate prices are falling and it dealt a catastrophic blow to Redfin's key competitor Zillow Group (Z -3.41%) (ZG -2.71%) last year. Thankfully Redfin's iBuying business is much smaller and it appears to have behaved less aggressively when acquiring properties so there are no signs it will suffer a similar fate at this stage.

Redfin's stock once traded at $96.59 but it has fallen 91% from that level to $8.43 today. That places its current valuation at just $900 million -- less than half of its 2021 full-year revenue of $1.9 billion. In 2022 analysts expect revenue will grow further to $2.5 billion.

Redfin stock would need to rise 455% to $47 in order to amass a $5 billion valuation and there's a case that it might be there right now if not for the uncertainty in the real estate market. But that won't last forever. As long as Redfin continues to grow steadily over the next eight years it should find the target very achievable.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVGh0dHBzOi8vbWcuY28uemEvZnJpZGF5LzIwMjItMDctMTYtdHVyYmluZS1hcnQtZmFpci1yZWFjaGVzLW5ldy1oZWlnaHRzLXVuZGVyZ3JvdW5kL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Turbine Art Fair reaches new heights — underground – The Mail & Guardian,"Top guns: Isaac Zavale’s untitled 2021 work at the cutting-edge Kalashnikovv Gallery.

For its tenth year the Turbine Art Fair (TAF) is taking art and urban design to new heights by going underground. South Africa’s emerging artists and galleries will be descending on or rather beneath Oxford Parks in Rosebank from 21 to 24 July 2022. It’s unsurprising that TAF has chosen Rosebank as its new home considering that a couple of blocks down is Joburg’s art strip at Keyes Art Mile.

TAF sews an artistic seed into the urban design of Oxford Parks which now houses famous restaurants by celebrity chef Luke Dale Roberts: The Shortmarket Club and the Test Kitchen. Above ground the Radisson Red Hotel will also house TAF’s talks and Walkabouts for visitors to cultivate a more social experience with the fair’s artists.

Make your way down the escalators through the TAF-marked entrance into a microcosm of contemporary Southern African art design and creativity. It’s not often that all these spheres of emerging creatives are found in one place intermingling making TAF 2022 the epicentre to experience this cultural and artistic melting pot in all its glory (because it truly is glorious).

Since its inception in 2013 TAF has cemented its place as the go-to event in the social and art calendar as the first accessible and affordable art fair in South Africa. Since it aims to give a platform for small-scale and emerging galleries TAF continues to empower educate entertain and sell art to those who crave it most.

Go down for the up-and-coming

A universal challenging notion of the art world is accessibility: the affordability to buy and collect art; artists ability to thrive and survive; as well as the public’s access to interacting with artists’ works. Both emerging artists and art consumers alike have remained in a more passive role to South Africa’s art world leaving a smaller dominant circle of galleries artists collectors and museums to set the agenda for the art world.

Without a platform like TAF there is a dynamic with smaller artists forming the lower part of this pyramid-like system whose peaks are largely inaccessible. For Pretoria-born artist Setlamorago Mashilo – who won the 2014 Turbine Art Fair and Sylt Emerging Artist Award (TASA) – TAF is one of the catalysts to launching an artist’s career and bringing eyes to their works.

“It’s instrumental for emerging artists. Once you’ve won [TASA] your career starts to grow so drastically” says Mashilo who is now represented by the Everard Read Gallery and has since had his art shown in Germany Japan and the Netherlands.

In 2022 the TASA is replaced by TAF Off the Grid which aims to reward these emerging artists at the top of their game who are about to blast off into the global art universe. This year’s participants include Jeanne Hoffman Yonela Makoba Dominique Edwards Bella Knemeyer and Sivan Zeffertt each bringing their own flair to the special project.

The underground art fair kicks off in the evening of Thursday 21 July with a cocktail event for VIP’s and guests to mix and mingle with each other before celebrating works of art throughout the weekend. Bringing together the best of emerging talents and quality is a balancing act yet it does not feel like anyone from the artist’s experience is left out.

Other special projects taking place at TAF that encompass an artist’s journey from studying to discovery to showcasing includes TAF Unearthed curated by Teboho Relasai TAF Capsule showcasing Kagiso Patrick Mautloa as well as the TAF Grad Show curated by Michaela Limberis and Siwa Mgoboza.

“We see this as an opportunity to support art schools in ensuring a generation of new artists. Through our special projects we showcase the work of emerging artists at the start of their careers giving them a much-needed launch pad. It is vital to keep the art ecosystem engaged and keep the conversations going” says TAF’s founder Glynis Hyslop.

The Creative Block

More than a flag pole

The talks at TAF 2022 span genre tone and aesthetic sensibilities. Discussions will be diverse with subjects such as Collecting with Purpose; Johannesburg a Melting Pot of Cultural Hubs; or Alchemy of Colour. More Than a FlagPole is a talk which explores solutions for owning South Africa’s cultural future in light of the unveiling of the department of sport arts and culture’s R22 Million flagpole coined a “monumental waste of money”.

TAF’s place in SA’s creative scene strikes the perfect balance of emerging artists and quality. As the starting place for artists and emerging galleries the fair instils togetherness where differences often reside. There is a strong focus on art’s “object production and materiality” says Hyslop. “It is a place to meet old friends and make new ones” she adds.

Mixed-media work ‘Bofula Tonki’ by Themba Msiza

Going one step further with its ethos of accessibility TAF has launched an online store for members to sign up to buy art. Art prices are notoriously secretive but for emerging artists this is not the case. TAF’s online store is a breath of fresh air in the world of being able to own pieces of art. If they give a platform for emerging artists to showcase their art then surely it should be a platform for emerging buyers to find a place to suit their taste and budget.

“The public has embraced the ethos of the Turbine Art Fair and over the years have built a long-standing trusted relationship with the fair which provides a safe and curated space in which to buy art” says Hyslop. “I have bought some fantastic pieces over the years” she laughs.

Not only is TAF the place for emerging artists to showcase their works but for galleries to showcase their collections that are carefully curated for the different spheres of the art world. The same way that each artist has their own style of creating galleries too have their own style of curating. TAF will play host to explosive galleries such as the Bubblegum Club Gallery Dream Press Kalashnikovv Gallery and Collective UNTITLD.

“It presents a space for the showcasing of established and new talent in an environment that is immersive accessible and inclusive” says Hyslop. “Turbine Art Fair provides a space for a range of galleries secondary market dealers print studios artist organisations and collectives to exhibit new emerging artists and engage with emerging and established collectors” adds Hyslop.

Home affairs but make it fashion

It wouldn’t be an art fair without dabbling in the age-old debate “is fashion art?” The African Fashion Research Institute (AFRI) and South African designer Wanda Lephoto will showcase pieces from his Home Affairs SS22 collection that explores ideas of belonging identity and movement.

“Using the lens of fashion in the space typically exclusive to fine art […] the collections reference silenced sartorial landscapes and histories and spotlight the complex realities of postapartheid South Africa. ‘Home Affairs’ is a story about South Africa’s social labels” explains Lephoto.

The well-known experience of standing in the queue at home affairs is where all become equal in a melting pot of cultural differences.

“All in one place seeking and representing different needs traditions backgrounds and histories; where foreign missions and asylum seekers mix and where freedoms of movement and identities are made possible. No matter your social status and class you have to pass through the hands of Home Affairs” says Lephoto.

The Turbine Art Fair takes place from 21 to 24 July 2022 at Oxford Parks 199 Oxford Road Rosebank Johannesburg.

Tempe police say that a FedEx truck and motorcycle crashed around 6 a.m. at the intersection of Kyrene and Elliot Road in Tempe. Detectives believe the truck was heading east and was turning to head north when it hit a motorcycle traveling west. Video from the scene showed the motorcycle tipped over in the middle of the intersection underneath the truck. Police say the motorcycle driver was announced dead at the scene. At this time impairment isn’t believed to be a factor in the crash.

Traffic in the area was restricted throughout much of the morning. No additional details have been released. FedEx released a statement regarding the accident as follows:

“Our thoughts and condolences are with those affected by this accident. We are cooperating with investigating authorities.”

A 28-year-old man distraught over a breakup with his girlfriend was arrested after police alleged he planned to shoot people leaving an event at an arena in downtown Memphis Tennessee according to authorities.

Elijah Hyman was arrested at his apartment early Saturday on a charge of commission of an act of terrorism according to a statement from the Memphis Police Department.

Hyman allegedly threatened to commit a mass shooting targeting people leaving the FedExForum in Memphis police said.

Police did not specify the date of the planned attack or the event but rapper Yo Gotti said his annual birthday bash performance at the Forum Friday night was the target.

""We were informed of a potential threat regarding an individual seeking to harm attendees leaving (the) Birthday Bash that occurred 3 hours after our show ended"" Yo Gotti a Memphis rapper whose real name is Mario Mims said in a post on Twitter Saturday. ""I would also like to thank the Memphis Police Department for their swift and proactive action in ensuring that all attendees returned home safely.""

Yo Gotti's concert ended several hours before officers responded to Hyman's apartment just blocks from the arena.

Officers initially responded to Hyman's apartment around 2:45 a.m. Saturday for an ""armed mental consumer call"" according to the police statement. Hyman was taken into custody after police spoke to him and his girlfriend officials said.

""Officers were advised that since Hyman and his girlfriend's relationship was coming to an end he wanted to kill himself and everyone he saw coming from an event being held at the FedExForum"" the Memphis police said in a statement.

Police said Hyman was detained and placed in handcuffs before being taken to a hospital for a mental evaluation and to be treated for a cut to his hand that he sustained from a broken window in his residence authorities said.

The federal Bureau of Alcohol Tobacco and Firearms and Explosives was contacted about the incident police said.

Yo Gotti who was born and raised in Memphis began staging his annual birthday bash concert in 2012. The concert had been canceled in 2020 and 2021 during to the COVID-19 pandemic.

[Photo/Xinhua]

SF Express China's leading logistics service provider plays a crucial role at the Ezhou airport much like how FedEx Express handles the majority of cargo at the Memphis International Airport.

SF Express holds a 46 percent stake in Hubei International Logistics Airport Co. Ltd. the operator of Ezhou Huahu Airport. The logistics service provider has independently built a freight transport transit center a cargo sorting center and an aviation base at the new airport. SF Express also plans to process the majority of its packages through the new airport in the future.

""As a cargo hub Ezhou Huazhu Airport will help SF Express to form a new comprehensive logistics network"" said Pan Le director of the airport's IT department.

""No matter where the destination is all SF Airlines cargoes can be transferred and sorted in Ezhou before being flown to other cities in China"" Pan said adding that such a transportation network will enable SF Express freight planes to operate at full capacity hence improving transportation efficiency.

The landlocked city of Ezhou is hundreds of kilometers away from any seaports. But with the new airport goods from Ezhou can reach anywhere in China overnight and overseas destinations in two days.

""The airport will promote the opening up of the central Chinese region and the whole country"" said Yin Junwu director of Ezhou Airport Economic Zone Management Committee adding that airline and shipping companies from the United States Germany France and Russia have already reached out to forge cooperation with the airport.

Besides cargo flights the airport also provides passenger flight services for eastern Hubei. Seven passenger routes linking Ezhou with nine destinations including Beijing Shanghai Chengdu and Kunming have started operation.

The airport has opened two cargo routes to Shenzhen and Shanghai and is scheduled to add international routes connecting with Osaka in Japan and Frankfurt in Germany within this year.

The airport is expected to open around 10 international cargo routes and 50 domestic routes by 2025 with the cargo and mail throughput reaching 2.45 million tonnes."

DOWAGIAC — The 48th annual Steve’s Run drew more than 325 people to Dowagiac for the road and trail race Friday night.

The Original Road and Trail Race was renamed “Steve’s Run” in memory of Steven Briegel a Southwestern Michigan College honors graduate who lost his fight against cancer in 1990. For the second straight year it started and finished in downtown Dowagiac. The Friday night race was the first in the event’s history.

All proceeds including 100 percent of the pledge monies are donated to SMC’s Steven Briegel Scholarship Fund and the Mayo Clinic Cancer Research Fund.

The first few years it was called the Road and Trail Race the Bud Lite Run and the Nike-Fair Store Run. After a two-year hiatus the race returned as Steve’s Run and has been run every year since.

The Original Road and Trail Race used to serve “wheat juice” to those participants who were 21 years of age and older. The beer tent returned for the 2022 edition of Steve’s Run.

The Dowagiac community continues to support the event as well as its local sponsors including presenting sponsor Fifth Third Bank Baker’s Rhapsody Imperial Furniture #staydowagiac Bakeman’s Barbers McDonald’s Family Fare Enterprise Rent-a-Car Ascension Borgess-Lee and Pepsi. Bud Distributing was also a sponsor for the 2022 Steve’s Run and provided the alcoholic and non-alcoholic beverages at the beer tent.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiiQFodHRwczovL3NwZWN0cnVtbmV3czEuY29tL2t5L25vcnRoZXJuLWt5L25ld3MvMjAyMi8wNy8xNS90cnV0aC0tLWluc3BpcmF0aW9uLWFydGlzdC1zaG93Y2FzZS1vZmZlcnMtd2Vla2VuZC1mdWxsLW9mLWV4aGliaXRpb25zLS1wcm9ncmFtc9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Artist showcase offers weekend of exhibitions programs,"CINCINNATI — Live artistic performances and a film festival will take place at museums across downtown Cincinnati this weekend to mark the opening of the Truth and Inspiration Artist Showcase.

What You Need To Know The Truth and Inspiration Artist Showcase opens this weekend at three different downtown Cincinnati museums



Events include a mixture of onetime and ongoing displays including a mural gallery to performances pieces to a film festival



Organizers said the pieces will lead to a mixture of emotions ranging pain and heartache to hope



Some exhibits are free but others require admission to the museum

Featuring a mix of artistic disciplines and style the works of 22 local artists aim to represent a range of perspectives on the theme of truth and reconciliation. Styles of work include visual art film music dance and children’s literature.

To mark the return of the showcase a ribbon-cutting Friday at the Cincinnati Art Museum one of the event sites. Musician Margaret Tung played selections from the work ""New Music for the Queen City and Beyond"" in the museum’s Great Hall.

The full weekend program schedule is below.

“The themes of this year’s exhibition align closely with the museum’s mission to contribute to a more vibrant Cincinnati by inspiring and connecting our communities through the power of art” said David Linnenberg the Cincinnati Art Museum’s acting director. “We hope that the show’s artwork sparks conversations among our visitors and communities.”

While there are specific events taking place at multiple locations downtown this weekend there’s also an ongoing visual art show at the Cincinnati Art Museum. Included in that exhibition are works by the following artists:

“NEW MOON” by Asha Ama

“Mood Altering” by Asha the Artist

“REST” by Darnell Pierre Benjamin

“It is Art” by Means Cameron

“12 Commandments” by Michael Coppage

“Amid Exhibition” by Iman Jabrah

“Tepozzanilli: Live Stream Transmission” by Rebecca Nava Soto

“Sanctuaries” by Michael Thompson

“Story Share” by Kailah Ware

This exhibit is open daily in the Schiff Gallery at the Cincinnati Art Museum. It will remain open through Aug. 14.

Artists involved in the showcase received support from ArtsWave a major funding source for many Cincinnati-area artists and arts organizations. The funds came from its Black and Brown Artist Program.

Organizers described Truth and Inspiration as displaying a mixture of emotions – pain and heartache skepticism and futility. But they also display hope imagination and commitment.

Started in 2020 the showcase expanded this year to three locations — the Cincinnati Art Museum the Cincinnati Museum Center and the National Underground Railroad Freedom Center. Events will take place at each site throughout the weekend.

Woody Keown the Freedom Center’s president and COO invited guests to come to visit his riverfront museum both Saturday and Sunday.

On Saturday the Freedom Center will host “Monarca - Lost Butterfly (In Memoriam)” a contemporary dance with film by Gabriel Martinez Rubio. Immediately after that will be a documentary on Japanese American’s incarceration in the United States during World War II. There will be a question-and-answer session that follows.

Keown also invited guests to visit Sunday to view artist Brent Billingsley’s ongoing mural showcase “I’m Listening…”. The piece combines art with months of conversations between officers from the Cincinnati Police Department and residents in the communities they serve.

Guests will need to pay normal admission on Saturday. Admission on Sunday is free at the Freedom Center thanks to a corporate sponsor.

Keown described the showcase as “something that can truly move our community forward” through “dialogue about equity and empathy.”

“Artists have a unique ability to stir something inside that moves you to emotion and inspires you to action” he added. “Last year’s showcase did exactly that and as you will see this year’s will be just as powerful.”

Beyond capturing the themes of “truth” and/or “reconciliation” each artist aimed to create works that involve an aspect of collaboration with community members and other partners.

The goal was to allow the public to take part in what ArtsWave described as “reconciling the moment and imagining a more just and equitable future” for the Cincinnati region. They also wanted to showcase the role the arts can play in that process.

Other project partners include City of Cincinnati Duke Energy Macy’s the Greater Cincinnati Foundation Fifth Third Bank The Jewish Foundation of Cincinnati Hard Rock Casino and Cincinnati Children’s Hospital Medical Center.

The Bank was named Oman’s Best Investment Bank for the third consecutive year while also winning the Best Bank in the Environmental Social and Governance (ESG) category.

This recognition came in addition to six other HSBC wins across the Middle East – more than any other bank in the region. HSBC is the Middle East’s Best Investment Bank and for the fourth year in a row the region’s Best Bank for Sustainable Finance.

HSBC is the only bank to have held the title of the Middle East’s Best Bank for Sustainable Finance since the award’s 2018 inauguration. Outside of the Middle East HSBC was named Asia’s Best Bank for Sustainable Finance for the fifth consecutive year and was recognised as the World’s Best Bank for Trade Finance.

Melika Betlely CEO HSBC Oman said: “These awards are evidence that we are delivering on our ambition to provide leadership in sustainable finance as well as being the ‘go-to’ investment bank globally in this region and in Oman. Whether we’re connecting Omani institutions to international markets or introducing foreign investors to local capital markets we’re creating trade opportunities while also supporting the transition to a net zero economy.”

Stephen Moss HSBC Regional Chief Executive for the Middle East North Africa and Turkey (MENAT) said: “Our aspiration to be the global leader in supporting our clients with their cross-border banking needs together with helping lead the transition to a global net zero economy are key pillars of HSBC’s strategy. Being recognised as the Middle East’s Best Investment Bank and Best Bank for Sustainable Finance is a clear reflection that we are making good progress on our stated ambition to be the preferred international banking partner for our clients.”

HSBC Oman has continuously been a core relationship bank for the Ministry of Finance providing support on debt raising plans and extending access to complex and ground-breaking financing solutions.

If that's the case – and you've got a spare $340000 sitting around – you might want to check out Living Vehicle's 2023 luxury camper. The Santa Barbara California-based company unveiled its new solar-powered fully sustainable camper trailer last month saying it's aimed at customers who want ""to travel far away from campgrounds and overcrowded RV parks.""

The 29-foot-long camper is equipped with a solar-powered energy system to fully power a mobile office pre-filled with Apple products. The company says it's also the first vehicle ever to produce its own drinkable water from thin air: The camper's atmospheric water generator made by Israeli startup Watergen pulls moisture from the air to produce 5 gallons of potable water each day.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRvbXNndWlkZS5jb20vb3Bpbmlvbi90aGlzLXNvbGFyLXBhbmVsLWlzLWEtZ2FtZS1jaGFuZ2VyLWZvci1zZWN1cml0eS1jYW1lcmFzLWJ1dC10aGVyZXMtYS1jYXRjaNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,This solar panel is a game-changer for security cameras — but there's a catch,"One of the best outdoor security cameras — and one of my personal favorites — is the Blink Outdoor. It’s small completely wireless easy to set up and inexpensive. The video quality isn’t as good as one of Arlo’s cameras but it’s plenty good enough for something that costs less than $100. It was also a super-popular Prime Day deal when it was on sale for nearly half off.

The Blink Outdoor is so versatile I use it not only to keep tabs on my house but I even use one to watch the birds in my yard.

Another great feature is that the Blink camera which runs on two AA batteries uses so little power that it can last up to two years on a charge. It’s not just hyperbole from Blink either: I’ve had these cameras around my house for a long time and have only changed them once. Still unlike many of the best home security cameras you do have to change the batteries which 1) is a minor inconvenience and 2) contributes to e-waste.

Last year though Blink came out with an accessory that would take care of both of these problems: a solar panel charging mount that would supply the Blink Outdoor with nearly limitless energy. Goodbye AA’s!

There’s only one problem: You can only get the solar panel if you buy a new Blink Outdoor camera. The camera solar charger and sync module (which you need to use the camera) cost $139 when bundled together . The camera and solar charger alone cost $129.

This is a huge disservice to current Blink camera owners and a real missed opportunity for Blink. Since they were first announced Blink owners have been asking when the solar panels will be available separately. In the question section of its Amazon listing page  a number of Blink owners have posed that very question. Two Blink representatives responded “We will be offering the Solar Panel as an individual accessory soon.”

That was October 2021. We're still waiting.

If Blink doesn’t want to take advantage of this opportunity there are others who will — and who already have: Wasserstein which makes a large number of accessories for smart home devices currently sells a third-party solar panel for the Blink Outdoor for $39.59 . While not as seamless a design as Blink’s panel Wasserstein’s panel offers more flexibility in where you can mount it so you can capture light more efficiently and place the panel where it’s more convenient.

Blink’s About Us page has a statement that it’s “proud to be an Amazon company.” Well one of Amazon’s goals is to be net-zero carbon by 2040 ; it would seem that an easy way to achieve a more sustainable future is to develop products that don’t require disposable batteries and to promote renewable energy sources.

Making a solar panel accessory available to the tens — if not hundreds of thousands of customers who have already bought a Blink camera would be one of the easiest steps the company could take. Not only would it be better for the environment but it would be better for consumers too.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmdyZWVudGVjaGxlYWQuY29tL2Jpb2Z1ZWwvY2VzLWJ1eXMtbWFkZXJhLWJpb21hc3MtcG93ZXItcGxhbnQtaW4tY2FsaWZvcm5pYS0zOTk0ONIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,CES buys Madera biomass power plant in California,"Clean Energy Systems (CES) is set to acquire the idled Madera Biomass Power Plant located in Madera County California.

CES aims to convert the existing facility into a Biomass Carbon Removal and Storage (BiCRS) facility. CES said similar projects in Fresno and Kern Counties are under active development.

The facility once converted into a BiCRS facility will convert agricultural waste biomass from local farms into a renewable synthesis gas that will be mixed with oxygen in a combustor to generate electricity and/or hydrogen.

By using biomass fuel that consumes CO2 over its lifetime to produce energy and storing the CO2 the process is designed to result in net-negative carbon emissions effectively removing greenhouse gas from the atmosphere.

The new BiCRS facility is expected to remove about 600000 tons of CO2 annually which is equivalent to the emissions from electricity use of more than 130000 U.S. homes. It will help improve air quality in the San Joaquin Valley by using approximately 400000 tons of agricultural waste annually.

CES plans to evaluate the Madera Biomass Power Plant for conversion to a BiCRS facility using CES’ oxy-fuel technology that contributes to cost-effective carbon capture. BiCRS is identified as a low-cost form of engineered carbon removal resulting in net energy production without routine emissions of nitrous oxide carbon monoxide and particulates from combustion produced by conventional biomass plants.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiQ2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNjaWVuY2VkaXJlY3QuY29tL3NjaWVuY2UvYXJ0aWNsZS9waWkvUzAwMDkyNjE0MjIwMDMwMzfSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Study on Zr Sn Pb Si and Pt doped TiO2 photoanode for dye-sensitized solar cells: The first-principles calculations,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0009261422003037 on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiQ2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNjaWVuY2VkaXJlY3QuY29tL3NjaWVuY2UvYXJ0aWNsZS9waWkvUzAwMDkyNjE0MjIwMDMwMzfSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMicWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJydXNzZWxzdGltZXMuY29tLzI1NjA0NC9iZWxnaXVtLWFwcHJvdmVzLWUyLW1pbGxpb24tZm9yLWZsb2F0aW5nLXNvbGFyLXBhbmVscy1wcm9qZWN0LWluLXdvcmxkLWZpcnN00gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Belgium approves €2 million for floating solar panels project in world-first,"Credit: Belga

On Friday the Council of Ministers approved a budget of €2 million to scale up a project involving offshore floating solar panels at sea. If successful Belgium would be the first country in the world to do this.

Nations across the EU are looking for ways to decrease the vulnerability of the European energy system and energy supply since the war broke out in Ukraine and to decrease its dependence on Russia. Belgium's North Sea is playing a pivotal role in this Minister of the North Sea Vincent Van Quickenborne said in a statement.

""The North Sea is becoming the powerhouse of our energy independence. These floating solar panels have the potential to generate an additional 1GW in the first offshore zone"" Van Quickenborne said on Friday.

""With this demonstration project our companies will once again be able to play an important pioneering role in the global development of this technology and contribute to economic growth accompanied by the creation of additional jobs.""

With the help of the €2 million budget the first phase — the Proof of Concept — will be launched this autumn in the Belgian part of the North Sea of which €1.5 million will be granted to the Royal Belgian Institute of Natural Sciences (KBIN) to realise a full-scale prototype of floating solar panels at sea and to carry out the necessary studies.

Need for (greener) energy alternatives

The idea of constructing floating solar panels at sea was already discussed last year however the current energy crisis and the situation is not expected to improve by this winter resulting in the need for the technology to scale up to commercialisation growing rapidly.

Van Quickenborne also referred to the need to adopt more green energy alternatives in the long-term in light of climate change challenges. ""Our oceans and seas are an important part of the solution. Not only by absorbing greenhouse gas emissions but even more so as a source of sustainable renewable energy.""

Earlier this year it was already announced that Belgium will be joining forces with neighbouring countries to create Europe’s largest sea-based sustainable energy plant which is expected to consist of multiple connected offshore energy projects and hubs offshore wind production at a massive scale as well as electricity and green hydrogen interconnectors.

Belgium is already ranked in sixth place globally when it comes to the number of wind turbines at sea in absolute figures and is working to triple that capacity by 2030 and even quadruple it by 2040.

Next steps

Solar panels are widely seen as a powerful tool in the switch to greener energy alternatives mainly due to the rapidly falling prices of the components and advancing technological developments for photovoltaic panels.

""It is suspected that this technology could become cost-competitive within the European energy landscape in a relatively short period of time"" the statement from Van Quickenborne read.

The launch of the Proof of Concept installation expected to happen before the end of the year should serve as a stepping stone to a future large-scale demonstration project. These will ideally be placed in the space between the existing wind turbines.

If the first step is successful the budget will be increased to €10.5 million next year to support the accelerated development of this technology the statement read."

In the spartan offices of his small private investment firm Raj Rajaratnam  former inmate 62785-054 is searching for his next big trade.All is quiet inside the townhouse in Manhattan’s East 50s -- 200 miles and a world away from the federal prison where he served seven-and-a-half years for insider trading.It’s been three years since the former hedge-fund magnate was freed from FMC Devens the medical prison west of Boston where he did time with Ponzi schemer Nicholas Cosmo AKA the “mini-Madoff” among others.His new surroundings are undoubtedly a step up. But they’re surprisingly modest for the man known as Raj-Raj the high-rolling trader who became the Ivan Boesky of his time. Nothing about this unassuming building might suggest this is where Rajaratnam -- “Sunk by Greed” and “bound for brig” the New York Post trumpeted 11 years ago -- hopes to stage a comeback maybe in more ways than one.In his heyday at his multibillion-dollar Galleon Group LLC computer screens crowded his huge curved desk monitoring markets around the globe. Here at Synamon Global LLC Rajaratnam works at a utilitarian glass-topped table that looks as if it might’ve come from Ikea. A leather satchel is tossed on the blond-wood floor behind him. A beige tapestry hangs on one white wall a red fire extinguisher nearby. The fish tank in the adjoining sunroom-workspace could stand a cleaning.Rajaratnam 65 is less fleshy than he was in his days as tabloid fodder. His temples are graying. The neat mustache is gone as are the rimless glasses but the gap-toothed smile is the same as ever. He peers into his monitor and pecks at the keyboard. Barred for life from managing other people’s money and with Galleon long since shut Rajaratnam spends his days tending his considerable personal fortune in obscurity. With about 18 people working or consulting for his family-office firm -- the name “Synamon” echoes the spice most associated with his native Sri Lanka -- he’s trading stocks investing in real estate whatever catches his eye.As much as anything Rajaratnam is looking for a shot at redemption. He’s embarked on a long lonely quest to rehabilitate his reputation or at least indict the legal system that indicted him. Ever since federal agents showed up at his pricey Sutton Place apartment in 2009 he’s maintained his innocence. His case riveted Wall Street and with reason: He ended up being convicted on all 14 counts of securities fraud and conspiracy and sentenced to 11 years one of the the harshest penalties the US has ever levied for insider trading. It was the first major insider trading case in which the government used wiretaps a tactic often used against organized crime and drug traffickers.Today Rajaratnam insists he doesn’t want to relitigate his case. But he’s been doing that a lot lately in media interviews and in a book “Uneven Justice: The Plot to Sink Galleon’’ published in December. Like Michael Milken a symbol of the greed-is-good 1980s who has successfully refurbished his reputation and been re-embraced by the global business elite Rajaratnam is also using his wealth for various philanthropic efforts particularly in his native Sri Lanka.But make no mistake: Raj Rajaratnam is unrepentant. He says he was the “fall guy” for the feds’ failure to convict any prominent bankers following the 2008 financial crisis. “I was entrapped framed unlawfully wiretapped surveilled and then made to endure a brutal and very public media lynching” Rajaratnam writes in “Uneven Justice.” Federal agents and prosecutors crossed legal lines to convict him he says. Threatened with prison employees and business contacts testified against him to save themselves he says.At FMC Devens where he was sent because he has diabetes and kidney disease he did time with murders and sex offenders – he says he tried to avoid them – and befriended drug dealers and white-collar crooks. Some fellow inmates tried to extort money from him. “That was not going to happen with me” he says.“This is a huge infrastructure that has to change” Rajaratnam says of the criminal-justice system.That’s not quite the way federal prosecutors saw things. Government authorities called Rajaratnam “a billion-dollar force of deception and corruption on Wall Street.” Tapping a network of informants across swaths of corporate America he illegally used inside information to trade stocks such as Goldman Sachs Group Inc. Google Intel Corp. and Hilton Worldwide Holdings prosecutors said. His trading generated profits or avoided losses of $72 million not quite $10 million for each year he served in prison.The explosive case exposed the trafficking in illicit information at the highest echelons of American finance. Roughly a hundred other people were eventually ensnared by insider trading cases. Most pleaded guilty or like Rajaratnam were convicted by a jury. Among those who went to prison were Rajat Gupta former global head of McKinsey & Co. and former board member for Goldman Sachs who blamed Rajaratnam for his downfall. The two were later reunited at FMC Devens where Rajaratnam says they played bridge and Scrabble together. (Gupta ??was convicted of passing tips to Rajaratnam related to Goldman Sachs and was sentenced to 2 years; he has long maintained his innocence.)“Yeah we were civil to each other” Rajaratnam says of Gupta.Rajaratnam has been far less charitable toward Preet Bharara  the former US attorney who spearheaded the government’s sweeping crackdown. Some celebrated Bharara as the Sheriff of Wall Street for aggressively going after hedge fund managers. Others accused him of letting Wall Street off the hook for the financial crisis. To hear Rajaratnam tell it Bharara used the power of his office to win at all costs and advance his own career. He mentions Bharara 325 times in his 333-page book.Bharara today says he doesn’t care what Rajaratnam thinks. In an email the former prosecutor called the hedge funder he put away possibly “the least sympathetic defendant ever.”Says Bharara: “Raj Rajaratnam was a privileged billionaire who engaged in massive insider trading and there was an avalanche of evidence to prove it.” Bharara pointed to Rajaratnam’s failure to win over jurors and judges despite an aggressive and costly defense.“Whatever fairy tales he may now tell to rehabilitate his reputation or settle scores or peddle his book Raj Rajaratnam was and is guilty. Period” wrote Bharara who was fired by Donald Trump in 2017.Still like Milken Rajaratnam may have another act yet. Anita Raghavan a former Wall Street Journal reporter who wrote a book about Rajaratnam and Gupta says that in all likelihood Rajaratnam is still a billionaire. She calls his book a “selective retelling” of the Galleon affair and says there was ample evidence at trial to convict Rajaratnam. But wealth begets wealth and also influence. In the waning days of the Trump administration Milken received a presidential pardon.For his part Rajaratnam won’t say if he’s still a billionaire.“Yes I am in many currencies -- rupees lira pesos” he jokes.Back at Synamon Rajaratnam is working with his small staff to spot investment opportunities“We invest in real estate as well as in the stock market” he says. “And so I come to work every day. Rather than having hundreds of investors we have one investor.”Galleon specialized in technology and healthcare waters Rajaratnam is still plying today. Synamon’s investments include companies in medical technology cloud computing cybersecurity and clean energy including electric vehicles. Its real estate investment business is buying residential properties in New York and in 10 states across the South he says. His employees include recent college students who are working for him as analysts. The US staff is spread among New York Pittsburgh and San Francisco. A team in Sri Lanka covers e-commerce.Ean Renaud 23 has been working for Rajaratanam since a chance five-minute encounter with him last year while meeting with another trader. Renaud is a former competitive swimmer who says he dropped out of college to launch a clothing line then worked at a start-up and traded stocks for his own account. As a rookie analyst he’s thrilled to benefit from Rajaratnam’s years of experience in finance.“You can kind of tell he’s grinning and he enjoys thoroughly what he’s talking about” Renaud said. “He hopes to see the excitement return from the other person he’s teaching.”In an online meeting the two discuss a recent downturn in the shares of Chinese electric car makers.Rajaratnam seems delighted to hear from Renaud that one XPeng Inc. is developing a flying car. Another analyst briefed Rajaratnam on Procept BioRobotics Corp. which sells equipment for robotic surgery.After the call Rajaratnam’s office is quiet again. He takes a few M&M's from a bag. ""I really have no regrets about the decisions I made"" he said. ""I'm not looking back with bitterness.""Whether Rajaratnam can pick himself up after such a spectacular fall is anyone’s guess. But he still has the money to try. The year was arrested Forbes estimated he was worth $1.3 billion. He says legal fees and fines cost him $200 million. As for what he’s worth today? “Subtract that from whatever number you think I had” he says with a laugh.",,,,,,,,,,,,

Still my friend mused it is encouraging that the cultural landscape has changed this much. As recently as 2005 a year after two-thirds of Michigan voters approved a state constitutional amendment banning same-sex marriage corporate support for gay rights was tentative. That was the year Ford Motor Co. pulled ads from LGBT media after a threatened boycott by the extreme right-wing group the American Family Association.

Now just seven years after a U.S. Supreme Court ruling found gay marriage bans in Michigan and other states were unconstitutional corporations are eager to offer visible support to the LGBTQ community.

The landscape shifted dramatically in 2020 too when businesses that had previously urged employees to stay mum on subjects such as police brutality rushed to voice support for the Black Lives Matter movement after the murder of George Floyd by Minneapolis police officers. Corporations vowed support for diversity equity and inclusion initiatives urged support for and consideration of the physical and psychological harm faced by Black employees and other employees of color.

Of course lip service isn't enough to eliminate discrimination or inequity on the basis of sexual orientation gender identity race or ethnicity. What companies say in press releases often diverges from what they do or overlook in their workplaces.

A conspicuous silence

But these shifts are welcome and overdue. Companies should support civil rights and equity for all Americans. I'm glad that the math has changed — thanks to the patient work of activists — and that corporations now judge support for LGBTQ rights and condemnation of racial violence good business.

More:Opinion: Michigan's economy headed for disaster if abortion is criminalized

Yet many of the same companies eager to speak out in favor of other civil rights movements have remained conspicuously silent in the weeks since the U.S. Supreme Court overturned its landmark 1973 ruling in Roe v. Wade the decision that declared state laws banning abortion unconstitutional.

Because a 1931 Michigan law banning abortion in almost all circumstances was never repealed abortion would have become illegal here if not for lawsuits filed in May by Gov. Gretchen Whitmer and Planned Parenthood of Michigan. Those suits asked state courts to find that the 1931 law violates Michigan's constitution.

Last month a state judge issued a temporary injunction barring immediate enforcement of the 1931 law preserving for now Michigan's abortion status quo. But in many states the demise of Roe has eliminated or dramatically limited access to abortion.

Most women even pro-choice women will never end a pregnancy and many proponents of choice say they are personally uncomfortable with the procedure.

But they believe women or anyone who is pregnant should have the right to choose. That's what unites abortion-rights advocates: belief in women's autonomy. That we not a Legislature or governor or even a court are the ones who should make decisions regarding our lives and bodies. —

So the court's decision to overturn Roe is also a blow to our autonomy the foundation of our personhood and to our ability to act as full citizens of this nation.

Controversial as apple pie

Abortion rights are often described as ""controversial."" But that's not true. Roe is popular with Americans; about two-thirds of us believe abortion should be legal. That's about the same percentage of Americans who tell pollsters they support the right to same-sex marriage and who say police violence and racism are serious problems.

Why have some businesses gauged support acceptable for this but not that?

Support is not an abstract idea. This spring and summer Reproductive Freedom for All circulated petitions to place a constitutional amendment that would affirm the right to abortion and to birth control on the ballot this fall. Organizers have collected a record-breaking 753759 signatures but must now wage a costly campaign to turn out voters this fall. Corporate contributions could make the difference.

In lieu of public support for abortion rights it has become the vogue among some corporations to announce that they will pay expenses for any employee who needs to travel out of state to obtain an abortion as though this were an acceptable substitute for the ability to obtain a safe legal abortion in one's home city or region or as though disclosing the need for an abortion to one's employer were a thing anyone wanted to do.

(It's also worth noting that women in poverty who comprise a disproportionate number of those who end pregnancies are largely left out of such offers.)

Abortion is not something any of us expect we will require — until we do. And the right to end a pregnancy is one that has always been available to Americans currently of childbearing age — a world without it is nearly inconceivable. It's all right to have complicated feelings about abortion but it's a mistake to allow those feelings to quash vocal public support for a basic human right.

Rights wither without defense and I fear that is what is happening now.

Ford Motor Company sold 54842 of its Bronco model in the first half of up from 810 a year which is a 6746% increase. Granted the Bronco was just introduced a year ago but it still shows how a popular vehicle can surge in sales based on tremendous public demand. Ford sold 915820 vehicles in the same period which demonstrates how critical the Bronco is to the total.

Ford sold five generations of Broncos from 1965 to 1996. That makes it about as old as the Mustang Ford’s flagship sports car. Ford decided to bring back the Bronco to continue to expand its highly successful crossover/SUV business.

The first Bronco was available in July of last year.



The auto media took to the Bronco immediately. It was the 2022 North American Utility of the Year.

Like most highly successful vehicles the Bronco comes in several models. The base ones are the Bronco Sport. Its lowest price point is $28815. The Bronco the second model has a bottom price point of $31300.

The price of the Bronco can skyrocket. The price of the Bronco Raptor model is $68500. Its price with extra accessories can rise to almost $75000

It is hard to say why the Bronco has done so well. The media has helped push sales. It is one of Ford’s most well-known legacy models. And it enters a market when the demand for crossovers and SUVs is extraordinarily high.

Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas has faced growing ethical concerns from critics due to his wife Ginni Thomas's political activism and participation in partisan politics — especially her support for former President Donald Trump's attempt to overturn the 2020 election.

In January Thomas held the lone dissenting opinion in the Supreme Court's order rejecting a bid from former President Donald Trump to withhold presidential records from the House select committee investigating the Capitol attack on January 6 2021.

The suit dated July 7 was filed in Montgomery County Circuit Court by family members of Mabel Amos who served as Alabama Secretary of State from 1967 to 1975 al.com reports.

According to the lawsuit the board trustees benefited personally ""using the funds in the Trust to educate their children at out-of-state expensive colleges and were not in financial need while members of Amos’ immediate family were in financial need.""

The suit seeks to remove Regions as the trustee bank and require it to pay back all distributions to the trustee children.

The suit also calls for compensatory and punitive damages.

Amos' will established a memorial trust in her name with Union Bank which eventually merged with Regions.

According to the lawsuit Regions began charging ""outrageous"" fees when oil was discovered on Amos’ property in contrast to ""reasonable"" fees when there were only natural gas wells there.

In the suit the plaintiffs claim that Regions was paid about $7000 for spending five hours a week administering the trust in 2010.

Within a year that same five hours a week cost $92736. From 2002 to 2018 the suit claims the trust paid more than $1 million in administration fees to Regions.

The number and dollar amount of scholarships also increased from $21794 through five scholarships in 2011 to $214000 among 17 scholarships two years later.

Bruce Willis returns to Nakatomi Plaza 34 years after 'Die Hard',"John McClane just can't stay away from Nakatomi Plaza.

Bruce Willis who portrayed the iconic detective in Die Hard returned to the famed high-rise building for the 34th anniversary of the film this month. The actor trekked to the top of the building (known as the Fox Plaza building) in the Century City neighborhood of Los Angeles with wife Emma Heming Willis who shared the moment on Instagram.

In the video Heming Willis interspersed clips of her husband from the film as the Tabernacle Choir's version of Beethoven's ""Ode to Joy"" from ""Symphony No. 9"" plays in the background. ""On top of Nakatomi Plaza 34 years later"" she captioned the clip.

The 1988 action thriller follows Willis' John McClane a police officer who visits his estranged wife (Bonnie Bedelia) and their daughters on Christmas Eve. He joins his wife at a holiday office party at Nakatomi Plaza the headquarters of the Japanese-owned company she works for. When terrorists take over the high-rise it's up to John to save the hostages. The success of the film resulted in four sequels.

Willis told EW in 2007 that the desire to make a film that lived up to the first one is what continually pulled him back to the role: ""The first one was always my favorite and I always wanted to go back and make a movie that tried to live up to the first one"" he said ""to make an old-school Die Hard with old-school stunts that had also been brought into the 21st century and that was able to talk about terrorism in a post-9/11 time and not be afraid to say the word 'terrorist.'""

""And at the same time"" he continued ""not dishonor the memory of the people who lost their lives on 9/11. In the first three films we say 'they're terrorists!'… but it didn't hit that inflamed nerve people have when it comes to terrorism now.""

In March Willis' family announced that he would step away from acting following an aphasia diagnosis which affects a person's ability to communicate. ""This is a really challenging time for our family and we are so appreciative of your continued love compassion and support"" his family — also comprised of ex-wife Demi Moore and their daughters Rumer Scout and Tallulah — said in a joint statement.

""We are moving through this as a strong family unit and wanted to bring his fans in because we know how much he means to you as you do to him"" the statement continued.

Hybrid watches are basically a fusion of both smartwatch and analog watch. Reason: Some people particularly those used to such watches love the looks of classic watches. These analog looks have a kind of charm that the digital ones lack. So companies like Garmin are increasingly mixing smart features with analog watches.

advertisement

The new Garmin watch is aimed at people who want to have an analog and even want some smart features. The wearable can measure your heart rate sleep quality blood oxygen level stress levels and other things. It is priced at Rs 18990. But is it worth buying under Rs 20000? Read our detailed review to find out.

Design build display

The Garmin Vivomove Sport has a classic analog watch design. Consequently it is one of those watches that you will not recognise as a digital watch unless you wear it or take a closer look at it. There are no side buttons on this wearable for navigation and the mini-OLED screen at the bottom side is hidden quite well. Garmin has done a good job of giving benefits and feel of both a smartwatch and analog timepiece here.

The device has a plastic build and it doesn't feel like an expensive watch. I believe Garmin could have offered stainless steel chassis to justify the high price of the watch and give users a more premium feel. But this doesn't mean that the Vivomove Sport isn't worth your attention. It is quite lightweight and can be worn easily day and night. The build quality is good enough. People can easily replace the silicone straps. We got the Mint color variant for review but I would advise you to go for the black model as it will match better with all of your outfits and look classy.

This is a hybrid watch. So there are certain limitations and you don't get a full fledge experience of a smartwatch. It features a very small screen which is why it is difficult to read full messages in one go. The watch is not basically for checking out all the messages or notifications. But it can be used to know when you should check your smartphone for important messages. Since this is a hybrid watch you can't reply to messages using the wearable. I had one more issue with the watch. It displays all the unread notifications or messages every time I receive a new message which is pretty annoying.

advertisement

Also there is no dedicated button to go back to any watch interface and you will have to swipe left or right which too is a bit annoying. The speaker and microphone are also missing here so you won't be able to attend calls via the wrist.

But of course it's not all bad news. Because there is a lot of goodness in the Vivomove Sport. What I liked most about this hybrid watch is that it still works even if the battery dies. Confused? Well this one has the traditional coin battery that is used on analog watches to offer at least one year of battery life. So you won't be able to use it as a smartwatch but you will be able to check the time as if you are using an analog watch. If you want to use the smart features then you will have to charge it when the battery dies.

You can flick your wrist or double tap on the bottom side of the watch to wake up the tiny screen. When the watch receives notifications or calls the analog hands automatically move to the three and nine positions and the message gets displayed on the lower side of watch. The same also happens when navigating through menus or notifications.

The display is visible enough under sunlight. There is a way to increase brightness but for that you will have to dig a little deeper into the settings menu. Speaking of which it was a bit difficult to check the time in dark as there is no backlit. Additionally I noticed a visible lag in terms of response while waking up the display. Also the touchscreen is not smudge-proof so you will have to keep cleaning it.

Performance

One of the biggest downsides of the Garmin Vivomove Sport smartwatch is that it doesn't have inbuilt GPS which is disappointing considering the price it is selling for. The wearable uses the phone's GPS to offer you data on location pace and the distance you have travelled. I did get pretty accurate data with the Garmin watch which is not usually the case with the smartwatches that support connected-GPS feature.

The step counting on this one is fine. The smartwatch registers 20-25 steps extra. But this is usually the case with most of the watches and you never really get a complete accuracy level in these activities. In addition to this the watch recorded 15 steps taken even when I was sitting in a car for about 30 minutes which shouldn't happen.

advertisement

The sleep tracking data is sometimes not accurate which was the case only a few times. I liked the fact that it even registers data of Pulse oximetry (oxygen level in your body) average heart rate and respiration rate. All this data helps offer a much idea of your health.

I found stress level tracking to be fairly accurate. In addition there is a feature called ""body battery"" where the watch shows the overall energy level of a user by analysing different kind of data that it records throughout the day. Odd naming aside -- I mean who calls the energy level of humans ""body battery"" as if we are smartphones -- I find the feature useful because it kind of shows how tired or energetic a person is. The ""Body Battery"" level of a user is calculated on the basis of sleep quality exercises and stress levels. And the body's energy levels are displayed in different values: Very low low medium and high with points.

While using the watch I was impressed by the level of detailed data the app provides. Often I come across with fitness watches and fitness bands that are not at all accurate. But the Vivomove Sport is not one them. I found it fairly accurate. The Garmin Vivomove Sport can also track a user's respiration rate fitness age as well as blood oxygen levels. It is capable of showing maximum and average heart rate data. The app provides heart rate zones and displays abnormal heart rate data in the graph. Additionally you can also swim using this watch as it is 5 ATM rated for water resistance. And not surprisingly it can also withstand showers.

Something extra

There are several smart features that work in tandem with your phone. You get to change music using the smartwatch. However the feature is not immediately visible and one will have to swipe left or right several times to access the music interface. Garmin also doesn't give an option to shuffle or change the position of each watch interface. This would have helped me in re-arranging faces as per my preference.

The watch shows weather and events if you have saved any on your calendar app in the phone. The hydration level tracking feature in my opinion is of no use. There is no option to set reminders for drinking water. The app lets you set a goal of how many cups of water you would want to have in a day. Once this is done you can update the number of cups you had in a day manually. Honestly most of users won't likely use this because they first need to remind themselves about the target they have set for the day and there is nothing ""smart"" about it.

There is also a Safety tracking feature on the Garmin Vivomove Sport. You can add any of your closed ones as an emergency contact which is a great feature because in case of some accident or if a user falls down the watch detects it automatically and notifies the emergency contact.

Battery life

Battery life isn't the strongest point of the Garmin Vivomove Sport smartwatch. I got only one day of battery life with casual usage. This included checking notifications heart rate tracking stress level monitoring step respiration and sleep tracking. The data for all this gets registered automatically. With one hour of GPS-enabled activity via the phone or non-GPS activity tracking I got less than 7-8 hours of battery life. Unfortunately there is no battery-saving mode that I would have enabled for prolonged usage.

But like I said earlier even if the battery drains out the watch becomes an analog timepiece.

Garmin Vivomove Sport review: Should you buy it?

The latest Garmin smartwatch is a good option for those who want an analog watch with some smart features too. But I feel the price is a bit too high given the features you are getting. This is not a watch for hardcore fitness enthusiasts. With this hybrid watch you will be able to check all your phone's notifications control music and measure your health as well as some basic activities. You can probably buy it when it is available with some discount offers via online channels. But otherwise there are several other options like the Fitbit Versa 3 and Apple Watch Series 3 which is available in the similar price range and will appeal to users who want a more thorough and ""smarter"" package.

In this hands-on review I turn my focus to the Garmin Forerunner 955. Packing almost everything Garmin has an offer this is a sports tracking powerhouse.

Essential reading: Best fitness trackers and health gadgets

The device was released in early June along with its lower spec brother the Forerunner 255. Packing a familiar design the 955 brought with it some novel functionality. Most of it has to do with recovery statistics which are now trickling over to other devices such has Fenix 7 and Epix 2 via firmware updates.

The Forerunner 955 is often considered to be the less premium variant of Fenix 7. And that’s a pretty fair assessment. But how does the latest iteration hold up in real life? Is it as good as its Forerunner predecessors or better?

This is my full review having used the device for more than a month now. To cut a long story short and to save you reading through this 4000 plus word article – I honestly love the watch. It is a superb device that is considerably cheaper than the Fenix 7 and Epix 2 while offering just as much and more.

The verdict

Garmin Forerunner 955 review: Design & hardware

Large 1.3 inch touchscreen looks great small bezel

Retains familiar sporty lightweight look and feel

Standard gamut of Garmin fitness & health tracking sensors

Excellent battery life – up to 15 days with typical use

Look and feel

I have owned a high-end Forerunner for some five years now. Having experimented a bit with the Garmin Vivoactive and then the Apple Watch once I tried the 935 I was sold. I’ve held on to the device since 2017 skipping the Forerunner 945 and 945 LTE. In my mind these watches just didn’t provide enough emprovements to entice me to sell my 935 and upgrade. But this time around it is different.

Having read through some of the reviews my initial fear was that the Forerunner 955 would be too bulky. The 935 is quite thick and although the 955 has slightly smaller dimensions it adds about 0.5mm of depth. But it turns out my fear was unfounded. I admit it did seem a bit odd the first few hours but the change in thickness is so fractional you don’t notice it after that.

Additionally because the display has increased from 1.2 inches to 1.3 inches the device looks more attractive. I didn’t see the point of purchasing the solar variant as I live in the UK. Those in the region will perfectly understand my line of thinking. We simply do not get enough sunshine in this country. It would be a completely pointless purchase. But if you live in a sunny region and spend lots of time outdoors – it might be an option worth considering.

Mind you you still get a bezel around the edges of the display. But it is not nearly as noticeable as the previous iterations. The screen resolution has also been upped slightly from 240 x 240 pixels to 260 x 260 pixels. This increase is entirely the result of a larger display is its not more high-res in real life.

And that’s pretty much it as far as changes. You get the same general build the same overall look the same 5 ATM water-resistance and the same lightweight feel.

If you have small wrists you may want to think twice before purchasing the 955. I would suggest going for the 945 LTE. It has the same heart rate sensor as the 955 so will in the coming months inherit all the new functionality. That one has a smaller diameter and overall dimensions. Or going for the Forerunner 255.

Sensors battery life

Under the hood of the 955 you will find the standard gamut of Garmin sensors. The full list is as follows: heart rate (including SpO2) barometric altimeter accelerometer compass gyroscope and thermometer. Of course this is the Elevate 4.0 heart rate sensor so the last word in Garmin tech.

You also get built-in support for satellite connectivity. So GPS Glonass and Galileo. But unlike its predecessors this version has support for multi-frequency or multi-band GNSS. Which makes quite a bit of difference to speed of connection and quality of signal. More about that later.

Beyond that there is on-board storage for up to 2000 songs an NFC chip for Garmin Pay along with Bluetooth ANT+ WiFi connectivity. No surprises there. Pretty much what you would expect from a high-end Garmin watch.

The Forerunner range is known for its awesome battery life and the 955 is no different. You will certainly not be charging it as often as an Apple Watch. Not even close.

The 955 can keep going for up to 15 days in smartwatch mode. This falls to 42 hours in GPS mode 80 hours in UltraTrac mode. Under ideal conditions the solar option can add an extra 5 days in smartwatch mode 7 hours in GPS mode and 30 hours in UltraTrac mode.

Some options such as multi-frequency can shrink battery life even more. Garmin is currently testing something called SatIQ. Once available this will intelligently be able to switch between different GPS modes thus preserving battery life. The functionality is currently in Beta for the Fenix 7 and Epix 2.

All in all I didn’t find the battery life to be any different between my old 935 and the 955. With a run lasting about half an hour every other day tracked with multi-band GNSS I can easily get at least 10 days from the device between charges. Top-ups are quite quick. Rest it on the charger for half an hour every few days and you’ll be above 80% most of the time.

Reading through Garmin forums I noticed that some users have noticed a battery drain issue. In my case it wasn’t the case.

Garmin Forerunner 955 review: Features

Fitness and health monitoring

Latest generation heart rate sensor

All the smarts are there for 24/7 activity tracking

Sleep tracking is still a weak point

Buy any Garmin watch these days and you’ll pretty much get the same general activity and health tracking ability. This includes things such as steps distance calories sleep heart rate blood oxygen breathing rate and more. There are no surprises there or offerings that can not be found in other brands’ devices. But all of this works well.

The 955 is no exception. It is stuffed to the brim with features. You will get a lot of graphs and information about your activities and health.

One of the benefits of purchasing the Forerunner 955 is that you get the latest generation Elevate 4.0 heart rate sensor. This insures the data is more accurate. Beyond that the sensors are pretty standard.

You will be perfectly happy with the ability of the 955 to monitor your general activity and health around the clock. Garmin has nailed this years ago and in that sense the watch is an iterative upgrade.

Limited sleep tracking ability

One negative worth mentioning is Garmin’s sleep tracking. It is the one area where the company lags behind some other brands. You will be fine if you only sleep during the night. But Garmin devices do not track naps. So if you are like me and tend to supplement your shorter than ideal nightly rest with an afternoon nap – this will not be registered. There is no fix or hack that you can make to get the watch to register a nap.

I am not sure why the company does not introduce this functionality. It is completely baffling to me. Particularly as now there’s the addition of recovery stats – which depend very much on how much sleep time you’ve put in.

The ecosystem takes some time to get used to

All the health and fitness information is viewable on the device itself and in more detail in the Garmin Connect app and the web dashboard. The ecosystem takes some getting used to and lacks a bit in user friendliness. But it time you will familiarise yourself with everything. Garmin has not really changed its app and dashboard for years now.

A few things on my wish-list includes an app that can be installed on tablets and the ability to view your stats without a live internet connection. The latter is particularly important.

It takes me back to a couple of years ago when the Garmin servers were hacked. Everyone who has had a Garmin watch at the time will remember this. For about a week we were not able to log into our Garmin accounts and view our training stats. My suggestion to people with Garmin devices is to download all their .FIT files and store them locally. Yes it requires a bit of effort – but better to be safe than sorry.

While the general health and fitness tracking ability is fine you have probably not purchased the 955 so that it can merely count your steps and track your sleep. There are much cheaper options for that. Where the Garmin Forerunner 955 shines is in its mulit-sports tracking ability. It is a device for those serious about their fitness pursuits.

Sports tracking

Dual-band GNSS is more accurate and quicker to connect

Recovery stats add a whole new dimension to your training

Native run power works well

As mentioned after 5 years of use I upgraded from my Forerunner 935 to the 955. Somehow I doubt the 955 will last me the next 5 years. I hope not. It is nothing to do with the quality of the device. My 935 is as good today as it was back in 2017. It is to do with the pace of technological progress. My prediction is that two or three years down the line we will be able to track much more with the device on our wrist. Hopefully glucose hydration lactate and more will make the cut.

For now the 955 is pretty much top of the range. Although it represents a cheaper version of the Fenix 7 which is meant to be the best Garmin has on offer (along with Epix 2) it actually outshines this device on a number of counts.

One of these is the dual-band GNSS. We’ve done a separate piece on the benefits of this. Basically it allows the device to tap into more than one satellite signal. This ensures the initial connection time is shorter and that the tracking is more accurate.

I live in central London so a heavily built-up area. With the 935 it would typically take anywhere between 30-45 seconds to obtain a GPS signal. Sometimes longer. With dual-band GNSS switched on on my 955 the signal is acquired almost instantly. In most cases it takes no more than 10 seconds.

The accuracy of tracking is better too. My post-run maps do not show me running through buildings any more which gives me much more confidence that the stats are a fair reflection of my performance. Sure it eats into battery life but I prefer to keep dual-band GNSS on.

I am also more comfortable during exercise to purely rely on the 955 heart rate sensor as the latest generation tech provides more accuracy. Previously I would almost never head out for a run without a heart rate chest strap. Now its a mix.

Mind you the sensor on your wrist will still not be as accurate as a chest strap when it comes to high intensity exercise. But for most other things it will perfectly suffice.

As a keen runner of most interest to me are the run stats. Comparing the 935 and 955 you get the same standard post-run information. The major difference are the recovery stats.

Recovery stats

These include Training Readiness and HRV Status. The stats along with dual-frequency GNSS and the latest generation heart rate sensor are the major reasons to upgrade if you have one of the older Garmin Forerunners.

At the time of launch the 955 was the only device with Training Readiness. The 255 that was unveiled alongside the device only has HRV Status. Which is the reason I opted for the 955 over the 255. If it wasn’t for that I would have purchased the 255 due to its smaller dimensions.

The recovery functionality has recently started trickling over to a number of watches including the Fenix 7 and Epix 2. It is very likely the stats will come to the Forerunner 945 LTE as well and perhaps a few other Garmin watches via firmware updates.

Training readiness

Training Readiness is something that Garmin is hoping will help it sway some of Whoop and Oura customers. It was the one big gap in training stats that the company has plugged now.

Essentially a score between 0 and 100 it quantifies your readiness to train. To arrive at its calculations Training Readiness combines info on the prior night’s sleep recovery time from the last activity HRV status stress Acute Load and your sleep history. Think of it as a simple colored gauge that shows in real-time how ready for exercise you are in any given moment.

I found that in most cases the metric is a fair representation of my ability to train. What’s more it teaches you about your body and what things are important when it comes to recovery. Sleep well and you will speed up your recovery. A poor night’s rest session on the other hand can really mess up your ability to train.

On the Forerunner 935 all I had to go by was Recovery Time. Now I have multiple figures. You’ll find out that there are instances you can train even if your Recovery Time is not down to zero.

The caveat is that for me sometimes I need to ignore the figure if I’ve had a short overnight sleep session and a long nap in the afternoon. Because this will throw the training readiness information out of whack. Which is annoying.

My hope is that Garmin will finally introduce a software update that will add nap tracking ability to its watches. Surely it cannot be too difficult to come up with this. Other companies have done it. Years ago.

HRV Status

What about HRV Status? It might seem like overkill to have this and Training Readiness.

In practice I found that both have distinct uses. While Training Readiness is all encompassing HRV Status focuses only on one aspect – your heart rate variability. This is the irregularity between the time intervals between your heart beats. The higher the figure the less fatigued you are. Yes a bit counter-intuitive.

Garmin HRV status tracks your values during the night. You get a nightly average 7 day average and longer term average (that takes about three weeks to establish). Because you get absolute values you can compare your figures with others. Also HRV Status is useful because you can track how your average values adjust over time.

Of course you still get info on Body Battery. In my mind it might be time for Garmin to retire that metric given the other information it now spits out.

Morning Report

Morning Report is also something that is new (ish). It has in fact been a feature of Garmin Lily for a while now. But the company has taken this to another level.

Each time you wake up you are served up with a bunch of information. This includes the upcoming weather your sleep quality for the previous night your Training Readiness score and more. All of this can be tweaked and tailored to your liking.

Some people are fans of the feature and I found it interesting for about a week. But after that I just switched it off preferring to simply run through the individual widgets.

Native run power

The other important addition is support for native running power. Once again we’ve done a more detailed piece on how this functions so I will not go into too much detail in this review.

To summerize – run power is expressed in Watts. It quantifies how much energy you are expending during a run and how fast you are expending it. Cyclists have been using it for years – it is only in recent times that runners have started using it.

Basically instead of looking at your heart rate you keep an eye on your run power. The metric takes into account things such as your speed terrain change form fatigue and weather. A quick look at your run power and you’ll know how hard you are pushing. It helps you better tweak your effort so that you don’t run out of gas before the finish line.

In a sense what Garmin has done with native run power is not new functionality. You could do much of this by downloading and installing the Garmin Run Power app. Plus you still need an external accessory such as the Running Dynamics Pod or one of Garmin’s heart rate chest straps such as the HRM Pro.

The novelty is that the feature is now natively built into the entire ecosystem. And you don’t need to download and install anything. Think of it as the next step up. It is a simpler more seamless solution than going through the hassle of installing the Connect IQ app.

Apple is introducing run power from the wrist with its next software upgrade Polar already has this. It is therefore just a matter of time before Garmin does the same.

I actually purchased the Running Dynamics Pod to test out the functionality. The device will only set you back around $50 so is a cheaper option than going for the heart rate chest strap (which also spits out running dynamics data). You’ll also get the benefit of additional stats which quantify your running form. This includes biomechanical measurements such as cadence stride length ground contact time and balance vertical oscillation and vertical ratio.

For run power you’ll need to set up the appropriate run power fields on your watch and you are good to go. The app also allows you to customise power zones for training.

You can view the metric in real-time on your wrist or post run in Garmin Connect or the web dashboard. The infos that you can sift through include Average Power for the duration of the recorded run Maximum Power or your highest power output during a recorded run and Wind Data (if enabled). You can also view your lap average power in your activity laps table and laps chart.

A sports training powerhouse

The Forerunner 955 is a sports training powerhouse. There’s support for an endless list of exercises both in and out of water along with permance metrics such as Real-time Stamina. You will probably end up using only a small percentage of workout features that are available.

The device also takes on some navigational functionality from the Fenix range. This is head and shoulders above what you get from other brands.

There’s support for offline full-colour maps in all regions. You can set routes with turn-by-turn directions. That way you can navigate without having to think where to turn next. This functionality is not new but it is good that it has made the Forerunner 955 cut. Create new routes or tap into third-party ones from Strava nad Komoot. You can even input a distance and then let the Forerunner automatically figure out a circular route taking you back to the start/finish line.

And let’s not forget the PacePro and Climpro on-route guidance and navigation along with the TracBack feature which allows you to retrace your steps back to your start point. The device definitely lots to offer as far as maps and routes. You will certainly not get lost along the way.

Smart functionality

A sports watch with some smart functionality

Storage for 2000 songs and Spotify support

NFC for Garmin Pay

The Forerunner 955 is a sports watch with some smart functionality. So don’t think of it as a smartwatch akin to the Apple Watch or Samsung Galaxy watch. These are meant for entirely different use scenarios.

If you are after an all-round Garmin smartwatch you are better off going for Venu 2. But even that one will lag very much behind devices from some other brands as far as smart functionality. The Garmin Connect IQ app store pales in comparison to the App Store or Google Play.

Having said that the Forerunner 955 does come with some smartwatch functionality bits and pieces which will keep the athlete happy. This includes support for all kinds of smartphone notifications weather information NFC for Garmin Pay lots of watch faces and internal storage for up to 2000 songs.

Do you really need that much space for your tunes? Probably not. But its good to know you can transfer so much music on to your device. This is done via Garmin Express so you cannot download music through Garmin Connect. You can also link up to a Spotify Premium account for offline playback.

Garmin Forerunner review: The verdict

As someone who has upgraded from the Forerunner 935 I couldn’t be more happier with my 955. It is a big step up. The device is stuffed to the brim with health and fitness tracking features.

Would I upgrade if I have the 945? Probably not. And definitely not if I have the 945 LTE as it will get most of the new functionality that comes with the 955.

Is it a perfect sports watch? No. But it is the best Garmin timepiece you can buy today when it comes to functionality and value for money. The company did not increase the price over the previous generation and should be applauded for that.

As a keen runner the highlight of the 955 for me are the new recovery stats and the dual-band GNSS functionality. Both work well and perform the functions they were designed for. Compared to that the native run power functionality feels like a bonus rather than a highlight along with the real-time Stamina metric.

Having said that the important negative for me is sleep tracking which is not something to write home about. This could easily be fixed if Garmin introduces the ability to monitor naps. The functionality is particularly important now as it feeds into the recovery stats.

Garmin Forerunner 955

Gadgets & Wearables may get a commission

Other positives worth mentioning are the functional design Garmin Pay and awesome battery life. There is also more than enough storage for music.

Buy the Forerunner 955 if you want an all-round multi-sports tracker. Or if you were considering purchasing a Fenix 7 or Epix 2 but do not want to pay an arm and a leg.

The 955 is the real deal! It is the best Forerunner yet a device for those serious about their fitness. I love every minute of training with the Forerunner 955. It allows me to analyze my performance like never before.

Another option worth considering is the Forerunner 255. For a runner it offers pretty much everything they need. The only exception is Training Readiness which is not part of the feature set. But the 255 is smaller in size and cheaper than the 955.

The Forerunner 955 can be picked up on Garmin’s website for $499 in the US and Amazon (check price). There is also a Solar version that runs an extra $100. Those that spend a lot of time outdoors and live in a sunny area may want to consider purchasing that one. If you are in two minds weather a solar watch is right for you we’ve done a separate piece on this topic.

Garmin has had a busy first half of 2022 and this is set to continue. In this article we list a bunch of watches that are likely to drop in the months ahead.

Much of this information is based on leaked information we came across earlier this year from warranty information of an authorised local distributor of Garmin products. The only other detail about the source that we will reveal is that they are located in one of the smaller regional markets. Final caveat – all we have to go by are the names of the upcoming devices – so the specs are anyone’s guess at this stage.

A busy few months

The fun started in January when Venu 2 Plus Fenix 7 and Epix 2 dropped. February was only slightly less busy with the release of Instinct 2 and Descent G1. Further wearable drops came in the form of the D2 Mach 1 in March and Tactix 7 in early April.

Then Vivosmart 5 landed. It received a mixed reception. Although the wearable packs a bigger display than its predecessor there are few other improvements. Not even built-in GPS.

Which leads to the conclusion that Garmin may be shifting its focus away from fitness bands to the more lucrative sports watch space and wellness watch space. That shouldn’t really come as too much of a surprise. Smartwatches and sports watches are higher growth categories than fitness bands. Competition is going to come from all sides and Garmin will continue to set its sights high.

Essential reading: Top fitness trackers and health gadgets

The most recent sports watch additions came in the form of the Forerunner 255 and 955. Both devices were much anticipated. The first is an update of Garmin’s popular running watch. The second is a multi-use device.

The headline grabbing upgrades were mostly to do with recovery metrics. Garmin introduced a bunch of them including HRV Status and Training Readiness. Also there is the addition of support of native running power. Not quite the solution most were hoping for as it requires you to have the Dynamics pod or one of the company’s heart rate chest straps. But progress nevertheless. Now these features are making their way over to Fenix 7 and Epix 2.

We expect the second half of 2022 to be just as busy as the start. This is very much unlike 2021 when we only saw a handful of releases. But that year was not typical due to the Coronavirus effects energy crisis in some Asian countries and chip shortages.

Garmin watches to come later in 2022

We list below Garmin watches that have a good chance of landing in the coming months. The launch window is between now and early November. After that it doesn’t make sense to release any new watches as holiday sales will already have begun. A great opportunity is IFA in Berlin. Europe’s largest tech gathering which occurs in the first week of September has served as a springboard for Garmin launches in prior years.

Garmin Vivomove Trend

We’ve got Vivomove 3 vivomove sport vivomove Luxe and a few other iterations in this series. According to the local authorised dealer listing the next one to drop will be called vivomove Trend.

An interesting choice of name. This sounds like it will be a device with some new design enhancements. Garmin has Lily Classic and Sport as devices solely designed for women. Could this be a vivomove designed especially for women?

Garmin Venu Sq 2 (but no Vivoactive 5)

Something that might come as a disappointment to a number of you – Vivoactive 5 is not on the list. We did a separate piece on why this might be the case.

Garmin seems to be pushing the Venu range of late. This is essentially the same device as Vivoactive but with a fancy AMOLED display. The device belongs in the all-purpose smartwatch category. If you’re competing against Apple something with a high-res AMOLED display is always going to be the way to go.

Venu Sq is the lower spec square brother of Venu – a general fitness device that does a bit of everything. Well it appears that the watch will get a successor in the coming months. It will be called Venu Sq 2. A barometric altimeter for floor count and longer battery life would be a nice start as far as improvements.

We suspect we have already spotted this timepiece in a recent FCC listing. What leads us to this conclusion is label information which is square in shape. Garmin does not have very many square shaped watches. There is a model without WiFi that is listed. That one would be the base version. The model with WiFi would be the Music version.

Garmin Instinct Analog

Instinct Analog is another watch we are expecting in the second half of 2022. That sounds like a hybrid watch – and Garmin already has experience in this area. But a hybrid Instinct would have an audience. It certainly sounds intriguing. Watch this space if you’re a fan of outdoor rugged watches.

Garmin Austin

Now this one is a complete mystery. On the warranty information it is listed right between the Garmin Fenix range and Tactix range. A new outdoors watch? A new take on the Epix 2? An outdoors watch specifically designed for women?

MARQ II series

Garmin’s collection of luxury sports watches – the MARQ series – is also due for an upgrade in 2022. The devices that are listed in the MARQ II series include Aviator Captain Golfer Adventurer and Athlete. The only omission from the first generation is Driver. Perhaps that one will also drop but at a later stage.

Garmin Descent S1

Rounding off this list is Garmin Descent S1. We already saw one divers watch this year that came in the form of the Descent G1. Arriving in a solar option Descent G1 has useful functions both in and out of water. Compared with the previous generation Descent G1 is nearly half the price.

Garmin has achieved some of the saving by opting for a Fiber-reinforced polymer bezel instead of a steel one along with a Monochrome MIP display. Perhaps the Descent S1 will be the fancier (and pricer) version of the same?

CHARLES Mo. (KMOV/Gray News) - Police in Missouri are investigating a violent crime spree in St. Charles that ended with an armed robber being shot and killed.

The St. Charles Police Department reports the crime spree started during the early morning hours on Saturday at a convenience store where a 26-year-old went into the business with a knife and told the clerk he was robbing her.

Police said the man held the knife to the clerk’s throat while she opened the register. He then pushed the clerk to the floor and stole money from the register. He dragged her toward the back of the store asking the location of the safe.

According to authorities the clerk did not have access to the safe so the thief forced the worker to open a second register before stealing that cash and leaving the scene.

Officials said first responders took the clerk to a hospital for lacerations on her left wrist right hand and neck.

Police said they were on their way to that scene when reports of another armed robbery came in at a Phillips 66 gas station. Officers said they found broken glass that looked like a burglary had occurred.

St. Charles police said a third burglary call then came in regarding an armed robbery at a QuikTrip convenience store where shots had been fired.

According to police arriving officers found the 26-year-old suspect shot by a customer during that attempted robbery. First responders took the suspected thief to the hospital where he later died.

Authorities said they interviewed the customer a 26-year-old man who told police he stopped at the gas station to use the restroom and buy something. However he was walking back to his car from the store when he saw a black SUV drive quickly into the parking lot.

The customer said he saw a man carrying a backpack while running into the store and threatening the clerk with a knife according to police.

Officials said the 26-year-old customer grabbed his gun and went back into the store. He then confronted the thief who grabbed for his backpack.

According to authorities the suspect reportedly told the customer “I have something for you” and came around the counter when he was shot and killed by the customer.

Investigators said the customer and the clerk were both uninjured in the incident and the suspect’s car came back as stolen in an armed robbery on Friday with stolen items also found in the vehicle.

St. Charles police did not immediately release the suspect’s identity but urged anyone with further information on the incidents to contact them at 636-949-3300.

Wade has affected millions of Americans including those attending colleges in states where abortion is currently illegal or soon will be.

Intelligent.com an online magazine focusing on education surveyed 1000 current U.S. college students attending schools in states where abortion is currently or soon-to-be illegal.

The respondents were asked about their views on abortion and whether or not they plan to continue attending school in a state where they or their partners can access a safe legal abortion.

According to the survey 45% of college students in states where abortion is illegal shared they are planning to or considering transferring.

And 22% of students in states where abortion is currently or soon-to-be illegal which includes 17 states said they’re ‘definitely’ transferring to a different school in a state where abortion is still legal.

Another 25% of students are ‘considering’ transferring to a school in a state with legal abortion. The remaining 55% have no intentions to change schools based on abortion laws.

The survey also shared these further key findings:

39% of students who identify as ‘pro-life’ are planning to or considering transferring so they can access abortion care for themselves or their partner.

55% of Democrat students and 41% of Republican students at schools in states with abortion bans are definitely or potentially transferring.

Three-fourths of pro-choice college students are ‘very concerned’ that a nationwide abortion ban is next.

1 in 5 college students plan to transfer away from schools in states with abortion bans.

Intelligent.com shared that the survey was conducted from July 1-4 and included 1000 current U.S. college students ages 18-24 attending a four-year university.

He bought a 3-D printer and began “tinkering around” with some simple print builds.Around 2012 Hills printed his first generic jet engine design off plans that he discovered online. “It was a real simple model that spun with some bearings” Hills recalls. “I thought it was cool and printed another one that I put on my desk.”As he progressed so did the degree of difficulty of his projects. Hills a sub-section manager for test enabling hardware at GE spent a half year building two six-foot Saturn V rocket replicas for the National Museum of the United States Air Force in Dayton Ohio.“I’ve been a volunteer there for 14 years and have been coming up with STEM projects for education and family events” he said. “That project gave me a lot of experience and technique.”https://youtu.be/CDA1mQjC8LEHills was interested in printing something more GE specific since his primary work for the company is building engine test hardware such as cowling doors and fan ducts for various programs including CFM International's LEAP and GE9X engines.“I really couldn’t find 3D-printed engine plans online that were GE or CFM specific so I wanted to build something that represents what I’ve worked on” he said.In June of 2021 Hills zeroed in on his next project after watching a video of the newly-announced CFM RISE Program which includes advanced new engine architectures an open fan engine. The concept does not look like conventional jet engine designs and features an advanced 14-foot diameter fan in the front with a row of non-rotating variable-pitch stators behind it.“The CFM video had a 360 degree 3D rendering of the engine. I thought it would be great to build an actual model of the open fan so I began reverse engineering the design in software for 3D printing.”Hills never printed a project without plans prior to this endeavor let alone an architecture that was so challenging. With the help of the video he was able to piece together a design from scratch. “The video gives you straight-forward images of the concept. I roughly scaled things on how big the engine would be based on what information was out there. I was able to develop a model from that” he said.Hills worked on the fan first. “It’s a real interesting fan. On older ducted fans the blades stay at a fixed pitch. For this engine since it’s unducted to get reverse thrust capabilities you have to pitch these blades and you can see they rotate on the hub. It was a challenge.”After many hours of eyeing dimensions and generating a design Hills finished his first open fan model last fall. Instead of displaying it on his desk Hills donated it to GE's Cincinnati-based Community Service Fund and the model was auctioned off for $900.Word spread quickly within GE circles about the model and eventually the news made its way to Chris Lorence a chief engineer and general manager for GE. Lorence was preparing for an industry sustainability conference in Europe and needed something to catch people's attention. There were videos to illustrate the concept but once he discovered Hills' open fan model Lorence knew it would be a great asset for the conference.In approximately 10 days Hills built another model and met Lorence just in time to hand it off for his trip. ""The paint was still drying!"" said Hills.""It turned out to be a great way to let people see what we are talking about with these technologies"" said Lorence. ""Pictures and videos are just not the same as the tactile element of being able to get up close to an engine model particularly something as innovative as the RISE open fan which is so different than what we've done historically in the industry.""Hills has not stopped building these models and continues to refine new versions. His latest build includes removable magnetic rotor blades a gearing mechanism for the stators and fan blades a more detailed core with LED lights and even jet engine sounds from audio he got of a GE90 running up and shutting down. Eventually Hills plans to design a pylon attachment that would hook on to a wing model.""One of the great things about Alex and the engineering team here at GE is they have such a passion for our product"" said Lorence. ""It goes beyond the design work and the day-to-day challenges. People here get very excited about inventing the future. Alex is a great example of how that enthusiasm can reach beyond the workplace.""*LEAP and RISE are products of CFM International is a 50/50 joint business between GE and Safran Aircraft Engines.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiKmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmdlLmNvbS9uZXdzL3RheG9ub215L3Rlcm0vODk0MdIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Electrified Aircraft Propulsion | GE News,"Reflecting on a recent visit to NASA GE Aviation President and CEO John Slattery wrote this week that decarbonizing aviation was “our industry’s moonshot.” Now GE engineers and the U.S. space agency get to work on the moonshot together.

GE is in the midst of major test campaigns for transformational combat and rotorcraft engines. GE’s XA100* adaptive cycle engine for the F-35 has demonstrated performance consistent with the U.S. Air Force’s goals for the Adaptive Engine Transition Program (AETP). This engine is expected to complete testing at a U.S. Air Force facility later this summer.

Meanwhile GE’s T901 turboshaft engine completed its First Engine to Test (FETT) campaign in late June as part of the U.S. Army’s Improved Turbine Engine Program (ITEP). The T901 is demonstrating performance in line with the U.S. Army’s goals and will re-engine the Army’s UH-60 and AH-64 fleets as well as power the Army’s Future Attack Reconnaissance Aircraft (FARA).

Additionally GE’s fielded products continue to perform for military customers around the world. The T700/CT7 turboshaft engine family offers proven reliable power for applications around the world while GE’s T408 engine powered the Sikorsky CH-53K to Initial Operational Capability (IOC) with the U.S. Marine Corps in April. Deliveries of GE’s F110 engine are ongoing for the U.S. Air Force’s F-15EX platform as well as international users. The F414-powered KF-21 Boramae’s first flight is anticipated soon and the F404 engine is readying for a historic production ramp.

Testing

GE’s second XA100 adaptive cycle engine is undergoing testing at the U.S. Air Force’s Arnold Engineering Development Complex (AEDC) in Tullahoma Tenn. Designed to fit the F-35A and F-35C with no structural modifications to either airframe GE’s XA100 has demonstrated transformational performance through testing which began in December 2020. This includes 25% better fuel efficiency 10% more thrust and significantly more power and thermal management capacity than today’s engines. Those improvements would enable 30% more range 20–40% faster acceleration and double the mission systems capability for the F-35.

The XA100 incorporates the latest in GE’s technology portfolio including Ceramic Matrix Composites (CMCs) and 3D-printed (additive) parts to help unlock game-changing performance.

“We’re proud of what we’ve accomplished to date with the U.S. Air Force on the XA100” said David Tweedie GE Edison Works’ vice president and general manager Advanced Products. “Our focus is on a strong finish to the AEDC test campaign which will demonstrate both a return on the significant taxpayer and Air Force investment in this program as well as GE’s readiness to move into a low-risk Engineering and Manufacturing Development (EMD) program.”

GE’s T901 turboshaft engine recently concluded its FETT campaign which began on March 25 2022. Testing consisted of more than 100 hours of run time in a Lynn Mass. test cell.

“The first T901 engine test campaign was successful and demonstrated performance consistent with the Army’s goals” said Tom Champion GE’s T901 program director. “That performance makes this an extremely important program for the future of Army Aviation. We’re fully focused on the coming months of testing and delivering this capability to the Warfighter.”

Performance goals for this engine include 50% more power 25% better specific fuel consumption (SFC) and improved durability and life cycle costs compared to the T700 engine. The T901 won the Improved Turbine Engine Program (ITEP) competition to re-engine the U.S. Army’s UH-60 Black Hawk and AH-64 Apache fleets in 2019. The T901 was also selected to power both Future Attack Reconnaissance Aircraft (FARA) competitive prototypes and will power the Army’s selected FARA production aircraft. GE continues working closely with the Army to deliver flight test engines later this year to support the FARA competitive prototype fly-off.

In February 2022 GE and the Army Research Laboratory began a research and development program called the Applied Research Collaborative Systematic Turboshaft Electrification Project (ARC-STEP). Included in this project is the research development testing and evaluation of a megawatt (MW) class electrified powerplant that further develops technologies applicable to Army Future Vertical Lift (FVL). Development is ongoing at GE’s research campus in Niskayuna N.Y. with a CT7 turboshaft engine.

In-production products

With more than 25000 engines delivered to date the T700/CT7 turboshaft engine family continues to represent a compelling option for proven reliable power for dozens of applications around the world.

GE powers the Leonardo AW149 and AW189 which are in service today with the CT7-2E1 engine. The CT7-2E1 has proven itself with reliable operations in harsh and maritime environments while offering lower engine weight lower fuel consumption and maintenance cost advantages compared to competing engines for the AW149. Meanwhile the T700-GE-701D for the Sikorsky S-70M Black Hawk offers decades of front-line combat experience and 100% engine commonality with the Boeing AH-64E Apache fleet currently being delivered to the U.K. Armed Forces. Thus both the CT7-2E1 and T700-701D offer a high level of commonality with an existing U.K. platform. Local sustainment for the AH-64E engine fleet will be provided by H+S Aviation in Portsmouth U.K.

GE’s powerhouse T408 turboshaft engine continues providing transformational heavy-lift capabilities for the Sikorsky CH-53K King Stallion helicopter which achieved Initial Operating Capability (IOC) with the U.S. Marine Corps in April. To date the T408 has accumulated more than 20000 ground and flight hours. The CH-53K represents a compelling offering to U.S. allies and partners as well with each T408 engine offering 57% more power 18% better specific fuel consumption and 63% fewer parts compared to the T64 engine.

The F404/F414 family of engines remains a compelling versatile and cost-effective choice for fighter and trainer platforms around the world. The F404 will see a historic production ramp to support the U.S. Air Force’s acquisition of the Boeing T-7A Red Hawk trainer jet (F404-GE-103 variant) as well as a contract for 99 F404-GE-IN20 engines for India’s HAL Tejas Mk 1/1A fighter.

Program leaders recently spent a week in Lynn Mass. the home of F404 final assembly for a lean event to prepare the line for the ramp. “We’re feeling energized following the great week we had in Lynn this June using lean tools to prepare for the F404 production ramp” said Shawn Warren GE’s vice president and general manager Combat and Trainer Engines. “The F404 production line hasn’t required this level of production in years so we’re focused on meeting the demand and building on the outstanding legacy of the F404 engine.”

Meanwhile the F414 engine is expecting milestone flights soon. South Korea’s KF-21 Boramae is expected to achieve its first flight soon powered by two F414-GE-400K engines. GE received a contract in 2016 to provide engines to Korea Aerospace Industries (KAI) for the KF-21 (then KF-X) program. NASA’s X-59 Quiet SuperSonic Transport (QueSST) is also progressing toward first flight powered by a single F414-GE-100 engine. The aircraft is designed to reduce a supersonic boom to a “thump” while also gathering data to deliver to regulators in an effort to open commercial supersonic flight over land. Additionally the F414 powers every Boeing F/A-18E/F Super Hornet in service today and would provide combat-proven reliable performance as part of the Block III Super Hornet bid for India’s multi-role carrier-borne fighter (MRCBF) program. The F414 also powers the Boeing E/A-18 Growler along with the SAAB Gripen E/F which saw its first deliveries to the Brazilian Air Force in 2021.

GE’s F110 engine was selected in October 2021 for the U.S. Air Force’s F-15EX Eagle II program. It remains the only propulsion solution certified integrated and in production for the Advanced fly-by-wire F-15 platform. The F110 continues to prove its capability and reliability worldwide powering F-15 F-16 and F-2 aircraft in service with 14 air forces. Approximately 70% of the U.S. Air Force’s F-16 Fighting Falcon fleet is powered by the F110 engine. Additionally the F110 was selected to power new F-16 Block 70 aircraft during several recent international acquisitions.

GE HealthCare will cut loose in early 2023 with a new purple brand color but the same GE monogram the company said. After its transition is complete it will be listed on Nasdaq under the symbol GEHC.

In early 2024 the firm plans to spin off its Renewable Energy Power Digital and Energy Financial Services under the brand name GE Vernova (a combination of ""ver"" from ""verdant"" and ""nova"" or ""new""); a third company comprising its aviation business will be called GE Aerospace.

GE first announced its intention to split into three separate companies in 2018 and in 2021 confirmed the plan. In a video conversation between CEO Larry Culp and GE's chief marketing officer Linda Boff Culp emphasized the importance of building on GE's long-term brand trust.

""The GE brand has tremendous intrinsic value"" Culp said. ""The decision to retain the GE name and monogram is meant to build on the power and strength of the shared equity of the brand to leverage heritage of the brand.""

GE's involvement in the field of healthcare -- and specifically imaging -- began in 1893 when inventors C.F. Samms and J.B. Wantz founded the Victor Electric Company in Chicago. The two began making x-ray systems in 1896 just a year after Wilhelm Röntgen discovered x-rays.

It was almost 100 years later that GE bought Technicare from Johnson & Johnson which added that firm's installed base of CT scanners to GE's operations; a pioneer in CT scanner manufacturing GE installed its first system in the mid-1970s. In the 1980s it launched a line of MRI devices under the now well-known brand name Signa and in 1998 the company further expanded its imaging footprint with the purchase of ultrasound developer Diasonics Vingmed. This modality expansion continued in 2001 with GE's acquisition of Imatron and in 2003 with the purchase of contrast media firm Amersham.

""Built on a foundation of lean and innovation these brands will continue our mission of building a world that works and provide our customers with an important reminder of the strengths they value in GE"" Culp said in a statement released July 18.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiR2h0dHBzOi8vdGhlYWlyY3VycmVudC5jb20vZW5naW5lLWRldmVsb3BtZW50L3ByYXR0LXdoaXRuZXktaHlicmlkLXNuZnAv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Harvest & hybrids await engine makers for the next decade,"Log-in here if you’re already a subscriber

Eyeing a return to growth and calls for frenetic factory output for their barely half-decade old technology propulsion providers are staring down the unavoidable social and political demands that they significantly reduce and eventually eliminate net carbon emissions.

TAC/Forum: Previewing the 2022 Farnborough International Airshow

Yet for all the discussion of future technology concepts to r adically reduce the industry’s disproportionately-visible environmental footprint airplane and engine manufacturers are going to spend the remainder of the largely living off of the portfolio of airplanes they have today.

“I have not had one customer — I’ll be honest with you — I have not had one customer say to me ‘Geez…we need Airbus and Boeing to do an airplane sooner.’…Not at least in the next five years” said Rick Deurloo in his first interview as Pratt & Whitney President of Commercial Engines. “I don’t think there’s incentive for either engine manufacturer to say let’s do a new airplane sooner.”

GE HealthCare will cut loose in early 2023 with a new purple brand color but the same GE monogram the company said. After its transition is complete it will be listed on Nasdaq under the symbol GEHC.

In early 2024 the firm plans to spin off its Renewable Energy Power Digital and Energy Financial Services under the brand name GE Vernova (a combination of ""ver"" from ""verdant"" and ""nova"" or ""new""); a third company comprising its aviation business will be called GE Aerospace.

GE first announced its intention to split into three separate companies in 2018 and in 2021 confirmed the plan. In a video conversation between CEO Larry Culp and GE's chief marketing officer Linda Boff Culp emphasized the importance of building on GE's long-term brand trust.

""The GE brand has tremendous intrinsic value"" Culp said. ""The decision to retain the GE name and monogram is meant to build on the power and strength of the shared equity of the brand to leverage heritage of the brand.""

GE's involvement in the field of healthcare -- and specifically imaging -- began in 1893 when inventors C.F. Samms and J.B. Wantz founded the Victor Electric Company in Chicago. The two began making x-ray systems in 1896 just a year after Wilhelm Röntgen discovered x-rays.

It was almost 100 years later that GE bought Technicare from Johnson & Johnson which added that firm's installed base of CT scanners to GE's operations; a pioneer in CT scanner manufacturing GE installed its first system in the mid-1970s. In the 1980s it launched a line of MRI devices under the now well-known brand name Signa and in 1998 the company further expanded its imaging footprint with the purchase of ultrasound developer Diasonics Vingmed. This modality expansion continued in 2001 with GE's acquisition of Imatron and in 2003 with the purchase of contrast media firm Amersham.

""Built on a foundation of lean and innovation these brands will continue our mission of building a world that works and provide our customers with an important reminder of the strengths they value in GE"" Culp said in a statement released July 18.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMidmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmF1bnRtaW5uaWVldXJvcGUuY29tL2luZHVzdHJ5LW5ld3MvYXJ0aWNsZS8xNTY1Njk0Ni9lc2FvdGUtaW5zdGFsbHMtZmlyc3QtbWFnbmlmaWNvLW9wZW4tbXJpLXNjYW5uZXItaW4tdXPSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Esaote installs first Magnifico Open MRI scanner in U.S.,"Esaote announced the installation of the first Magnifico Open MRI system in the U.S. Magnifico offers versatility in imaging across a wide variety of clinical applications according to the company.

Multiple systems were adopted to express the VHH-B11 Ab to seek a cost-effective Ab preparation method preferably with one-step affinity purification for later preparation. Briefly VHH was expressed in three expression systems (Escherichia coli (E. coli) Pichia pastoris (P. pastoris) and HEK293F mammalian cells). As shown in Fig. 1 and Figs. S1–S5 the VHH-B11 Ab was expressed successfully in the three different systems. VHH-B11 was expressed in BL21 E. coli (lane 1: pET28a-VHH-B11) TG1 E. coli (lane 2: pMECS-VHH-B11) and HB2151 E. coli (lane 3: pMECS-VHH-B11) (Fig. 1A and Figs. S1–S3). Due to the intracellular and low soluble expression in BL21 E. coli (pET28a lane 1) adequate results by only one step Ni2+ affinity purification is difficult. Also ultrasonication resulted in partial degradation of the VHH-B11 Ab. In the case of TG1 E. coli (lane 2: pMECS-VHH-B11) the undesired protein band (~ 30 kDa) appeared on the gel. Lane B is the blank control. In lane 3 HB2151 E. coli (pMECS-VHH-B11) also seems to be not very suitable for VHH protein expression. Because one-step Ni2+-affinity purification provided an unsatisfactory eluate. As shown in Fig. 1B and Figs. S4 S5 the monovalent nanobody VHH-B11 was expressed in P. pastoris (lane 4) and HEK293F mammalian cells (lane 5). Because of the secretory expression a favorable purification was achieved in a single Ni2+ affinity purification step without lysis. Due to the amount of heteroprotein bands that may require multi-stage purification the three E. coli expression systems are not our preferred choice. Besides considering the competitive advantages of low cost and convenient purification yeast secretion seems to be a more optimal VHH expression system than that of mammalian cells. Furthermore the affinity between PCSK9 and VHH-B11 expressed by P. pastoris was determinated by surface plasmon resonance (SPR) technology. As shown in Fig. 2A VHH-B11 had an interaction affinity with PCSK9 at 4.436 nM.

Polyvalent configuration design and comparison

Figure 3AE show the camelid heavy chain Ab (HcAb) and classic human Ab. The variable region of HcAb is also described as VHH (Fig. 3B). To increase the affinity and prolong the half-life of the VHH we designed a series of VHH-based polyvalent Abs that can be divided into two classes of Ab configurations (Fig. 3). One was for non-IgG-like strategy (Fig. 3CD) and the other for IgG-like strategy (Fig. 3F–J). However both increased the affinity of VHH-B11 by > ten-fold or about 100-fold (Table 1). Peptide linker was used to form tandem bivalent or multivalent Abs for affinity increase. For instance the GlyGlyGlyGlySerGlyGlyGlyGlySerGlyGlyGlyGlySer-(G4S)3 is the most common polypeptide linker with joint flexibility (Fig. 3CDI)810. “AlaAlaAla” is a representative of rigid peptides11 and the hinge region between Fab and Fc of the Ab is also considered a linker.

Figure 3 Schematic representation of Ab configurations. Schematic representation of different Abs’ configurations. (A) HcAb has its llama hinge linker: bivalent; (B) Camelid VHH: monovalent; (C) VHH-(G4S)3-VHH: bivalent; (D) VHH-(G4S)3-VHH-(G4S)3-VHH: trivalent; (E) Human classic Ab with its hinge linker: bivalent; (F) Llama VHH-human IgG4 hinge linker-IgG4 Fc chimeric HcAb: bivalent; (G) Llama VHH-human CH1-IgG4 hinge linker-IgG4 Fc chimeric heavy chain: bivalent; (H) VHH-llama long linker-VHH-human IgG4 hinge linker-IgG4 Fc: tetravalent; (I) VHH-(G4S)3 linker-VHH-human CH1-IgG4 hinge linker-IgG4 Fc chimeric Ab: tetravalent; (J) VHH-human IgG4 hinge linker-IgG4 Fc-llama long linker-VHH chimeric Ab: tetravalent. Thus “(G4S)3” is a 15-peptide linker (amino acid sequence: GGGGSGGGGSGGGGS). “IgG4-hinge linker” means the hinge region between the human Fab and human IgG4 Fc (amino acid sequence: PPCPSCPAPEFLGGPS). “Llama long linker” means the hinge region between the llama Fab and llama IgG2 Fc (amino acid sequence: EPKIPQPQPKPQPQPQPQPKPQPKPEPECTCPKCP).

The principle of the first strategy is simple. Tandem VHHs were expressed in procaryotic or eukaryotic expression systems. The protein bands in lanes 1 2 and 6 illustrated the intercomparison among the molecular weights (Fig. 4: lane 1 VHH: 17 kDa; lane 2 VHH-VHH: 35 kDa; lane 6 VHH-VHH-VHH: 51 kDa) and the medium supernatants and flow-through components are shown in lanes 4 and 5. The affinities between VHH-VHH (Fig. 2C) or VHH-VHH-VHH and PCSK9 are ~4 or 100-fold than that of VHH-B11 (Table 1).

The second type of IgG-like Abs mediate the augmentation of the biological half-life period because of Fc fusion that is expressed in the eukaryotic expression system including P. pastoris and HEK293F cells. Five configurations were designed (Fig. 3F–J). Herein VHH-Fc (Figs. 3F 4 S6 lane 7: 75 kDa) has the hinge linker of the human IgG4 type and the affinity increased ten-fold (VHH-Fc vs. VHH) (Fig. 2B Table 1). VHH-CH1-Fc (Fig. 3G) is a recombinant heavy chain and has a very low expression due to lack of stability.

Next three tetravalent Abs were designed. VHH-VHH-Fc (Figs. 3H 4 S7 lane 8: ~ 110 kDa) has two hinge linkers; the llama long hinge peptide of the IgG2 type was used to link bivalent VHHs and the hinge linker of the human IgG4 type was used to link human Fc. The Fc region of this tetravalent conformation is fully exposed. Also its affinity increased ten-fold (VHH-VHH-Fc vs. VHH) (Fig. 2D Table 1). As shown in Fig. 3I VHH-VHH-CH1-Fc configuration has a low expression and the protein band is ~ 155 kDa (Figs. 4 S8: lane 9). The last tetravalent Ab is VHH-Fc-VHH configuration (Figs. 3J 4 S9: lane 10). The Fc region of this conformation acts as a linker. Similarly its affinity to PCSK9 also increased ten-fold. A previous study reported an increased functionality of Fc-fused configuration10. Hence the tetravalent Ab format VHH-VHH-Fc is relatively the best conformation based on the appropriate molecular weight increased affinity Fc exposure and medium expression level.

Humanization and identification of key amino acids

According to previous reports16 we summarized 17 hot spot amino acids of humanization in the three framework regions (FR 1–3) of VHH. To improve the degree of humanization of VHH-B11 (Fig. 5: lane1 we designed humanized VHH-B11 (Hu-B11) with all the 17 humanized amino acid mutation sites (Table 2). Surprisingly Hu-B11 (Fig. 5 and Fig. S12: lane5) has a normal expression level similar to the wild-type VHH-B11 (~ 20 mg/L) but the affinity decreased by nine-fold such that Hu-B11 has an affinity interaction with hPCSK9 (4.4 nM vs. 39.7 nM) (Fig. 2A vs. Fig. S14A). However each FR region has five or six humanization sites and Hu-B11 has a high humanized degree; thus affinity maturation is needed in the future. If not it is highly likely that unsatisfactory pharmacodynamic evaluation effect will be obtained.

Table 2 VHH-B11 Ab and its humanized mutants. Full size table

In order to identify which amino acid position plays a critical role we designed and expressed another nine VHH-B11 humanized mutants named by VHH-Z1-Z9 in P. pastoris (~ 15 kDa Fig. 5 Figs. S10–S13 and Table 2). Most of these differed from each other by only one amino acid. For instance VHH-Z1 (Fig. 5 and Figs. S11: lane 2 S14C) and VHH-Z6 VHH-Z2 (Fig. 5 and Fig. S11: lane 3) and VHH-Z5 (Fig. 5 and Figs. S13: lane 7 S14D) and VHH-Z3 (Fig. 5 and Figs. S12: lane 4 S14B) and VHH-Z4 (Fig. 5 and Fig. S13: lane 6) all have only one amino acid difference between each other. Among these Hu-B11 VHH-Z3 and VHH-Z5 are expressed normally (~ 20 mg/L) in yeast but the others have very low expression levels (< 1 mg/L) and VHH-Z9 is not expressed. There is only a single amino acid difference that can cause high or low expression and affinity (Fig. 5 Figs. S10–S13 and Table 2) as well as failure. Also it could be speculated that these amino acid positions play critical roles. For instance compared to the normal expression of VHH-Z1 (80Pro) (Fig. 5 and Figs. S11: lane 2 S14C) one amino acid difference (80Pro vs. 80Arg) in FR3 region causes low expression of VHH-Z6 (80Arg). Another replacement of the 87Val in the FR3 region of VHH-Z5 (normal expression Fig. 5 and Figs. S13: lane 7 S14D) also led to a low expression and affinity of VHH-Z2 (87Lys). Similarly one amino acid difference in FR2 region led to normal expression and no decline in the affinity of VHH-Z3 (54Ala) (Fig. 5 and Figs. S12: lane 4 S14B) but the very low expression and affinity of VHH-Z4 (54Ser). This finding suggested that these amino acid positions (no. 54 no. 80 and no. 87) may be crucial to the humanization of VHH-B11 protein.

On the other hand the first five amino acids “QVQLQ” of VHH-B11 were not indispensable because the protein expression structure and avidity of VHH-B11 were not affected without these initial amino acids (data not shown). In this case VHH-Z9 expression failure could be attributed to the replacement of 83Ser in the FR3 region of VHH-Z3 (83Ala normal expression ~ 20 mg/L) indicating that 83Ala may also affect the normal formation of VHH-B11 Ab structure. When disregarding the initial five amino acids “QVQLQ” VHH-Z2 and VHH-Z9 have only one amino acid difference at no. 54 (Ser vs. Ala). Among these VHH-Z2 (Fig. 5 and Fig. S11: lane 3) has some expression and Z9 has no expression which further emphasizes the importance of no. 54 amino acid position on protein expression. It is worth noting that due to a poor fit only three concentration gradients were showed the kinetic binding of VHH-Z1 and Z5 to the hPCSK9. (Fig. S14CD). As for other humanized VHHs they have poor or even no binding to PCSK9 so they are not shown.

Epitope speculation and determination

In a previous study we conducted SPR and sandwich ELISA (enzyme linked immunosorbent assay) assays and confirmed that the various PCSK9-binding epitope on VHH-B11 has different responses against Evolocumab7. However the specific interaction epitope is yet unclear. To determine the interaction sites we employed a random peptide library phage display and sequencing technology and characterized the amino acid of the binding epitope1718.

Sequencing revealed 321 Ab-binding peptides from groups A and B (Table S1). Further analyses showed similar motif characteristics (× S × GW × T × GW or × H × GW) among several peptides; “ × ” represents one or more amino acids (Table S2). Three peptides are listed in Fig. 6A. If “GW” or “G” is placed in the same amino acid position Weblogo 3 analysis tool identified the most common features (“STSGAGW”) of these short peptides after input of the peptides listed in Table S2 (Fig. 6B). Interestingly the hinge region of hPCSK9 447–452 amino acids (STHGAGW) met this characteristic. To verify this speculation we designed and expressed wild-type hPCSK9 and four hPCSK9-deletants lacking some modules: PCSK9-Δ1(383–405) PCSK9-Δ2(429–449) PCSK9-Δ3(153–449) and PCSK9-Δ4(450–692) in HEK293F (Fig. 6C). The numbers in parentheses represent the deletion range of amino acids. For instance PCSK9-Δ1(383–405) represents a PCSK9 deletant lacking 383–405 amino acids (“SGTSQAAAHVAGIAAMMLSAEPE”). The PCSK9-Δ1 deletant was regarded as the irrelevant contrast and the other three deletants were experimental groups that the predicted epitope was broken by removing different modules.

Figure 6 Epitope speculation and PCSK9 deletants design. (A) Epitope speculation. Many polypeptides with similar “GW” motif characteristics (for example × S × GW × T × GW or × H × GW. × represents any amino acid) were identified from the random library (Table S2). Three peptides were listed as an illustration. (B) PCSK9 deletants design. Placing “GW” in the same amino acid position facilitated the identification of the possible common features (“STSGAGW”) of these short peptides after input in the Table S2 peptides by Weblogo 3 analysis tool. (C) Wild-type hPCSK9 and four hPCSK9-deletants lacked some modules: PCSK9-Δ1 (383–405) PCSK9-Δ2 (429–449) PCSK9-Δ3 (153–449) and PCSK9-Δ4 (450–692). hPCSK9 is composed of the signal peptide (amino acids 1–30) pro-domain (31–152) catalytic domain (153–407) hinge region (408–452) and C-terminal region (453–692). HA tag was fused for purification easily. Full size image

An immunoblot assay was performed to verify this prediction. PCSK9 and its deletants were loaded in the following sequence in groups of five samples (supernatants and cell precipitation lysate): PCSK9-Δ1(383–405) PCSK9-Δ2(429–449) PCSK9-Δ3(153–449) PCSK9-Δ4(450–692) and wild-type PCSK9. As shown in Fig. 7A anti-HA Ab was used as a primary Ab to assess whether PCSK9 was expressed intracellularly (Fig. 7A lanes 1–5 supernatants) and extracellularly (Fig. 7A lanes 6–10 cell lysate) while B11-Fc Ab was used as primary Ab to verify whether PCSK9 and the deletants could self-interact (Fig. 7B lanes 11–15 supernatants and Fig. 7B lanes 16–20 cell lysate). Anti-HA primary Ab group showed that wild-type PCSK9 was expressed extracellularly as well as intracellularly (~ 66 kDa & ~ 72 kDa Fig. 7A lanes 5 and 10) while all the PCSK9 deletants expressed only intracellularly (Fig. 7A lanes 6–9). Furthermore B11-Fc primary Ab group showed that wild-type PCSK9 (Fig. 7B lanes 15 and 20) and the PCSK9-Δ1 deletant (the irrelevant contrast Fig. 7B lane16) could still be detected by B11-Fc because of their intact epitope but the other three deletants (PCSK9 Δ2-Δ4 Fig. 7B lanes 17–19) not. These findings suggested that the broken epitope “STHGAGW” (no. 447–452) of the PCSK9 Δ2-Δ4 deletants would lead to the failure of detection by the specific Ab B11-Fc deeming that this linear epitope is the interacting site between B11-Fc and PCSK9.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNiYy5jYS9uZXdzL2NhbmFkYS9jYWxnYXJ5L2FsYmVydGEtY29udHJhc3QtZHllLXNob3J0YWdlLW1lZGljYWwtc2NhbnMtZGVsYXktMS42NTIyODU00gEgaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuY2JjLmNhL2FtcC8xLjY1MjI4NTQ?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Doctors worry about Alberta patients as contrast dye shortage continues to delay medical scans,"More than 7000 Albertans have had their imaging procedures delayed due to a global shortage of contrast dye and there are growing concerns about the impact on patients as supply issues drag on.

The dye is used in roughly half of the CT scans performed in Alberta and it helps make blood vessels and organs more visible.

The shortage was sparked when one of Canada's main suppliers of the contrast material — GE Healthcare — had to shutter its production plant in Shanghai due to COVID-19 lockdowns. While the plant has since re-opened supply problems continue.

According to Alberta Health Services approximately 7200 less urgent patients have had their imaging procedures postponed over the last six weeks and the shortage is expected to continue for several months with 1200 patients being impacted weekly.

""It's just another delay on top of all the other delays in the system"" said Dr. Tony Gomes section president for general surgery with the Alberta Medical Association.

According to Gomes elective CT scans are being postponed by at least two months.

While many people can wait there are concerns some seemingly less urgent patients may suffer.

""The problem is that there's a small percentage of patients who are having routine investigations routine CAT scans and a small percentage of those patients are going to actually have a bad diagnosis"" he said.

""Things may be found that we look at and wish we'd found before.""

'It's a bit like operating 30 years ago'

The dye shortage is impacting care in emergency rooms now too Gomes said. Doctors are trying to conserve the contrast dye for the sickest patients by doing scans without it or resorting to other tests altogether when they can.

""There is certainly concern that we're doing lower quality [CT scans] rather than higher quality ones and there's some concerns that we're using alternative tests like ultrasounds ... when actually that might be less than optimal"" Gomes said.

""We see patients in the emergency department where we have to decide if an ultrasound is good enough for a diagnosis of something in their abdomen. So sometimes we may be operating with less information than we actually would like to have about the patient's condition.""

A CT scan is performed at Calgary's South Health Campus. Contrast dye is normally used in about half of Alberta's CT scans (David Bell/CBC)

That includes problems such as appendicitis according to Gomes and could complicate care or even lead to unnecessary surgery.

""It's a bit like working 30 years ago when we didn't do a lot of CAT scans"" he said.

No delays for most urgent cases AHS says

Alberta Health Services said the most urgent patients are not having their imaging procedures delayed.

""We continue our mitigation strategies while ensuring that we image our urgent and emergent patients"" spokesperson Kerry Williamson said in a statement emailed to CBC News.

""AHS will do everything possible to ensure all deferred patients are imaged in a timely manner when our supply is stabilized.""

Gomes who is based in Lethbridge is particularly concerned about cancer patients who he worries could eventually face delays for diagnostic scans.

""If it progresses to the point where we see real delays with cancer staging then we're going to see patients potentially having poorer outcomes with their surgery because the surgery will be delayed as we're waiting for the CAT scans to get done before being able to operate on them.""

Calgary-based family physician Dr. Christine Luelo hasn't yet had patients postponed due to the contrast dye shortage but she said it highlights the need to think critically about what procedures are needed.

""I've been really thinking about when I'm ordering a test 'Is this going to need contrast. Do I need this test? Is there another test I can do instead?' And I think that's the lesson coming out of the pandemic as well. Are we doing these things because we can or because we really need the test?"" she said.

It's just another delay on top of all the other delays in the system. - Dr. Tony Gomes Alberta Medical Association

It's not a new idea Luelo added noting there is an ongoing nation-wide campaign aimed at raising awareness about reducing unnecessary testing.

Any kind of postponement though can be very difficult for patients she said.

""Anytime something's delayed it's significant. And for each one patient it's significant for them. There's a lot of anxiety around 'What's that test going to show? How's that going to change the trajectory of my disease?'""

AHS said it had been increasing its imaging capacity in the months prior to start of the shortage and it is now filling those spots with patients who don't need contrast dye.

It's currently sending 15 per cent fewer patients for CT scans on average during a two-week period than it did last year and two per cent less than in 2018-2019.

The contrast dye shortage is expected to last several more months.",,,

It was almost 100 years later that GE bought Technicare from Johnson & Johnson which added that firm's installed base of CT scanners to GE's operations; a pioneer in CT scanner manufacturing GE installed its first system in the mid-1970s. In the 1980s it launched a line of MRI devices under the now well-known brand name Signa and in 1998 the company further expanded its imaging footprint with the purchase of ultrasound developer Diasonics Vingmed. This modality expansion continued in 2001 with GE's acquisition of Imatron and in 2003 with the purchase of contrast media firm Amersham.

And while on a practical basis I remain more enthused about charging developments like GM's recent expansion with Pilot and EVgo or Tesla Superchargers embracing the world here are some new battery technologies that are strong rivals for my enthusiasm.

Lithium ion is far from done

Sila Nanotechnologies is replacing the graphite anode that forms a lot of the bulk and about 15% of the weight of today's lithium-ion batteries with a form of silicon that it claims will give battery cells a 20 to 40% increase in energy density while also charging faster. That change would be roughly analogous to a Ford F-150 getting 25 MPG this year but 35 MPG next model year an unheard of jump.

Mercedes looks like the first customer to offer the Sila tech as an elite option in the new electric EQG in 2025. Energy density is especially important in heavy vehicles like the EQG because their lardiness tends to magnify the shortcomings of current batteries that have to be large and heavy to move something large and heavy even a decent number of miles setting up a decided unvirtuous cycle.

Sila claims traditional lithium-ion battery tech has flatlined in terms of energy density. Sila

Group14 is another company to watch in the marriage of silicon and lithium lining up Porsche as a lead partner. OneD is pursuing a strategy of growing silicon nanowires on the graphite anode of a lithium battery. All these approaches leverage the good performance and vast acceptance of lithium battery technologies to move to market apace.

Sodium-ion batteries

The Pacific Northwest National Lab recently announced a breakthrough in sodium-ion battery tech that promises greater immunity to the temperature-management requirements that bedevil current EV batteries charge many times without degradation be naturally extinguishing and less of a toxic headache. PNNL says it's found a way to tame the unstable aspects of sodium-ion technology but still needs to tackle its substantially lower energy density compared to lithium ion. As a bonus PNNL researchers think they'll be able to reduce or remove cobalt from the formula a contentious and toxic element in EV batteries today.

Solid-state batteries

Solid-state battery tech is aptly named: It generally refers to batteries made of tightly compressed hard materials rather than the slightly mushy moist material that makes up a typical lithium battery.

Today's battery cells are semirigid affairs with a wet electrolyte solution inside. Solid-state batteries are physically distinct signifying the materials that make them radically more promising. Brian Cooley/CNET

The fact that a solid-state battery is composed of hard materials in a rigid package isn't specifically what makes it perform better but it's a simple way to describe a construction that promises a lot of benefits:

Greater energy density: This could yield an EV with far more range from the same size battery or today's range from a much smaller cheaper battery tomorrow. The latter is more transformational in my mind.

Faster charging: While full charges in under 30 minutes are rather elite today solid-state batteries target that as a matter of course. Short charge times have the potential to change the entire perception of electric cars.

Longer cycle life: You may have seen my recent story on the problem of EV batteries being put out to pasture because they lose a significant portion of their capacity through charge cycling. Solid-state tech is a key part of GM's plan to produce a million-mile life battery.

Thermal stability: Solid-state designs promise little or no chance of thermal runaway which has made current lithium batteries synonymous with fire risk. Silicon batteries like those mentioned earlier are also said to largely eliminate this problem as well.

Most of the new battery technologies under development boast of being nearly immune to thermal runaway which has made lithium-ion batteries somewhat synonymous with fire. Brian Cooley/CNET

Who's in line to deliver this magic?

Solid Power grabbed headlines lately when it announced it was starting small volume production with the backing of Ford and BMW. Notably production can be done on lines that make conventional lithium-ion batteries today a potentially huge industrial advantage. Mass production could come as soon as 2024.

Perhaps the most talked about company has been QuantumScape with backing from VW which says the tech is no less than ""the most promising approach to electromobility of the future."" QuantumScape has developed a ceramic separator between anode and cathode that helps its cells charge from 10% to 80% in less than 15 minutes while allowing the battery to lose very little capacity after repeated charges.

Nikkei recently reported that Toyota is by far the world's leader in solid-state battery patents and has said it will have a limited production vehicle using the tech by 2025.

Buzzy EV newcomer Vinfast recently committed to invest in solid-state battery-maker ProLogium for batteries that could be in the Vietnamese manufacturer's electric cars by 2024.

Should you wait?

Some of the target dates I related above seem tantalizingly close but take them with a grain of salt: Slipped mass production dates for any of these battery technologies would surprise exactly nobody. On top of that the auto industry typically has a long lead time from a new tech being technically available to it being widely available in popularly priced cars. Add to that my general aversion to buying a new car at all and you start to get to the longer end of five to 10 years. I would analyze an EV based on today's offerings as these exciting new battery technologies are probably a full car ownership cycle away for the smart value-savvy buyer.

That said these battery technologies will arrive early enough in the EV adoption curve to be major contributors to its tipping point.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiamh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmV1cm9nYW1lci5uZXQvY2QtcHJvamVrdHMtc2hhcmUtdmFsdWUtaGFzLXJlcG9ydGVkbHktcGx1bW1ldGVkLTc1LXBlci1jZW50LXBvc3QtY3liZXJwdW5rLTIwNzfSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,CD Projekt's share value has reportedly plummeted 75 percent post-Cyberpunk 2077,"CD Projekt - the publisher behind studio CD Projekt Red developer of The Witcher games and of course Cyberpunk 2077 - has seen its share value plummet by over 75 percent.

That's according to Business Insider Poland which says that the disastrous launch of Cyberpunk 2077 has wiped the value of the then most-valuable games company in Europe from over 40 billion Polish złoty - that's around £7.11bn - to less than zł10 billion - about £1.77bn.

The drop in CD Projekt's value - whilst still remaining one of Poland's most valuable companies - reportedly takes it back to a value last seen around 2017.

That means that Dying Light developer Techland - which is also based in Poland and thought to be worth around 10.6bn Polish złoty (£1.88bn) - is now seemingly worth more and continues to increase in value (thanks PC Gamer) thanks to the release of Dying Light 2: Stay Human.

Sony has announced its ready to bring the next generation of Xperia to the market and we won’t have to wait long either as the tech giant has confirmed a launch date of May 11. The video teaser makes it apparent that the phone we will see announced next month will be the eagerly awaited Xperia 1 IV successor to the excellent Sony Xperia 1 III which has pioneered a new breed of periscope zoom with its quad-camera system. There have been two large Xperia 1 IV leaks so far which assuming they are correct tell us a lot about the upcoming smartphone.

(Image credit: Giznext) Last month Giznext shared exclusive 5K render images of the Xperia 1 series flagship camera phone’s design – assuming they’re accurate it features a similar design to the Xperia 1 III.

The images show a flat-edge design as seen in the previous-gen model but with slightly different dimensions - the upcoming model comes in at 164.7 x 70.8 x 8.3mm and 9.5mm thickness including camera bump.

(Image credit: Giznext) We can also see a tiny selfie camera embedded within the top bezel: there’s no punch-hole cut-out or waterdrop notch. On the back panel we can see a good sixed vertical camera module with three sensors and an LED flash. The bottom panel shows the SIM card tray along with the USB Type-C port charging and data transfers.

From the leaked images we can also see the Xperia 1 IV looks to have a 3.5mm headphone jack on the upper left of the top frame and volume power and shutter key on the right spine. According to this leak we can also expect the power key on the Xperia 1 IV to feature a physical fingerprint scanner for biometrics.

Sony Xperia 1 IV: Leaked specs The biggest Xperia 1 IV leak so far came back in January via a post on Chinese social media platform Weibo by the usually reliable Zackbuks (via Notebookcheck). According to the leak the Sony Xperia 1 IV will be powered by a Snapdragon 8 Gen 1 chip with RAM ranging from 12 GB to 16 GB and storage in either 256 GB or 512 GB configurations. The tipped 5000-mAh battery is said to be complimented by new 45W charging. Camera wise the Sony Xperia 1 IV is said to have the same 12 MP Sony Exmor RS IMX36312 ultra-wide sensor as the Xperia 1 III but with both the main lens and telephoto getting upgrades. This does make sense as Sony do tend to choose large sensors over resolution for their smartphones so we could be looking at 12 MP + 12 MP + 12 MP. The specs in this leak are indeed as we would expect for the Mark 4 variant of the Xperia 1 smartphone which has always been very well received. Not long to wait to see if it’s correct…

We're here ready for Sony's Xperia launch popcorn in hand (even though it's not even 8am here in the UK) ready to see the big launch

The comments section is as lively as you'd imagine. ""​Xperia is an android version of iPhone these days"" says one.

""if it's gonna cost an arm they should at least throw in a good pair of earbuds"" says another

""interchangable lens?"" posits a very hopeful individual.

Like… we don't work for Sony but we'll go out on a wild limb and say ""no"" to that one.

We'd bite our nails but we don't have any left after the excitement of the DJI Mini Pro 3 launch just yesterday!

Aaaaaaand now we're going to be hearing from creators. Yikes.

Pierre Lambert loves shooting him some 4K 120fps footage. And the ability to translate the shooting from his traditional Alpha camera to his phone – same autofocus system and three different lenses. Also object tracking which switches to eye when you get closer.

16-375mm seamless zoom. Okay that really is pretty cool. Image stabilization too.

He's shooting HDR of cyclists under a monorail bridge – the dynamic range is pretty good. He's doing it with 20fps bursts too. Vlog Monitor enables you to see yourself and use the main camera.

You can use the phone as an external monitor which is a REALLY underappreciated feature.

Music Pro has been designed by Sony Music sound engineers to studio-quality production… but music isn't exactly our specialty.

(Though we can recommend some fantastic synthwave acts if you're interested.)

MONONKVL is singing a song called Higher. It's quite pleasant. And now a Sony A&R is talking about more music stuff. Autofocus and framerate doesn't seem to feature so we're a bit lost.

Yikes did I write 18-125mm lens earlier? My bad – it's actually an 85-125mm f/2.3-2.8 lens. And yes it's completely optical. So the Xperia 1 IV has four cameras: a 16mm f/2.2 ultra-wide 24mm f/1.7 wide and the 85-25mm telephoto zoom. This is actually incredible.

Okay we're into gaming features now. You know what games we like to play on our phones? The ones where you pretend you're a photographer and you take pictures with them. Or XCOM. We love a bit of XCOM.

Okay this is interesting – aimed at streamers there seems to be some sort of cooling device on the way

$${\dot{{{{{{{{\boldsymbol{\rho }}}}}}}}}}_{t}=-\imath \\left[{{{{{{{{\rm{H}}}}}}}}}_{t}{{{{{{{{\boldsymbol{\rho }}}}}}}}}_{t}\right]+\mathop{\sum }\limits_{\ell =1}^{{{{{{{{\mathscr{L}}}}}}}}}{{{\Gamma }}}_{\ell t}\frac{\left[{{{{{{{{\rm{L}}}}}}}}}_{\ell }{{{{{{{{\boldsymbol{\rho }}}}}}}}}_{t}{{{{{{{{\rm{L}}}}}}}}}_{\ell }^{{{{\dagger}}} }\right]+\left[{{{{{{{{\rm{L}}}}}}}}}_{\ell }{{{{{{{{\boldsymbol{\rho }}}}}}}}}_{t}{{{{{{{{\rm{L}}}}}}}}}_{\ell }^{{{{\dagger}}} }\right]}{2}$$ (1)

The master equation (1) embodies the universal form of a time-local and trace-preserving evolution law.

In (1) the Hamiltonian H t is the generator of a unitary dynamics. The collection \({\{{{{{{{{{\rm{L}}}}}}}}}_{\ell }\}}_{\ell = 1}^{{{{{{{{\mathscr{L}}}}}}}}}\) consists of so-called Lindblad operators modeling the interaction with the environment. The weights Γ ℓt ’s are related to the probability per unit of time of the collapse associated to the Lindblad operators they couple to (1). Khalfin’s theorem45 forbids exponential decay in quantum mechanics outside the intermediate asymptotic singled out by the weak coupling scaling limit1446. Thus the Γ ℓt ’s are in general time dependent functions with arbitrary sign. We only require them to be bounded. The celebrated Lindblad-Gorini-Kossakowski-Sudarshan master equation is thus a special case of (1) corresponding to the complete positivity conditions

$${{{\Gamma }}}_{\ell t}\\ge \0\\\\\\\ell =1\ldots {{{{{{{\mathscr{L}}}}}}}}.$$ (2)

The conditions (2) are usually derived from microscopic models in the weak coupling limit14. We emphasize that even when the conditions (2) do not hold (1) may still admit completely positive solutions but only for special initial states and initial times. These cases correspond to completely positive but not completely positive divisible dynamical maps2247.

The gist of the proof of the unraveling of (1) via the influence martingale is based on an extension of Girsanov’s change of measure formula a well known result in the theory of stochastic processes (see e.g. ref. 42). Roughly speaking Girsanov formula expresses the average of a generic functional F t up to time t of a stochastic process in terms of the weighted average of the same functional now evaluated over a second distinct stochastic process

$$\tilde{{{{{{{{\rm{E}}}}}}}}}({F}_{t})={{{{{{{\rm{E}}}}}}}}({M}_{t}{F}_{t}).$$ (3)

Here E and \(\tilde{{{{{{{{\rm{E}}}}}}}}}\) denote the expectation values with respect to the probability measures of the two stochastic processes. Girsanov’s theorem states that the scalar weighing factor M t must be a positive definite martingale42 satisfying for all t

$${{{{{{{\rm{E}}}}}}}}({M}_{t})=1.$$ (4)

The extension we propose consists in relinquishing the requirement that the martingale be positive definite. We will return below on the interpretation of the negative values of the influence martingale. We now turn to detail the proof of the unraveling.

Our aim is to prove that a state operator solution of (1) always admits the representation

$${{{{{{{{\boldsymbol{\rho }}}}}}}}}_{t}={{{{{{{\rm{E}}}}}}}}\left({\mu }_{t}{{{{{{{{\boldsymbol{\psi }}}}}}}}}_{t}{{{{{{{{\boldsymbol{\psi }}}}}}}}}_{t}^{{{{\dagger}}} }\right).$$ (5)

Here E denotes the expectation value operation ψ t is a stochastic state vector at time t defined in the Hilbert space of the system and \({{{{{{{{\boldsymbol{\psi }}}}}}}}}_{t}^{{{{\dagger}}} }\) is its adjoint dual. Finally μ t is a scalar stochastic process enjoying the martingale property. We prescribe ψ t  \({{{{{{{{\boldsymbol{\psi }}}}}}}}}_{t}^{{{{\dagger}}} }\) and μ t to obey evolution laws such that the expectation value (5) indeed solves (1).

First we require that the state vector solve the Itô stochastic differential equation9

$${{{{{{{\rm{d}}}}}}}}{{{{{{{{\boldsymbol{\psi }}}}}}}}}_{t}= -\imath \{{{{{{{{\rm{H}}}}}}}}}_{t}{{{{{{{{\boldsymbol{\psi }}}}}}}}}_{t}{{{{{{{\rm{d}}}}}}}}t-\mathop{\sum }\limits_{\ell =1}^{{{{{{{{\mathscr{L}}}}}}}}}{{{\Gamma }}}_{\ell t}\frac{{{{{{{{{\rm{L}}}}}}}}}_{\ell }^{{{{\dagger}}} }{{{{{{{{\rm{L}}}}}}}}}_{\ell }-{\left\Vert {{{{{{{{\rm{L}}}}}}}}}_{\ell }{{{{{{{{\boldsymbol{\psi }}}}}}}}}_{t}\right\Vert }^{2}}{2}{{{{{{{{\boldsymbol{\psi }}}}}}}}}_{t}{{{{{{{\rm{d}}}}}}}}t\\ +\mathop{\sum }\limits_{\ell =1}^{{{{{{{{\mathscr{L}}}}}}}}}{{{{{{{\rm{d}}}}}}}}{

u }_{\ell t}\left(\frac{{{{{{{{{\rm{L}}}}}}}}}_{\ell }{{{{{{{{\boldsymbol{\psi }}}}}}}}}_{t}}{\left\Vert {{{{{{{{\rm{L}}}}}}}}}_{\ell }{{{{{{{{\boldsymbol{\psi }}}}}}}}}_{t}\right\Vert }-{{{{{{{{\boldsymbol{\psi }}}}}}}}}_{t}\right)$$ (6)

In (6) the \({\{{

u }_{\ell t}\}}_{\ell = 1}^{{{{{{{{\mathscr{L}}}}}}}}}\) are a collection of counting processes (see e.g. refs. 23716). The statistics of the counting process increments dν ℓt ’s are fully specified for \(\ell {{{{{{{\mathscr{k}}}}}}}}=1\ldots {{{{{{{\mathscr{L}}}}}}}}\) by

$${{{{{{{\rm{d}}}}}}}}{

u }_{\ell t}{{{{{{{\rm{d}}}}}}}}{

u }_{{{{{{{{\mathscr{k}}}}}}}}t}={\delta }_{\ell {{{{{{{\mathscr{k}}}}}}}}}{{{{{{{\rm{d}}}}}}}}{

u }_{\ell t}$$ (7)

$${{{{{{{\rm{E}}}}}}}}\left(\right.{{{{{{{\rm{d}}}}}}}}{

u }_{\ell t}\left|\right.{{{{{{{{\boldsymbol{\psi }}}}}}}}}_{t}{{{{{{{{\boldsymbol{\psi }}}}}}}}}_{t}^{{{{\dagger}}} }\left)\right.={{{{{{{{\mathscr{r}}}}}}}}}_{\ell t}{\left\Vert {{{{{{{{\rm{L}}}}}}}}}_{\ell }{{{{{{{{\boldsymbol{\psi }}}}}}}}}_{t}\right\Vert }^{2}{{{{{{{\rm{d}}}}}}}}t$$ (8)

where \({\{{{{{{{{{\mathscr{r}}}}}}}}}_{\ell t}\}}_{\ell = 1}^{{{{{{{{\mathscr{L}}}}}}}}}\) is a collection of strictly positive definite functions of time. Equation (7) states that dν ℓt can only take values 0 or 1. The conditional expectation \({{{{{{{\rm{E}}}}}}}}({{{{{{{\rm{d}}}}}}}}{

u }_{\ell t}| {{{{{{{{\boldsymbol{\psi }}}}}}}}}_{t}{{{{{{{{\boldsymbol{\psi }}}}}}}}}_{t}^{{{{\dagger}}} })\) is called the compensator of the counting process ν ℓt and determines the jump rate given the values of the state vector and its complex adjoint at time t42. The equations governing \({{{{{{{{\boldsymbol{\psi }}}}}}}}}_{t}^{{{{\dagger}}} }\) follow immediately from (6) by applying the complex adjoint operation. We associate to (6) and to the equation for the adjoint initial data on the Bloch hyper-sphere i.e. \({{{{{{{{\boldsymbol{\psi }}}}}}}}}_{0}^{{{{\dagger}}} }{{{{{{{{\boldsymbol{\psi }}}}}}}}}_{0}=\parallel {{{{{{{{\boldsymbol{\psi }}}}}}}}}_{0}{\parallel }^{2}=1\). We emphasize that the stochastic Schrödinger equation (6) and the counting processes (7) (8) are essentially the same as in ref. 9.

Next we need μ t to obey an evolution law admitting solutions enjoying the martingale property. We thus require μ t to evolve according to the Itô stochastic differential equation

$${{{{{{{\rm{d}}}}}}}}{\mu }_{t}={\mu }_{t}\mathop{\sum }\limits_{\ell =1}^{{{{{{{{\mathscr{L}}}}}}}}}\left(\frac{{{{\Gamma }}}_{\ell t}}{{{{{{{{{\mathscr{r}}}}}}}}}_{\ell t}}-1\right){{{{{{{{\rm{d}}}}}}}}\iota }_{\ell t}$$ (9)

$${{{{{{{{\rm{d}}}}}}}}\iota }_{\ell t}={{{{{{{\rm{d}}}}}}}}{

u }_{\ell t}-{{{{{{{{\mathscr{r}}}}}}}}}_{\ell t}{\left\Vert {{{{{{{{\rm{L}}}}}}}}}_{\ell }{{{{{{{{\boldsymbol{\psi }}}}}}}}}_{t}\right\Vert }^{2}{{{{{{{\rm{d}}}}}}}}t$$ (10)

$${\mu }_{0}=1$$ (11)

The solution of an equation of the form (9) is by construction a local martingale (see e.g. ref. 42 for details). Namely the source of randomness in (9) are the innovation processes (10)716 defined by compensating counting process increments dν ℓt ’s by their conditional expectation (8). The immediate consequence is that the expectation value of the increments of μ t conditional on the values of ψ t  \({{{{{{{{\boldsymbol{\psi }}}}}}}}}_{t}^{{{{\dagger}}} }\) vanishes at any time instant t:

$${{{{{{{\rm{E}}}}}}}}({{{{{{{\rm{d}}}}}}}}{\mu }_{t}| {{{{{{{{\boldsymbol{\psi }}}}}}}}}_{t}{{{{{{{{\boldsymbol{\psi }}}}}}}}}_{t}^{{{{\dagger}}} })=0.$$ (12)

A local martingale becomes a strict martingale i.e. satisfies the condition Eμ t = 1 for all t if the integrability condition \({{{{{{{\rm{E}}}}}}}}\mathop{\sup }\limits_{t}| {\mu }_{t}| \; < \; \infty\) holds. In practice we expect μ t to be a strict martingale if all Γ ℓt ’s are bounded functions of t during the evolution horizon. We take for granted this physically reasonable condition and therefore that the process μ t is a strict martingale.

The last step in the proof of the unraveling via the influence martingale is to compute the differential of the expectation value (5) using (6) (7) (8) and (9). A straightforward application of stochastic calculus proves that the state operator satisfies the time local master Eq. (1). We report the details of the calculation in Methods.

The question naturally arises whether the evolution law (6) preserves the squared norm of the stochastic process ψ t  and as a consequence justifies the interpretation of ψ t as state vector of the system. We verify that the squared norm satisfies the Itô stochastic differential equation

$${{{{{{{\rm{d}}}}}}}}\left({\left\Vert {{{{{{{{\boldsymbol{\psi }}}}}}}}}_{t}\right\Vert }^{2}\right)=\mathop{\sum }\limits_{\ell =1}^{{{{{{{{\mathscr{L}}}}}}}}}\left({{{{{{{\rm{d}}}}}}}}{

u }_{\ell t}-{{{\Gamma }}}_{\ell t}{\left\Vert {{{{{{{{\rm{L}}}}}}}}}_{\ell }{{{{{{{{\boldsymbol{\psi }}}}}}}}}_{t}\right\Vert }^{2}{{{{{{{\rm{d}}}}}}}}t\right)\left(1-{\left\Vert {{{{{{{{\boldsymbol{\psi }}}}}}}}}_{t}\right\Vert }^{2}\right).$$ (13)

Therefore for arbitrary initial values ψ 0  \({{{{{{{{\boldsymbol{\psi }}}}}}}}}_{0}^{{{{\dagger}}} }\) the expected value of the squared norm is not preserved unless (2) holds true. Nevertheless the Bloch hyper-sphere (i.e. the manifold ∥ψ t ∥2 = 1) is preserved by the dynamics. Thus we can interpret ψ t as a state vector for any quantum trajectory evolving from physically relevant initial data assigned on the Bloch hyper-sphere. A further useful consequence is that Bloch hyper-sphere valued solutions of (6) can always be couched into the form of the ratio of the solution of a linear stochastic differential equation divided by its norm. We defer the proof of the claim to Methods.

Some observations are in order regarding equations (6) and (9). The evolution law (9) of the influence martingale is enslaved to that of the state vector (6): μ t exerts no feedback on the stochastic Schrödinger equation (6). Most importantly the state vector is a Markov process and the influence martingale is also non anticipating. This is intuitively pleasing because in any finite dimensional Hilbert space the master equation (1) is just a matrix-valued time non-autonomous linear ordinary differential equation. Finally we emphasize the different nature of the weights Γ ℓt ’s and of the positive definite rates \({{{{{{{{\mathscr{r}}}}}}}}}_{\ell t}\)’s. The former ones are theoretical predictions fixed by the microscopic dynamics. The \({{{{{{{{\mathscr{r}}}}}}}}}_{\ell t}\)’s are either inferred from experimental measurement or in numerical applications selected based on integration convenience. Such arbitrariness reflects the fact that quantum trajectories generated by an unraveling exist only contextually to a setup or in the language of48 are “subjectively real”.

Let us now turn to the interpretation of the influence martingale. Girsanov’s formula (see e.g. ref. 42) states that when the martingale process μ t in (5) is positive definite it specifies a change of probability measure. The influence martingale can however take negative values when the Γ ℓt ’s do so. As μ t is non-anticipating at any time t it is always possible to represent it as the difference of two positive definite and correlated processes

$${\mu }_{t}^{(\pm )}=\max (0\pm {\mu }_{t}).$$ (14)

The immediate consequence is that we can couch (5) into the form

$${{{{{{{{\boldsymbol{\rho }}}}}}}}}_{t}={{{{{{{\rm{E}}}}}}}}\left({\mu }_{t}^{(+)}{{{\boldsymbol{{\psi }}}}}_{t}{{{{{{{{\boldsymbol{\psi }}}}}}}}}_{t}^{{{{\dagger}}} }-{\mu }_{t}^{(-)}{{{\boldsymbol{{\psi }}}}}_{t}{{{{{{{{\boldsymbol{\psi }}}}}}}}}_{t}^{{{{\dagger}}} }\right)$$ (15)

Using the explicit expression of the influence martingale and of the state vector in terms of the fundamental solution of the linear dynamics (“Methods”) it is straightforward to verify that the argument of the expectation value is the difference of two completely positive dynamical maps. We thus recognize that from the mathematical point of view the need to introduce the influence martingale naturally stems from the general result in linear operator algebra known as the Wittstock–Paulsen decomposition23 stating that any completely bounded map is always amenable to the difference of two completely positive maps.

If one insists on the change of probability measure interpretation negative values of the influence martingale would imply that some realizations of quantum trajectories in the mathematical path-space should be weighed by a “negative probability”. Exactly for the reasons put forward by Feynman in ref. 49 even such interpretation does not pose any logical difficulty when the initial state operator belongs to the compatibility domain of operators whose positivity is preserved by the evolution3334. Negative values of the influence martingale only contribute as an intermediate step to the Monte Carlo evaluation of the state operator. In other words they do not specify “the final probability of verifiable physical events”49. We refer to refs. 5051 for a mathematically rigorous operational definition of negative probabilities in quantum mechanics recently developed starting from Feynman’s argument.

From a more qualitative point of view it is suggestive to interpret negative values of μ t as a form of interference that occurs in the mathematical path-space in order to ensure the convergence of a Monte Carlo average to a completely bounded deterministic dynamical map. In ref. 49 (page 246–48) Feynman shows how interference patterns in a double slit experiment can be formally computed by means of arithmetic averages also including events weighed by a negative probability. The Lindblad weights Γ ℓt ’s in the master equation are essentially time derivatives of survival probabilities. These latter quantities may take negative values in consequence of a phenomenon usually interpreted as re-scattering of decay products from the environment to the system46. Putting together these admittedly heuristic considerations motivates the appeal of conceptualizing the influence martingale as the expression of a form of environment feedback-induced interference of quantum trajectories. By the same token we motivate its name with a role reminiscent of the influence functional introduced by Feynman and Vernon in ref. 25. To dispel any possible misunderstanding however we wish to add that the above considerations do not aim at arguing a one-to-one correspondence between the phenomenon of quantum interference and completely bounded maps.

Examples

In low dimensional Hilbert spaces algorithms based on quantum trajectories are not expected to bring any numerical efficiency advantage with respect to direct integration of the master equation. Thus the purpose of the examples is only to highlight how a non-anticipating unraveling reproduces physical phenomena such as quantum revivals usually attributed to memory and prescience effects. In all the examples we set for convenience \({{{{{{{{\mathscr{r}}}}}}}}}_{\ell t}=| {{{\Gamma }}}_{\ell t}|\) in (8).

The master equation in Dirac’s interaction picture of a two level atom in a photonic band gap2952 is

$${\dot{{{{{{{{\boldsymbol{\rho }}}}}}}}}}_{t}=\frac{{S}_{t}}{2\\imath }\left[{\sigma }_{+}{\sigma }_{-}{{{{{{{{\boldsymbol{\rho }}}}}}}}}_{t}\right]+{{{\Gamma }}}_{t}\frac{\left[{\sigma }_{-}{{{{{{{{\boldsymbol{\rho }}}}}}}}}_{t}{\sigma }_{+}\right]+\left[{\sigma }_{-}{{{{{{{{\boldsymbol{\rho }}}}}}}}}_{t}{\sigma }_{+}\right]}{2}$$ (16)

where σ ± = (σ 1 ± ı σ 2 )/2 and \({\left\{{\sigma }_{i}\right\}}_{i = 1}^{3}\) are Pauli matrices. The time dependent functions S t and Γ t are respectively the Lamb shift and the Lindblad weight factor. Negative values of Γ t also imply a violation of the Kossakowski conditions (see e.g. refs. 2247) a weaker form of positivity that might be imposed on ρ t 53. This fact renders the unraveling of (16) in quantum trajectories particularly probing.

In order to explore a genuine strong system-environment coupling we proceed as in38. Let g and e be respectively the ground and excited state of σ + σ − . Using the solution of the off-diagonal matrix element e†ρ t g = c t e†ρ 0 g of a qubit in a photonic band gap (equation (2.21) of ref. 29 with β = −δ) we determine the Lamb shift S t and weight factor Γ t by2

$${S}_{t}=-2\{{{{{{{\rm{Im}}}}}}}}\frac{{\dot{c}}_{t}}{{c}_{t}}\\\{{{\Gamma }}}_{t}=-2\{{{{{{{\rm{Re}}}}}}}}\frac{{\dot{c}}_{t}}{{c}_{t}}$$ (17)

We also translate the origin of time to t ≈ 1.4 so that S t and Γ t vanish at time origin.

In Fig. 1a we show the time dependence of the Lindblad weight factor Γ t and the Lamb shift S t . In Fig. 1c d we show typical realizations of μ t . In particular Fig. 1d exhibits the exponential growth of μ t when Γ t is negative and in the absence of jumps. On the other hand when Γ t is positive μ t is constant in between jumps. Finally in Fig. 1c we show a realization of μ t taking negative values in consequence of a quantum jump.

Figure 2 reports the result of our numerical integration for distinct values of the initial data. We generate the quantum trajectories by mapping (6) into a linear equation as described in Methods. The (black) full lines always denote predictions from the master equation. Monte Carlo averages are over ensembles of 104 realizations. We theoretically estimate errors with twice the square root of the ensemble variance of the indicator of interest. In all cases Monte Carlo averages and master equation predictions are well within fluctuation-induced errors. The occurrence of “quantum revivals” can be also quantitatively substantiated observing that the measure of system-environment information flow introduced in ref. 54 is simply related to Γ t for this model4754. Namely equation (66) of ref. 47 relates the direction of the information flow in the model to the sign of the time derivative of ∣Γ t ∣. We perform the numerical integration using the Tsitouras 5/4 Runge-Kutta method automatically switching for stiffness detection to a 4th order A-stable Rosenbrock. The Julia code is offered ready for use in the “DifferentialEquation.jl” open source suite55.

The scatter plots show \({{{{{{{{\boldsymbol{f}}}}}}}}}_{1}^{{{{\dagger}}} }{{{{{{{{\boldsymbol{\rho }}}}}}}}}_{t}{{{{{{{{\boldsymbol{f}}}}}}}}}_{1}\) with \({{{{{{{{\boldsymbol{f}}}}}}}}}_{1}=({{{{{{{\boldsymbol{e}}}}}}}}+{{{{{{{\boldsymbol{g}}}}}}}})/\sqrt{2}\) with initial states ψ 0 = f 1 (diamonds) and \({{{{{{{{\boldsymbol{\psi }}}}}}}}}_{0}={{{{{{{{\boldsymbol{f}}}}}}}}}_{2}=({{{{{{{\boldsymbol{e}}}}}}}}-{{{{{{{\boldsymbol{g}}}}}}}})/\sqrt{2}\) (x's) and their sum (crosses) where e and g are the excited and ground state of σ + σ −  respectively. The data is obtained from 104 realizations. The continuous lines show the solutions obtained from directly integrating the master equation. The shaded area is determined by two times the square root of the ensemble variance of the indicator of interest. The starting time mesh for the adaptive code is dt = 0.03. Full size image

Next we study a qubit model with “controllable positivity” whose dynamics are governed by the master equation

$${\dot{{{{{{{{\boldsymbol{\rho }}}}}}}}}}_{t}=\mathop{\sum }\limits_{\ell =1}^{3}{{{\Gamma }}}_{\ell t}({\sigma }_{\ell }{{{{{{{{\boldsymbol{\rho }}}}}}}}}_{t}{\sigma }_{\ell }-{{{{{{{{\boldsymbol{\rho }}}}}}}}}_{t}).$$ (18)

The above equation provides a mathematical model of an all-optical setup exhibiting controllable transitions from positive-divisible to non-positive divisible evolution laws56. We focus on the case when the Lindblad weights are of the form (ℓ = 1 2 3)

$${{{\Gamma }}}_{\ell t}=-{a}_{\ell }+{b}_{\ell }\tanh ({c}_{\ell }\t)$$ (19)

We choose a ℓ  b ℓ  c ℓ > 0 such that all Lindblad weights are negative during a finite time interval around t = 0. As a consequence not only the Kossakowski conditions are violated but the rate operator57 has negative eigenvalues for the initial conditions we consider. Under these hypotheses and to the best of our knowledge only the influence martingale permits to unravel the master equation in quantum trajectories taking values in the Hilbert space of the system. Figure 3 shows the evolution in time of e†ρ t e where e is the excited state of the Pauli matrix σ 3  i.e. it has eigenvalue 1. The full (black) line is the master equation prediction the crosses show the Monte Carlo average (5) for 103 realizations and the diamonds for 104. The light green shaded area shows twice the square root of the variance for 103 realizations and the darker brown for 104. In agreement with the theory increasing the number of realizations in the ensemble evinces convergence.

Fig. 3: Illustration of the influence martingale for the random unitary model. Monte Carlo averages versus master equation predictions for the energy level populations of the random unitary model (18). The Lindblad weights are \({{{\Gamma }}}_{1t}=-0.5+2\tanh (\sqrt{2}\t)\) \({{{\Gamma }}}_{2t}=-1+2\tanh (\sqrt{3}\t)\) and \({{{\Gamma }}}_{3t}=-0.8+2\tanh (\sqrt{5}\t)\). The initial condition of the qubit is \({{{{{{{{\boldsymbol{\psi }}}}}}}}}_{0}=\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}{{{{{{{\boldsymbol{e}}}}}}}}+\frac{1}{2}{{{{{{{\boldsymbol{g}}}}}}}}\) where g e are the ground and excited state of σ 3  respectively. The black full line gives the prediction by solving the master equation (18). The crosses show the stochastic average after 103 realizations and the (light) green shaded area displays fluctuation-related errors estimated as in Fig. 2. Similarly the diamonds show the ensemble average after 104 realizations and the (dark) brown shaded area the estimated error. Full size image

As a further example of how the influence martingale associates a quantum trajectory picture even to master equations with non positive definite solutions we consider a Redfield equation model. We call Redfield a master equation of the form (1) obtained from an exact system-environment dynamics by implementing the Born–Markov approximation without a rotating wave approximation. Redfield equations are phenomenologically known to give accurate descriptions of the system dynamics at arbitrary system-environment coupling although they do not guarantee a positive time evolution of the state operator see e.g. refs. 23058. In “Methods” we outline the derivation of a Redfield equation from the exact dynamics of two non-interacting qubits in contact with a boson environment59. The result is an equation of the form (1) with only two Lindblad operators \({\left\{{{{{{{{{\rm{L}}}}}}}}}_{\ell }\right\}}_{\ell = 1}^{2}\) satisfying the commutation relations

$$[{{{{{{{{\rm{L}}}}}}}}}_{\ell }{{{{{{{{\rm{L}}}}}}}}}_{{{{{{{{\mathscr{k}}}}}}}}}^{{{{\dagger}}} }]={\delta }_{\ell {{{{{{{\mathscr{k}}}}}}}}}\[{{{{{{{{\rm{L}}}}}}}}}_{\ell }{{{{{{{{\rm{L}}}}}}}}}_{{{{{{{{\mathscr{k}}}}}}}}}]=0.$$

The corresponding weights are time independent

$${{{\Gamma }}}_{\ell t}={\lambda }_{\ell }=\frac{{\gamma }_{1}+{\gamma }_{2}+{(-1)}^{\ell }\sqrt{2}\sqrt{{\gamma }_{1}^{2}+{\gamma }_{2}^{2}+2\{\kappa }^{2}}}{4}$$ (20)

where γ 1  γ 2  κ are real numbers. We refer to Methods for the explicit expressions of H and \({\left\{{{{{{{{{\rm{L}}}}}}}}}_{\ell }\right\}}_{\ell = 1}^{2}\). Inspection of (20) shows that λ 1 is negative definite. Figure 4 shows how the influence martingale reproduces the predictions of the Redfield equation.

Fig. 4: Illustration of the influence martingale for a Redfield equation. The parameters for the model (20) are γ 1 = 1 γ 2 = 4 α = 3 and κ = 1. The initial condition is \({{{{{{{{\boldsymbol{\psi }}}}}}}}}_{0}=\sqrt{0.2}\{{{{{{{{\boldsymbol{w}}}}}}}}}_{1}+\sqrt{0.1}\{{{{{{{{\boldsymbol{w}}}}}}}}}_{2}+\sqrt{0.7}\{{{{{{{\boldsymbol{g}}}}}}}}\) where g is the ground state \({{{{{{{{\boldsymbol{w}}}}}}}}}_{1}={L}_{1}^{{{{\dagger}}} }\{{{{{{{\boldsymbol{g}}}}}}}}\) and \({{{{{{{{\boldsymbol{w}}}}}}}}}_{2}={L}_{2}^{{{{\dagger}}} }\{{{{{{{\boldsymbol{g}}}}}}}}\). The crosses diamonds and x's show the result from Monte Carlo simulations after 104 realizations. The full lines are master equation predictions and the shaded regions have the same meaning as in Fig. 2. The time mesh is dt = 0.0125. The diamonds show that ρ t is non positive definite for t > 3.

Numerical application

Simulating Large Quantum Systems was the motivation of the authors of ref. 9 for unraveling a master equation or in their words for “Monte Carlo wave-function methods”. The reason is the following. Given a \({{{{{{{\mathscr{N}}}}}}}}\)-state system numerical integration of the master equation requires to store \(O({{{{{{{{\mathscr{N}}}}}}}}}^{2})\) real numbers so that the computing time typically scales as \(O({{{{{{{{\mathscr{N}}}}}}}}}^{4})\). Unraveling the state operator as the average over state vectors generated by a Markov process requires to store only \(O(2\{{{{{{{\mathscr{N}}}}}}}})\) real numbers for each realization. This means that the computing time scales as \(O({{{{{{{{\mathscr{N}}}}}}}}}^{2}\\times \{{{{{{{\mathscr{M}}}}}}}})\) where \({{{{{{{\mathscr{M}}}}}}}}\) is the number of realizations or just \(O({{{{{{{{\mathscr{N}}}}}}}}}^{2})\) on a parallel processor3. Thus in high dimensional Hilbert spaces also due to the existence of efficient numerical algorithms for stochastic differential equations44 ensemble averages are expected to offer a real advantage for numerical computation2348. It is worth noticing that the reasoning is very similar to that motivating the use of Lagrangian in place of Eulerian numerical methods in the context of classical hydrodynamics see e.g. ref. 60.

To exhibit that the argument applies to the influence martingale we compare computing times versus the dimension of the Hilbert space using QuTiP43 a standard numerical toolbox for open quantum systems. Specifically we take a chain of \({{{{{{{\mathscr{N}}}}}}}}\) coupled qubits and directly integrate the master equation using QuTiP. Next we perform the same calculation using the QuTiP package for Monte Carlo wave-function methods combined with the implementation of the influence martingale. To do so we choose the rates in (8) as we detail below.

In (1) we take \({{{{{{{\mathscr{L}}}}}}}}=2\{{{{{{{\mathscr{N}}}}}}}}\) where the Lindblad operator L ℓ for \(\ell =1\ldots {{{{{{{\mathscr{N}}}}}}}}\) is the tensor product of the lowering operator of the ℓth qubit with the identity acting on the Hilbert space of the remaining qubits. Thus we set

$${{{{{{{{\rm{L}}}}}}}}}_{\ell }={\sigma }_{-}^{(\ell )}\\\{{{{{{{{\rm{L}}}}}}}}}_{\ell +{{{{{{{\mathscr{N}}}}}}}}}={\sigma }_{+}^{(\ell )}\\\\ell =1\ldots {{{{{{{\mathscr{N}}}}}}}}$$ (21)

The Hamiltonian is

$${{{{{{{\rm{H}}}}}}}}=\mathop{\sum }\limits_{\ell =1}^{{{{{{{{\mathscr{N}}}}}}}}}{\sigma }_{+}^{(\ell )}{\sigma }_{-}^{(\ell )}+\lambda \mathop{\sum }\limits_{\ell =1}^{{{{{{{{\mathscr{N}}}}}}}}-1}({\sigma }_{+}^{(\ell )}{\sigma }_{-}^{(\ell +1)}+{\sigma }_{+}^{(\ell +1)}{\sigma }_{-}^{(\ell )})$$ (22)

For the sake of simplicity we assume that the Lindblad weights in (1) are all strictly positive definite with the only exception of Γ 1t which can take negative values. For any ℓ different from 1 and \({{{{{{{\mathscr{N}}}}}}}}+1\) we choose the rates of the counting processes (8)

$${{{{{{{{\mathscr{r}}}}}}}}}_{\ell t}={{{\Gamma }}}_{\ell t} > 0\\\\\\ell

e 1{{{{{{{\mathscr{N}}}}}}}}+1$$ (23)

Next we use the fact that given a collection of scalars \({{{{{{{{\mathscr{w}}}}}}}}}_{\ell }\) on the real axis it is always possible to find an equal number of positive definite scalars \({{{{{{{{\mathscr{r}}}}}}}}}_{\ell }\) and a negative definite real c such that the set of equations

$${{{{{{{{\mathscr{w}}}}}}}}}_{\ell }={{{{{{{{\mathscr{r}}}}}}}}}_{\ell }+c$$ (24)

is satisfied. We therefore set for any t

$${{{\Gamma }}}_{1t}={{{{{{{{\mathscr{r}}}}}}}}}_{1t}+{c}_{t}$$ (25)

$${{{\Gamma }}}_{1+{{{{{{{\mathscr{N}}}}}}}}t}={{{{{{{{\mathscr{r}}}}}}}}}_{1+{{{{{{{\mathscr{N}}}}}}}}t}+{c}_{t}$$ (26)

where now \({{{{{{{{\mathscr{r}}}}}}}}}_{1t}\) and \({{{{{{{{\mathscr{r}}}}}}}}}_{1+{{{{{{{\mathscr{N}}}}}}}}t}\) specify the rates of the counting processes dν 1t and \({{{{{{{\rm{d}}}}}}}}{

u }_{1+{{{{{{{\mathscr{N}}}}}}}}t}\). As the Lindblad operators satisfy

$${\sigma }_{+}^{(1)}{\sigma }_{-}^{(1)}+{\sigma }_{-}^{(1)}{\sigma }_{+}^{(1)}={{{{{{{{\rm{1}}}}}}}}}_{{{{{{{{\mathcal{H}}}}}}}}}$$ (27)

on the Bloch hyper-sphere (∥ψ t ∥2 = 1) we simplify the drift in (6) using the identity

$${{{\Gamma }}}_{1t}\frac{{\sigma }_{+}^{(1)}{\sigma }_{-}^{(1)}-{\left\Vert {\sigma }_{-}^{(1)}{{{{{{{{\boldsymbol{\psi }}}}}}}}}_{t}\right\Vert }^{2}}{2}{{{{{{{{\boldsymbol{\psi }}}}}}}}}_{t}+{{{\Gamma }}}_{1+{{{{{{{\mathscr{N}}}}}}}}t}\frac{{\sigma }_{-}^{(1)}{\sigma }_{+}^{(1)}-{\left\Vert {\sigma }_{+}^{(1)}{{{{{{{{\boldsymbol{\psi }}}}}}}}}_{t}\right\Vert }^{2}}{2}{{{{{{{{\boldsymbol{\psi }}}}}}}}}_{t}\\ ={{{{{{{{\mathscr{r}}}}}}}}}_{1t}\frac{{\sigma }_{+}^{(1)}{\sigma }_{-}^{(1)}-{\left\Vert {\sigma }_{-}^{(1)}{{{{{{{{\boldsymbol{\psi }}}}}}}}}_{t}\right\Vert }^{2}}{2}{{{{{{{{\boldsymbol{\psi }}}}}}}}}_{t}+{{{{{{{{\mathscr{r}}}}}}}}}_{1+{{{{{{{\mathscr{N}}}}}}}}t}\frac{{\sigma }_{-}^{(1)}{\sigma }_{+}^{(1)}-{\left\Vert {\sigma }_{+}^{(1)}{{{{{{{{\boldsymbol{\psi }}}}}}}}}_{t}\right\Vert }^{2}}{2}{{{{{{{{\boldsymbol{\psi }}}}}}}}}_{t}$$ (28)

We conclude that the state operator evolves on the Bloch hyper-sphere according to the same stochastic Schrödinger equation of ref. 9. We can therefore directly use the Monte Carlo wave function package of QuTiP for computing the evolution of the state vector. Using this information we compute the influence martingale for each trajectory and finally the state operator. We refer to Methods for further details.

Figure 5 shows the populations of several sites for \({{{{{{{\mathscr{N}}}}}}}}=11\). The computation time is shown in Fig. 6a. At \({{{{{{{\mathscr{N}}}}}}}}=10\) we observe a cross-over of the computation time curves. After \({{{{{{{\mathscr{N}}}}}}}}=11\) the influence martingale based algorithm becomes more efficient without applying any adapted optimization. From 12 qubits on direct integration of the master equation becomes unwieldy (Apple M1 CPU). With the influence martingale even 13 coupled qubits take only a few minutes of computation time. Most of the computation time is due to generating the trajectories. The actual computation of the martingale takes 0.19s for \({{{{{{{\mathscr{N}}}}}}}}=2\) and 0.42s for \({{{{{{{\mathscr{N}}}}}}}}=11\). The number of realizations is always 103. Figure 6b shows the root mean square error of site occupations averaged over all sites. The error stays approximately constant when \({{{{{{{\mathscr{N}}}}}}}}\) increases.

Theoretical application

In experimental quantum optics photo-current is usually defined as the average number of detection events per unit of time. The stochastic differentials (7) mathematically describe increments of the photocurrent associated to detection events corresponding to transitions induced by the Lindblad operator L ℓ in (1)3.

The study of time-dependent transport properties of photo-excited undoped super-lattices highlighted the phenomenon of photo-current oscillations61. Photo-current oscillations naturally come about when working with the time convolutionless master equation with non positive Lindblad weights. In such a case and under standard hypotheses (see “Methods”) it is straightforward to verify that a system governed by an Hamiltonian \({{{{{{{{\rm{H}}}}}}}}}_{{\mathfrak{0}}}\) when isolated satisfies when the coupled to an environment the energy balance equation

The company said that the PDR was part of a technical process to ensure that its design can realize a precise low-cost speed-of-light technology for military operations.

In March 2021 the US Department of Defense (DoD) awarded Northrop Grumman a $72 million contract under the High Energy Laser Scaling Initiative (HELSI) to demonstrate a HEL prototype using Northrop Grumman’s coherent beam combining technology.

The HELSI is a Pentagon initiative to develop a new 300-kilowatt-class laser weapon prototype for technology demonstration.

“This is an important step in combining high-power laser beams into a single beam that can be scaled for maximum power” said Robert Fleming vice president and general manager strategic space systems Northrop Grumman.

“We’re on track to demonstrate the technology leveraging our decades of experience in the field.”

According to the company the prototype can be scaled up to more than a megawatt. It will be tested at progressively higher powers later this year to prove the coherent beam combining (CBC) design.

Beam combining involves combining the outputs of multiple laser sources to obtain a single high-energy output beam. In contrast ‘Coherent’ beam incorporation would involve the merger of coherent waves – waves with a constant phase difference.

Another method to fuse two laser beams is ‘Spectral’ beam combining (SBC) also known as wavelength beam combining which involves superimposing the outputs of several laser emitters at specific wavelengths in an area to form a single beam.

The SBC technology was used by Lockheed Martin and its subsidiary Aculight Corporation to demonstrate a series of laser weapon prototypes: first the 30 kilowatts then 60 kilowatts and ultimately 100 kilowatts in October 2019 which then also won them a HELSI contract to demonstrate a 300 kilowatts class laser in 2022.

Lockheed Martin is only one of the three companies participating in the HELSI initiative led by the Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD) and the US Army promotes it. Other companies are Nutronics Inc. sponsored by the Navy and General Atomics sponsored by the US Air Force (USAF).

In May 2020 Dynetics also announced that it would work to increase the power of a 100 kW-class system to the 300kW-class system for the US Army and demonstrate a prototype in 2022.

High-Energy Lasers US Military’s Top Priority

The incorporation of laser weapons technology is currently one of the high-priority targets of the US military especially after the US lawmakers asked the armed services to speed up efforts toward developing Directed Energy Weapons (DEWs) in early July.

The US Army plans to have two types of laser weapons systems for air defense by 2022 which include the 50 kilowatts class weapons and 300 kilowatts class weapons fitted on Stryker armored vehicles manufactured by General Dynamics.

The 50-kilowatt laser weapon is designated as the DE-MSHORAD (Directed Energy – Maneuver Short-Range Air Defense) which will be used to shoot short-range rockets artillery and drones. In contrast the 300 kilowatts beams will be used against cruise missiles.

Initially Northrop Grumman and Raytheon competed for the 50-kilowatt laser weapon system. Still Northrop Grumman dropped out of the program while Raytheon recently demonstrated its prototype in May against 60-millimeter mortars and several small medium and large drones.

Meanwhile the US Air Force received its first high-energy laser weapon on July 12 called LANCE (or Laser Advancements for Next-generation Compact Environments) from Lockheed Martin.

LANCE is a pod weapon that can be fitted on an aircraft with the primary laser weapon supplied by Lockheed Martin and the pod carrying LANCE made by Boeing. Also the beam control system that trains the laser on its target is provided by Northrop Grumman.

It is unclear how much power this new laser weapon will produce but reports indicate it will probably not exceed 100 kilowatts.

US Navy

The US Navy hopes to start fielding its new Columbia-class missile subs over the next decade.

The Columbia-class program is already facing problems including delays and cost overruns.

Those headwinds have the Navy considering extending the lives of its aging Ohio-class subs.

On June 4 the US Navy laid the keel for USS District of Columbia the first of its new Columbia-class nuclear-powered ballistic-missile submarines at an Electric Boat facility in Quonset Point Rhode Island.

The high-profile event was attended by both Adm. Daryl Caudle commander of US Fleet Forces Command and Secretary of the Navy Carlos Del Toro who said the Columbia class ""will be the cornerstone of our strategic deterrence"" and ""the ultimate guarantor of our national security.""

Lingering over this major milestone however are longstanding problems for the Columbia program — unexpected delays and technical difficulties that may limit the Navy's ability to deliver nuclear and conventional missiles.

Compounding these problems is a recent report from the Government Accountability Office that in addition to cataloging difficulties in the Columbia program noted that the program's overall cost has increased by another $3.4 billion to a projected $112 billion.

With nuclear-powered ballistic-missile submarines (classified as SSBNs) carrying 70% of America's deployed nuclear arsenal the prospect of delays has led the Navy to consider extending the life of some of its older SSBNs even though some are close to the end of their own service lives.

The Columbia class

At 560 feet long 43 feet wide and displacing 20810 tons the Columbia class will be the largest submarines ever built by the US.

In addition to Mk 48 Advanced Capability torpedoes the subs will carry 16 Trident II D5 submarine-launched ballistic missiles each of which has a range of over 7500 miles and can carry up to eight multiple independently targetable reentry vehicles.

The boats will have a service life of 42 years and have a number of upgrades and improvements over their Ohio-class predecessors including ""superior acoustic performance and state-of-the-art sensors to make it the most capable and quiet submarine ever built"" according to the Navy.

One significant improvement is that each Columbia-class boat's reactor will not ever need to refuel during the planned service life making the reactors more cost-efficient and allowing the subs to be operational for longer periods.

The Columbia-class is also being developed jointly with the British Royal Navy's Dreadnaught-class SSBN. Both classes will have the Common Missile Compartment a section of the submarines jointly developed by US-based Electric Boat and UK-based BAE Systems that will house the SLBMs. Both boats will also be armed with the Trident II D5s.

The Navy plans to build a total of 12 Columbia-class boats. Construction of USS District of Columbia is now underway and construction of the second USS Wisconsin will start in March 2024.

The Ohio class

The US Navy's Ohio-class subs are currently the largest American submarines. They are slightly smaller than the Columbia-class will be measuring 560 feet long and 42 feet wide and displacing 18750 tons but Ohio-class subs are more heavily armed than the Columbias with four torpedo tubes and 24 Trident II D-5 SLBMs.







Eighteen Ohio-class SSBNs were built between 1976 and 1997. In 2002 the Navy determined that it could meet US strategic nuclear needs with 14 Ohios and decided to convert the four oldest boats — USS Ohio USS Michigan USS Florida and USS Georgia — into cruise-missile submarines.

Reclassified SSGNs these boats traded their torpedoes and ballistic missiles for up to 154 Tomahawk land-attack cruise missiles which are launched from the subs' refitted missile tubes.

Two of the tubes were converted into swimmer lockout chambers which along with the ability to mount a dry-deck shelter holding a SEAL Delivery Vehicle or inflatable boats allows the SSGNs to carry and deploy 66 special-operations troops for covert missions.

The Ohios originally had service lives of just 30 years but because they perform such a vital mission the Navy increased that to 42 years.

Possible extension

USS District of Columbia is planned to be delivered in 2027 with initial operating capability expected in June 2030 and its first patrol in 2031. The Ohios all but five of which have been in service for 30 years or longer are expected to be decommissioned between 2027 and 2040.

That is a tight timeframe especially considering the importance of SSBNs in the US's nuclear posture. Cost overruns and delays in major Navy acquisition programs are not uncommon and the Navy is now thinking about extending the lives of up to five Ohio SSBNs in case its new subs run into trouble.

""We're doing evaluations right now on what it would take to do a short repair availability — short-ish repair availability — to extend those ships for a couple of years as a risk mitigator if need be"" Rear Adm. Scott Pappano program executive officer for strategic submarines said at an event hosted by the Advanced Nuclear Weapons Alliance Deterrence Center in May.

The four Ohio-class SSGNs the youngest of which is 38 years old are to be replaced by the Virginia-class Block V nuclear-powered attack subs.

The Block V Virginias are designed with an 84-foot extension known as the Virginia Payload Module which adds four tubes capable of firing seven missiles each allowing the new subs to launch 65 torpedo-size weapons.

Ohio-class SSGNs also have an important role in the US arsenal and Pappano said the Navy is considering extending their service lives as well.

""Until that [Block V Virginia] comes online we want to make sure we have the missile-shooter capability in the SSGNs for as long as we can but it's going to be a delicate balancing act of maintaining the current SSBN fleet vs. extending the SSGN fleet"" Pappano said in May.

The Government Accountability Office report complicates things. In addition to a ballooning price the report said the Navy has assessed that there is ""medium risk"" to the Columbia program's ability to meet its accelerated building schedule.

The report identified construction issues and disruptions caused by Covid-19 as reasons for potential delays on the Columbias. Shipbuilders have also pulled workers from the Virginia-class program to work on the Columbia class contributing to delays on the newest Virginias. These factors increase the likelihood that Ohio-class SSGNs will need to remain in service.

For now the Ohio-class life-extension plan is only in the evaluation stage. Construction continues on the Columbia-class which the Navy has said is its top priority.

""The venerable Ohio-class that has guarded us for decades is nearing the end of its service life"" Del Toro said at the keel-laying ceremony in June. ""For the safety of our sailors and the security of our world we must modernize our fleet."""

Shore Conference 2022 MLB Draft Hopeful Profile

Chris Sparber Louisberg College (N.C.)

High School (Graduation Year): Red Bank Catholic (2020 – Season Canceled due to COVID)

College Plans: Virginia Tech

2022 Stats: .433/.512/.851 15 2B 1 3B 14 HR 45 R 57 RBI 9 SB

HS Junior-Year Stats: .282/.424/.359 4 2B 1 3B 15 R 17 RBI 5 SB

High School Resume

Sparber showed a lot of promise during his sophomore season at Red Bank Catholic when he took over the starting catcher job midseason and hit .348 while slugging three home runs. His junior year was more of a struggle as he hit under .300 and did not go deep. Sparber seemed poised for a big senior year after putting in a lot of offseason work in the cage but never got the change to show it due to the cancelation of the 2020 season.

After High School

Sparber was able to latch on at Louisburg College in North Carolina and finally got to put all that hard work in the cage to good use. The RBC grad just finished his second monster season at the junior college slashing .429/.516/.843 with 26 home runs and 104 RBI in 266 plate appearances over the past two seasons. On top of the dominant production Sparber walked more than he struck out and improved his defense behind the plate between his freshman and sophomore seasons.

Why Teams Like Him

Sparber showed he can indeed hit over his two Juco seasons and while he has also shown enough behind the plate to give him a chance back there as a pro the big hitting performance will also give him a chance to play elsewhere on the diamond without putting him at a disadvantage. He hits the ball hard and in the air which is what teams are looking for out of hitters at the big-league level. If he can indeed hold his own behind the plate any team that takes a shot on him could have a nice prospect on their hands.

Why Teams Might Hesitate

While the numbers were robust they did come at the Juco level so they should be taken with a healthy dose of skepticism. It’s not to say they should be ignored: more and more junior college is producing significant Division I contributors who go on to become significant contributors within Major League organizations. There is just a filtration process that scouting departments have to go through and Sparber is now going through it.

The good news for the former Casey is Virginia Tech is sold on him. Sparber is set to join the Hokies this fall and will have a great shot to start at catcher for a team that won the regular-season conference title and reached the Super Regionals of the NCAA Tournament in 2022. That will be the likely route for Sparber but if a Major League club is as convinced of his ability anywhere near the level that Virginia Tech is he will have to listen to their pitch.

In a notice published days ago by Massy Distribution on behalf of General Mills International the company indicated that the ice-cream products in Barbados were recalled “due to non-compliance from a vanilla extract supplier”.

The recall advisory from General Mills International Food Safety and Quality in Miami Florida affects its Haagen-Dazs Plain Vanilla ice-cream products sold here. They were found to contain trace amounts of ethylene oxide (ETO) in two batches.

According to the United States Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) ethylene oxide is a flammable gas with a somewhat sweet odour. The CDC noted that exposure to ethylene oxide may cause headache nausea vomiting diarrhea breathing difficulty drowsiness weakness exhaustion eye and skin burns and reproductive effects.

Haagen-Dazs is regarded as a premium brand product and the company said it undertook a “thorough investigation” into the root of the contamination which was traced back to a vanilla extract provided by one of General Mills’ suppliers.

As a result the consumer giant said it was “taking the precautionary step of voluntarily recalling all affected batches of Haagen-Dazs from all points of sale in Barbados”.

The company said the levels of ethylene oxide found in the vanilla ice-cream imported to Barbados “marginally exceed analytical detection limits”.

Haagen-Dezs stressed that it does not use ethylene oxide in any of its products adding that the ice-cream maker adheres “to all food safety regulations and strict standards in every market in which we operated including Barbados”.

The vanilla products affected have best buy expiry dates between 05/07/2022 and 18/7/2023.

The company added that customers who purchased one of the products can take the product or receipt back to the place of purchase for a full refund and can contact General Mills at www.generalmills.com/VanillaRecall for any queries or Massy Distribution.

The company said no other products are affected by the recall. (IMC1)"

The automaker gave the customers a $5500 discount on the purchase or lease of the Lyriq according to two sources familiar with the plan who did not have authority to speak on details of it. The select customers signed a nondisclosure agreement that prohibits them from discussing with any parties outside of GM their experience of owning or driving one of the first Lyriqs.

Cadillac spokesman Michael Albano confirmed the program saying he believes GM is the first automaker to tap customers — versus employees — in real-time in their new cars so as to study their driving patterns and behavior.

“As we transform our business the launch of our first all-electric vehicle Lyriq provides Cadillac some unique learning opportunities"" Albano told the Free Press. ""Therefore we have engaged a small group of early customers who agree to share their vehicle information and customer behaviors. Cadillac will use these learnings to elevate the experience for all our customers.”

A 'private agreement'

Albano also said the importance of the Lyriq to Cadillac's future as the brand transitions to all-electric by 2030 cannot be overstated.

The Lyriq which is being built at GM's Spring Hill Assembly plant in Tennessee is one of GM's first EVs to use the Ultium battery propulsion system that will underpin 29 other new EVs GM will bring to market in the next few years. The 2022 GMC Hummer pickup which started rolling out late last year also uses Ultium.

Last week Cadillac of Novi got the first production Lyriq in the world delivered to its showroom. The dealer sold the vehicle on Thursday to the customer who ordered it earlier in the year. Cadillac had sent out engineers to show the dealership's technicians how to service the vehicle and it got extra prepping — the ""white glove treatment"" Albano said.

""We’re doing everything possible to get this launch right"" Albano said. ""It is a critical launch.""

That includes coming up with the idea for the study that tracks early adopters.

Earlier this summer GM's luxury brand quietly pushed the Cadillac Lyriq Targeted Private Offer to certain customers as first reported June 30 by Carsdirect.com. In a dealer bulletin last month Cadillac said the program was available nationally and that GM offered select customers a $5500 cash allowance on the 2023 Lyriq when buying or leasing from June 28 through Aug. 31 according to Carsdirect.com.

The rear-wheel drive Lyriq starts at $62990 a $3000 price bump from the Lyriq Debut edition. The all-wheel drive model starts at $64990. Initial deliveries of the all-wheel drive model will start early next year.

The bulletin said Carsdirect.com stopped short of saying who was eligible or why GM had such a deal going.

But a Cadillac dealer familiar with the program told the Free Press this week that in exchange for the rebate the selected customers agreed to be part of an early adopters' study and give Cadillac access to their driving patterns. The dealer asked to not be identified because he is not authorized to speak for Cadillac.

Albano said there are about 20 customers that were chosen for the program. He declined to outline the parameters for how participants were selected but Albano said they are mostly located within the New York Detroit and Los Angeles areas and are ""early adopters; they're tech savvy and they want the first and the best.""

""The number of customers involved is intentionally very small"" Albano said in an email. ""We will use the program to learn more about customer behaviors and their vehicles. Beyond that the details of the program are a private agreement between the customer and Cadillac.""

All of GM 'up for evaluation'

Cadillac opened the order banks for the Lyriq on May 19 but in two hours it stopped taking orders for the 2023 Lyriq saying it sold out. GM will not quantify what sold out means but earlier this year GM told suppliers to prepare to produce 25000 Lyriqs this year.

GM's luxury brand has a lot riding on the Lyriq being a success.

“The Lyriq is really important to Cadillac. Really important” said Erik Gordon a business professor at the University of Michigan's Ross School of Business. “If this works the Cadillac brand moves forward. If it doesn’t work someone’s going to lose their head at Cadillac and they’re going to have to figure out what to do to make the brand relevant.""

So it's no surprise that GM is taking an extra step with this unprecedented customer study to protect the brand Gordon said. Still it's an unusual and bold move typically seen in industries outside of autos he said. Technology industries he said will launch beta versions of their software to customers for feedback and to make tweaks and updates before launching the mass version for example.

""I don't know of any other instance of this in the car business. But I kind of get it"" Gordon said. ""You come out with a new product and new platform. You like to gather data. I think it’s more realistic to gather data from nonemployees; you get a wider variety of people and people who are not so gung-ho. You get real world data.”

And making customers sign a nondisclosure agreement makes sense too because “you don’t want people to blab about your experiment” said Gordon who is also a lawyer and said the agreement is legal in this case and enforceable.

Albano explained GM's motive to do this study simply as GM is changing not only its lineup to all-electric but reinventing its go-to-market strategy and ""every part of our business is up for evaluation. There's not a single part of our business that we're not transforming.""

Albano said Cadillac has historically done vehicle studies with employees.

""But there's a lot we can learn from customers beyond the physical vehicle"" Albano said. ""We can see their charging behaviors driving behaviors and how they use the vehicle.""

Albano said GM will use ""a variety of ways to gather information from the customers"" including direct phone calls dealer contacts and a dedicated EV concierge team. He did not have more specifics including how long the agreement lasts what the penalty is for violating it and whether GM will monitor vehicle software to gather data.

Troubleshooting issues

Several Cadillac dealers told the Free Press they support the customer study calling it smart because it could help Cadillac spot and fix any production or engineering bugs early on and it provides Cadillac knowledge of customer driving behavior to make future improvements on vehicles.

And it could help GM avoid massive recalls of a newly launched vehicle such as that of Ford Motor Co. which in June issued a recall affecting 48924 of the 2021-22 Mustang Mach-E vehicles built during a two-year period. The EV could lose power while driving or not start.

On Monday three owners of the recalled Mach-E filed a federal lawsuit against Ford saying the Dearborn automaker has known of a design flaw in its electric vehicles that causes the power loss while driving but has not figured out how to fix the problem.

""You want to fix the first 100 of them you don’t want to do a big recall"" Gordon said of new-vehicle launches. ""A recall is expensive and it hurts the brand.""

Not your father's customer

Ivan Drury worked in product planning at American Honda Motor Co. well before his current role as senior manager of insights at Edmunds.com. At Honda the company held focus groups with customers or hired third-party research firms to poll customers and do dependability studies he said.

But GM's program is ""the first time I’ve heard of it to this extent” Drury said. But he applauds it. ""With data they collect through the vehicle they can actually verify things. If they are looking through a true lens — then this is the way to go"" he said.

Drury also understands why GM would want the participants to sign a nondisclosure agreement but he hopes the customers understand it could mean that GM is ""going to watch everything you do all the features you use every mile you drive how much do you charge do they need this much range? You can get some powerful data sets. (GM's) not wasting their money.”

Drury called the Lyriq ""one of the most important launches in the last decade"" and said GM should monitor all it can in the vehicles.

GM would have to wait too long if it commissioned an outside company to do a study on customer reaction to the Lyriq or its performance Drury said. Eager tech-savvy customers want flawless technology fast. They lack the patience and tolerance of traditional car buyers.

""This is a different kind of customer"" Drury said.

So General Motors decided to drop a V-12 into the 'Vette as a possible way to compete.

First spotted by Road & Track this video from YouTube channel DtRockstar1 shows the V-12 Corvette prototype—dubbed ""ZR-12""—at the National Corvette Museum in Bowling Green Kentucky. The prototype is fully drivable and sounds fantastic.

That sound is generated by a 600-cubic-inch (roughly 10.0-liter) V-12 built by Ryan Falconer Racing Engines. The all-aluminum engine produced a claimed 686 hp and 680 lb-ft of torque when new—eclipsing the contemporary Viper's 400 hp and 450 lb-ft of torque—and weighed about the same as an iron-block V-8.

Per the video the ZR-12 also managed an 11.6-second quarter mile run at 133 mph in a March 1993 Motor Trend test.

When new the ZR-12 even had Viper-like side pipes although these were subsequently removed. Today the car has a dual exhaust system more like that of a stock C4 Corvette. The wheels were changed at some point as well.

The ZR-12 never went into production. Chevy had already spent a lot of time and money developing the 380-hp V-8 Corvette ZR-1 which along with later Z06 and ZR1 (minus the hyphen) variants took the fight to the Viper. Today the Viper is gone but Chevy is about to launch the 2023 Corvette Z06 with a 670-hp flat-plane crank V-8. Future Corvettes are expected to use a hybrid powertrain combining a V-8 and electric motors and an all-electric powertrain for extra power so it's unlikely that we'll ever see another factory-backed attempt at a V-12 Corvette.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMid2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxhbnNpbmdzdGF0ZWpvdXJuYWwuY29tL3N0b3J5L25ld3MvMjAyMi8wNy8xNi93aHktZ20tbGFuc2luZy1kZWx0YS10b3duc2hpcC1zaHV0dGluZy1kb3duLXdlZWsvMTAwNzcwMTIwMDIv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Why GM Lansing Delta Township is shutting down for a week,"General Motors Lansing Delta Township Assembly will be closed the week of July 18 due to supply chain disruptions.

The automaker is pausing production at the Delta Township plant because of semiconductor constraints that are impacting the industry globally according to General Motors Senior Manager of Communications Erin Davis.

""Our production in North America has been relatively strong and stable since the third quarter of last year. However short-term supply chain disruptions continue to occur which has led us to make these production adjustments"" Davis said in an emailed statement. ""We are actively working with our suppliers to resolve issues as they arise to meet pent up customer demand for our vehicles.""

The plant builds the Chevrolet Traverse and Buick Enclave.

Production is expected to resume on Monday July 25 according to Davis.

This is not the first halt in production at the plant this year. It was temporarily shut down in February due to protests at the U.S. and Canadian border and the plant also had scheduled closures for facility modifications.

The Lansing Grand River GM plant is not being affected by the shutdown.

I entered the field of clinical operations and development because I was motivated by the idea of contributing to making innovative medicines available to people impacted by life-threatening diseases. During my career I’ve worked for both a large pharmaceutical company in clinical development and clinical operations as well as a mid-sized company where I was part of the global leadership team and helped establish an EU-based corporate office.

When looking at opportunities to continue to grow professionally I was keen to join a company with innovative medicines and a strong pipeline. I also have interest and experience in progressing clinical trials in virology and oncology – which are two of Gilead’s therapeutic areas – and it was an inspiring proposition to help lead efforts to make the company’s medicines available to more children living with these serious diseases. Therefore I was excited to join Gilead’s Pediatric Drug Development Centre of Excellence and to have the opportunity to build out the Clinical Operations team.

Q: How would you describe the company’s culture?

One of the things that attracted me to Gilead was the company’s Core Values. Since joining Gilead I’ve come to see just how embedded these values are in everything we do and how they continue to shape our culture providing the foundation for how we conduct our daily work and strive to deliver medicines with the highest quality and ethical standards. These values help create a culture that enables everyone to be themselves do their best work and play a role in the company’s success.

Q: What was your most memorable day at Gilead and what made it special?

My most memorable day was the official opening of our Global Pediatric Drug Development Centre of Excellence in Dublin on April 5 2022. It was exciting to be part of this day representing the company’s growth in Ireland to celebrate the opening with members of the Gilead Leadership Team and to listen to our leaders speak about the company’s commitment to making innovative medicines available to children.

Q: How did you approach building out your team at the Global Pediatric Drug Development Centre of Excellence?

Dublin has really become a global life science hub with the clinical academic and regulatory expertise here so we were fortunate to have access to a large pool of experienced professionals from Ireland and beyond. In building out our strong and talented Clinical Operations team we prioritized inclusion and diversity in terms of background stage of career experience and more with the belief that having diverse voices at the table leads to optimal results in drug development.

Q: Why is working at Gilead more than ‘just a job’?

Our team is at the heart of Gilead’s efforts to make our innovative medicines available to more children around the world. The data we generate from pediatric studies is so critical to receiving the approvals needed to make this a reality so we feel the potential impact of this work on a daily basis. When you stop and think about the children parents and caregivers who stand to benefit from this work it’s far more than just a job.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiMmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5hdHVyZS5jb20vYXJ0aWNsZXMvczQxNDA5LTAyMi0wMTc2My140gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,SARS-CoV-2 infection in a stem cell transplant recipient grafted from a SARS-CoV-2-positive donor | Bone Marrow ...,"Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) recipients are at a high risk of severe disease from SARS-CoV-2 infection with a mortality rate ranging from 22 to 25% [1 2]. Therefore the European Bone Marrow Transplantation guidelines recommend that HSCT be deferred until a patient is asymptomatic and has two negative polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests [3 4].

A 63-year-old female was diagnosed with very high-risk myelodysplastic syndrome according to the Revised International Prognostic Scoring System (pancytopenia bone marrow blasts 10% trisomy 8). Her past medical history was negative and had not been vaccinated for SARS-CoV-2. She achieved a partial response after five azacytidine cycles and was considered eligible for an allogeneic peripheral blood stem cell (PBSC) transplantation from her HLA-identical 57-year-old brother. Although at admission her PCR SARS-CoV-2 nasopharyngeal swab was negative on day –2 after having completed the myeloablative preparative regimen her monitoring swab was positive and confirmed by a second swab test. She was asymptomatic had had no contact with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 cases nor had she traveled to high-risk areas. Moreover no visitors could enter the HSCT unit since November 2021. At PBSC collection the donor who was fully vaccinated had a positive SARS-CoV-2 swab. The Omicron variant was identified by next-generation sequencing in both the patient’s and donor’s nasopharyngeal swabs while only the recipient had viral RNA load in plasma. However PBSC infusion could not be postponed as the myeloablative regimen had already been completed. The recipient was administered unmanipulated PBSC containing 5.93 × 106/kg CD34+ cells and 2.64 × 108/kg CD3+ cells on day 0. GVHD prophylaxis included cyclosporine A and a short-course methotrexate with no ex vivo T-cell depletion.

A brief episode of desaturation occurred on day +1. The patient had neither fever nor cough and negative inflammation markers. No opacity or interstitial injury was evidenced at chest radiography and lung echography. High-flow nasal cannula therapy was discontinued two days later as arterial blood gas analysis evidenced normal oxygen saturation in room air. Although this post-transplant episode ran a mild course it was not possible to exclude a correlation with SARS-CoV-2 as the patient’s swabs continued to be positive. Consequently she was administered low-dose steroid (i.v. methylprednisolone at 0.5 mg/kg/day for 5 days) and remdesivir at 100 mg per day for 5 days. Severe thrombocytopenia excluded antithrombotic prophylaxis.

Neutrophil engraftment was achieved on day +21 and complete donor chimerism was documented by fluorescent in situ hybridization on unfractionated peripheral blood cells (99.6%) CD3+ T cells (98.2%) and CD19+ B cells (99.6%) on day +30. She was discharged on self-isolation on day +31 and finally cleared the virus on day +46.

The recipient’s IgG anti-spike protein (anti-S) titer was low at day 0 before PBSC infusion (132 BAU/ml LIAISON® SARS-CoV-2 S1/S2 IgG indirect chemiluminescent immunoassay – DiaSorin Saluggia Italy) and showed an upward trend until day +30 (IgG anti-S >2080 BAU/ml). Noteworthy serum IgG rose on day +5 (439 BAU/ml) supporting the passive transfer of donor humoral immunity through the stem cell product.

The T-cell response to SARS-CoV-2 was assessed by interferon-γ release fluorescence immunoassay Covi-FERON FIA (SD BIOSENSOR ReLab Republic of Korea). Briefly heparinized whole blood was incubated in test tubes for 16–24 h at 37 °C after which plasma was harvested and tested for the presence of interferon-γ produced in response to the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein derived from Alpha Beta and Gamma variants (B.1.1.7 B.1.351 and P.1 respectively) and the Nucleocapsid protein (antigen N). The recipient’s Covi-FERON test was non-reactive on day +7 whilst the donor had had a strong response to all antigens (day –1). Although the recipient’s CD4+ and CD8+ counts were low on day +30 (178 and 11 respectively) there was a significant T-lymphocyte response to the spike proteins but not to the nucleocapsid (Fig. 1).

The top row shows the days before and after hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) when the conditioning regimen and antiviral therapy were administered. Below the results of the recipient and donor SARS-CoV-2 tests are reported: SARS-CoV-2 nasopharyngeal swab (SARS-CoV-2 NP-swab); immunoglobulins G anti-SARS-CoV-2 levels (IgG); SARS-CoV-2 interferon-γ release assay (Covi-FERON) tested to the Alpha spike protein Beta and Gamma spike proteins and nucleocapsid antigen; B.1.1.529 SARS-CoV-2 viremia (Omicron variant). Full size image

To the best of our knowledge this is the first reported case of a SARS-CoV-2 infection in an allogeneic HSCT recipient whose donor was also SARS-CoV-2 positive.

Few reports have described HSCT patients with concomitant COVID-19 disease in the pre-engraftment and early post-engraftment phases. Some studies reported that HSCT recipients with COVID-19 disease have a poor outcome but they were carried out during the period 2020-2021 when the predominant variants were Alpha and Delta [1 2 5]. Although the mutations identified in the Omicron spike protein (about 37) have led to serious concerns over antibody responses [6 7] it seems that most T-cell immune responses are retained potentially underpinning protection from a severe disease [6 8 9]. A recent study on vaccinated subjects evidenced a significant decrease in memory B cells and neutralizing antibodies at 6 months with up to 42% less for the Omicron variant than others whilst there was an >80% average functional preservation of T-cell responses [8]. Therefore it may be hypothesized that the myeloablative preparative regimen inhibited recipient T-cell response at least during the early post-transplant phase. Nevertheless the expansion of reactive T lymphocytes might well have contributed to minimizing the disease severity at one post-HSCT month. Although the interferon-γ response was evaluated to the Alpha Beta and Gamma variants it may be assumed that those T-cell clones were also responsive to Omicron in agreement with Tarke et al. [8]. The recipient had a high response to all variant spike proteins except the nucleocapsid antigen confirming the preferential targeting of the spike protein [10].

Notwithstanding the low number of B lymphocytes the serological assay revealed a concomitant IgG antibody rise that peaked at 2080 BAU/ml on day +30. The recipient’s IgG anti-S protein was first detected before transplant and rose on day +5 supporting the passive transfer of donor humoral immunity through the stem cell product. It is conceivable that the remarkable immune response might have been induced by the expansion of donor lymphocytes as demonstrated by the chimerism analysis. Both T cell and humoral immunity might have contributed to limiting the extent of the disease. Indeed although antibodies are responsible for viral neutralization adaptive immunity is necessary for viral clearance [11].

Whether or not the absence of a SARS-CoV-2 hyperinflammatory syndrome was due to low lymphocyte and neutrophil counts and the concomitant administration of immunosuppressive agents i.e. cyclosporine A remains to be clarified. Although data supporting the efficacy of this antiviral agent in the immunocompromised host are scanty treatment with remdesivir might have played a role in making the clinical course mild [2 5].

In contrast with other authors who observed SARS-CoV-2 RNA more frequently in whole blood than in plasma we detected SARS-CoV-2 RNA only in our recipient’s plasma [12]. However this may be related to the differences in the viral-load kinetics in the two blood compartments analyzed in line with other viruses in HSCT recipients [13].

The case herein reported suggests that the variant of concern Omicron has been associated with a mild clinical outcome even in patients at high risk of severe disease such as HSCT recipients. However further studies are required to clarify whether this is due to an intrinsic attenuated virulence or the capacity Omicron has to elicit a robust response of both adaptive and humoral immunity. We believe that in our case the potential role of humoral and cell-mediated immunity transferred from the donor should not be underestimated. Moreover there might have been a different modulation of the immune response should the donor have been haploidentical or unrelated or in the presence of a GVHD prophylaxis including in vivo/ex vivo T-cell depletion. Hopefully further research will provide data able to optimize the donor selection process and clarify the impact SARS-CoV-2 infection has on immune reconstitution.",,,,,,,,,

According to the Bank of England some foreign transactions can take as long as ten days and cost up to 10% of the transfer value.

But resolve some of these legacy issues and there’s much to gain. A recent report by Boston Consulting Group puts the value of cross-border payments more than $250tn by 2027 — up from $150tn in 2017. That’s a rise of more than $100tn in just ten years.

So how close are we to frictionless international payments? We asked the experts what roadblocks are remaining and how smoother cross-border transactions will affect both startups and the global marketplace in the future.

What’s holding us back?

Søren Mogensen chief growth officer at Banking Circle Group which includes Banking Circle a tech-led payments bank specialising in B2B banking solutions and international payments says the major challenge today is the correspondent banking system. That's where one bank gives services to another bank usually in another country.

Countries and jurisdictions have different conventions for data format and storage. Harmonising these requires manual intervention

“Every transaction on the correspondent banking system must go through the main banks before it can reach the final beneficiary and each bank needs to do its sanction screening and monitoring which costs time and money” says Mogensen. “This fragmentation means that often the money doesn't get there or half gets there or it comes back to the sender.”

Lewis McLellan editor at the OMFIF Digital Monetary Institute an independent forum for central banking tells a similar story.

“Countries and jurisdictions have different conventions for data format and storage” says McLellan. “Harmonising these requires manual intervention. Similarly there are different standards for data protection such as AML (anti-money laundering) and CFT (combatting financial terrorism) controls that require processing at both ends of the transaction or by correspondent banks in the chain.”

McLellan adds that banks may also have different operating hours and work across different time zones which can slow the process.

Smarter faster better?

To sidestep some of these issues neobanks and other financial institutions have entered the payments space promising to make cross-border banking smarter faster and better.

“As Banking Circle has its own banking licence we are building our own access to major currencies and as we bring that access together on the same platform — with the right tech anti-money laundering controls and the right data management — we can deliver frictionless international payments that are near real-time and low cost” says Mogensen.

Other businesses looking to revolutionise cross-border payments include UK-based fintech Leatherback which raised a $10m pre-seed round in April 2022 to expand its solutions across South Africa Egypt Uganda India and the UAE.

And payment services can be particularly useful for fintechs yet to receive financial licences — something that Banking Circle offers.

“Banking Circle Group can deliver Banking-as-a-Service for non-licence-holding businesses” says Mogensen. “Most recently Juni the Nordic fintech that grew its team by 644% last year has benefited from that as they wait for their licence to go live.""

A mobile revolution

Smartphones are another key driver towards frictionless international payments.

“The mobile payments revolution began in the UK about ten years ago when Barclays introduced PingIt an app that enabled the ability to transfer money from one person to another with a minimum amount of friction” says Mogensen. “Since then we've seen similar offerings in just about every European country spreading either in the shape of P2P (peer-to-peer) solutions or P2M (peer-to-merchant).”

But while this has helped improve domestic payments he says cross-border payments still fall short.

European Mobile Payment Systems Association (EMPSA) employs a technology it calls ‘The Bridge’ which links together different members to enable frictionless international payments

One initiative that is helping broaden the scope of mobile payments is the European Mobile Payment Systems Association (EMPSA). It was founded in 2019 to unite payment methods across the European continent and today it links 15 mobile payment systems more than 90m mobile payment users and hundreds of banks.

“EMPSA employs a technology it calls ‘The Bridge’ which links together different members to enable frictionless international payments” says Mogensen adding Banking Circle is helping the initiative with its tech.

“We are very excited to be able to help them in achieving this new cross-border mobile payment system” he tells Sifted. “Because effectively it will become a new European payment method.”

Whether EMPSA does become the de facto payment method in Europe or not many fintechs and neobanks are making good use of the digital infrastructure offered in the mobile payment ecosystem.

Crypto to the rescue?

Cryptocurrency and public blockchains also offer near-instantaneous transactions. But to send cash across borders users need to access a crypto exchange to exchange fiat for crypto send said cryptocurrency to the recipient’s crypto wallet and then exchange it back to fiat — hardly a frictionless experience.

“Technically cryptocurrency can be transferred internationally without friction” says McLellan. “However the absence of the AML CTF and KYC checks means that it does not represent a viable alternative payment mechanism for international business.”

Because of this many countries are researching or piloting central bank digital currencies (CBDCs or government-backed digital tokens that are the digital version of their fiat currency) to harness the speed and frictionless nature of cryptocurrencies while still providing much needed checks and balances.

A frictionless future is key to global trade

Mogensen tells Sifted optimistically that more and more payments in the future will be account-to-account based no matter the location. But he says the current inefficiency in frictionless international payments is hampering startups global trade and ecommerce — once we improve these inefficiencies and reduce friction we’ll encourage more efficient international trade.

The value lost to payment processors can be spent on capital investment job creation research and other more productive things

McLellan paints a similar picture saying that friction in payments helps no one except the businesses that extract revenue from processing payments — and the sooner that stops the better.

“If a system can be devised where international payments can be sent instantly securely and cheaply then the value lost to payment processors can be spent on capital investment job creation research and other more productive things” he says. “It will also lower the margins on international trade opening markets that would previously not have been economically viable.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibmh0dHBzOi8vZm9ydHVuZS5jb20vZXVyb3BlLzIwMjIvMDcvMTYvd2h5LWhhc250LXRoZS1ydXNzaWFuLWVjb25vbXktY29sbGFwc2VkLXB1dGluLW9pbC1zYW5jdGlvbnMtcnVibGUtY2hpbmEv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Why hasn't the Russian economy collapsed yet?,"When Russia invaded Ukraine countries around the world condemned the move and abruptly cut economic business and diplomatic ties.

Over 1000 companies—from American to European and Japanese firms—abandoned their business operations in Russia. Western nations booted Russia from SWIFT—the international payments system that moves money around the world—and froze Russia’s central bank assets barring it from accessing its $630 billion foreign reserve stash.

Economists and world leaders believed that combined the economic impact on the country relegate it to an economic pariah ensure losses in the billions and perhaps even lead to a wholesale collapse of the country’s financial system.

But that’s not quite how it worked out.

Across Russia signs have emerged that the country is adapting to global economic isolation better than most people anticipated.

Russian businessmen have gobbled up western companies’ operations like Siberian billionaire Alexander Govor’s purchase of McDonald’s 850 outlets across the country. Russian property developers like MR Group are opening new shopping malls—simply sans western brands like H&M Nike and Starbucks.

And despite becoming the world’s most sanctioned nation in the world Russia’s economy hasn’t tanked. Russian President Vladimir Putin had began preparing the country years ago to endure western financial pressure by shoring up its currency reserves and befriending China. And in a stroke of luck the Kremlin’s coffers are bursting because oil prices have skyrocketed stabilizing the ruble.

The economy is staying afloat for now. But as the war drags on cracks are beginning to show as Russia stares down its worst recession in 30 years faces a looming EU oil embargo and grapples with a growing number of citizens pushed into poverty.

Stockpiling and rallies

After Russia’s invasion of Crimea in 2014 Putin began preparing the country’s economy to endure western sanctions. He stockpiled foreign currencies reduced Russia’s dollar dependency and pivoted to a stronger partnership with China.

When Russia invaded Ukraine in February of this year it did so with large currency reserves and minimal public debt.

In the weeks following the invasion western nations pummelled Russia with harsh unprecedented sanctions restricting Russia’s access to the global financial system. In response Russia barred citizens from transferring money to bank accounts abroad to prevent capital outflow while the central bank imposed a 20% emergency interest rate hike as the ruble tumbled to record lows. Those “timely and strong” moves allowed the country to stave off a “full scale financial crisis” Laura Solanko senior advisor at The Bank of Finland Institute for Emerging Economies in Transition (BOFIT) an organization that researches emerging economies told Fortune.

Such measures “would have been very difficult to implement in a democracy but [feasible] in an autocracy [where] state-owned companies play a larger role” she says.

The widespread notion that the Russian economy would collapse from sanctions in a few short months was “as unrealistic as Russia’s own blitzkrieg plan to conquer Ukraine” in mere days because of the government’s preparations to ensure a financially stable economy Russian political scientist Ilya Matveev told Fortune.

But Russia hasn’t just played a good game of economic defense. Its invasion of Ukraine destabilized the global oil market raising prices which provided it with an incredible source of funding.

Petrodollars

Since Feb. 24 petrodollars from energy sales have filled the Kremlin’s coffers and offered it an economic lifeline.

In the first 100 days of the war Russia earned a record $94 billion from fossil fuel sales despite selling its crude at a 30% discount and exporting lower volumes according to analysis from Switzerland-based Center for Research on Energy and Clean Air (CREA). In May alone Russia raked in $20 billion from energy sales alone up 11% from April.

Russia’s energy revenue is “unprecedented because prices are unprecedented” said CREA analyst Lauri Myllyvirta. From January to May this year the country’s energy revenue grew 50% says the International Energy Agency (IEA). Russia’s current account surplus—which measures a country’s exports against its imports—reached nearly $139 billion in the first six months of 2022 helped by its profits from energy and commodity exports coupled with a collapse in imports due to sanctions.

Those petrodollars also powered the ruble’s remarkable turnaround. Russia’s currency is the best-performing currency in the world this year. The ruble’s value plunged to less than one cent in March. But since January it has surged 45% against the dollar. As of July 12 one U.S. dollar is worth 58.40 rubles. The ruble’s rally in turn has helped tame Russian inflation to its lowest level since February. In June Russia’s consumer prices grew 15.9% year over year compared to 17.1% in May and 17.8% in April according to Russian government data.

The “bottom line” is that Russia’s oil and gas revenues haven’t been dented at all allowing the government to keep funding the war and providing financial support for citizens Peter Rutland a Russia-focused professor of government at Wesleyan University told Fortune.

“In the short run the deck is stacked in favor of Russia” he says.

Turbulence ahead

So far Russia has managed to soften the blow to its economy and for its citizens. But its strong policy moves and growing oil revenues mask the ominous economic future that’s brewing just below the surface.

The ruble’s stunning turnaround is an artificial indicator that Russia’s economy is faring well Sergei Guriev scientific director of Sciences Po’s economics program and a research fellow at London-based think tank the Center for Economic Policy Research told Fortune. Normally a rising currency reflects the strengthened competitiveness of a country’s exports. But the main driver of the ruble’s strength is the collapse of Russian imports which have plunged to 20-year lows and drastically reduced its demand for dollars Guriev says. The strong ruble doesn’t reflect Russia’s economic strength but is a “symptom of something that’s very bad” for the nation he says.

And behind the façade of a stabilizing economy ordinary Russians are bearing the brunt of the sanctions. Russians’ real wages are expected to drop almost 6% this year and their real disposable incomes set for a 7.5% decline according to Russian bank VEB. Putin has authorized 10% hikes for pension incomes and minimum wages that went into effect last month. But even these boosts won’t stop Russians’ real wages incomes and pensions from deteriorating VEB said.

Although inflation is currently rising less rapidly than it was double-digit inflation is set to continue in a country where 21 million people—nearly 15% of the national population—live below the poverty line a number that has surged since the war began.

“Already-poor [Russians] will get poorer” Matveev says. Andrei Illarionov a former Putin aide predicts that the number of Russians living in poverty will likely double or even triple as the war progresses he told the BBC.

And four months into the war Russian industries are suffering from a severe tech supply crunch.

Russia has replaced western goods with smartphones from China refrigerators from Uzbekistan and 5G equipment from Israel and India since the war started. Still there are big gaps that not even China—Russia’s largest trading partner—will be able to fill.

Sanctions have restricted western companies from supplying the country with chips electrical equipment and other critical hardware needed to produce everything from kitchen appliances cars computers data servers and military equipment. Entire supply routes for “[data] servers to computers to iPhones—everything—is gone” one western chip executive told the FT.

China holds only 4% of the global semiconductor share and can’t make up the stymied supply from the world’s biggest chipmakers in the U.S. and Taiwan Guriev says. Chinese firms are also holding back over concerns of triggering secondary sanctions from the west. The collapse of high-tech imports means that the Russian economy will undergo a “regressive transformation” Matveev says. He notes that while the world progresses Russia will be relegated to trying to reach its pre-war economic state thus its technological and economic gap with the rest of the globe will widen over time.

Russia “hasn’t seen the worst yet” even as its economy has undergone some initial shocks Matveev says. “Unemployment will [increase] and shortages [of goods and parts] and price increases will continue” he says.

Other experts agree. The EU’s sixth sanctions package against Russia which will ban Russian seaborne crude by December and petroleum products by next February—90% of the bloc’s Russian oil imports—will be a major blow to the Kremlin if it’s implemented properly. The bloc accounted for 61% of Russia’s fossil fuel revenues from January to May this year. If the embargo is seriously enforced Putin “won’t have enough money to recruit soldiers” let alone prop up its citizens and industries Guriev says.

Russia’s central bank expects an 8 to 10% gross domestic product (GDP) decline this year compared to a pre-war growth forecast of 2%. That figure is a “substantial decline largely caused by western sanctions” Solanko says.

Russia’s economic squeeze will come in the long run as the country deindustrializes faces growing unemployment and continued stagflation and a run on goods Rutland says.

In short Russia is staring down its worst recession in 30 years Guriev says.

Russia’s economic crises in 2009 2014 and 2020 involved steep drops and fast recoveries. But experts agree that Russia won’t experience a speedy economic reboot his time around. Russia is facing a future of stagnation for years perhaps even decades Matveev says.

As Solanko notes Russia is “isolating itself and decoupling from the global economy. This time the fast recovery won’t come.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMie2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnJldXRlcnMuY29tL3dvcmxkL2FzaWEtcGFjaWZpYy9tYWxheXNpYW4tYXNzZXRzLXJpc2stZ2xvYmFsbHktbGF0ZS1zdWx0YW5zLWhlaXJzLWNsYWltLTE1LWJsbi1hd2FyZC0yMDIyLTA3LTE3L9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Malaysian assets at risk globally as late Sultan's heirs claim $15 billion award,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 401 Client Error: HTTP Forbidden for url: https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/malaysian-assets-risk-globally-late-sultans-heirs-claim-15-bln-award-2022-07-17/ on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMie2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnJldXRlcnMuY29tL3dvcmxkL2FzaWEtcGFjaWZpYy9tYWxheXNpYW4tYXNzZXRzLXJpc2stZ2xvYmFsbHktbGF0ZS1zdWx0YW5zLWhlaXJzLWNsYWltLTE1LWJsbi1hd2FyZC0yMDIyLTA3LTE3L9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMihQFodHRwczovL3RpbWVzb2ZpbmRpYS5pbmRpYXRpbWVzLmNvbS9idXNpbmVzcy9pbmRpYS1idXNpbmVzcy93aHktcnVwZWUtaXMtc3RpbGwtbm90LWFuLWludGVybmF0aW9uYWwtY3VycmVuY3kvYXJ0aWNsZXNob3cvOTI5MzM3NzMuY21z0gGJAWh0dHBzOi8vdGltZXNvZmluZGlhLmluZGlhdGltZXMuY29tL2J1c2luZXNzL2luZGlhLWJ1c2luZXNzL3doeS1ydXBlZS1pcy1zdGlsbC1ub3QtYW4taW50ZXJuYXRpb25hbC1jdXJyZW5jeS9hbXBfYXJ0aWNsZXNob3cvOTI5MzM3NzMuY21z?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Why rupee is still not an international currency,"Ajit Ranade

TIMESOFINDIA.COM Updated: Jul 17 2022 21:04 IST IST

RBI’s decision to allow payments for global trade in rupees is not aimed at internationalising the currency. It’s just a way to pay for Russian oil without falling foul of the sanctions regime

Recently the Reserve Bank of India announced an additional arrangement for invoicing payment and settlement of imports and exports in rupees. Many assumed that this is tantamount to rupee becoming an international currency. Not quite. There is a huge difference. For that to happen the rupee has to be freely traded across the world between third parties which have no connection to India.

Like a Saudi resident buying a Japanese Toyota car with American dollars even though that transaction has nothing to do with America. Thus to internationalise the rupee we basically must open up our capital account. Unlimited amount of rupees can go in or out to buy and sell stocks bonds real estate here or abroad. Third party countries should prefer to hold some of their foreign exchange reserves in the form of rupees or rupee assets. Our current policy is that the capital account is substantively closed and you need permission to buy assets abroad.

It’s the first time the United States is hosting the Championships and the action is taking place at Hayward Field.

Bigger prizes for 2022 World Athletics Championships winners

Participants in Oregon22 will be competing for a bigger amount than usual thanks to a commitment by World Athletics to increase the pot for winning athletes. A total of almost $8.5 million is up for grabs this year.

The organization has set aside $2 million from fines paid by the Russian Athletics Federation for violating rules on doping to add to the prize money for the Oregon Championships as well as WCH Budapest 23.

Aside from this there will be an extra incentive for athletes to set new records as Japanese electronics company TDK is handing out $100000 to gold medal winners who break an IAAF World Record in the process.

Those who make the top eight in each event will win a cash prize. Individual winners receive the same amount regardless of which event they participate in. Relay winners are awarded prize money per team.

Here are the purses at stake at the 2022 World Athletics Championships in Oregon.

The Mariners beat the Texas Rangers at Globe Life Park on Sunday (SEA 6 TEX 2) to extend their winning streak to 14 games. It is tied for the longest winning streak in baseball this season (the Atlanta Braves won 14 straight from June 1-15) and is the second longest winning streak in franchise history.

At 51-42 (.548) the Mariners have their best first half record since going 58-39 (.598) prior to the All-Star break in 2018. The 2018 Mariners went 31-34 (.477) in the second half and Seattle missed the postseason by eight games. Here are the longest winning streaks in franchise history:

15 games: May 23 to June 8 2001 14 games: July 2-17 2022 (and counting) 10 games: April 8-17 2002 10 games: Sept. 12-21 1996 9 games: May 27 to June 5 2003 9 games: April 19-28 2001

All-Stars Ty France and Julio Rodríguez (who else?) were the heroes Sunday. France who was named to the All-Star team earlier in the day slugged a solo home run in the fifth inning and an RBI single in the seventh. Rodríguez broke the game open with a two-run double in the seventh. Those two went 4 for 9 with a double a homer and 4 RBI on Sunday.

Following their most recent loss on July 1 the Mariners were five games behind the third and final American League wild-card spot with five teams ahead of them. The 14-game win streak has moved Seattle into the second wild-card spot and they are only a half-game behind the Tampa Bay Rays for the first wild-card spot. Seattle is three games up on a postseason spot in general.

The Mariners have not been to the postseason since Ichiro's rookie season in 2001. It is baseball's longest postseason drought by a decade. According to FanGraphs the winning streak has improved Seattle's postseason odds from 11.0 percent to 63.1 percent.

Goldman Sachs’ program called 10000 Small Business is a nationwide program that came to Iowa in 2019 with the goal of helping small business owners accelerate their growth.

It’s a 12-week curriculum-based program that focuses on practical business skills that can be applied by owners of small businesses.

During the 12 weeks business owners have the chance to network and learn from each other while receiving coaching from the program’s business advisors. After completing the program business owners join an ever-growing network of alumni across the state and the country.

David Barwin the business program coordinator and a professor at Iowa Central Community College has been the lead faculty for the program in the Iowa junior colleges. He’s recently been named as a lead faculty member for the program on the national level.

“Three years ago Jim Kersten (vice president at Iowa Central) came to me and said they were looking to bring this program to Iowa and they want to have it at the community college level. So I applied to be a faculty member and was accepted” Barwin said.

Barwin then attended training at Babson University in Boston. He said it’s the No. 1 entrepreneurial school in the country part of the reason it was chosen by Goldman Sachs to write the curriculum.

“After the training I just ran one of the modules for the first year” Barwin said. “It’s about culture and hiring and setting yourself up to hire the right people for the job. The program itself is designed to help business owners that have gotten past the startup.”

Business owners go through the nine modules in 12 weeks.

Modules range from lessons in growing businesses to marketing and selling along with financial lessons and lessons on relationships with employees. According to the Goldman Sachs 10000 Small Business website the curriculum is organized into nine modules and four clinics geared around small business management training each of which includes classroom discussion peer learning exercises skill building and experiential applications.

Classroom activities are complemented by an integrated portfolio of business services including: one-on-one business advice legal and financial clinics and networking opportunities.

“They are extremely applicable to their businesses” said Barwin. “It puts them in a position to create a growth plan for their business which will essentially lead to hiring more people. So they grow their business and they hire more people which obviously helps the local economy.”

As the lead faculty member in Iowa Barwin now oversees the construction of new modules. He works with faculty members from all the Iowa community colleges in the program as well. The program is based out of Des Moines Area Community College in Ankeny.

“I really love it because I am on the front line with these business owners. This program is so impactful and they all highly recommend it after they’ve gone through it” he said.

Goldman Sachs funds the entire program so there is no cost to business owners who are accepted into it. Barwin admitted though that often business owners are skeptical when he promotes the program to them.

“The question always comes up ‘What do you really want from me? Is this really free?’ But I tell them I wouldn’t be a part of this if it wasn’t going to help them. There are a lot of benefits for the local community by them going back and growing their business.”

Six area businesses are alumni from the Iowa Central region.

• Mona Everson Life and Health Care

• Ben Pingel Pingel Farms

• Maureen Seamonds MyMedMart

• Todd McCubbin Shiny Top Brewing

• Cheryl O’Hern Spin Markket

• Brian Pederson Blue Ribbon Pelham Waters

According to the program’s website 97 percent of business owners complete the 12-week program.

More than 60 percent of businesses in the program report increased revenues within six months of completing the program.

Nearly 50 percent of businesses report creating new jobs within six months of completing the program and 86 percent of graduating business owners report they are currently doing business with other graduates of the program.

“I just love being a part of this program” said Barwin. “It’s really special and I am passionate about serving others. I get to see the impact it makes on them in real time. It’s just so invaluable.”

Business owners interested in the program can visit https://www.10ksbapply.com for more information and to apply for the program. Applications are accepted on a rolling basis.

Barwin said the next module will start in September and then another in February. They’ll be the eighth and ninth sessions for Iowa businesses.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNuYmMuY29tLzIwMjIvMDcvMTcvc3RvY2stbWFya2V0LWZ1dHVyZXMtb3Blbi10by1jbG9zZS1uZXdzLmh0bWzSAVBodHRwczovL3d3dy5jbmJjLmNvbS9hbXAvMjAyMi8wNy8xNy9zdG9jay1tYXJrZXQtZnV0dXJlcy1vcGVuLXRvLWNsb3NlLW5ld3MuaHRtbA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Dow sheds more than 200 points in late-day pullback as a busy week of earnings begins,"Boockvar said Apple earnings will be important to the overall market in terms of how they manage currency what's happening in the Chinese business and how they're going to react as consumers move more toward services rather than goods spending.

""When Apple a $2.4 trillion dollar company market cap-wise rolls over it's obviously going to have a pronounced impact on the headline indices and it just reminds people that companies are buckling down because of what they're seeing out there"" said Peter Boockvar chief investment officer at Bleakley Advisory Group.

The late-day pullback follows a Bloomberg report that said Apple plans to slow hiring and spending on growth next year to deal with a possible downturn. Shares of Apple declined nearly 2.1%.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 215.65 points or 0.69% to 31072.61 — accelerating losses in the final hour of trading and erasing a 356 point jump earlier in the day. The S&P 500 fell 0.84% to 3830.85. The Nasdaq Composite declined 0.81% to 11360.05

A stock rally on Wall Street lost steam on Monday with the Dow Jones Industrial Average losing a more than 350 point gain from earlier in the session.

""People are not going to keep buying laptops every year and they're not going to replace their phone every year"" Boockvar added.

A strong earnings report from Goldman Sachs initially buoyed stocks following mixed results last week from banks JPMorgan Chase and Morgan Stanley though some on Wall Street warned investors to err on the side of caution during what's expected to be a choppy earnings season.

""We anticipate volatility to remain elevated as the market toggles between pricing recession risk and soft landing probabilities with each piece of data"" Citi's Scott Chronert said in a recent note.

On Monday Goldman Sachs posted earnings and revenue that easily beat expectations even as CEO David Solomon said during an earnings call that inflation is ""deeply entrenched"" in the economy. Shares popped 5.6% at one point before easing and ending the day with a 2.5% gain.

Strong results from its fixed income operations helped Goldman Sachs offset a drop in investment banking revenue. Bond traders at the bank generated about $700 million more revenue than expected following increased trading in interest rates commodities and currencies.

Bank of America reported quarterly revenue that beat analyst expectations with shares ticking slightly higher. IBM will post results after the closing bell.

Other major companies set to report earnings this week include Johnson & Johnson Netflix Lockheed Martin Tesla United Airlines Union Pacific and Verizon.

Earnings expectations

Despite the growing recession fears S&P 500 companies are expected to post a 4.2% year-over-year increase in second-quarter profit according to consensus analyst estimates gathered by FactSet. S&P 500 revenues are seen expanding 10.2% in the quarters according to FactSet.

Profit expectations for the full year are still high with analysts estimating S&P 500 companies will lift 2022 earnings by 9.9% data collected by FactSet show.

""We expect the results to be generally okay"" said Terry Sandven chief equity strategist at U.S. Bank Wealth Management. ""Focus will primarily be on margins and to the extent to which companies are able to pass along higher input costs that'll dictate where perhaps valuations can go.""

Energy stocks gained in the broader market index. Shares of Hess jumped 4.8%. Devon Energy gained 3.6% and Marathon Oil climbed nearly 3.5%.

Meanwhile Boeing shares dipped slightly on news that Delta Air Lines was buying 100 737 Max 10 planes. Shares of Delta jumped about 3.5%.

Less aggressive Fed?

Investors assessed the likelihood that the Fed will be less aggressive than feared at its meeting later this month. A Wall Street Journal report Sunday said the central bank is on track to lift interest rates by 75 basis points instead of the full percentage point increase forecast by some market participants.

Goldman Sachs chief economist Jan Hatzius also said in an overnight note that he expected the Fed to raise rates by three quarters of a point.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiQWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmVmaW5hbmNpYWxjYXJlZXJzLmNvbS9uZXdzLzIwMjIvMDcva2tyLWhvbmcta29uZy1qb2Jz0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Finance firms in Hong Kong want Mandarin speakers not expats,"KKR has built a massive Asian business with less than 1% of staff as expats

Joe Bae KKR’s co-chief executive has built the firm’s Asian business from scratch into one that employs 350 people and is the biggest international alternative investment fund in the region.

The firm is continuing to expand in the region and in May unveiled its inaugural $1.1bn credit fund the biggest first-time fund-raising in the region.

Bae told Alison Mass chairman of Goldman Sachs’s investment banking division in an interview last month that the success is down to recruiting local talent. Bae launched the KKR business in Asia in 2005 as a start-up and he had a clear vision of the talent he wanted to recruit.

“What we didn't want to be is this big US firm coming to Asia trying to do business in a very western style. So today we have eight offices. We have over 350 executives on the ground. I think we have maybe three expats on the team. Everybody else is localized.”

KKR’s approach was deliberate in order to build trust and local networks in order to attract the best local investors – and investment opportunities.

The KKR approach to APAC is not unique. In Hong Kong international banks favour local talent with fluent mandarin so they can service clients both offshore and onshore. The former head of APAC capital markets at one US firm says: “When we look at our junior cohort we only hire locals. The only expats left in our business are senior people like myself. That’s why I smile when I read about an exodus of expat bankers – there aren’t that many anymore.”

One Hong Kong-based headhunter agrees: “My clients want local bankers. Mandarin is essential. Equally when you look at the number of expats who were looking to relocate from Hong Kong during Covid the numbers were tiny.”

Meanwhile Bae has advice for anyone looking to pursue a career in private equity – make sure you have the industry knowledge to seize opportunities early. “For me the biggest disappointments are sometimes the deals you don't do where you don't have the conviction. Where you don't have the ability to really lean in when you should have leaned in. And you know you've missed a big opportunity.”

And for KKR they didn’t come much bigger than Alibaba. KKR passed up the opportunity to invest in the Chinese e-commerce company before its IPO because it lacked the sector expertise. “We were localizing all the teams. But we hadn't built the industry depth yet. And I look back and say that's a huge miss. Right? It's one of the most painful misses that we probably made in Asia in our early days.”

After the first 16 years in Hartford financial issues in the city forced stops in Waterbury and New Britain before finding the Pro-Am’s new home in the Vale gym in Middletown.

Next year for the 25th anniversary Higgins hopes to return to the capital city.

It’s all about money.

“If I’m able to get a big sponsor which we’ve always tried to get and they want to cover that $45000 fee to get the gym then by all means” Higgins said. “I’m in Hartford. I don’t have a problem with that. But I can’t afford that right now.”

The Pro-Am is NCAA-sponsored so it is not permitted to charge admission and has relied on sponsorships which are plastered around the court and on the uniforms.

Exploring options Higgins has been in communication with city council people and “other people with some big clout” who want to see the Pro-Am come back to Hartford for its milestone season.

“It’s still a great event” said McKoy who coaches his son Troy McKoy Jr. on the All Faith Memorial Angels. “But a lot of the people that used to come out for every game don’t come out anymore.”

Would it be possible to move back? “Without question” McKoy Sr. said. “[The Pro-Am] is just something to look forward to going to and playing — or even after I was done playing going to watch. It was always a joy.”

Raisner loves the Vale facility which has housed the Pro-Am for the last few seasons. It’s spacious with three courts and is air-conditioned. The game is the same. DJ Tall T’s tunes still play in the background and Higgins emcees from tip-off to the final buzzer. But the atmosphere is different.

The UConn players who Raisner loved and sat next to in her original reserved seat don’t make the trip to Middletown. Attendance numbers are down mostly because of the location.

Raisner seems to be in the minority when she says “I like this location. It’s further for me from my home but I love this big open gym. The others I felt claustrophobic.”

The Pro-Am takes over center court with three sets of bleachers across from the team benches with youth practices on the courts to the right and left.

This year’s regular season ends July 25 with the Championship Tournament beginning Aug. 1.

Higgins decided to create the league after being stationed in Norfolk Virginia with the U.S. Navy. He cooked for the admiral and attended a Johnson and Wales satellite campus when he took a wrong turn that had him driving past Lake Taylor High School — which was home to the Pro-Am league Allen Iverson played in after his first year at Georgetown. He stopped to watch Iverson who had scored as many as 81 points in a game in that league.

Shortly after drawing his inspiration Higgins moved back to Connecticut to be with his dad who had gotten ill. He contacted organizers in Virginia and created the GHPA in 1997.

His goal isn’t only to put on a show but to give the players — many of whom are in high school or college — a chance to work out with and against older more experienced players.

After a game Thursday McKoy Sr. was doing just that.

He stood under one basket giving Brody Limric a 6-foot-9 forward from Glastonbury who transferred to Central Connecticut State after his freshman season at Quinnipiac some pointers on playing in the post.

On the other end of the court Raisner was getting her own shots up. Regardless of where the Pro-Am games are played Raisner will be there. With her own reserved seat watching her team.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMijAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5mb3g2MS5jb20vdmlkZW8vbmV3cy9sb2NhbC9hbm51YWwtY29ubmVjdGljb24tYnJpbmdzLWJpZy1jcm93ZHMtYW5kLWNvc3BsYXktdG8taGFydGZvcmQvNTIwLTllNWEzZDY1LWFiZTktNGIyOS05ZDNkLTRmMDRjNzgzMGQ1OdIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Annual ConnectiCon brings big crowds and cosplay to Hartford,"Next up in 5

Back in January she had gone to the doctors for something on her tongue and she then received the news that she had mouth cancer. She went threw a long 12 hour surgery where they took part of her forearm to reconstruct her tongue. She was finally on the road to recovery when she started to not feel well again and has this crazy pressure on the side of her head/neck. After being rushed to the emergency room she got an MRI which showed that she had another mass on the side of her head/neck. She is now going through sevens weeks of chemo and radiation to hopefully shrink the size of the mass. Kristina is a strong and brave women who is giving this cancer one hell of a battle. She is not one to ask for anyone to help in with her everyday life but she has no choice right now but with being out of work for the last seven months has been hard on her. My family gets so many people asking if there is anything they could do to help and my family thought that this would be a nice way to help/support Kristina. My family has been flooded with so much love and support thus far and could not thank everyone enough.

Hasbro probably strongly suspected. But until Sony actually gave them the go ahead they couldn’t start work on all three Spider-Men figures based on Spider-Man: No Way Home. Now the digital renders are finally complete and the three-pack up for preorder at Hasbro Pulse and other stores. The set includes Spider-Man One (Tom Holland) in the integrated suit Friendly Neighborhood Spider-Man (Tobey Maguire) and The Amazing Spider-Man (Andrew Garfield). What it does not include notably: unmasked heads.

The Maguire and Garfield Spider-suits feature entirely new sculpts based on the actors’ individual body types. The Holland Spidey reuses parts but features new premium detail including painted web lines. All three feature deco above and beyond normal single-card release Marvel Legends. Thus in the current pricing reality they’re considered $30 figures (as opposed to the standard $25) and the set runs $89.99. Each Spidey comes with three pairs of hands and web effects.

As far as unmasked heads go: there’s no way Hasbro won’t do more with these characters. Now that the current team looks greenlit to do characters from the previous Spider-Man movies they want to make them just as much as fans want to buy them. Repaints seem inevitable. Tentative fulfillment date on this set is next August but that’s subject to change.

NICEVILLE — HCA Florida Twin Cities Hospital has been named to the 2022 Fortune/Merative 100 Top Hospitals list.

This is the first time HCA Florida Twin Cities Hospital has been recognized as one of the top performing Small Community Hospitals in the U.S. The annual list was published by Fortune.

“We are proud to have received this national recognition for the first time” Twin Cities Hospital CEO Todd Jackson said. “Our team truly cares for each patient like family and we are dedicated to continuing to provide the best patient experience possible.”

Healthgrades:HCA Florida Fort Walton-Destin rated in top 10 percent for patient safety

Another hospital honored:Ascension Sacred Heart Emerald Coast named to list of nation's 100 Top Hospitals. Here's why

Merative a data analytics and technology partner for the health industry has identified the top hospitals from a rigorous evaluation of 2650 short-term acute care non-federal hospitals in the U.S. The annual list recognizes excellence in clinical outcomes operational efficiency patient experience and financial health.

Merative formerly IBM Watson Health established the list to help identify best practices that may help other health care organizations achieve consistent balanced and sustainable high performance.

HCA Florida Twin Cities Hospital is an award-winning 65-bed hospital with a medical staff of more than 150 physicians. The facility offers all private rooms the area’s only Certified Orthopedic Joint Replacement Program the first Certified Spine Surgery Program as well as 24-hour emergency services a critical care unit and a variety of inpatient and outpatient diagnostic imaging and laboratory services.

Recognition as one of the Fortune/Merative 100 Top Hospitals demonstrates HCA Florida Twin Cities Hospital’s ongoing commitment to prioritize patient-centered care.

According to Merative as compared to similar ones the hospitals included on the Fortune/Merative 100 Top Hospitals list had better results on key clinical and operational performance indicators. These include survival rates patient complications health care-associated infections 30-day mortality and 30-day hospital-wide readmission rates length of stay throughput in emergency departments inpatient expenses profitability and ratings from patients.

The Fortune/Merative 100 Top Hospitals lists also incorporates a community health measure into its ranking process.

For the community health measure hospitals were surveyed across three components: 1) assessing hospital contributions to community health as a provider of critical services for community health and preventive care; 2) identifying ways that hospitals contribute to community health as a community partner by teaming up with local organizations to implement critical programs; and 3) focusing on ways that hospitals promote community health through their practices as anchor institutions supporting local economic and social progress.

The community health measure is weighted equally with other ranking measures.

Organized by Dr. Mitchell Li of Take Medicine Back and Will Overfelt of the 13200-member Mountain Maladies Facebook group the forum was engineered to scrutinize the hospitals’ certificates of need or “CONs” documentation submitted to the North Carolina Department of Health and Human Services’ Division of Health Service Regulation.

Nearly 100 people attended the event including its organizers and speakers.

In the CON documents Mission AdventHealth and Novant each argue their case to bring 67 new acute care beds to Buncombe County a need identified by the 2022 State Medical Facilities Plan that would also serve Graham Madison and Yancey counties.

The DHSR is accepting public feedback on the three CONs including letters of support that anyone can email to DHSR.CON.Comments@dhhs.nc.gov and will hold a public hearing Aug. 12.

Though the CON process — used by North Carolina and many other states — establishes a seemingly competitive review process for medical facility growth it has skeptics.

More:Want to support Mission Novant or AdventHealth expansion? You have 3 options and 40 days

A panel of experts – preceded by a short address from N.C. Treasurer Dale Folwell – was the July 14 forum’s centerpiece and included community members an economic researcher a nurse a restaurateur and a legal expert.

“Certificate of need is a bad idea” said panelist David Feinwachs former general counsel for the Minnesota Hospital Association a job he had for 30 years. “In fact that’s an understatement. Certificate of need is a stupid and dangerous idea.”

Feinwachs said the basic premise of the certificate of need process is that “if you have less health care available that it will reduce the cost of health care and increase its quality which is on its face a ridiculous notion.

“That is like saying that the price of gasoline is attributable to the proliferation of gas stations or that if only McDonald’s or Burger King could operate in the fast-food world everything would be better prices would drop quality would improve. It’s nonsense.”

Feinwachs also argued that the certificate of need process over time has not since it was passed into federal law in 1974 increased access improved quality and reduced prices.

Folwell in his preamble to the forum called profit-seeking hospitals “cartels” language he’s recently used in price transparency investigations and public statements.

Feinwachs who did not speak specifically to the WNC hospital CONs agreed with this characterization and said the CON process helped prop up “cartel” behavior because it “leads to consolidation and the formation of vertical monopsonies.”

A monopsony is a “market condition that is heavily influenced by a single buyer” according to a Corporate Finance Institute definition. It is the opposite of a monopoly in which the market is influenced by a single seller. Advocates have accused HCA of creating both of these economic environments in WNC.

Feinwachs encouraged forum attendees to be skeptical about CONs and asked them to seek out hard evidence about why hospitals want to expand or set up shop in Buncombe.

AdventHealth Mission Health and Novant Health were each invited to speak at the forum but declined. Mission created a video about CONs instead and Novant answered a list of questions from forum organizers.

Li made it clear the forum’s organizers did not support Mission’s expansion bid but didn’t say whether or not they favored AdventHealth or Novant.

Instead other forum panelists — especially Cornell University Professor Rosemary Batt and Dr. Robert McNamara chief medical officer with the American Academy of Emergency Medicine Physician Group — educated attendees on the dangers of health care corporatization.

Jared Walker another panelist and founder of Dollar For which helps patients understand charity care and eliminate medical debt showed his group’s detailed analysis of the three hospitals’ charity care programs.

None of them were great he said.

Kelley Tyler a 37-year Mission employee and National Nurses United member was another panelist. Tyler recently addressed the U.S. Federal Trade Commission and Justice Department during an April 14 hearing on mergers and acquisitions in health care.

Then and during the July 14 forum Tyler characterized the working situation at Mission as dire with high numbers of patients and increasingly low numbers of staff to care for them.

“It was very apparent that no one really cared about patient outcomes anymore” Tyler said reflecting on the 2019 shift when HCA bought Mission for $1.5 billion. “We were leaders in Western North Carolina. I was very happy to be and very proud to be a Mission employee. At the end I couldn't feel good about the job that I did at the end of the day.”

Since the HCA purchase in 2019 Mission has come under scrutiny for a variety of issues and seen significant pushback. The hospital system faces two antitrust lawsuits alleging HCA has created a health care monopoly: One was filed by Asheville residents and one by the city of Brevard. Nurses at Mission in Asheville have unionized and recently were involved in an effort to highlight inadequate protective equipment standards which led to a North Carolina Department of Labor Occupational Safety and Health division citation in March.

Despite these issues the hospital believes it needs to expand to meet the demand of a burgeoning population in the Buncombe Graham Madison and Yancey region.

“Mission Hospital has seen significant growth in demand for its acute care services – so much so that it often cannot accommodate certain transfers and patients must wait for extended periods of time in the ED for hospital admission” the hospital’s CON states.

It faces competition from AdventHealth which already has a Hendersonville location and Novant which is headquartered in Winston-Salem and has 18 hospitals in North Carolina. In their CONs the other two systems emphasize Mission’s issues and the importance of “promoting choice and competition.”

Though community members and elected officials and health system employees already have submitted hundreds of letters supporting one hospital the forum emphasized a wariness of health care corporatization.

“There is a larger question at hand that I would like to emphasize: What do we do about this disaster of a healthcare system in general?” said Li in a Facebook message July 15. He co-founded Take Medicine Back and said the organization’s “long-term arc is to act as a grassroots think tank to uncover the mechanisms of corporate exploitation in healthcare identify the actors and advocate for action.”

Li said the organization in various advocacy actions like the forum is addressing:

Monopoly power.

Poor staffing of nurses.

Lack of transparency.

Lack of labor rights and due process.

“Unconscionable contracts"" with non-competes that prevent physicians from working within their own communities.

“This is a true public health emergency” said Li of WNC’s hospital issues.

Both he and Overfelt — who is also a plaintiff in the Asheville antitrust lawsuit — noted Folwell’s strong condemnation of corporate health care practices in North Carolina and the larger political implications of HCA’s action and reputation in WNC.

Both Folwell as an individual and Josh Stein as N.C. Attorney General have filed friend of the court briefs supporting the plaintiffs in the Ashville HCA antitrust lawsuit which currently is in N.C. Business Court.

“The things happening at Mission hospital could likely determine a lot of political fates and fortunes” Overfelt said in a July 14 Facebook post musing on a potential gubernatorial faceoff between the two. “I’m not alone in my thoughts and feelings.”

Following the forum Take Back Medicine July 15 released a letter to Stein ""requesting an investigation into what we believe are widespread violations of the prohibition on the corporate practice of medicine in North Carolina.""

Stein when he visited Buncombe in April said he was searching for new legislative measures to prevent the fallout from mergers like HCA and Mission from happening in North Carolina again.

Overall U.S. chocolate retail sales volumes have been ""off and down"" 2% to 3% over the last couple of months as prices have risen in the ""high single-digit low double-digit"" range Melissa Poole Hershey's vice president of investor relations told Reuters.

Hershey's performance closely tracks the rest of the chocolate category the wire service reported.

""We are expecting that as we move through the year ... we will see a bit of pull-back in volume"" Poole told Reuters.

Hershey previously noted that it was expecting a ""softening"" in demand.

But until the recent decrease ""consumers haven't really reduced consumption much at all.""

In the later stages of the COVID-19 pandemic chocolate sales ballooned — along with other consumer products — Reuters noted with shoppers assisted by government stimulus payments as they maintained the stay-at-home habit of buying products and supplies in bulk.

OHIO MCDONALD'S FRANCHISE OWNER A VETERAN PAID WORKERS AMID CLOSURE: ‘I’VE BEEN IN THEIR SHOES'

But today chocolate companies are seeing some consumer behavioral changes.

As just one example shoppers are choosing individual candy bars at store checkouts — instead of buying larger quantities and multi-packs from grocery aisle shelves.

The volume sold of chocolate products in the U.S. dropped 1.5% versus a year ago in the 13 weeks ended June 12 as prices soared 8.2% according to IRI a Chicago-based market research firm that shared information with Reuters.

""We're going to see chocolate becoming more sensitive to price"" Daniel Sadler an IRI principal told Reuters.

""For those who have the money and have the space to store bigger bags value to them is cheaper price per pound.""

""Consumers will treat themselves but it will be smaller sizes — a small treat. That's why you're seeing [a sales] volume decline"" he said.

In recent months Hershey has been using a new fulfillment center in Annville Pa. to more efficiently serve retailers such as mass discounters and dollar stores whose customers are sensitive to price Poole indicated.

SOBERING NEW STUDY SAYS THAT THOSE UNDER AGE 40 SHOULDN'T DRINK ALCOHOL AT ALL

""For those who have the money and have the space to store bigger bags value to them is cheaper price per pound"" she said.

""Value to others might be something 'accessible to me' at an absolute lower price point.""

Hershey in certain cases slims down its package size and keeps the same or very close price — commonly known as ""shrinkflation"" — to retain customers who say they only have $3 to spend on a bag of chocolate Kisses rather than $5 or $6 Poole also told Reuters.

Shrinkflation such as trading down to cheaper chocolate impacts cocoa demand even if item sales volumes stay the same.

Chocolate makers originally expected cocoa demand to grow some 2.5% this year but are now seeing growth of just 1% — and that could be followed by no growth next year if inflation persists and the Russia-Ukraine war continues traders and experts say according to Reuters.

""We don't buy a lot of chocolate to begin with"" one New York father of four speaking about his family's household told FOX Business.

""But I can definitely see that people are cutting back on this type of purchase simply because they have to given today's rising prices.""

Yet a single full-size Hershey's Milk Chocolate Candy Bar at 1.55 ounces was going for a mere $1.14 at Walmart (prices may vary).

Sixty years after Hewlett-Packard Co. employees first began moving into Building A on the company’s new Loveland campus in October 1962 the company that once grew to employ more than 9000 workers in Loveland Fort Collins and Greeley does not have the presence that it once did.

Today HP’s successor companies — Hewlett-Packard Enterprise Co. (NYSE: HPE) and HP Inc. (NYSE: HPQ) — occupy 580000 square feet in Fort Collins with HPE employing 800 people. (HP Inc. did not respond to requests for information.)

But HP’s legacy extends far beyond that footprint from spinoff companies that continue to employ thousands of workers to the real estate that HP left behind.

SPONSORED CONTENT Business Cares: May 2024 As Mental Health Awareness Month unfolds in Colorado it serves as a reminder of the collective responsibility to prioritize mental well-being.

Much of the Fort Collins campus is now owned by Broadcom which essentially is a spinoff of a spinoff i.e. HP’s spinoff of Agilent Technologies Inc. which then sold its Semiconductor Products Group to an investment group creating Avago Technologies Inc. which acquired Broadcom in 2015.

No HP employees remain at the Loveland site where it all started but another spinoff of a spinoff — Keysight Technologies Inc. (NYSE: KEYS) which grew out of Agilent in 2014 — maintains an operation there.

In Greeley nothing remains of an HP operation that was once the center of the city’s nascent tech sector.

HP’s three Northern Colorado campuses have witnessed far different fates since the company began divesting local operations and selling local properties with tech remaining the driving force in Fort Collins and tech and manufacturing enjoying a resurgence at what was the Loveland campus. Greeley however has seen demolition of the long-vacant HP building with the bulk of the acreage transformed for residential retail and other uses.

Loveland

Hewlett-Packard Co.’s history in Northern Colorado began in Loveland but it almost didn’t start that way. Loveland had to compete with Boulder for an HP expansion but problems with potential Boulder sites — and a strong pitch from Loveland civic and business leaders — prompted Colorado native David Packard and other HP executives to select Loveland instead according to an HP Computer Museum post on the history of the Loveland plant.

The plant — with a temporary building opening in 1960 and the first permanent building in 1962 — initially produced power supplies but eventually began producing desktop computers and calculators. HP’s Loveland operation also produced a variety of computer peripherals including printers and instruments such as voltmeters.

The campus — on the northeast corner of South Taft Avenue and 14th Street Southwest — remained a bastion for HP’s global operations for decades but change began in the late 1990s.

HP spun off Agilent in 1998 and by 2005 only 500 people remained at the Loveland site according to the HP Computer Museum.

The Thompson School District acquired one building on the former HP/Agilent campus in 2004 an 88000-square-foot building at 800 S. Taft Ave. that was formerly home to Colorado Memory Systems Inc. which built the structure in 1984. Colorado Memory Systems was founded by former HP employee Bill Bierwaltes. The company manufactured computer tape backup systems and was acquired by HP in 1992.

The school district purchased the building for $4.7 million and now uses it for its headquarters.

Just to the east is Keysight Technologies at 900 S. Taft Ave. Keysight spun off from Agilent in 2014 developing test and measurement equipment.

Keysight’s Loveland building encompasses more than 139000 square feet.

Kari Fauber vice president of Keysight’s global partner sales and ecommerce told BizWest in an email that the Loveland facility is “primarily a research and development site but also hosts teams from legal sales marketing finance logistics and services.

“Keysight delivers advanced design and validation solutions that help accelerate innovation to connect and secure the world” she said. “Keysight’s dedication to speed and precision extends to software-driven insights and analytics that bring tomorrow’s technology products to market faster across the development lifecycle in design simulation prototype validation automated software testing manufacturing analysis and network performance optimization and visibility in enterprise service provider and cloud environments.”

Keysight’s customers span the worldwide communications and industrial ecosystems aerospace and defense automotive energy semiconductor and general electronics markets Fauber said.

Keysight also maintains operations in Colorado Springs and Boulder. It acquired Eggplant Software Inc. with U.S. headquarters in Boulder in 2020 for $330 million.

Keysight employs 14300 worldwide and employed about 300 people in Loveland at the time of the spinoff from Agilent. The company recorded revenue of $4.94 billion in 2021.

With Agilent’s retrenchment in Loveland the company negotiated a deal in May 2011 to sell the bulk of the Loveland campus to the city for $5.8 million.

Plans to revitalize the campus were ambitious with the Colorado Association of Manufacturing and Technology eventually selecting the site in June 2011 for an Aerospace and Clean Energy Manufacturing and Innovation Park known as ACE. The project was touted as creating up to 10000 jobs.

But the proposal faltered early on with developer United Properties withdrawing from the project in August 2011 citing unattainable timelines.

Loveland then selected Bowling Green Kentucky-based developer Cumberland and Western to develop the property with the city selling the property to the company for $5 million.

Plans for the ACE park formally ended in March when CAMT withdrew from the project.

Even before that Cumberland and Western had rebranded the site as the Rocky Mountain Center for Innovation and Technology.

Cumberland and Western invested in upgrades to the property including some tenant finishes and successfully lured Lightning eMotors Inc. (NYSE: ZEV) as a tenant. In April 2016 Cumberland and Western announced that EWI a Columbus Ohio-based organization that promotes manufacturing technologies would open an applied research center at RMCIT.

But it all wasn’t enough and Cumberland and Western opted through commercial brokerage CBRE to put the property on the market for $22.8 million in October 2020.

Loveland site sells rebrands

Cumberland and Western eventually found its buyer although not for the full asking price. In late October 2020 a group of local business owners led by Jay Dokter Josh Kamrath and Dan Kamrath purchased the 811000-square-foot property for $15.5 million under the entity RMCIT LLC.

Dokter CEO of Loveland-based Vergent Products Inc. and his partners began working to increase occupancy from an anemic 16%.

The new owners quickly got to work rebranding the property as the Forge Campus in March 2021.

“We just observed all of the potential that didn’t happen and thought ‘We could do that’” Dokter said. “What we saw was 40 to 50 companies in here collocated creating an innovative tech environment. And the price was right too. So we knew that it wasn’t as risky. We also saw building prices were going up for a lot of commercial.”

Cumberland and Western’s initial approach to the property was to secure a single large occupant Dokter said.

Jay Dokter and other investors acquired most of the former Hewlett-Packard Co. campus in Loveland for $15.5 million and are breathing new life into the facility. Christopher Wood/BizWest

“I think there was a fair amount of activity. They seemed to be going more for the grand slam one occupant and that market is extremely limited” he said adding that Cumberland did refocus to allow smaller companies in.

The vision of Dokter and his partners was clear from the beginning: Create an environment in which occupants would build an innovation ecosystem interacting and feeding off of one another.

The owners moved one of their own companies into the Forge — Bongo which provides video-assessment solutions for experiential learning. The investors also plan to relocate another of their companies Vergent Products a contract design and manufacturing company into the facility within a couple of years.

Dokter said one of the key advantages of the Loveland property was the maintenance that Cumberland and Western provided for almost a decade.

Often vacant properties are allowed to decay with damage by weather vandalism and neglect. Not so with the Loveland site. Cumberland and Western continued to employ a team of one part-time worker and three full-time workers to maintain the property and conduct real estate tours.

“The cool thing with Cumberland and Western is that they spent a lot of money maintaining the property” Dokter said. “I never forget the first time I came here to get a tour … there was a nice man waxing the floor over here in an empty building — one of those machines that go back and forth in an empty building. That impressed me that it was quite preserved.”

“Big buildings like this you don’t just shut the lights off and walk away” said Rob Blauvelt property manager for the Forge and one of the full-time workers who maintained the property during the Cumberland and Western years.

Cumberland and Western maintained a contract for upkeep of the 22 acres of roof. Landscaping was maintained although at a lower level than when the property was occupied. Cracks in parking lots were filled. HVAC systems were maintained.

“It was three and a half people watching an empty building for 11 years” Dokter said.

The property’s 16% occupancy at the time of purchase included 12 tenants but that number has doubled to 24. Another five tenants are housed on-site in The Warehouse accelerator a nonprofit organization that occupies 48000 square feet of donated space.

Allison Seabeck executive director of The Warehouse said the organization has three alumni members and three off-site members along with the five onsite members.

A capital campaign has raised $1.1 million out of a $4.8 million capital raise allowing the organization to add a staff member and proceed through Phase I of its construction plan creating space for nine companies.

Phase II of the capital campaign entails raising another $1.25 millon including $750000 to create space for 15 more companies including installation of a series of “garage pods” in the accelerator space providing turnkey manufacturing space for startups that need access to manufacturing floor space equipment ample power compressed air and other features.

Future expansions will include further buildout including community space a training room additional equipment a share marketing studio and other amenities.

Including The Warehouse occupancy at the Forge stands at 54% Dokter said with other leases pending.

One recent addition is Veloce Energy Inc. a Los Angeles-based company that produces modular devices to make electrification easier.

Veloce moved its Colorado location from north Fort Collins into the Forge campus in May. The company employs 12 people locally.

Additionally E.I. Medical Imaging a trade name for OrcaWest Holdings Inc. will move into the Forge. E.I. Medical Imaging develops real-time ultrasound devices for use by veterinarians and livestock producers.

Lightning eMotors which Cumberland and Western first brought to the site has expanded rapidly growing from 142386 square feet when Dokter and his team acquired the property to 250000 square feet and 260 employees. The company provides commercial electric vehicles for fleets and went public in 2021.

The Forge thus far has a mix of large clean-tech and other manufacturing companies.

“They’re more complimentary than you would think” Dokter said of the tenant mix. “That is the whole idea. We want to do more and more mixing and explaining who does what.”

With Vergent Products Dokter already has two clients within the Forge with another three potential clients. That cross-pollination can be seen among other tenants as well he said.

One additional amenity will foster even more interaction: The Forge soon will reopen the old HP cafeteria bringing a variety of local restaurant and catering companies in to provide a mix of dining options.

Blauvelt stressed the quality of the construction that is attractive for potential manufacturers.

“What you have here are structurally sound buildings with solid floors with a massive amount of power a massive amount of heating and cooling water a good amount of compressed air infrastructure for process vacuum … and you have a campus that’s just inviting as a workplace” Blauvelt said.

“This thing has awesome bones” he added “and it’s really easy to fit a business into here. It’s not very challenging to fit a complex operation into this space.”

And that 22 acres of roofs? Future plans call for installation of solar panels further emphasizing the site’s focus on clean technologies.

Stability characterizes Fort Collins site

No city in Northern Colorado has maintained as much of HP’s legacy operations as has Fort Collins a site that opened in 1978 and employed as many as 3200 HP workers at its peak.

In fact HP — both Hewlett Packard Enterprise and HP Inc. — remain prominent employers on the campus located on the northeast corner of East Harmony and Ziegler roads — with HP Inc. leasing space within Hewlett Packard Enterprise’s two buildings on 71.5 acres.

Hewlett Packard Enterprise’s operations there employ 800 workers and are varied.

“The Fort Collins site houses a range of business units and functions — from servers to R&D to marketing. It’s a multi-use facility and not dedicated to any specific part of the company” Adam Bauer a spokesman for HPE said in an email to BizWest.

The Fort Collins campus sits on the East Harmony Road corridor the focal point of a cluster of high-tech companies that includes Broadcom Intel Corp. Advanced Micro Devices and others. “Certainly having other tech players with whom we partner and do business in close proximity helps create an ecosystem that is mutually beneficial” he said. “That’s true in Fort Collins Silicon Valley Houston — everywhere we have a large presence.”

Bauer said that Fort Collins “is an important location for HPE and again is host to a range of business units and functions that span the company. It remains one of our biggest employment hubs in the U.S. and is an important part of our history. We do not anticipate any change to Fort Collins’ role in the company at this time. We actually are in the process of renovating the site to accommodate our hybrid Edge-to-Office working model that arose out of the pandemic.”

HPE leases space to HP Inc. which did not respond to BizWest requests for comment. The city of Fort Collins estimates that HP Inc. employs 1100 local workers but that number could not be verified.

HPE in April 2019 sold a building on the Fort Collins campus — at 3420 E. Harmony Road — to an entity owned by McWhinney Real Estate Services Inc. of Loveland for $21 million. Bauer declined to speculate on any plans to sell additional properties.

“We continuously evaluate our real estate portfolio based on a variety of criteria including usage opportunities for cost optimization and other factors” he said. “I can’t speculate on future real estate transactions.”

The McWhinney building is largely vacant although fully leased. Madwire formerly occupied the third floor and a first-floor gym space but the company has put the space on the sublease market although it continues to pay rent.

Additionally Comcast Corp. (Nasdaq: CMCSA) has vacated 80000 square feet within the building. The company had opened a call center in 2016 with plans to house up to 600 employees.

But those plans changed in September 2019 when the company announced closure of the operation. Comcast’s lease expires in 2027 with the space put up for sublease.

A federal contractor based in Maryland ASRC or Arctic Slope Regional Corp. leased 31000 square feet of the Comcast space in August 2020. The company operates as a contractor to federal intelligence aerospace and health-care information-technology agencies.

Micro Focus a spinoff of Hewlett Packard Enterprise occupies about 16000 square feet in the building.

Peter Kast a broker with CBRE who is listing space in the building for sublease said the campus and other corners of East Harmony and Ziegler roads benefit from infrastructure put in place to serve HP.

“If you look at it from an infrastructure point of view it’s one of the few places in town that has redundant fiber and redundant fiber so people like this that have needs for those kinds of things there’s not that many choices so in terms of an infrastructure location it’s great” he said.

He noted that HPE HP Broadcom Intel AMD and other high-tech companies in the area capitalize on a concentration of skilled workers.

“The thing that’s so attractive about Fort Collins for these guys is the intellectual capital the people who do this kind of work who are trained to handle whether it’s software or hardware design” he said. “We’ve got a ton of people who do chip design in this town.”

The biggest player in that space locally is Broadcom which has continued to invest in its Fort Collins operation. Although the city of Fort Collins estimates that Broadcom employs 1150 workers locally the company told BizWest in 2019 that it employed 1747 including 1313 employees and 434 contingent workers.

Broadcom owns a large swathe of the former HP campus with its predecessor Avago completing several major expansions.

The company in its most-recent quarterly report filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission cited ongoing supply-chain disruptions brought on by the COVID-19 pandemic and highlighted the importance of the Fort Collins operation.

“We have been and expect to continue experiencing some disruption to parts of our global semiconductor supply chain including procuring necessary components and inputs such as wafers and substrates in a timely fashion with suppliers increasing lead times or placing products on allocation and raising prices” the company reported noting shutdowns at key suppliers and service providers around the world.

“Any similar disruption at our Fort Collins Colorado manufacturing facility would severely impact our ability to manufacture our film bulk acoustic resonator (“FBAR”) products and adversely affect our wireless business” the company said.

Despite those challenges Broadcom HP and related companies remain key components of the Fort Collins economy.

SeonAh Kendall senior economic manager for the city of Fort Collins said Hewlett Packard Broadcom and other companies in the East Harmony Road corridor are “going strong.”

“We are seeing that they’re kind of staying in the area and growing with spinoffs in there as well” she said. “I do think that it is a critical piece for us in terms of the employment as well as the contributions that the companies as well as employees have in our community.

“There are opportunities for additional growth in those locations” she added “and opportunities for a lot of collaboration. I think one of the greatest strengths is that we’re able to retain the talent here. Sometimes we have seen folks leave AMD and go to Intel or leave Intel and go to HP and vice versa.”

She noted that companies in the area work closely with Colorado State University Front Range Community College and the Poudre School District on issues such as talent and retention.

Greeley facility sees different fate

Greeley’s Hewlett-Packard facility was the last to be built the first to close and the only one to be torn down — at least most of it.

The facility opened in 1984 focused on scanners tape drives and other devices but HP closed the operation in 2003 shifting what was then 800 workers to other locations. About 640 workers were transferred to Fort Collins with another 165 shifting to Flextronics International Ltd. Flextronics purchased DII Group Inc. which was buying HP’s tape-storage manufacturing business.

HP put the property on the market and seemed to attract widespread interest at first including for a potential expansion of Aims Community College. But that and other deals fell through prompting HP to sell the building to a group of local investors. HP sold the 355000-square-foot property on 157 acres in August 2004 to Boomerang Properties LLC headed by local investors Bruce Deifik and Jeff Bedingfield a Greeley attorney. The purchase price was $8 million far lower than HP’s $14 million asking price.

“Up to this point HP has not been willing to divide the property or divide the facility” Bedingfield told the Northern Colorado Business Report a predecessor to BizWest in August 2004. “Their desire is to sell everything and let the buyer determine how best to use it.”

Boomerang intended to subdivide the HP building to support perhaps four smaller tenants.

“There’s been a lot of talk that you can’t get big blocks leased that the best thing is to bulldoze the facility” Bedingfield said in 2004. “It’s too fine of a facility to begin talking about any kind of changes to that place other than demising it into large blocks.”

But the new owners also envisioned that surrounding acreage would be transformed into residential neighborhoods retail centers and office uses.

The project soon was taken over by City Center West LP a Denver development company affiliated with Westside Investment Partners Inc. which acquired the building and adjacent acreage for $8.36 million in 2007. Some holdings were owned and developed under the umbrella of BV Retail Land Holdings LLP.

City Center West began selling acreage for retail residential and other uses:

In 2011 the company sold 12 acres to a North Colorado Medical Center/Banner Health entity for $2.34 million. Banner continues to own the vacant land.

In 2014 City Center West launched a commercial development on the northeast corner of 71st Avenue and West 10th Street eventually adding a Bank of Colorado branch McDonald’s Breeze Thru Car Wash and a Les Schwab tire center.

Developers of a self-storage facility purchased land along 71st Avenue. That property now houses Boomerang Self Storage.

A chunk of the HP building — the cafeteria and events center — was redeveloped into the West Ridge Academy at 6905 Eighth St.

City Center West continues to own residential land on the former HP campus but sold the remaining vacant building and some acreage to LaSalle Investors LLC a unit of Waltel Cos. Inc. LaSalle demolished the remaining HP building preparing the site for future development.

But the company faces opposition to plans to rezone the property from Industrial – Low Intensity to Residential – High Density. About 10 neighboring residents voiced opposition to the rezoning request at a June 7 Greeley City Council meeting.

Residents voiced fears that LaSalle planned to build a large apartment complex on the property which they said could exacerbate existing traffic problems.

Several City Council members also voiced opposition to the R-H zoning preferring a less-intensive Residential – Medium Density zoning.

“It’s just too intense right now” Councilman Dale Hall said. “I’m uncomfortable making this R-H. I’m OK with Residential Medium Intensity.”

In the end LaSalle’s attorney asked that the council continue the discussion to the July 19 City Council meeting.

Greeley’s westward expansion

Why Greeley’s HP facility faced such a different outcome than campuses in Fort Collins and Loveland can be attributed to a variety of factors.

First the technology sector in Greeley has never developed to the scale of Fort Collins’ or Loveland which enjoy closer proximity to Colorado State University. Even before HP’s closure Greeley had seen the departure of home-grown printed-circuit-board manufacturer EFTC Corp. founded in Greeley as Electronic Fab Technology Corp. which left for the north Denver suburbs.

But the greatest factor seems to be the pattern of Greeley’s residential and commercial growth which has pushed inexorably westward for several decades.

Benjamin Snow director of economic health and housing for the city of Greeley said the area around “the core of the apple” meaning the HP building has transformed.

HP’s Greeley facility was once on the city’s outskirts with little nearby retail and far less residential development.

“When you look at what’s happened over the last 10 years out there it has sort of defaulted to what I would describe as typical suburban growth” Snow said pointing to the King Soopers and other retail development across 10th Street as well as retail and residential projects on former HP land surrounding the building.

He noted that for years he and his predecessors in the economic-development community sought to preserve the industrial zoning for the building as a way to balance the city’s housing stock with a solid employment center.

“It just never took” he said. “We never could get a secondary use in there … At some point you have to listen to the market signals.”

Although many potential users toured the facility one obstacle he said was that the building had fallen into disrepair.

“Once people went in because that building essentially had been neglected and abandoned for so long … it was kind of a magnet for that kind of vandalism. There was evidence that people were inside the building at different times.”

“Greeley has tried for 20 years to get some industrial users to reinhabit to reanimate that building to no avail” he said.

Last Updated 2 years ago

Digital nomads need a good internet connection and a comfortable space to work. Since the pandemic many hotel chains have adopted the “work from hotel” trend and have been making improvements thinking of remote workers.

It’s a win-win situation: hotels get guests to stay for longer and travelers can be happy with their “workation” experience. According to a survey published by HighSpeedInternet.com last year 84% of Americans consider wifi important for their short and long-term stays and 30% consider a good internet connection “essential”.

For those whose income depends on a high-speed internet connection just good internet isn’t enough and hotels are popular for having horrible internet connections.

Digital nomads need fast and reliable wifi and sometimes —even while visiting the best cities for remote work— they don’t have enough time to view the wifi reviews of all the hotels in the area.

This is why we researched considered recent surveys and created a list of the most popular hotel chains in the United States —and some worldwide— with fast internet connections for all budgets.

Holiday Inn / Holiday Inn Express

This American Hotel chain with more than 1100 active hotels around the world can be a great option for digital nomads because it offers free high-speed wifi for guests. In the United States—where the company has hotels in 552 locations— the average speed is 42.1Mbps a great service for video calls streaming and downloading large files.





Hilton Hotels

These hotels have a good reputation among remote workers. The hotel chain offers free wifi in certain areas or for Hilton Honors members and the Internet's minimum speed is 16.2Mbps. On average guests have to pay around $14.99 per day for a fast internet connection.

Ritz-Carlton

For those who prefer luxury and the fastest internet connection the Ritz-Carlton hotels offer the fastest wifi among popular hotel chains. This company offers guests 76.2 Mbps that can be free for loyalty members or cost from $13 to $17 per day.

Marriott

Another large luxury brand that offers travelers special experiences across the world at its over 5500 locations. Digital nomads staying at any of the Marriott Hotel & Resorts can expect an average internet speed of 45.9 Mbps which is free for loyalty members and at certain lobbies. Otherwise travelers must pay around $15 per day for premium wifi.

InterContinental

The British multinational hospitality company offers travelers free and fast internet connection. Guests can experience up to 30.7 Mbps at the InterContinental Hotels at no extra cost.

Rodeway Inn

This economy-priced chain with more than 578 locations in the United States can also be a reliable option for digital nomads. In 2019 this hotel chain earned recognition as the hotel chain with the best free wifi in the US. The average internet speed for guests is 7.66 Mbps and the company also offers premium internet for a slightly faster speed.

Econo Lodge

This economy hotel chain has been offering decent free wifi for travelers earning great reviews worldwide. Not all hotels have great connectivity but on average digital nomads will find a stable Internet connection for free.

Internet Connection can always vary

Digital nomads learn to live with uncertainty but these options are usually good and reliable. Of course there are many factors that can affect the Internet connection such as:

The location and the specific hotel: Not all hotel brands can provide the exact same service and it might vary depending on the country or area.

Not all hotel brands can provide the exact same service and it might vary depending on the country or area. The number of devices connected: It's also a good idea to consider if the hotel is crowded. Too many people connected to the same network will affect speed even if it is over 25 Mbps

Ethernet vs Wireless: sometimes Internet speed uses Ethernet—the wired option which is usually faster— as a reference and not wifi. If the wifi doesn’t work well having access to an Ethernet port is always valuable.

A good strategy to guarantee a good internet connection is to request the hotel a speed test and information about occupancy.

The regulation has already been approved and is being printed for distribution.

Hilton which the government partially owns and the state-owned Ghion Hotel are the only ones with a duty free shop available on their premises. Run by the state owned Ethiopian Tourist Trading Enterprise these shops used to be the go-to place for the diplomatic community to procure different items.

The regulation will be the first of its kind with details on how duty free shops should be run in the country. It also gives access to the private sector to engage in the business in places outside airports. Privately run duty free shops are only available at Addis Ababa Bole International Airport.

With the regulation already approved and to be made operational soon anyone with an import license a 10 million birr capital and a customs licensed duty free warehouse will be eligible to own a duty free shop.

Decisions on how duty free shops should be opened used to be made in letters for a lack of regulations on the matter according to Mulugeta Beyene deputy commissioner for legal compliance sector at the Customs Commission.

“The customs regulation brings access to the private sector with qualifications” said Mulugeta.

The shops would be allowed in places such as international airports limited customs checkpoints African Union Headquarters Economic Commission for Africa four and above stared hotels and other places the Ministry of Revenue might decide on according to the regulation.

The Enterprise has been unilaterally running duty free shops at all the places in the city outside the airport. Implementation of the regulation will end the Enterprises’ dominance.

“There are people such as diplomats with the privileges but they are limited to a number of items based on the quota administered by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs” Mulugeta said explaining the need to expand reachability of the shops.

The government plans to collect the forex in addition to availing items to the diplomatic community as all items are to be sold in foreign currencies.

Any incoming and outgoing passengers as well as transit passengers will have the permit to buy items at the duty free shops available only in the airport. However only diplomats and international organization personnel with the specific privilege will be permitted to buy items at the shops outside airports according to the regulation.

Alcoholic beverages household items electronics packed food & drinks clothes souvenirs perfumes and several other items will be sold at the shops as listed in the regulation.

Aster Solomon chairperson of Addis Ababa Hotel Owners Association and owner of Mosaic Hotel welcomes the new development for the variety of service options it would provide hotels. Opening up duty free shops in hotels would enable them provide services A-Z according to Aster.

“It is a good beginning now but I expect the government to implement it at least at three stared hotels as well since they also have a high number of guests paying in foreign currencies” Aster said.

The Customs Commission will have strong controlling mechanisms such as applying duty free stickers on the items to make those using it illegally accountable at the time of inspection.

The shops will also be liable to a series follow-ups from inspection teams at the Commission to check how when and who they have sold the items to. Sales and other documents will also be cross-checked according to Mulugeta."

The Home Depot just released a ton of new Halloween decorations and the ones that have everyone’s attention involve the Sanderson Sisters.

The home improvement store has two Hocus Pocus lawn inflatables available. The larger one which features all three Sanderson Sisters is 6.5 feet long. Winifred Sarah and Mary Sanderson stand at 4.6 feet tall on top of a stone that says “I put a spell on you” a nod to the iconic Bettle Midler number in the 1993 film.

The Home Depot also has a solo inflatable of Winifred Sanderson for those who might not have as much lawn real estate. She stands at 3.5 feet and holds a pumpkin that reads “Gather ‘Round Sisters!’ and has tiny bats surrounding the call.

Both decor pieces self-inflate and are LED-illuminated lighting up any Halloween display. The trio runs for $149 and Winifred runs at $34.98.

The Home Depot launched the cute cartoony lawn inflatables just a little over a month before the premiere of Hocus Pocus 2. The sequel which features Midler Sarah Jessica Parker and Kathy Najimy reprising their roles as Winifred Sarah and Mary is set to premiere on Disney+ September 30.

The teaser trailer shows just how the Sanderson Sisters made their way back to the 21st Century. Three teen girls dabbling in coming-of-age witchcraft accidentally awaken the Book along with the witchy trio. At the end of the teaser the Sisters walk through what looks like a Halloween festival when a man approaches them and asks if they are looking for the stage to which Winifred replies “Always.”

So it looks like fans are definitely getting another musical number from Midler. It’s also worth noting that Mary is absolutely flying on two Roombas on the page for Hocus Pocus 2 on the Disney+ website.

Today HP’s successor companies — Hewlett-Packard Enterprise Co. (NYSE: HPE) and HP Inc. (NYSE: HPQ) — occupy 580000 square feet in Fort Collins with HPE employing 800 people. (HP Inc. did not respond to requests for information.)

But HP’s legacy extends far beyond that footprint from spinoff companies that continue to employ thousands of workers to the real estate that HP left behind.

SPONSORED CONTENT Business Cares: May 2024 As Mental Health Awareness Month unfolds in Colorado it serves as a reminder of the collective responsibility to prioritize mental well-being.

Much of the Fort Collins campus is now owned by Broadcom which essentially is a spinoff of a spinoff i.e. HP’s spinoff of Agilent Technologies Inc. which then sold its Semiconductor Products Group to an investment group creating Avago Technologies Inc. which acquired Broadcom in 2015.

No HP employees remain at the Loveland site where it all started but another spinoff of a spinoff — Keysight Technologies Inc. (NYSE: KEYS) which grew out of Agilent in 2014 — maintains an operation there.

In Greeley nothing remains of an HP operation that was once the center of the city’s nascent tech sector.

HP’s three Northern Colorado campuses have witnessed far different fates since the company began divesting local operations and selling local properties with tech remaining the driving force in Fort Collins and tech and manufacturing enjoying a resurgence at what was the Loveland campus. Greeley however has seen demolition of the long-vacant HP building with the bulk of the acreage transformed for residential retail and other uses.

Loveland

Hewlett-Packard Co.’s history in Northern Colorado began in Loveland but it almost didn’t start that way. Loveland had to compete with Boulder for an HP expansion but problems with potential Boulder sites — and a strong pitch from Loveland civic and business leaders — prompted Colorado native David Packard and other HP executives to select Loveland instead according to an HP Computer Museum post on the history of the Loveland plant.

The plant — with a temporary building opening in 1960 and the first permanent building in 1962 — initially produced power supplies but eventually began producing desktop computers and calculators. HP’s Loveland operation also produced a variety of computer peripherals including printers and instruments such as voltmeters.

The campus — on the northeast corner of South Taft Avenue and 14th Street Southwest — remained a bastion for HP’s global operations for decades but change began in the late 1990s.

HP spun off Agilent in 1998 and by 2005 only 500 people remained at the Loveland site according to the HP Computer Museum.

The Thompson School District acquired one building on the former HP/Agilent campus in 2004 an 88000-square-foot building at 800 S. Taft Ave. that was formerly home to Colorado Memory Systems Inc. which built the structure in 1984. Colorado Memory Systems was founded by former HP employee Bill Bierwaltes. The company manufactured computer tape backup systems and was acquired by HP in 1992.

The school district purchased the building for $4.7 million and now uses it for its headquarters.

Just to the east is Keysight Technologies at 900 S. Taft Ave. Keysight spun off from Agilent in 2014 developing test and measurement equipment.

Keysight’s Loveland building encompasses more than 139000 square feet.

Kari Fauber vice president of Keysight’s global partner sales and ecommerce told BizWest in an email that the Loveland facility is “primarily a research and development site but also hosts teams from legal sales marketing finance logistics and services.

“Keysight delivers advanced design and validation solutions that help accelerate innovation to connect and secure the world” she said. “Keysight’s dedication to speed and precision extends to software-driven insights and analytics that bring tomorrow’s technology products to market faster across the development lifecycle in design simulation prototype validation automated software testing manufacturing analysis and network performance optimization and visibility in enterprise service provider and cloud environments.”

Keysight’s customers span the worldwide communications and industrial ecosystems aerospace and defense automotive energy semiconductor and general electronics markets Fauber said.

Keysight also maintains operations in Colorado Springs and Boulder. It acquired Eggplant Software Inc. with U.S. headquarters in Boulder in 2020 for $330 million.

Keysight employs 14300 worldwide and employed about 300 people in Loveland at the time of the spinoff from Agilent. The company recorded revenue of $4.94 billion in 2021.

With Agilent’s retrenchment in Loveland the company negotiated a deal in May 2011 to sell the bulk of the Loveland campus to the city for $5.8 million.

Plans to revitalize the campus were ambitious with the Colorado Association of Manufacturing and Technology eventually selecting the site in June 2011 for an Aerospace and Clean Energy Manufacturing and Innovation Park known as ACE. The project was touted as creating up to 10000 jobs.

But the proposal faltered early on with developer United Properties withdrawing from the project in August 2011 citing unattainable timelines.

Loveland then selected Bowling Green Kentucky-based developer Cumberland and Western to develop the property with the city selling the property to the company for $5 million.

Plans for the ACE park formally ended in March when CAMT withdrew from the project.

Even before that Cumberland and Western had rebranded the site as the Rocky Mountain Center for Innovation and Technology.

Cumberland and Western invested in upgrades to the property including some tenant finishes and successfully lured Lightning eMotors Inc. (NYSE: ZEV) as a tenant. In April 2016 Cumberland and Western announced that EWI a Columbus Ohio-based organization that promotes manufacturing technologies would open an applied research center at RMCIT.

But it all wasn’t enough and Cumberland and Western opted through commercial brokerage CBRE to put the property on the market for $22.8 million in October 2020.

Loveland site sells rebrands

Cumberland and Western eventually found its buyer although not for the full asking price. In late October 2020 a group of local business owners led by Jay Dokter Josh Kamrath and Dan Kamrath purchased the 811000-square-foot property for $15.5 million under the entity RMCIT LLC.

Dokter CEO of Loveland-based Vergent Products Inc. and his partners began working to increase occupancy from an anemic 16%.

The new owners quickly got to work rebranding the property as the Forge Campus in March 2021.

“We just observed all of the potential that didn’t happen and thought ‘We could do that’” Dokter said. “What we saw was 40 to 50 companies in here collocated creating an innovative tech environment. And the price was right too. So we knew that it wasn’t as risky. We also saw building prices were going up for a lot of commercial.”

Cumberland and Western’s initial approach to the property was to secure a single large occupant Dokter said.

“I think there was a fair amount of activity. They seemed to be going more for the grand slam one occupant and that market is extremely limited” he said adding that Cumberland did refocus to allow smaller companies in.

The vision of Dokter and his partners was clear from the beginning: Create an environment in which occupants would build an innovation ecosystem interacting and feeding off of one another.

The owners moved one of their own companies into the Forge — Bongo which provides video-assessment solutions for experiential learning. The investors also plan to relocate another of their companies Vergent Products a contract design and manufacturing company into the facility within a couple of years.

Dokter said one of the key advantages of the Loveland property was the maintenance that Cumberland and Western provided for almost a decade.

Often vacant properties are allowed to decay with damage by weather vandalism and neglect. Not so with the Loveland site. Cumberland and Western continued to employ a team of one part-time worker and three full-time workers to maintain the property and conduct real estate tours.

“The cool thing with Cumberland and Western is that they spent a lot of money maintaining the property” Dokter said. “I never forget the first time I came here to get a tour … there was a nice man waxing the floor over here in an empty building — one of those machines that go back and forth in an empty building. That impressed me that it was quite preserved.”

“Big buildings like this you don’t just shut the lights off and walk away” said Rob Blauvelt property manager for the Forge and one of the full-time workers who maintained the property during the Cumberland and Western years.

Cumberland and Western maintained a contract for upkeep of the 22 acres of roof. Landscaping was maintained although at a lower level than when the property was occupied. Cracks in parking lots were filled. HVAC systems were maintained.

“It was three and a half people watching an empty building for 11 years” Dokter said.

The property’s 16% occupancy at the time of purchase included 12 tenants but that number has doubled to 24. Another five tenants are housed on-site in The Warehouse accelerator a nonprofit organization that occupies 48000 square feet of donated space.

Allison Seabeck executive director of The Warehouse said the organization has three alumni members and three off-site members along with the five onsite members.

A capital campaign has raised $1.1 million out of a $4.8 million capital raise allowing the organization to add a staff member and proceed through Phase I of its construction plan creating space for nine companies.

Phase II of the capital campaign entails raising another $1.25 millon including $750000 to create space for 15 more companies including installation of a series of “garage pods” in the accelerator space providing turnkey manufacturing space for startups that need access to manufacturing floor space equipment ample power compressed air and other features.

Future expansions will include further buildout including community space a training room additional equipment a share marketing studio and other amenities.

Including The Warehouse occupancy at the Forge stands at 54% Dokter said with other leases pending.

One recent addition is Veloce Energy Inc. a Los Angeles-based company that produces modular devices to make electrification easier.

Veloce moved its Colorado location from north Fort Collins into the Forge campus in May. The company employs 12 people locally.

Additionally E.I. Medical Imaging a trade name for OrcaWest Holdings Inc. will move into the Forge. E.I. Medical Imaging develops real-time ultrasound devices for use by veterinarians and livestock producers.

Lightning eMotors which Cumberland and Western first brought to the site has expanded rapidly growing from 142386 square feet when Dokter and his team acquired the property to 250000 square feet and 260 employees. The company provides commercial electric vehicles for fleets and went public in 2021.

The Forge thus far has a mix of large clean-tech and other manufacturing companies.

“They’re more complimentary than you would think” Dokter said of the tenant mix. “That is the whole idea. We want to do more and more mixing and explaining who does what.”

With Vergent Products Dokter already has two clients within the Forge with another three potential clients. That cross-pollination can be seen among other tenants as well he said.

One additional amenity will foster even more interaction: The Forge soon will reopen the old HP cafeteria bringing a variety of local restaurant and catering companies in to provide a mix of dining options.

Blauvelt stressed the quality of the construction that is attractive for potential manufacturers.

“What you have here are structurally sound buildings with solid floors with a massive amount of power a massive amount of heating and cooling water a good amount of compressed air infrastructure for process vacuum … and you have a campus that’s just inviting as a workplace” Blauvelt said.

“This thing has awesome bones” he added “and it’s really easy to fit a business into here. It’s not very challenging to fit a complex operation into this space.”

And that 22 acres of roofs? Future plans call for installation of solar panels further emphasizing the site’s focus on clean technologies.

Stability characterizes Fort Collins site

No city in Northern Colorado has maintained as much of HP’s legacy operations as has Fort Collins a site that opened in 1978 and employed as many as 3200 HP workers at its peak.

In fact HP — both Hewlett Packard Enterprise and HP Inc. — remain prominent employers on the campus located on the northeast corner of East Harmony and Ziegler roads — with HP Inc. leasing space within Hewlett Packard Enterprise’s two buildings on 71.5 acres.

Hewlett Packard Enterprise’s operations there employ 800 workers and are varied.

“The Fort Collins site houses a range of business units and functions — from servers to R&D to marketing. It’s a multi-use facility and not dedicated to any specific part of the company” Adam Bauer a spokesman for HPE said in an email to BizWest.

The Fort Collins campus sits on the East Harmony Road corridor the focal point of a cluster of high-tech companies that includes Broadcom Intel Corp. Advanced Micro Devices and others. “Certainly having other tech players with whom we partner and do business in close proximity helps create an ecosystem that is mutually beneficial” he said. “That’s true in Fort Collins Silicon Valley Houston — everywhere we have a large presence.”

Bauer said that Fort Collins “is an important location for HPE and again is host to a range of business units and functions that span the company. It remains one of our biggest employment hubs in the U.S. and is an important part of our history. We do not anticipate any change to Fort Collins’ role in the company at this time. We actually are in the process of renovating the site to accommodate our hybrid Edge-to-Office working model that arose out of the pandemic.”

HPE leases space to HP Inc. which did not respond to BizWest requests for comment. The city of Fort Collins estimates that HP Inc. employs 1100 local workers but that number could not be verified.

HPE in April 2019 sold a building on the Fort Collins campus — at 3420 E. Harmony Road — to an entity owned by McWhinney Real Estate Services Inc. of Loveland for $21 million. Bauer declined to speculate on any plans to sell additional properties.

“We continuously evaluate our real estate portfolio based on a variety of criteria including usage opportunities for cost optimization and other factors” he said. “I can’t speculate on future real estate transactions.”

The McWhinney building is largely vacant although fully leased. Madwire formerly occupied the third floor and a first-floor gym space but the company has put the space on the sublease market although it continues to pay rent.

Additionally Comcast Corp. (Nasdaq: CMCSA) has vacated 80000 square feet within the building. The company had opened a call center in 2016 with plans to house up to 600 employees.

But those plans changed in September 2019 when the company announced closure of the operation. Comcast’s lease expires in 2027 with the space put up for sublease.

A federal contractor based in Maryland ASRC or Arctic Slope Regional Corp. leased 31000 square feet of the Comcast space in August 2020. The company operates as a contractor to federal intelligence aerospace and health-care information-technology agencies.

Micro Focus a spinoff of Hewlett Packard Enterprise occupies about 16000 square feet in the building.

Peter Kast a broker with CBRE who is listing space in the building for sublease said the campus and other corners of East Harmony and Ziegler roads benefit from infrastructure put in place to serve HP.

“If you look at it from an infrastructure point of view it’s one of the few places in town that has redundant fiber and redundant fiber so people like this that have needs for those kinds of things there’s not that many choices so in terms of an infrastructure location it’s great” he said.

He noted that HPE HP Broadcom Intel AMD and other high-tech companies in the area capitalize on a concentration of skilled workers.

“The thing that’s so attractive about Fort Collins for these guys is the intellectual capital the people who do this kind of work who are trained to handle whether it’s software or hardware design” he said. “We’ve got a ton of people who do chip design in this town.”

The biggest player in that space locally is Broadcom which has continued to invest in its Fort Collins operation. Although the city of Fort Collins estimates that Broadcom employs 1150 workers locally the company told BizWest in 2019 that it employed 1747 including 1313 employees and 434 contingent workers.

Broadcom owns a large swathe of the former HP campus with its predecessor Avago completing several major expansions.

The company in its most-recent quarterly report filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission cited ongoing supply-chain disruptions brought on by the COVID-19 pandemic and highlighted the importance of the Fort Collins operation.

“We have been and expect to continue experiencing some disruption to parts of our global semiconductor supply chain including procuring necessary components and inputs such as wafers and substrates in a timely fashion with suppliers increasing lead times or placing products on allocation and raising prices” the company reported noting shutdowns at key suppliers and service providers around the world.

“Any similar disruption at our Fort Collins Colorado manufacturing facility would severely impact our ability to manufacture our film bulk acoustic resonator (“FBAR”) products and adversely affect our wireless business” the company said.

Despite those challenges Broadcom HP and related companies remain key components of the Fort Collins economy.

SeonAh Kendall senior economic manager for the city of Fort Collins said Hewlett Packard Broadcom and other companies in the East Harmony Road corridor are “going strong.”

“We are seeing that they’re kind of staying in the area and growing with spinoffs in there as well” she said. “I do think that it is a critical piece for us in terms of the employment as well as the contributions that the companies as well as employees have in our community.

“There are opportunities for additional growth in those locations” she added “and opportunities for a lot of collaboration. I think one of the greatest strengths is that we’re able to retain the talent here. Sometimes we have seen folks leave AMD and go to Intel or leave Intel and go to HP and vice versa.”

She noted that companies in the area work closely with Colorado State University Front Range Community College and the Poudre School District on issues such as talent and retention.

Greeley facility sees different fate

Greeley’s Hewlett-Packard facility was the last to be built the first to close and the only one to be torn down — at least most of it.

The facility opened in 1984 focused on scanners tape drives and other devices but HP closed the operation in 2003 shifting what was then 800 workers to other locations. About 640 workers were transferred to Fort Collins with another 165 shifting to Flextronics International Ltd. Flextronics purchased DII Group Inc. which was buying HP’s tape-storage manufacturing business.

HP put the property on the market and seemed to attract widespread interest at first including for a potential expansion of Aims Community College. But that and other deals fell through prompting HP to sell the building to a group of local investors. HP sold the 355000-square-foot property on 157 acres in August 2004 to Boomerang Properties LLC headed by local investors Bruce Deifik and Jeff Bedingfield a Greeley attorney. The purchase price was $8 million far lower than HP’s $14 million asking price.

“Up to this point HP has not been willing to divide the property or divide the facility” Bedingfield told the Northern Colorado Business Report a predecessor to BizWest in August 2004. “Their desire is to sell everything and let the buyer determine how best to use it.”

Boomerang intended to subdivide the HP building to support perhaps four smaller tenants.

“There’s been a lot of talk that you can’t get big blocks leased that the best thing is to bulldoze the facility” Bedingfield said in 2004. “It’s too fine of a facility to begin talking about any kind of changes to that place other than demising it into large blocks.”

But the new owners also envisioned that surrounding acreage would be transformed into residential neighborhoods retail centers and office uses.

The project soon was taken over by City Center West LP a Denver development company affiliated with Westside Investment Partners Inc. which acquired the building and adjacent acreage for $8.36 million in 2007. Some holdings were owned and developed under the umbrella of BV Retail Land Holdings LLP.

City Center West began selling acreage for retail residential and other uses:

In 2011 the company sold 12 acres to a North Colorado Medical Center/Banner Health entity for $2.34 million. Banner continues to own the vacant land.

In 2014 City Center West launched a commercial development on the northeast corner of 71st Avenue and West 10th Street eventually adding a Bank of Colorado branch McDonald’s Breeze Thru Car Wash and a Les Schwab tire center.

Developers of a self-storage facility purchased land along 71st Avenue. That property now houses Boomerang Self Storage.

A chunk of the HP building — the cafeteria and events center — was redeveloped into the West Ridge Academy at 6905 Eighth St.

City Center West continues to own residential land on the former HP campus but sold the remaining vacant building and some acreage to LaSalle Investors LLC a unit of Waltel Cos. Inc. LaSalle demolished the remaining HP building preparing the site for future development.

But the company faces opposition to plans to rezone the property from Industrial – Low Intensity to Residential – High Density. About 10 neighboring residents voiced opposition to the rezoning request at a June 7 Greeley City Council meeting.

Residents voiced fears that LaSalle planned to build a large apartment complex on the property which they said could exacerbate existing traffic problems.

Several City Council members also voiced opposition to the R-H zoning preferring a less-intensive Residential – Medium Density zoning.

“It’s just too intense right now” Councilman Dale Hall said. “I’m uncomfortable making this R-H. I’m OK with Residential Medium Intensity.”

In the end LaSalle’s attorney asked that the council continue the discussion to the July 19 City Council meeting.

Greeley’s westward expansion

Why Greeley’s HP facility faced such a different outcome than campuses in Fort Collins and Loveland can be attributed to a variety of factors.

First the technology sector in Greeley has never developed to the scale of Fort Collins’ or Loveland which enjoy closer proximity to Colorado State University. Even before HP’s closure Greeley had seen the departure of home-grown printed-circuit-board manufacturer EFTC Corp. founded in Greeley as Electronic Fab Technology Corp. which left for the north Denver suburbs.

But the greatest factor seems to be the pattern of Greeley’s residential and commercial growth which has pushed inexorably westward for several decades.

Benjamin Snow director of economic health and housing for the city of Greeley said the area around “the core of the apple” meaning the HP building has transformed.

HP’s Greeley facility was once on the city’s outskirts with little nearby retail and far less residential development.

“When you look at what’s happened over the last 10 years out there it has sort of defaulted to what I would describe as typical suburban growth” Snow said pointing to the King Soopers and other retail development across 10th Street as well as retail and residential projects on former HP land surrounding the building.

He noted that for years he and his predecessors in the economic-development community sought to preserve the industrial zoning for the building as a way to balance the city’s housing stock with a solid employment center.

“It just never took” he said. “We never could get a secondary use in there … At some point you have to listen to the market signals.”

Although many potential users toured the facility one obstacle he said was that the building had fallen into disrepair.

“Once people went in because that building essentially had been neglected and abandoned for so long … it was kind of a magnet for that kind of vandalism. There was evidence that people were inside the building at different times.”

“Greeley has tried for 20 years to get some industrial users to reinhabit to reanimate that building to no avail” he said.

The battery life and emissions also benefit enormously from this.

4 Reviews

This generation's HP ProBook 445 G8 retains its old look. This is good because it ensures that the office laptop with business features like an IR camera and HP's security software remains robust while offering good input devices.

On the other hand performance has improved dramatically thanks to the AMD Ryzen 5 5600U (Zen 3) but also because HP was more generous with its power limits this time and because the cooling system is very good. It also results in the device operating quietly.

The 16 GB of RAM run in single-channel mode which is especially unfavorable for the RX Vega 7 iGPU. However the ProBook 445 wasn't designed for gaming anyway. Thanks to two SO-DIMMs though it's possible to expand the RAM and enable dual-channel mode.

The 512 GB SSD can also be replaced and the Wi-Fi module as well. We would've wished for the faster Wi-Fi 6 here though. Moreover the 14-inch display with a Full HD resolution (1920x1080) isn't particularly bright (270 nits) and it only covers a very small color space (55.5% of sRGB). Fortunately there are alternative panels such as a 400-nit low-power variant (100% sRGB) or HP's 1000-nit bright SureView panel.

The Wi-Fi battery life of around 10 hours is significantly better than that of the sibling model with an Intel CPU. It's also nice that the laptop can be charged via USB-C although a more powerful 65-watt power adapter is required for fast charging. The price of 699 Euros (~$705) isn't too high for what you get and the ProBook with 8 GB RAM is available for 599 Euros (~$604). An operating system needs to be installed in both cases.

At the same time the United States had 1.3 million! The USSR was hardly a backward country — they’d launched Sputnik and made many advances in science and mathematics. Why didn’t they have more computers? The story is interesting and you can see it in the video below.

Apparently when news of ENIAC reached the USSR many dismissed it as fanciful propaganda. However there were some who thought computing would be the future. Sergey Lebedev in Ukraine built a “small” machine around 1951. Small of course is relative since the machine had 6000 tubes in it. It performed 250000 calculations for artillery tables in about 2 and half hours.

The success of this computer led to two teams being asked to build two different machines. Although one of the machines was less capable the better machine needed a part they could only get from the other team which they withheld forcing them to use outdated — even then — mercury delay lines for storage.

The more sophisticated machine the BESM-1 didn’t perform well thanks to this substitution and so the competitor STRELA was selected. However it broke down frequently and was unable to handle certain computations. Finally the BESM-1 was completed and was the fastest computer in Europe for several years starting in 1955.

By 1959 the Soviets produced $59 million worth of computer parts compared to the US’s output of around $1 billion. There are many reasons for the limited supply and limited demand that you’ll hear about in the video. In particular there was little commercial demand for computers in the Soviet Union. Nearly all the computer usage was in the military and academia.

Eventually the Russians wound up buying and copying the IBM 360. Not all of the engineers thought this was a good idea but it did have the advantage of allowing for existing software to run. The US government tried to forbid IBM from exporting key items so ICL — a UK company — offered up their IBM 360-compatible system.

The Soviets have been known to borrow tech before. Not that the west didn’t do some borrowing too at least temporarily.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiOGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJ1cmxpbmd0b25mcmVlcHJlc3MuY29tL29iaXR1YXJpZXMvYmZwMDM4OTc20gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Marvin Kirby Obituary - The Burlington Free Press,"In Loving Memory of Marvin Kirby. Marvin Kirby left this world on June 30 2022. He passed away peacefully surrounded by his family and is now absent from the body present with the Lord. He was born November 16 1933 the son of the late Hermon Kirby and Blanche (Waller) Kirby of Knoxville TN. He attended Fulton High School in Knoxville where he graduated in 1952. He studied at the University of Tennessee at Knoxville graduating with a Batchelor’s of Electrical Engineering in 1956 and with numerous job offers across the country. He started his career at the Martin Company in Baltimore MD and he quickly advanced through roles there and at other Engineering firms including Westinghouse Electric Corporation spending time at the Kennedy Space Center designing electronics for one of the early cameras for the United States space program. In 1968 he joined IBM where he worked until his retirement as an Advisory Engineer in 2001. While working he earned a Master's of Electrical Engineering at Drexel Institute of Technology and a Master’s of Large Scale Integration at the University of Vermont. On a blind date in Baltimore he met his wife Doris and after a year of courtship they married on August 17 1963. The ultimate family man his top priorities were being a kind and loving husband and a model father raising two sons Shaun Kirby (born in 1967) and Mark Kirby (born in 1971). Marvin enjoyed and inspired others with many hobbies including photography astronomy coin collecting singing and gardening. On family vacations you could always spot Marvin with a camera or two strapped over his shoulder capturing countless precious memories of happy family times. A recent highlight combining multiple hobbies was recording the total solar eclipse on August 21 2017 from the centerline. Among the favorites in his coin collection were the quarters commemorating national parks where he loved to vacation with his family. He sang in various church choirs growing up and with Doris and his strong clear voice anchored hymn sings around the piano at home. Marvin’s passion for gardening seemed a manifestation of his desire to grow the fruits of the Spirit which he produced in abundance throughout his life: Love Joy Peace Patience Kindness Goodness Faithfulness Gentleness and Self Control. He is survived by his wife Doris of Essex Junction VT their children Shaun of Pasadena CA and Mark of Essex Junction VT and his brother Noel Kirby and wife Drama Kirby of Knoxville TN. A celebration of life will be held at 11:00am on Saturday July 16 at Grace United Methodist Church in Essex Junction VT with a service followed by light refreshments.

Real Estate Editor Emeritus

One of Sarasota’s most distinctive buildings started out as a watercolor.

In the mid-1950s architect Victor Lundy was fairly new in town and businessman Karl Bickel heard about his talent as an artist. Knowing that the Chamber of Commerce needed a new headquarters building Bickel asked Lundy to paint a picture of what such a building might look like.

Lundy then in his early 30s drew a vivid watercolor that was dominated by plants and other landscaping with a blue-roofed pagoda-like structure in the background.

The Chamber of Commerce’s leaders loved the drawing and hired Lundy to design the new structure. Since 1956 it has been a landmark in the city-owned plaza that also is home to the former Chidsey Public Library and the Municipal Auditorium.

Renovated in 2017 it became the home of the Sarasota Bayfront Planning Organization reports Virginia Haley president of Visit Sarasota County.

The building has come to be known as the “Blue Pagoda” because of its distinctive roof covered in blue celadon ceramic tiles. It has been described as “more roof than walls” as Lundy created a pavilion in which the eaves of the roof are less than 7 feet off the ground.

The roof is supported by the “glulam” beams that are typical of Lundy buildings in Sarasota County. These curvy-yet-beefy “engineered wood” beams are made of layers of thin boards that are glued into laminated timbers. They offer strength and architectural versatility at a cost-effective price.

Lundy is “very sculptural and very creative” said architectural historian Christopher Wilson of Ringling College of Art + Design.

Lundy’s other notable Sarasota County buildings include the St. Paul Lutheran Church fellowship hall (1958) and sanctuary (1970) in Sarasota the Herron House (1957) in Venice and the Warm Mineral Springs motel in North Port also from the late 1950s. Lundy left Sarasota in 1959 before going on to become design director at the large firm HKS in Dallas.

No. 79: Boca Raton Resort & Club 1926 Boca Raton

His work was the subject of several articles in national design publications around 1959 when Lundy was 36. The Herron House won an AIA competition in cooperation with House & Home and McCall’s magazines for best modern home in the South.

“I want my buildings to be exuberant” he told Time magazine in 1965. In the July 2 issue Time paid homage to Rudolph and Lundy in the same layout featuring Rudolph’s Endo Laboratories in Garden City N.Y. (renovated in 2007) and Lundy’s IBM building in Cranford N.J.

The irony was that the two leading lights of the Sarasota School of Architecture were classmates under Walter Gropius at Harvard in the 1940s competitors in Sarasota in the 1950s and a few years later rivals in Time Magazine.

Now 99 and retired in suburban Houston Lundy was the featured architect during the Sarasota Architectural Foundation’s Sarasota MOD Weekend in November 2016.

Illumina is forking over the $325 million to settle claims following two recent jury decisions in Delaware and California as well as an antitrust case in California according to a statement on Thursday from MGI Tech a BGI affiliate.

As part of the deal each party will drop any challenges to the California and Delaware jury decisions and Illumina gets a license to the family of patents that BGI asserted in Delaware.

In 2010 Illumina filed a complaint in California against Complete Genomics an MGI subsidiary alleging that the company infringed on three of its DNA sequencing patents with the latter company’s “Complete Genomics Analysis Platform.” In response Complete Genomics asserted that Illumina had “attempted to achieve monopoly power in genome sequencing technology.”

In a later Delaware case Complete Genomics accused Illumina of infringing on its own patents with “two-channel” sequencing systems kits to prepare DNA fragments for sequencing and kits to immobilize amplify and sequence fragments. The company also filed an anticompetitive suit against Illumina in Delaware last year.

Back in November a federal jury ruled that four of Illumina’s five patents in the California case were valid awarding it $8 million according to a Law360 report. But in May a Delaware jury decided that Illumina owes Complete Genomics more than $333 million for infringing on two patents court documents state.

This latest settlement should put an end to the storm of lawsuits — at least for a while. According to MGI’s statement:

“The parties also agree to a three-year period of peace with respect to claims of U.S. patent infringement and violations of any antitrust or unfair competition laws of the United States during which time they will not sue each other or respective customers in the United States or accrue liability for existing platforms.”

We were able to get our hands on the complete official lineup (that is planned for release in the near future) of the Arc A-Series Desktop GPUs. This includes the price and performance positioning TDP and memory configurations.

Intel Arc A770 graphics card currently set to debut for under $400 USD

Now keep in mind unlike the official benchmarks everything mentioned in this article is subject to change and improvement. That said this is a document that Intel has already shared with their major Taiwanese partners so it is definitely accurate as of right now and has a very high likelihood of staying accurate (as information shared with partners in this segment of the supply chain is usually final or close to final). Without any further ado here it is:



The flagship of Intel's planned Arc A-Series GPU lineup is the Arc A770 graphics card. It will consume 225W and should trade blows with the RTX 3060 Ti and Radeon 6650 XT while beating the RTX 3060 and Radeon 6600. Based on the slide that we obtained it is set to debut at or under $399 USD. Considering how Intel drivers will only go up in performance from here this is a pretty great price point - assuming Intel can enforce it. The A750 is likely going to be the cut down variant of the same chip and will consume 225W but trade blows with the RTX 3060 and RX 6600. The A770 is going to come in 16 and 8 GB variants while the A750 is only going to ship with 8 GB of vRAM.

A770 A750 A580 A380 A310 Segment Performance + Performance+ Performance - Mainstream - Entry TDP 225W 225W 175W 75W 75W Memory 16/8 GB 8GB 8GB 6GB 4GB Tentative MSRP $349-$399 $279-$349 $200-249 $125-$149 ~$100

Up next you have the A580 which is part of Intel's performance lineup and will be the bread and butter of bog-standard gaming for 1080p desktops. It will compete with the RTX 3050 and consume 175W of power. It will also be mated to a very respectable 8 GB of memory. Finally you have the A380 and A310 GPUs which are entry level although Intel refers to the A380 as Mainstream ""-"". The A380 is positioned against the GTX 1650 and consumes 75W of power while being mated to a 6GB vRAM. The A310 which is Intel's smallest part is mated to a 4GB vRAM consuming 75W and will be pit against the GTX 1050/Ti.

While we don't know the exact pricing of these parts we can guess the brackets using the slide given above. Just like the A380 which has an MSRP of $135 and competing with the NVIDIA GTX 1650 with an MSRP of $190 (even the NVIDIA 1630 has an MSRP of $169) Intel's entire Arc lineup seems to be priced to undercut the competition. While NVIDIA is unlikely to budge they might find that AMD will give them a tougher time by matching any price cuts and offering equal value (if not more). That said this is an excellent lineup from Intel for their first ever desktop discrete GPU series and a huge congratulations to the GPU boss Raja Koduri and the entire graphics team is very much due. If Intel can play its cards right and actually enforce these price points things could get interesting very fast.

Do you think Intel will be able to enforce/deliver on these price points? Yeap! They have already done that somewhat with the A380.

Not a chance. The market price of the cards will be higher than the MSRP.

Intel shared the info in a blog and a video and revealed performance results from a small subset of games that ""work very well with Intel Arc and the Alchemist architecture."" Intel notes that not all games will show these results but it's a ""view of what Intel Arc A-series cards are capable of with the right software and engineering enablement.""

When compared to the 3060 in relative performance in regards to average FPS 2560X1440 resolution and High preset settings the Arc A750 performs 17% better with F1 2021 15% better in Cyberpunk 2077 14% better in Control 13% better in Borderlands 3 and 6% better in Fortnite.

Intel still has a ton to reveal about the A750 GPU including performance in other games when it will be available how much it will cost how it will handle XeSS and ray tracing and much more.

Intel is doing its best to be very open about its push into the GPU market and recetly shared details on the Guinnir Intel Arc A380 and showed how it performs while playing PUBG and Monster Hunter Rise: Sunbreak.

The company showed the A380 running Monster Hunter at over 90 frames per second said it is ""more than capable of playing the best games at 1080p medium.""

The Arc brand of graphics cards were revealed by Intel in 2021 and shared that the entry-level Arc 3 specifically the Gunnir Intel Arc A380 Photon 6G OC graphics card would first be released in China and that the higher-end Arc 5 and Arc 7 cards would follow later this summer.

This sneak peek follows a report that Intel will raise the price of its CPUs in 2022. In some cases the price increases may reach more than 20%.

Ex-NVIDIA staffer now Intel Arc GPU team member Tom Peterson confirms that the Intel Arc A770 that is fast enough for you to play games on and it also overclocks ""really well"" he says. Inside it has the full ACM-G10 GPU with 32 Xe-Cores and it should have 16GB of GDDR6 memory too.

Intel teases that the Intel Arc A770 Limited Edition graphics card will enter the retail channel sooner than ""we know it"" and that the A770 Limited Edition won't be exclusive to a single store. We should expect Intel to do something similar to NVIDIA where it sells its GeForce RTX series Founders Edition graphics cards on its website but also partners with retail giant Best Buy.

I gotta admit: I can't wait to have the Intel Arc A770 Limited Edition (and its siblings) in the TweakTown GPU lab to not just play with but I want to see that sleek card in the flesh. It's shaping up well for the lower-end side of the market (every GeForce RTX 40 series GPU in the coming months will thrash it) but for now it looks good. Now we need drivers + game compatibility + and non-stop support from Intel for the decades to come under Arc GPUs.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMif2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5ld2Fya2Fkdm9jYXRlLmNvbS9zdG9yeS9uZXdzLzIwMjIvMDcvMTcvc21hbGwtdG93bi11dGljYS1wcmVwYXJlcy1pbnRlbC1kZXZlbG9wbWVudC1ob3BlLWFwcHJlaGVuc2lvbi8xMDA2Nzc1NTAwMi_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Small-town Utica prepares for Intel development with hope apprehension,"No commitment required.

In a new video that’s just three minutes long the chipmaker gives us the briefest of glimpses at the card’s pretty average on-paper performance.

Before we dive in it’s important to note that the A750 is supposed to be one of Intel’s top-of-the-line GPUs as indicated by the “7” at the front of its name. Intel’s naming conventions have the Arc 5 and Arc 3 sitting below the Arc 7 which are supposed to offer midrange and entry-level performance respectively.

During the video Intel’s Ryan Shrout boots up Cyberpunk 2077 on a PC with the A750 chip installed and instead of giving us a long look at gameplay Shrout skips straight to performance. With the game set to the “high-quality” preset and 2560 x 1440 resolution Shrout says the card gets “just under” 60 frames per second (FPS) on average which isn’t bad but not necessarily what you’d expect from a company like Intel’s debut into discrete graphics cards.

Intel’s Arc A750 performs 1.06 to 1.15 times better than the standard RTX 3060. Image: Intel

Shrout shows off benchmark tests next revealing how well the card fares against the entry-level Nividia GeForce RTX 3060. The Intel Arc A750 performs 1.06 to 1.15 times better than the standard RTX 3060 on games like Cyberpunk 2077 F1 2021 Control Borderlands 3 and Fortnite. But these benchmark tests come with an asterisk — Shrout points out that “the performance of Arc won’t look like this in all games” and describes the test as “a great view of what Arc is capable of with the right game enablement and software engineering.” (Not to mention that these tests weren’t performed by an independent party.)

Obviously it’s impossible to tell how a card really performs until we try it out for ourselves but this first look offered by Intel isn’t exactly mind-blowing. Intel’s Arc A750 GPU is set to launch later this summer but Intel has already released its A370M and A350M mobile GPUs in a few different notebooks as well as the entry-level Arc A380 desktop GPU in China (which is supposed to hit the global market later this year)."

This compares to earnings of $0.87 per share a year ago. These figures are adjusted for non-recurring items.

This quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of 34.52%. A quarter ago it was expected that this ingredients producer for food cosmetics and consumer products industries would post earnings of $0.75 per share when it actually produced earnings of $0.72 delivering a surprise of -4%.

Over the last four quarters the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates two times.

International Flavors  which belongs to the Zacks Consumer Products - Staples industry posted revenues of $2.9 billion for the quarter ended March 2024 surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 3.35%. This compares to year-ago revenues of $3.03 billion. The company has topped consensus revenue estimates two times over the last four quarters.

The sustainability of the stock's immediate price movement based on the recently-released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's commentary on the earnings call.

International Flavors shares have added about 7% since the beginning of the year versus the S&P 500's gain of 7.5%.

What's Next for International Flavors?

While International Flavors has underperformed the market so far this year the question that comes to investors' minds is: what's next for the stock?

There are no easy answers to this key question but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company's earnings outlook. Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter(s) but also how these expectations have changed lately.

Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near-term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions. Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried-and-tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions.

Ahead of this earnings release the estimate revisions trend for International Flavors: mixed. While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company's just-released earnings report the current status translates into a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for the stock. So the shares are expected to perform in line with the market in the near future. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.

It will be interesting to see how estimates for the coming quarters and current fiscal year change in the days ahead. The current consensus EPS estimate is $0.89 on $2.76 billion in revenues for the coming quarter and $3.68 on $10.91 billion in revenues for the current fiscal year.

Investors should be mindful of the fact that the outlook for the industry can have a material impact on the performance of the stock as well. In terms of the Zacks Industry Rank Consumer Products - Staples is currently in the top 24% of the 250 plus Zacks industries. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperform the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.

Another stock from the same industry Chewy (CHWY) has yet to report results for the quarter ended April 2024.

This online pet store is expected to post quarterly earnings of $0.21 per share in its upcoming report which represents a year-over-year change of +5%. The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has remained unchanged over the last 30 days.

Chewy's revenues are expected to be $2.87 billion up 2.9% from the year-ago quarter.

Editor’s Note: Remarks delivered by retired justice Antonio T. Carpio on July 16 2022 at the webinar “Six Years after the Arbitral Award: Developments in the South China Sea” sponsored by the National Youth Movement for the West Philippine Sea.

When the Arbitral Tribunal at the Hague handed down its Award on July 12 2016 China belittled the Arbitral Award as “just a piece of paper.” Most of the rest of the world however hailed the Arbitral Award as a landmark ruling affirming the rules-based international order governing the South China Sea.

Unfortunately some Philippine government officials past and present have parroted the Chinese propaganda that the Arbitral Award is just a piece of paper. These Philippine government officials act against Philippine national interest giving aid and comfort to China that is clearly intent on seizing vast areas of Philippine maritime zones in the West Philippine Sea. Calling the Arbitral Award as just a piece of paper is dangerously naïve.

First prior to the Arbitral Award there was a legal question as to which country owned the natural resources including the oil and gas in the West Philippine Sea enclosed by China’s nine-dash line. Both China and the Philippines claimed ownership of these resources.

Many foreign service contractors wanted legal clarity before spending millions of dollars exploring for oil and gas in the West Philippine Sea. The Arbitral Award provides for that final and definitive legal clarity. Now a service contractor knows that if it extracts oil and gas for China in the West Philippine Sea the Philippines can sue the service contractor in third countries where it has assets for stealing the oil and gas belonging to the Philippines.

Second the US UK France Japan Australia Canada and other countries have been exercising freedom of navigation including naval drills in the South China Sea invoking the Arbitral Award which affirmed the application of UNCLOS in the South China Sea unimpaired by China’s nine-dash line. Every time the navies of these countries conduct naval drills in the West Philippine Sea they affirm that there is an EEZ in the West Philippine Sea unimpaired by China’s nine-dash line. Of course the only coastal state that can claim an EEZ in the West Philippine Sea is the Philippines. These freedom of navigation operations of the naval powers are in fact the most tangible and the most robust enforcement of the Arbitral Award so far.

Third ASEAN coastal states as well as a growing number of coastal states worldwide have in one form or another invoked the Arbitral Award. Indonesia invoked the Arbitral Award when it adopted the name North Natuna Sea to designate its maritime zone facing the South China Sea off the coast of the Natuna Islands. In various international fora the Arbitral Award is routinely invoked to debunk China’s nine-dash line.

Indeed the Arbitral Award is the most definitive and the most authoritative document declaring that China’s nine-dash line has no basis in fact and in law. Due to the Arbitral Award China’s nine-dash line has been ridiculed by legal scholars all over the world as a gigantic fraud on the international community.

Fourth China calls the Arbitral Award just a piece of paper because China considers the arbitral proceedings null and void since China did not participate in the arbitration. Thus for Filipino officials to parrot that the Arbitral Award is just a piece of paper is to accept that the Arbitral Award is null and void a position that is contrary to Philippine national interest. This position of China has been thoroughly debunked as erroneous by the Arbitral Tribunal.

Article 9 Annex VII of UNCLOS on Compulsory Arbitration provides: “If one of the parties to the dispute does not appear before the arbitral tribunal or fails to defend its case the other party may request the tribunal to continue the proceedings and to make its award. Absence of a party or failure of a party to defend its case shall not constitute a bar to the proceedings.” When China ratified UNCLOS China bound itself to this provision.

Clearly the refusal of China to participate in the arbitral proceedings did not divest the Arbitral Tribunal of jurisdiction to hear and decide the case. To repeat it is against Philippine national interest for Filipino officials to parrot China’s propaganda that the Arbitral Award is just a piece of paper. After all the Arbitral Award affirms what is stated in our Constitution: “The State shall protect the nation’s marine wealth in its xxx exclusive economic zone and reserve its use and enjoyment exclusively to Filipino citizens.”

Fifth to assert or enforce the Arbitral Award the Philippines does not need the consent or permission of China. The Arbitral Award by itself affirms that under UNCLOS the Philippines can exclusively exploit the natural resources including the oil and gas in the Philippine exclusive economic zone in the West Philippine Sea without interference from any other coastal state. To repeat the Philippines does not need China’s consent or permission to assert or enforce the Arbitral Award. For Filipino officials to say that the Philippines cannot exploit the oil and gas in its exclusive economic zone in the West Philippine Sea unless China recognizes the Arbitral Award is to baselessly grant China a veto power over the exploitation of the Philippine exclusive economic zone in the West Philippine Sea. No country in the world exercises such veto power.

Of course we know China will never recognize the Arbitral Award – thus waiting for recognition from China is like waiting for Godot. Again to assert or enforce the Arbitral Award the Philippines does not need to wait for China to recognize the Arbitral Award.

Last May 2020 Malaysia sent its Petronas-commissioned survey ship West Capella to explore in its exclusive economic zone off the coast of Borneo in an area falling within China’s nine-dash line. China warned Malaysia not to proceed with the exploration. Chinese Coast Guard vessels shadowed the Malaysian survey ship West Capella. Malaysian Coast Guard and Navy vessels however accompanied the West Capella and protected it until it completed its exploration work. Interestingly three US warships and an Australian frigate conducted naval drills near the area to lend moral support to the Malaysians. Thus Malaysia even without an Arbitral Award and without a Mutual Defense Treaty with a nuclear-armed power asserted successfully its sovereign rights in its EEZ despite threats and bullying from China.

Last October-November 2021 Malaysia sent its drilling ship to the same area off the coast of Borneo. China warned Malaysia not to proceed with the drilling. Chinese Coast guard vessels harassed the Malaysian drilling ship almost every day. But with the Malaysian Coast Guard and Navy ships protecting its drilling ship the drilling was completed. China despite its threats of war and harassment again failed to stop Malaysia from asserting its sovereign rights in Malaysian EEZ.

In mid-2021 Indonesia sent its drilling ship to drill test wells in its EEZ off the coast of the Natuna Islands facing the South China Sea within the area encompassed by China’s nine-dash line. China told Indonesia to stop the drilling and a four-month stand-off ensued between Indonesian Coast guard and Navy ships and Chinese Coast guard vessels. The Indonesians declaring that they were drilling in an area where they have sovereign rights proceeded with and completed their drilling. China failed to stop the Indonesians. Interestingly the US also sent its aircraft carrier Ronald Reagan near the drilling site to lend moral support to the Indonesians.

Thus two coastal states Malaysia and Indonesia whose EEZs are encroached by China’s nine-dash line asserted their sovereign rights in their EEZs despite threats of war from China and harassment from Chinese Coast guard vessels. Malaysia and Indonesia successfully asserted their sovereign rights even without an Arbitral Award or a Mutual Defense Treaty with a nuclear-armed state.

In contrast in April 2022 when China “whispered” to former president Duterte not to cross China’s redline Duterte slavishly ordered Forum Energy the Service Contractor in Reed Bank not to send its survey ship to Reed Bank which the Arbitral Tribunal had ruled is within Philippine EEZ. Malampaya which supplies 40% of the energy requirement of Luzon will run out of gas in 3-5 years. The only possible replacement is Reed Bank. Without Reed Bank the Philippines will have to import LNG – Liquified Natural Gas – to feed its gas-fired power plants in Luzon. This will send our energy costs already the highest in Asia soaring through the roof burdening the consuming public and driving away potential investors.

Obviously if we want to keep our energy costs within reasonable levels and if we want to unburden our people from exorbitant energy costs we must follow the example of Malaysia and Indonesia in asserting our sovereign rights in our EEZ. This requires political will which the Duterte administration was in severe deficit of when dealing with China.

Hopefully the new Marcos administration will find the courage to exercise the much-needed political will otherwise Filipinos will be condemned to suffer even higher energy costs than what they are already experiencing today. – Rappler.com",,,

These are just a few of the elements manipulated by artist Roman Villarreal.

“What I was doing in most of my work was sharing South Chicago and the South East side with the world but I never realized it at the time.” Roman Villarreal says. “I was documenting events. I realized whatever I was doing it had to be done on an equal basis the good with the bad.”

So that’s what he tilted the exhibition: “South Chicago Legacies.”

“I don't dwell much on the immigration end but what it is to be an urban person and live in this community being a steelworker blue collar what we experience. The good and the bad. I show everything.”

Villarreal refers to himself as an urban anthropologist a self-taught skill he says he learned as a child.

“I realized it was a gift to think in 3D. My mind is a 3D mind. I think in 3 dimensions like in layers and after years of being a sculptor that affects my work” he said.

The exhibition showcased in West Town’s Intuit Center for Intuitive and Outsider Art features Villarreal’s work from as early as the '70s.

“I didn’t realize the importance of developing your own style because I wanted to paint like everyone else but I realized that’s not necessary. They want more of your soul” Villarreal says. “Once you master your medium what will sell is your soul.”

Villarreal works to pay homage to both his community and heritage through his work.

“What South Chicago story does this sculpture tell? This one basically is sharing our past” he said. “This is Tatas the great grandfathers but she birthed us the three races which is us the Latino people now in the Americas.”

Made from serpentine Villarreal says this is his newest piece for the exhibition. These wooden cutouts from 1977 are the oldest.

“What do you think the shadows add to the piece? It gives it that extra dimension from flat. Being a sculptor you don’t want to deal with flat.”

Whether it be depicted through his “collage-style” sculpting paintings or cutouts Villarreal says the theme within his work remains the same.

“The main message of this show is that as an artist you can work with anything” Villarreal says. “It’s not important to me the money value right now. It’s about the legacy we leave behind.”

You can see South Chicago Legacies at the Intuit Center for Intuitive and Outsider Art in West Town until Jan. 8.

Broken into chunks the rock now called ore takes a two-hour ride to the surface before getting trucked to a crushing mill which separates the valuable minerals within through a flotation process that produces a clumpy gray filter cake.

That concentrate is loaded onto trains and sent to Canada on its way to being smelted and refined into a sulphate used in lithium-ion batteries that power electric cars.

For nearly a decade that’s been occurring around-the-clock in Michigan’s Upper Peninsula where ore from two large deposits under the Yellow Dog Plains near Marquette accounts for 100 percent of the domestic nickel supply in the United States.

Since 2014 the Eagle Mine has put America on the map for global production of a critical mineral that’s key to reducing climate-warming carbon emissions from automobiles. The mine owned by Lundin Mining Co. of Toronto is the only place in the U.S. where nickel a mineral which helps increase energy storage in lithium-ion batteries and thus boost the range an electric car can drive on a single charge is produced.

That status has put a spotlight on Eagle Mine as growing momentum behind electric vehicle (EV) production supercharges demand for battery-grade nickel; a mineral largely sourced in countries like Russia Brazil Indonesia and the Philippines where loose environmental regulations and dirty mining practices undercut the EV market’s green ethos.

“World class nickel mines in stable political justifications are extremely rare” said Robert Johnston a research scholar at the Columbia University Center for Global Energy Policy and former CEO of Eurasia Group who runs the consulting firm’s climate and energy practice.

“They’ve done something right to bring on a major nickel mine in the eastern U.S. in a state that has high standards for environmental and social assessment of these kind of projects” Johnston said.

Environmental opposition fades in the UP

Eagle Mine has produced nickel from two ore bodies for about eight years. “Massive” and “semi-massive” ore containing between 6.5 and 1.5 percent nickel is extracted daily resulting in about 18000 tons of nickel concentrate in 2021. The mine also produces about 18000 tons of copper concentrate and a smaller volume of cobalt about 380 tons.

Today Eagle Mine is closer to the end of its life than the beginning. Unless more ore is found the mine will close in about four years. When it started production in 2014 Eagle was the first new mine in decades to open in Michigan and it was not without plenty of controversy.

The mine produces sulfide ore which must be crushed and ground to extract minerals from the waste rock which is known as tailings. Environmental groups tribes and the private Huron Mountain Club worried that sulfide acid drainage from the mine could leach into groundwater and two rivers the Salmon Trout and Yellow Dog located nearby.

Kennecott Minerals Co. discovered the Eagle deposit in 2002 and the company spent more than a decade in permitting and legal challenges that eventually petered out.

Since then “it’s been pretty quiet” said Melanie Humphrey a geology technician in the oil gas and mineral’s division at the Michigan Department of Environment Great Lakes and Energy (EGLE) which monitors the mine’s waste discharges and permit compliance. “We haven’t really received any complaints for quite some time.”

In the water resources division at EGLE Randy Conroy said the mine has been cited for minor discharge issues but “because they are very responsive and timely in their notifications and corrective actions it hasn’t really gotten escalated.”

Early concerns about the Salmon Trout River particularly for a rare species of trout called the coaster brook trout have not materialized Conroy said. “The mine discharge eventually makes it there but the monitoring is not showing it would affect those fish.”

Eagle Mine conducts its own ground and surface water monitoring but the data is verified by the Superior Watershed Partnership a nonprofit working in conjunction with the Keweenaw Bay Indian Community and the Community Foundation of Marquette County.

Lundin pays for the program and the data is posted online. The environmental testing goes beyond what’s required in the mine’s permit to include analysis of edible berries and plants of cultural importance in the area. The program has generated widespread interest and has been featured in mine engineering textbooks as an example of a best practice.

“It’s been replicated all over the world now. We’ve been contacted by different mines and universities that want to start a program like this” said Geraldine Grant a senior planner and biologist with Superior Watershed Partnership. “We get inquiries every year.”

Horst Schmidt president of the Upper Peninsula Environmental Coalition (UPEC) which opposed the mine said their group’s attention has turned to fighting a different project a proposed open pit gold mine along the Menominee River called the Back Forty.

Schmidt offered muted praise for Lundin.

“They are probably better than most of the companies I read about” Schmidt said. “They are actually a bona fide mining company and they seem to follow the rules.”

“If they can get away with something I suspect they do.”

Lundin bought the mine from Kennecott parent Rio Tinto in 2013 for $325 million. In 2016 the company began tunneling to a second ore body about a mile east and 2500 feet further down. The second deposit called Eagle East began producing nickel in 2019. The east deposit extended the mine’s lifespan from 2023 to 2025 after which the shafts would be filled in and buildings torn down. That closure date was recently extended a year to 2026 after increases in the price nickel made nearby lower-grade ore worth extracting.

Exploratory underground drilling for additional deposits is ongoing. A new discovery could extend the mine life as well as that of the Humboldt Mill a repurposed iron mine mill near Ishpeming that went through a $275 million rehabilitation to return it to functional life.

The mine and mill together employ about 400 people some of which commute from Iron Mountain Crystal Falls and Wisconsin. Jeremy Francois mill operations superintendent drives in from Pelkie about an hour to the west.

Jeff Poirier Eagle Mine’s health and safety advisor said the mine will continue to employ people even after the ore bodies are depleted.

“Once we’re done operating there’s still going to be a lot of demolition and site work that goes on. That’s going to require safety people environmental people to be here. I don’t really think of 2026 as my end date” Poirier said. “I mean there’s gonna be a lot that happens after that.”

Surging EV market creates massive nickel demand

External forces have put a spotlight on Eagle Mine.

According to global commodity research firm Roskill 36 percent of global nickel production is expected to go toward battery production by 2030 versus 6 percent in 2020. The mine has largely supplied the global market for stainless steel the largest overall use of nickel but the share going toward EV battery production is rapidly increasing.

Rising demand coupled with recent volatility in nickel pricing caused by supply concerns amid the onset of Russia’s war on Ukraine created heightened interest in Eagle Mine this year said Matt Johnson external affairs manager at Eagle Mine.

In January the mine got a big attention boost on social media when Porsche released video of a Guinness World Records effort to achieve a 3-mile altitude change in an electric car which drove from bottom of Eagle East the lowest drivable point in America across the country to Pikes Peak in Colorado the highest drivable point.

In April President Biden ordered the Department of Defense to consider five metals — lithium cobalt graphite nickel and manganese — as essential to national security under the Defense Production Act because of their importance to battery technology. Invoking the Cold War-era law to boost mineral development may result in new subsidies for domestic mining and mineral processing on which the U.S. largely relies on China and other nations.

A single point of production combined with a dearth of domestic smelting and refining capacity for battery-grade nickel “poses a supply chain risk for battery manufacturing globally not just in the United States” according to a 2021 White House supply chain review which recommended the federal government invest in a domestic nickel refinery.

“We got a lot of calls from the government state and federal asking our opinions of you know ‘what would you do for domestic planning policy’ and ‘what is your opinion on that?’” Johnson said. “We definitely have an opinion because of our experience.”

Direct inquiries also come from automakers.

“Volkswagen called last week for example” said Johnson. The mine works with universities on research into new technologies around sustainable mining.

Sustainable nickel production is of high interest to automakers as production of electric vehicles ramps up. Sales are skyrocketing for vehicles that run on batteries. From April to June this year EVs accounted for 5.6 percent of all car sales which is twice that share a year ago. Demand is outpacing supply as manufacturers struggle with shortages of crucial components like semiconductors and surging prices for battery elements like nickel and lithium.

The market transition to EVs has brought auto manufacturers into direct contact with mining companies to secure raw materials. General Motors has been signing agreements with mining companies like Glencore to source cobalt. Tesla signed a supply deal with Talon Metals for nickel from the proposed Tamarack Mine in Minnesota which has yet to successfully hurdle the permitting process and is planned to open in 2026.

In 2021 Tesla signed nickel supply deals in Australia and New Caledonia a small French territory near Fiji. Tesla CEO Elon Musk has made it clear the company wants supply from mines that produce nickel in an “environmentally-sensitive way.” In Minnesota the Tamarack project is developing a capture technology that would chemically bind carbon to rocks at the mine which would allow the company to market its nickel as carbon neutral.

Mining companies like Lundin and Rio Tinto want to be in stable jurisdictions where environmental standards are more rigid but also transparent and provide a level of certainty said Johnston at Columbia. It may take longer to become permitted in the U.S but “once you are its much less likely the government will change the terms nationalize the resources or you’ll be overrun by local protestors.”

Charles Griffith director of the Ecology Center’s climate and energy program in Ann Arbor said the accelerating EV demand creates an opportunity to modernize mining laws.

“In the U.S. we still operate under fairly ancient mining laws have not been really updated in a long time” said Griffith who works with the Clean Fuels Michigan nonprofit. “This is an opportunity to do mining in a more sustainable way and with more community engagement.”

“That’s probably more likely to happen in the U.S. than some other countries where the laws are even weaker” said Griffith.

Johnston said Eagle Mine has proven to be an exception to the conventional moan he often hears in Washington D.C. that you “just can’t build mining projects in the U.S.” because of onerous and lengthy permitting and high environmental standards.

As the world moves toward cleaner transportation “you have to acknowledge that somewhere those minerals need to be mined and is it better to do it in Michigan with a world class operation and transparency or in Congo or Indonesia where the mine is being run for economic reasons with little regard for environmental standards” Johnston said.

“If this project were going through the permitting process now I think you’d have NGOs lining up to support it.”

In July we’re hitting the trails to explore the world’s greatest hikes.

CNN —

Hiking is often derided by adrenaline addicts as somehow lesser than more hardcore mountain experiences like climbing or skiing.

But as these challenging trails show putting one foot in front of the other isn’t always the easy option.

To undertake these famous hikes you’ll need more than just a hefty dose of gumption.

These routes are dangerous and for experienced hikers only. That means those with the right gear the ability to get themselves out of tricky situations and a willingness to plan for the worst and pack accordingly.

Whether you want to try out a vertiginous English Lake District classic or tackle the “most dangerous hike in the world” in rural China this list has got you covered.

Striding Edge Lake District England

The Lake District’s famously changeable weather can make even the most bucolic of strolls a challenge.

But Striding Edge – a sharp arête leading to the summit of Helvellyn the third highest peak in Lake District National Park – stands apart in this corner of England.

Hikers can choose to follow the paths that run along the side of the ridge but for those keen on thrills the ridge itself is where it’s at.

On a clear day the views are sensational stretching all the way to Scotland.

This is not for novices or the faint of heart: walkers will need to be prepared to scramble have decent climbing skills for the final push to the top and know how to properly navigate if the clouds roll in.

Ice and snow make it lethal in winter so preparation and a willingness to turn back are a must.

The Maze Canyonlands Utah United States

The National Park Service cuts right to the chase when it comes to the Maze.

It calls hiking here “very challenging” warning of slick rocks and steep drops.

It’s the most remote part of Canyonlands with visitors needing to negotiate long drives on dirt roads before setting out into the deep gullies where rockfalls and flash floods are not uncommon and water from the area’s few springs is hard to come by (packing enough fluid for a multi-day trip is a must).

Park rangers demand all visitors share their itineraries and stay in touch as often as practicable. Those that do come will be treated to landscapes that feel utterly timeless and will be unlikely to encounter other people on their adventures either.

HuaShan China

This epic trail to the South Peak of HuaShan one of China’s Five Great Mountains is often billed as the most dangerous hike in the world and for good reason.

To reach the summit which stands at 7070 feet hikers need to scale uneven steps and a series of ladders before hooking themselves onto a chain using a harness and carabiners to traverse its renowned “plank walk.”

This is as basic as it sounds – planks of wood bolted into the rock face which you follow both up and down the mountain.

While many tourists come in just sneakers and T-shirts this is not a place to arrive unprepared.

Proper hiking boots plenty of food and water and a decent level of fitness are essential.

Giro del Sorapiss Italy

The Dolomites are home to a series of stomach-churning via ferrata (literally ways of iron) – paths of metal rungs hammered into the rock during World War I when Italian and Austrian troops fought fierce battles across the region’s limestone peaks.

Today hikers looking for the thrill of climbing without the fear of long falls flock here during the spring and summer months.

The Giro del Sorapiss offers the biggest challenge of them all starting from Rifugio Vandelli before heading high into the mountains along sheer rock faces and taking in three separate via ferrata.

Hikers will need harnesses for clipping into the lines as well as a helmet and ideally a guide who can provide the requisite equipment and show the way.

Drakensberg Grand Traverse South Africa and Lesotho

Multi-day hikes offer intrepid walkers the chance to test their skills to the limit with changing weather and the need to carry ample supplies creating a real challenge.

The Drakensberg Grand Traverse certainly represents one. An epic 230 kilometer (143 miles) journey that can take up to two weeks to complete it kicks off with a climb up a set of chain ladders to the Drakensberg Escarpment before heading over the border with Lesotho and eventually heading back into South Africa.

This long distance monster can be attempted alone but hikers should be aware that the trail itself is more of a concept than a visible path meaning anyone planning to head here will need all of the KZN Wildlife Drakensberg hiking maps a GPS and enough food and water to last for the entire trip.

Spring or fall visits are recommended avoiding the lush hard-to-walk-on grass of summer and the bitter days of winter.

Cascade Saddle New Zealand

The reward? Endless vistas of snow-capped peaks. Ondrej/Adobe Stock

In the heart of Mount Aspiring National Park on New Zealand’s South Island Cascade Saddle offers some of the finest mountain views in the world.

But having seen a number of deaths earlier this century due to slippery rocks and treacherous conditions the country’s conservation department is keen to emphasize that this is a route “only for people with navigation and high level backcountry skills and experience” warning those who do come to be prepared to turn back if things get hairy.

Completed over two days with the option to camp or bunk up in mountain huts along the way the route includes wild scrambles rocky outcrops and hikes over ankle-cracking tussocky grass.

The reward is endless vistas of snow-capped peaks including the stunning Mount Aspiring also known by its Maori name of Tititea.

Kalalau Trail Hawaii

A 22-mile “out and back” along the Na Pali Coast of Kauai the Kalalau Trail isn’t just Hawaii’s most dangerous hike: It’s one of the most lethal in the entire United States.

The jungle trail cleaves to the coastline with the Pacific raging below.

You’ll need a permit to go beyond Hanakapiai Beach to Hanakoa Valley in order to camp either in the valley or at Kalalau beach.

While it sounds idyllic the trio of stream crossings here can be brutal in the wake of heavy rain when the water swells to extremely high levels.

Throw in a vertiginous path along Crawler’s Ledge and it’s a recipe for disaster for the inexperienced. Only those with proper outdoor smarts need apply.

Huayna Picchu Peru

Anyone who has seen a picture of Peru’s wildly popular Machu Picchu will have caught a glimpse of Huayna Picchu. It’s the towering peak which sits behind the Incas’ famous lost city seen in countless Instagram posts and on postcards sent home from South America.

Getting to the top however requires scaling the unsubtly titled ‘“stairs of death” a section of 500-year-old steps with sheer drops down to the valley below.

Throw in ladder sections that leave even the most hardened hikers feeling queasy and this is a route that isn’t to be underestimated. While plenty come unprepared hiking boots and the help of a local guide are highly advisable. It may seem daunting but the view of the citadel below is worth the three-hour effort.

Kokoda Track Papua New Guinea

The Kokoda Track takes up to two weeks to complete. Andrew Peacock/Stone RF/Getty Images

At 96 kilometers (around 60 miles) the Kokoda Track charts a route from just outside of the Papuan capital of Port Moresby to the village of Kokoda crossing the Owen Stanley Range.

This is isolated terrain with a trek taking up to two weeks to complete thanks to afternoon deluges raging torrents and conditions that can become treacherously slippery thanks to ankle deep mud and tree roots growing slippery in the tropical heat.

Following the death of 13 Australians heading to the track in a light aircraft in 2009 authorities have moved to make access to the path safer.

Permits are required and all visitors must walk with a licensed operator in a bid to help local communities benefit from tourism. To prepare for the sweaty days and bitter nights in this remote corner of the world organizers recommend training for up to a year.

When trekking this verdant and wild route it pays to remember it was the scene of vicious battles between Japanese and Allied Australian and Papuan forces during World War II.

Daikiretto Traverse Japan

Japan’s Northern Alps serve up arguably the best and certainly the most challenging hiking in the country. And the Daikiretto Traverse is unquestionably the route to try for hikers looking for a proper adventure – one that’s as close as they’ll get to a technical climb without the need for ropes.

The traverse itself covers less than two miles but can take hours to complete and is best undertaken as part of a longer guided trek through this beautiful range.

The path over the traverse makes use of chains and ladders following a knife-edge ridge with drops of over a hundred meters on either side.

A high level of fitness and a head for heights are musts. A helmet and gloves will make passage easier and it should be noted that attempting it alone especially in winter is ill-advised.

Mount Washington New Hampshire United States

Mount Washington is known for being home to the “world’s worst weather” (at least according to the Mount Washington Observatory).

In January 2004 temperatures at the summit plunged to a bitter -47º F (-44º C) while it also set a record for the fastest wind recorded on land a barely believable 231 mph (372 kph) in 1934 only surpassed in 1996 on Barrow Island Australia.

All that’s to say that hiking here requires serious preparation. Conditions can flip at any minute meaning you’ll need to pack winter gear even in the height of summer.

The ascent is no joke with hikers needing to be in great shape to achieve it. Yes it’s possible to drive or take the iconic cog train to the summit but anyone who’s well-prepared and keen on a challenge should pull on their boots fill their backpacks and do so on foot.",,,,,,

CPG says the launch of Bristol strengthens its nationwide trucking solutions by adding capacity for customers in major port markets experiencing rising import volumes.

“Expanding the CPG network with the opening of Bristol Transportation in these strategic locations will help us cater to the shift we are seeing in diverting cargo away from the West Coast and pushing volumes up in the East and Gulf coasts” said Joey Palmer president of CPG.

“We do things differently at Bristol Transportation; it’s not your typical drayage company” said Zach Hadden regional director. “We provide our drivers with the best compensation package on the market and 24/7 access to a wide range of support services that go far beyond what is offered by your typical trucking company. This strong support is what keeps our drivers engaged and ultimately results in better on-time delivery rates and top-notch customer service.”

Bristol offers:

Company chassis including tri-axels for handling overweight 20’s

Auto-generated reports from TMS system built specifically on customer’s parameters

Local and regional drayage

Long-haul trucking (OTR)

Overweight loads

Secure yards with option for pre-pulls and storage

Bristol says it has committed to further expansion with the goal of opening a new facility every few months for the ‘foreseeable future.’

The reigning Olympic champion who became the first Olympic men's 100m winner in the post-Usain Bolt era wrote a message on Twitter explaining that he would not compete for fear of risking a more serious injury.

Jacobs has suffered with both injury and illness this season but had come through his 100m heat on Friday to qualify for the semi-finals in a time of 10.04.

However this latest setback means he will not be able to aim for a third major title in a year after his wins at Tokyo 2020 and the 60m competition of the World Athletics Indoor Championships that took place in March.

The 100m semi-finals and final are both due to take place on Day 2 of the World Athletics Championships that are taking place in Oregon USA.

With Jacobs out of the running the favourites for the race include the USA's Fred Kerley Trayvon Bromell Marvin Bracy and Christian Coleman as well as African record holder Ferdinand Omurwa and the Jamaican pairing of Yohan Blake and Oblique Seville.

Our son Jacob Simmons was killed by a drunk driver on June 12 2020. The impaired driver hit Jacob from behind when he was riding his bike (and wearing a new helmet) around 5:30 p.m. that nice Friday afternoon then drove away without trying to help him in any way. He died. I don’t know how long he lived lying on the pavement alone. Via help from other drivers police found the driver in a rural driveway 12 kilometres away. We cannot thank police and those drivers enough for making sure that Jacob’s killer was found.

Norma Hunter spent that night in jail was charged and released the next day to go back home and resume her life.

Sentencing hearing

She had a couple of court appearances in Charlottetown that summer then she pleaded guilty to impaired driving causing death with a blood alcohol level over double the legal limit as well as guilty to leaving the scene of the crash. On Nov. 10 2020 the judge sentenced her to five years in prison.

I knew going into the sentencing hearing that although P.E.I. has some of the strongest penalties for impaired driving she likely would not get a long sentence for killing Jacob and leaving him to die alone on the side of the road. Ms. Hunter had pleaded guilty and shed a few obligatory tears at the sentencing. My family and I and some of Jacob’s friends tried our best to convey the damage and incomprehensible loss the killer caused through her selfish actions but it didn’t really matter. It seems there’s kind of a recipe to follow: plead guilty sound remorseful and you get the lighter version of sentencing. The court has to balance punishment with the killer’s rights and rehabilitation and take previous sentences for similar carnage in P.E.I. into account so five years it was. She also got a 15-year driving ban which was welcome news. She was taken into custody and started her sentence on Nov. 10 2020.

Repeatedly released

What I wasn’t prepared for was how quickly and repeatedly Norma Hunter was able to leave the prison under our current legal system. As a “registered victim of crime” I had opted to be notified of any changes in her status while in prison because I didn’t want to miss an opportunity to do a better job explaining what killing our son meant to us when her parole hearing came up. I figured that would be years away.

Here’s what I learned:

• A few months into her sentence she applied for escorted absences from the prison and although I wrote back to oppose them she was granted those absences starting in February 2021 (three months after she started her five-year sentence). She also was granted leave for personal development in December 2021 and for most of January and February 2022.

• She applied for day parole around mid-2021. She’d been in prison for about six months then. I opposed it and had to write and submit another impact statement in November 2021. Her day parole hearing was held Dec. 14 2021. Despite evidence of her lying to the parole board members and the members telling her they believed this was not her first time driving drunk she was granted day parole starting in January 2022. She had a five-year sentence and was on day parole within 14 months. I was shocked by all this.

• She was also given permission to have weekend trips on her own to Halifax. Not long after that she asked for leave to have some weekends here in P.E.I. in case she was granted full parole soon so that she could “ease in” to being at home in P.E.I. They said yes.

• I told the parole board that she lives less than 30 minutes from my home between my place and Charlottetown. I’m scared that she will drive impaired again and kill someone else in my family or some other innocent family. That didn’t seem to matter.

• She started full parole on July 11 2022 having served just over 1.5 years of her five-year sentence.

What I wasn’t prepared for was how quickly and repeatedly Norma Hunter was able to leave the prison under our current legal system.

Another death

She has resumed her life but of course Jacob is dead. He has no rights. His father died six weeks after him and Norma Hunter made his fight with cancer a downhill battle once she killed our son. No points or deductions for that though – it’s just collateral damage although she admitted at the day parole hearing in December that she drank again once she heard that he also died. She justified drinking that day by telling the parole board that she felt she was probably going to be blamed for that too. She was right – if not directly responsible for his death she made his remaining time on Earth pure hell and I witnessed that every day until he died on July 28 2020.

So what’s left? The judge gave her a 15-year driving prohibition that started on July 11 2022. That means she cannot legally drive a vehicle until 2037. People should know that the police do not need to catch such a person driving without a licence in order to charge them. Eye witnesses can call the police and she can be charged via their information. The public has to take on some of the responsibility because the police cannot be everywhere 24/7. If you see Ms. Hunter breaching any of her parole conditions please call the police.

Also she’s been ordered not to purchase or consume alcohol is prohibited from entering a drinking establishment cannot contact my family and she must follow a treatment plan (but has a prescription for medical marijuana according to the parole board report).

Societal responsibilities

We have to change our approach to drunk driving in this province. People are charged with impaired driving almost daily. Any of them could have killed your loved ones. We never heard of Norma Hunter before she a professional bartender downed 13 drinks on a sunny afternoon and drove over my son on her way to her boyfriend’s. Any impaired driver could kill some other random family’s children. I’m angry and honestly think if someone wants to drink themselves to death that’s sad and will take a toll on anyone who cared about that person. But drinking and then driving and killing someone else’s family – it deserves more than 1.5 years before you’re back on the street.

My son’s killer herself said at the sentencing that she made one bad decision that day that she will regret for the rest of her life. I’ve spent a lot of time thinking about that and wondering which decision she regrets: drinking and driving or driving over someone or not trying to help or call 911 or leaving the scene of the crash to avoid arrest or not finding a better hiding place for her car? That’s a lot of bad decisions … which one was Norma Hunter regretting?

My message is harsh but so is losing your son in the prime of his life and then seeing your husband of almost 32 years having that incredible pain and suffering dumped on him while he is fighting cancer. We need longer sentences and for people to actually serve their sentences in prison. We also need for it to be absolutely socially unacceptable for people to drive impaired in this province. We cannot have a tolerance or blind eye to that. Please keep calling 911 to report suspected impaired drivers. You might get them off the road before they kill someone you love.

Someone told me that Norma Hunter posted on Facebook last week: “Mama I’m coming home!” I’ll never get to see a post like that on Jacob’s social media. I don’t know what the solution is but what I have seen in our case is not punishment that fits the crime.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmlyaXNodGltZXMuY29tL2NyaW1lLWxhdy8yMDIyLzA3LzE3L2RlaXJkcmUtamFjb2ItbXVyZGVyLWludmVzdGlnYXRpb24taXMtbm90LW92ZXItZ2FyZGFpLWluc2lzdC_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Deirdre Jacob murder investigation 'is not over' gardaí insist,"Deirdre Jacob vanished from the roadside close to her family home just outside Newbridge Co Kildare on July 28th 1998

The Garda investigation into the abduction and murder of Kildare teenager Deirdre Jacob is continuing and detectives still believe people who have not yet come forward have vital information that can help solve the crime.

Garda sources said that while the latest investigative file sent to the Director of Public Prosecutions had not resulted in any charges — against chief suspect and convicted rapist Larry Murphy — the development was “not the end of the investigation”.

The Irish Times revealed at the weekend that the DPP had considered the file on the case sent by gardaí last year after a new investigation but had decided the evidence gathered was not strong enough to ground a prosecution.

Gardaí used modern technology to enhance CCTV images from around Newbridge Co Kildare on the day Ms Jacob went missing in 1998. However they did not provide any information that linked Murphy to the crime. The images were not clear enough for witnesses to identify a person captured in the CCTV.

Furthermore while a former prisoner came forward to gardaí and claimed Murphy had confided in him that he had abducted and killed Ms Jacob that evidence alone was not regarded as strong enough. While gardaí believe the information was credible there were also concerns the man’s criminal background would be used to undermine him if he was used as a witness in a court case.

That man claimed Murphy told him he pulled into the roadside on the pretence of asking Ms Jacob for directions and when she leaned into the vehicle to see what area he was pointing at on a map he dragged her inside and drove off. The witness claimed the motive for the abduction was sexual but that Murphy panicked because Ms Jacob struggled so much and he killed her immediately.

Gardaí have never found Ms Jacob’s remains and nothing of evidential value was discovered during searches in counties Wicklow and Kildare including as recently as last October. Those shortcomings in the investigation mean the manner of Ms Jacob’s death is not possible to prove and the location remains unknown which also undermined the prospects of a prosecution.

For two decades Ms Jacob’s disappearance was investigated as a missing-person inquiry before being upgraded to a murder case in 2018 following a review by the serious crime review team in the National Bureau of Criminal Investigation.

Ms Jacob vanished from the roadside close to her family home just outside Newbridge on July 28th 1998. The 19-year-old had gone into the town for a bank draft to pay for student accommodation in London where she was studying to become a primary schoolteacher. She vanished on her return home by foot.

Four years ago gardaí travelled to the UK to interview Murphy (56) who did not substantively engage with them. Originally from Baltinglass Co Wicklow he was released from prison in 2010 having served 10 years of a 15-year sentence for the kidnapping rape and attempted murder of a woman in the Wicklow mountains in 2001."

Johnson found that out in heartbreaking fashion on Wednesday in the Class 4A state championship match at Duluth High School.

The Knights fell 2-0 to Westminster in a rematch of the 2023 title match snapping several impressive streaks in the process. They had their 14 straight postseason game win streak going back to 2021 snapped; saw their 15 match win streak in 2024 come to end; and had their state title run end at two as they were looking to defend their Class 4A state title.

“It’s soccer. You win some you lose some” Johnson coach Frank Zamora said in a rainy interview afterwards. “This is still a young group. They now see what it’s like to lose at this stage and I'm sure they’ll learn from this and come back stronger and motivated next year.”

The Wildcats (17-4-2) dominated much of the first half against the defending champions. They produced a solid scoring chance just two minutes in and Benjamin Villatoro was forced to make a diving save on another shot in the 9th minute.

The Knights' usually consistent ball-control offense sputtered for the first 19 minutes with six midfield turnovers. As a result the Wildcats were able to generate 7 shots many within 20 yards.

Johnson’s 6th turnover would contribute mightily. The Wildcats would take advantage as Will Stewart found himself alone on the left side for a 10-yard blast. Villatoro was able to make a diving save but that left Aditya Kaul wide open for an easy goal on the rebound for a 1-0 lead with 21:16 left in the first half.

The Knights (18-2-1) would get a huge break two minutes later however as Westminsters’s Tristen Lewis received a red card when he upended Vazquez who was on a breakaway just outside of the box.

Johnson turned that into their first two shots of the game moments later but Andres Galacia’s blast from 20-yards sailed wide left.

From there the Johnson offense awakened. They created three corners and outshot the Wildcats 4-1 over the final 20 minutes. But it would still go to the half 1-0 Westminster despite two huge opportunities for the Knights in the final two minutes..

A 15-yard blast by Vazquez after a beautiful long ball into the box sailed just over the crossbar in the 38th minute. Another Galacia shot from 22-yards out sailed just wide of the left crossbar in the final 30 seconds.

Westminster outshot the Knights 9-4 in the opening 40 minutes but generated just one shot after the red card to Lewis.

Johnson took the man-advantage into the second half but it was quickly erased on a questionable call against Jalil Chavez who got a red card of his own in the 42nd minute.

With the match back to even strength the Knights were able to generate a 6-2 shot advantage midway into the second half. But they could not cash in for the equalizer.

The Wildcats added a huge insurance goal with 14 minutes left to essentially seal it on a header from Alex Na off a corner in the 66th minute.

“Westminster came out with a lot of intensity and we did not match it” Zamora said. “We definitely picked it up when we had the man advantage but we missed some really good opportunities that would have changed the momentum. Then we got the red card and changed the momentum back a little bit.

“We had chances. We just couldn’t finish and find the net. But I think there were a lot of people that did not think we could get back to this point and the younger guys showed that they can play. I’m very proud of the season they had.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMidWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnJldXRlcnMuY29tL21hcmtldHMvY29tbW9kaXRpZXMvcGxhdGludW0tc2V0LWJpZ2dlc3QtZGVmaWNpdC1kZWNhZGUtMjAyNC1zYXlzLWpvaG5zb24tbWF0dGhleS0yMDI0LTA1LTA4L9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Platinum set for biggest deficit in a decade in 2024 says Johnson Matthey,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 401 Client Error: HTTP Forbidden for url: https://www.reuters.com/markets/commodities/platinum-set-biggest-deficit-decade-2024-says-johnson-matthey-2024-05-08/ on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMidWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnJldXRlcnMuY29tL21hcmtldHMvY29tbW9kaXRpZXMvcGxhdGludW0tc2V0LWJpZ2dlc3QtZGVmaWNpdC1kZWNhZGUtMjAyNC1zYXlzLWpvaG5zb24tbWF0dGhleS0yMDI0LTA1LTA4L9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMitAFodHRwczovL3d3dy55YWhvby5jb20vZW50ZXJ0YWlubWVudC9kd2F5bmUtam9obnNvbi1pcy1kaWZmaWN1bHQtdG8td29yay13aXRoLXJlcG9ydC1jbGFpbXMtdGhlLXN0YXItaGFzLW1vdW50YWlucy1vZi1wdWJsaWMtZ29vZHdpbGwtdG8tb2Zmc2V0LW5lZ2F0aXZpdHktZXhwZXJ0LXNheXMtMTcxNDAyNDM4Lmh0bWzSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Dwayne Johnson is difficult to work with report claims. The star has 'mountains of public goodwill' to offset negativity ...,"Dwayne “the Rock” Johnson’s nice guy reputation has been taking some hits — but the “mountains of public goodwill” he’s built over the years should outshine the drama an expert tells Yahoo Entertainment.

A recent report from the Wrap saw more than a dozen people who worked with Johnson on the upcoming holiday action-comedy film Red One criticize his “chronic lateness and lack of professionalism on set.”

Insiders claimed the Black Adam actor — who co-stars alongside Chris Evans and J.K. Simmons — “was late an average of seven to eight hours per day and missed several entire days of production” resulting in the movie running at least $50 million over budget. They pointed fingers at the film’s “inexperienced” lead producer Hiram Garcia who is Johnson’s ex-brother-in-law and ex-personal assistant for letting things spiral. An insider called the situation “a f***ing disaster” and claimed “Dwayne truly doesn’t give a f***.”

Sources claimed Johnson’s lateness is a pattern saying he had a “huge fight” with an “infuriated” Ryan Reynolds after showing up five hours late to the set of their movie Red Notice in 2020. There’s also a wild story about him urinating in water bottles (something he previously copped to doing).

A spokesperson for Amazon MGM the film studio behind Red One denied the claims in the report calling Johnson and his production company Seven Bucks “incredible partners.” Johnson insiders told the outlet he “averaged no more than one hour late” and “the budget did not deviate much from the agreed-upon figure.” Johnson’s rep did not respond to Yahoo’s request for comment.

Despite the scathing report a crisis and PR expert doesn’t expect this to cause lasting damage to Johnson’s reputation.

“There is a better chance of Martians landing on the lawn of the Biden White House than this ever permanently hurting the Rock” Eric Schiffer of Reputation Management Consultants tells Yahoo.

What’s going on with Johnson?

In addition to being one of the most bankable actors in Hollywood Johnson is one of the most likable celebrities — and a large part of that is due to his strong work ethic. Johnson brands himself as a hard worker — his Instagram with 397 million followers shows a dizzying schedule of gym time movie shoots meetings adorable girl dad moments and philanthropy.

Johnson’s production company Seven Bucks is a nod to his bank account balance when he was cut from a pro football team at age 22. It made the then broke star pivot to a career in wrestling rising through the ranks at the World Wrestling Federation (later called World Wrestling Entertainment or WWE) before crossing over to Hollywood and starring in the Fast and the Furious and Jumanji franchises. In 2016 Forbes listed Johnson as the highest-paid actor and currently estimates his net worth at $270 million between his movies production company wrestling endorsements and brands. A key part of his success is being able to connect with the masses but not forgetting his roots which is why many want to see him run for president.

It seems that over the last year-plus however there have been some negative headlines. The biggest prior to now was in September when he and Oprah Winfrey faced backlash after asking people to donate to their Maui wildfire fund — instead of giving more of their own money. He acknowledged the criticism and he and Winfrey quietly donated more than they had pledged.

The drama has been simmering elsewhere: His bankability took a small hit with 2022’s Black Adam which didn’t perform as well as anticipated and he faced criticism over how he handled it. The Wrap story also seemed to confirm that Johnson attempted to have his production company take over the DC films universe in 2022. It didn’t happen and Johnson going around others for the secret meeting didn’t sit well. Variety reported on that in 2023 with an insider saying Johnson’s “demands” — including having his brand of tequila served at a premiere of PG-13-rated Black Adam — “increased and the returns just weren’t there.”

This year Johnson made a big return to WWE and was appointed to the board of its parent company TKO but he was booed by fans for being almost two hours late to an April event. Recently he’s been hamming it up to play the villain in the pro wrestling storyline. The same week the View audience jeered the mention of his name for saying he won’t be endorsing a presidential candidate in the 2024 election. (He endorsed Joe Biden in 2020 but said he learned that sharing his political opinions only causes division.)

The Wrap story has brought back into conversation Johnson’s infamous feud with his Fast and the Furious franchise co-star Vin Diesel. If Johnson really does show up eight hours late to set — or not at all — that could certainly fuel tension (though reports at the time also cited Diesel’s lateness). The article also surfaces drama with Reynolds noting that the co-stars “didn’t speak for years” after their fall 2020 blowup but have since patched things up.

There’s been counterprogramming to the Wrap story. An unconfirmed report from Puck suggests that “unflattering” press about Johnson may stem from a former publicist. People magazine ran a story about Johnson’s “flourishing career” and how he’s found “success in many areas” with an unnamed source saying “People love him.” And the Rock’s own Instagram feed has been filled with sweet fan encounters and charitable endeavors.

Years of building a good reputation will ‘offset these recent damaging allegations’

It’s true — people do love Johnson who has spent years cultivating a good reputation and it should help see him through this negative patch of press.

“The best strategy for the Rock is to tackle the bad press in a setting where he can poke fun at himself and the facts of his situation” says Schiffer. “The Rock is beloved globally and has built mountains of public goodwill that can offset these recent damaging allegations.”

How does a star like Johnson who will voice the Maui character in the Moana sequel out later this year break the cycle of bad press? By “addressing the negative items with empathy and truth owning your part in it and then showing what you learned” says Schiffer.

He adds “The Rock did that well with the outcry in Hawaii and will likely do the same with the hits on being late on the set of his film.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMia2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnN0YXJ0cmlidW5lLmNvbS93ZXMtam9obnNvbi1taW5uZXNvdGEtdHdpbnMtcGl0Y2hpbmctZ2VvcmdpYS1iYXNlYmFsbC1wYXRyaWNrLXJldXNzZS82MDAzNjQzMTkv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Former Twins pitching coach Wes Johnson brings his velocity to Georgia,"Wes Johnson was asked about the strength of the Southeastern Conference in baseball knowing this would allow him to brag about the competition being faced in a first season as the head coach of the Georgia Bulldogs.

""There is our league and there is everybody else"" Johnson said by cellphone on Tuesday. ""I would equate the SEC in college baseball to the glory days of the American League East when every team was good.""

If you followed Wes in 3½ seasons as the Twins pitching coach from 2019 to the end of June 2022 you had to suspect this was not going to come without some evidence.

""One basic but telling statistic is that the average fastball in our league is a couple miles per hour higher than in the next best league"" Johnson said. ""Actually it was 1.6 [mph] the last time I checked.""

Likely that was on Monday after a weekend when the Bulldogs swept Vanderbilt for the first time since 2003 filling their compact Foley Field over the seating capacity of 3200. This raised Georgia to 35-12 overall 13-11 in the SEC and to No. 15 in the national rankings.

Velocity was the most-routine of the numbers that Johnson 52 has used in his quest to get the most out of pitchers which goes back to his first six years of coaching — as an assistant at Sylvan Hills High School in Arkansas.

Sixteen years later after stops at two more Arkansas high schools and four colleges (including the rising Dallas Baptist program from 2012 to 2015) the Twins hired him on Nov. 15 2018 to become new manager Rocco Baldelli's pitching coach.

He was the first-ever coach known to make that transition: from college directly to being the pitching coach for a big-league team.

That made you a baseball pioneer Wes … right?

""I didn't think of myself that way"" he said. ""I just saw it as a great opportunity to work with very good people. Working for Rocco [Baldelli] … in my mind I don't think there's a better manager. A lot of what I learned from him I'm trying to use as a head coach in college.""

Pitching theories were evolving in the 2010s at about the same rate as artificial intelligence is right now. Pitching coach Garvin Alston was ousted along with manager Paul Molitor after the 2018 season. And in came Baldelli — and Johnson.

Twins baseball boss Derek Falvey heard Johnson speak at pitching coaches clinic in ""2012 or 2013″ and repeated this Tuesday:

""The thing that stood out back then was how much he focused on development that was rooted in the newer data. Very few coaches were as curious about how to improve pitchers as Wes.""

As surprising as it was in the fall of 2018 to hire a pitching coach from college it was more so when Johnson told the Twins in late June 2022 that he had taken the pitching coach job at LSU — and wanted to leave quickly.

One reason offered for LSU needing him in midsummer was to assist with new volatile world of the transfer portal. That reason sounded thin then not so much now.

""I was able to recruit Paul Skenes and he committed to us in late July"" Johnson said. ""We also brought in another very good pitcher and were able to keep another who was going to transfer.""

Result: Skenes transferring from the Air Force Academy where he was a two-way player (including as a very tall catcher) was a superstar pitcher for LSU on its way to winning the 2023 College World Series.

He was the No. 1 overall draft choice and now all Pirates fans await his arrival as Skenes dominates in Class AAA. In fact Skenes' girlfriend — Olivia Dunne the LSU gymnast estimated to earn $3.9 million per year in NIL money — caused a stir recently by suggesting that was near.

Another of Johnson's avowed reasons for leaving the Twins was the desire to eventually become a college head coach. Georgia hired him last June 5 and then he stayed with LSU through the dramatics of the College World Series.

And get this: The Bulldogs probably will have the No. 1 overall selection in the MLB draft in 6-6 slugger Charlie Condon with home runs estimated at … well Johnson said:

""There have been a couple of 450-footers. We've been playing him at four five places for position versatility. But Charlie's been very good at third base.""

Bottom line:

As we approach the second anniversary of Wes' last game with the Twins we have better answers as to why this 5-foot-7 gent with the big pitching brain chose to return to the college game."

The industry AC sales number zoomed even though makers took a price increase two to three times in the last six months having a cumulative impact of nearly 10-15 per cent as they faced unprecedented inflationary pressure from metals to key components and an increase in logistic charges such as ocean freight.

Voltas has sold close to 1.2 million units of residential ACs while LG Electronic India has sold over one million units of residential inverter air-conditioners in the domestic market in the first half of this calendar year said their respective statements.

However some players are evaluating changes in their input costs as the Indian rupee is at a historic low against the US Dollar which has increased component import costs and the recent revision by the government's Bureau of Energy Efficiency (BEE) in the star rating of AC.

In the first half of 2022 other air conditioner manufacturers such as Hitachi Daikin Panasonic and Haier -also witnessed a similar upwards trend in their unit sales and expect an encouraging number for the remaining second half though it contributes around 25 per cent of their sales.

The first half of this year was very good for the air conditioner industry amid scorching heat this season without any lockdown restrictions said Consumer Electronics and Appliances Manufacturers Association (CEAMA) President Eric Braganza.

""The January to June AC market (domestic) must be close to 6 million units. We never had such a high sales number in the past. I expect the second half to be in the region of around 2.5 million units and end this year with around 8.5 million units"" Braganza told PTI.

In 2019 when the market was not affected by the pandemic the industry had sold nearly 4.25 to 4.5 million units in the first half.

Daikin India Chairman & MD K J Jawa said the company has sold around 4 lakh units in the April-June quarter and around 7 lakh units in the first half of 2022.

""We have grown over 30 per cent (in units) over 2019 (pre-pandemic) and over 175 per cent over last year"" he said.

Voltas has sold close to 1.2 million AC units in H1 CY 22 the highest ever by any player in the industry. This led to an increase in demand for cooling products given the intense summer experienced across the country coupled with the company's strong online and offline distribution network and strongest brand equity the Tata group firm said in a statement.

Similarly LG Electronic India sold over one million units of residential inverter air-conditioners in the domestic market in the H1 period clocking a growth of nearly 50 per cent compared to last year in which split models accounted for 90 per cent.

It has garnered Rs 4000 crore revenues from the AC segment in the January-June period said LG Electronics India VP Home Appliances & Air Conditioner Deepak Bansal.

Makers such as Panasonic India also witnessed 35 per cent growth in the number of units sold in the first of 2022 in comparison to pre-pandemic 2019.

""Overall we witnessed more than 35 per cent growth this summer (vs FY2019) for Air Conditioners; recording the highest ever sales in the month of March"" he said adding ""consumers are also moving towards premium buys as we saw huge demand for inverter ACs with maximum contribution coming from 4 stars and 5-star inverter ACs"" said Panasonic India Business Head Air Conditioners Group Gaurav Sah.

According to Haier Appliances India President Satish NS ""We have achieved 70 per cent YoY growth in value; attaining a 60 per cent YoY growth in units sold in H1 '22"" he said.

Besides the makers also anticipate good sales of residential air conditioners during the July to December period though it roughly contributes around 25 per cent of the industry sales.

""Though the peak season for the AC market remains the April - June quarter we anticipate a good festive season for the industry that will further boost the consumer appliances sector"" Satish added.

Johnson Controls-Hitachi Air Conditioning India which sells residential AC under the Hitachi brand said it aims over 20 per cent growth in FY 22-23 (over 2019) in the Indian market and is optimistic about achieving record sales of approximately Rs 1500 crore said its Chairman and Managing Director Gurmeet Singh.

Now the Indian rupee is on the brink of Rs 80 per dollar some makers are again evaluating the input cost changes for any further decisions on pricing as air-condition is still largely dependent on import (having a domestic value addition of 25 to 30 per cent only)

""In line with the market and increasing commodity prices we had to increase the price of our Air Conditioners twice this year we are evaluating the input cost changes before we take any further decisions on pricing"" said Gaurav Sah.

According to Satish NS ""with the recent revision in BEE ratings for the AC industry the new SKUs are yet to reach the market and it would be critical to review the competitive cost and price trends.",,,,,,,,,,,,

His primary research interests are China's international relations and ""socialism with Chinese characteristics."" The article reflects the author's opinions and not necessarily the views of CGTN.

The U.S. justifies its hard power by claiming to stand up for human rights. Unfortunately for those who receive U.S. ""aid"" they become the victim to human rights violations. The quest to ""save"" the people of Afghanistan Iraq and Libya all led to unprecedented suffering and casualties which continues to this day.

Despite the two-decade rampage inflicted on Muslim countries there hasn't been any soul searching. Why would there be when the U.S. military-industrial complex profits from chaos? Resources are captured and geopolitical aims such as keeping the Global South under-developed and Eurasia disconnected are successful and profitable.

This gigantic recurring scam i.e. war in the name of human rights has gone for broke by falsely accusing China of ""enslaving and genociding millions of its Muslims in concentration camps.""

Before attempting to ruin China in the name of trumped-up human rights charges U.S. citizens should remain cognizant of its real home-grown human rights incarceration tragedy. The U.S. prison industrial complex has transformed the U.S. into the world's number one prison state which exploits prisoners rather than rehabilitating them.

The U.S. has more than 20 percent of the world's prison population but it doesn't even have 5 percent of the world's population. This incarceration rate just like U.S. military spending is significantly higher than all others.

Like the U.S. ability to destroy other nations this drive to be ""number one"" when it comes to incarceration has been driven by the forces of capital that have captured the governing apparatus. Under the banner of the ""War on Drugs"" from the 1970s the U.S. prison population skyrocketed by 500 percent to around 2 million people today.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRpcHJhbmtzLmNvbS9uZXdzL2FydGljbGUvNS1zdGFyLWZpbmFuY2lhbC1hbmFseXN0LWlzLWJ1bGxpc2gtb24tdGhlc2UtdHdvLWJhbmstc3RvY2tz0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,5-Star Financial Analyst is Bullish on These Two Bank Stocks - TipRanks.com,"With recession fears rising and inflation at record-high levels making investment decisions are hard.

Overall the Wall Street community is cautiously optimistic about the stock with a Moderate Buy consensus rating based on 13 Buys and five Holds. The MS average price target of $92.41 implies the stock has upside potential of 18.4% from current levels. Shares have declined 10% over the past year.

Key Takeaways

With inflation showing no signs of slowing down interest rates are likely to remain elevated for the foreseeable future. In such a situation banks are expected to continue to benefit. Considering Susan Roth Katzke’s stellar track record and experience in covering the banking sector over many decades her picks can be given serious consideration by investors as viable investment choices.

Sweet loving husband father brother and friend left this world too soon on Friday July 15 2022 at the age of 66. Born in Waterloo IA on September 19 1955 and raised in Wisconsin Rapids Scott was the first-born to the late Alfred and Shirley (Liedke) Sweet. Often referred to as Little Al Scott was the clone of his father Big Al in their appearance habits and temperament. Scott graduated from Lincoln High School in 1974 and maintained lifelong relationships with several friends through their shared passion for golf and bird hunting. He earned a Bachelor’s degree in Finance from UW-Whitewater and worked most of his career in business banking retiring from JP Morgan Chase in 2013. He loved working with his clients and maintained friendships with many of them after his retirement. Scott always looked forward to quality time with his family. He married Lynn Miller on March 30 1992 in Las Vegas- a day also marked by a very rare tornado occurrence. As a father to two girls Amanda and Ashley Scott was thrilled to watch his daughters participate in various sports and events. Marveling at their abilities were some of the best times of his life. He instilled in them a passion for travel people watching and sarcasm- or the rare activity that involved all three- like sipping sangria at Salduba pub while the yachts and Ferraris pulled into Puerto Banús Spain. Anyone who knew Scott also knew he had a love affair with the game of golf. He sped around town with personalized ‘Own18th’ license plates commemorating his ace on the final hole at Oshkosh Country Club. Scrambling with the Buffoons on Friday afternoons was the highlight of his week. His love for the Badgers Packers and Brewers and tradition of attending games at their home fields and across the country will live on for generations. Following retirement he achieved a lifelong dream of wintering in Naples Florida. There you could find Scott Lynn and their beloved goldendoodle Murphy cruising around the community in a customized golf cart. Scott is survived by adoring family and friends across the world- his wife Lynn; daughters Amanda (Jacob Fraser) Sweet of Hermosa Beach CA and Ashley (Jason Bagby) Sweet-Bagby of Everett WA; sisters Julia Sweet of Ponte Vedra Beach FL and Anne (Christophe Fede) Sweet of Paris France; stepmother Maria Sweet of Marbella Spain; brother-in-law Steve (Nancy) Miller of Brevard NC. His legacy will live on with the arrival of his first grandchildren due in August 2022 and another in February 2023. In addition he leaves behind dear friends Scot and Deb Herman R Bob Doof and Terri Richardson. The family would like to thank the amazing providers at the Vince Lombardi Cancer Center Aurora Interventional Radiology and the staff at Eden Meadows. A service for Scott will be held at Konrad-Behlman Westside (100 Lake Pointe Dr) on Wednesday July 20 2022 at 5PM. A visitation will be held from 3PM until the time of service. As a celebration of life colorful attire is encouraged. Libations will be enjoyed at his favorite haunt following the service. In lieu of flowers memorials may be sent to the Oshkosh Area Humane Society.

Hewlett Packard Enterprise owns two buildings on the Fort Collins campus totaling 580000 square feet. Christopher Wood/BizWest

Sixty years after Hewlett-Packard Co. employees first began moving into Building A on the company’s new Loveland campus in October 1962 the company that once grew to employ more than 9000 workers in Loveland Fort Collins and Greeley does not have the presence that it once did.

Today HP’s successor companies — Hewlett-Packard Enterprise Co. (NYSE: HPE) and HP Inc. (NYSE: HPQ) — occupy 580000 square feet in Fort Collins with HPE employing 800 people. (HP Inc. did not respond to requests for information.)

But HP’s legacy extends far beyond that footprint from spinoff companies that continue to employ thousands of workers to the real estate that HP left behind.

SPONSORED CONTENT Business Cares: May 2024 As Mental Health Awareness Month unfolds in Colorado it serves as a reminder of the collective responsibility to prioritize mental well-being.

Much of the Fort Collins campus is now owned by Broadcom which essentially is a spinoff of a spinoff i.e. HP’s spinoff of Agilent Technologies Inc. which then sold its Semiconductor Products Group to an investment group creating Avago Technologies Inc. which acquired Broadcom in 2015.

No HP employees remain at the Loveland site where it all started but another spinoff of a spinoff — Keysight Technologies Inc. (NYSE: KEYS) which grew out of Agilent in 2014 — maintains an operation there.

In Greeley nothing remains of an HP operation that was once the center of the city’s nascent tech sector.

HP’s three Northern Colorado campuses have witnessed far different fates since the company began divesting local operations and selling local properties with tech remaining the driving force in Fort Collins and tech and manufacturing enjoying a resurgence at what was the Loveland campus. Greeley however has seen demolition of the long-vacant HP building with the bulk of the acreage transformed for residential retail and other uses.

Loveland

Hewlett-Packard Co.’s history in Northern Colorado began in Loveland but it almost didn’t start that way. Loveland had to compete with Boulder for an HP expansion but problems with potential Boulder sites — and a strong pitch from Loveland civic and business leaders — prompted Colorado native David Packard and other HP executives to select Loveland instead according to an HP Computer Museum post on the history of the Loveland plant.

The plant — with a temporary building opening in 1960 and the first permanent building in 1962 — initially produced power supplies but eventually began producing desktop computers and calculators. HP’s Loveland operation also produced a variety of computer peripherals including printers and instruments such as voltmeters.

The campus — on the northeast corner of South Taft Avenue and 14th Street Southwest — remained a bastion for HP’s global operations for decades but change began in the late 1990s.

HP spun off Agilent in 1998 and by 2005 only 500 people remained at the Loveland site according to the HP Computer Museum.

The Thompson School District acquired one building on the former HP/Agilent campus in 2004 an 88000-square-foot building at 800 S. Taft Ave. that was formerly home to Colorado Memory Systems Inc. which built the structure in 1984. Colorado Memory Systems was founded by former HP employee Bill Bierwaltes. The company manufactured computer tape backup systems and was acquired by HP in 1992.

The school district purchased the building for $4.7 million and now uses it for its headquarters.

Just to the east is Keysight Technologies at 900 S. Taft Ave. Keysight spun off from Agilent in 2014 developing test and measurement equipment.

Keysight’s Loveland building encompasses more than 139000 square feet.

Kari Fauber vice president of Keysight’s global partner sales and ecommerce told BizWest in an email that the Loveland facility is “primarily a research and development site but also hosts teams from legal sales marketing finance logistics and services.

“Keysight delivers advanced design and validation solutions that help accelerate innovation to connect and secure the world” she said. “Keysight’s dedication to speed and precision extends to software-driven insights and analytics that bring tomorrow’s technology products to market faster across the development lifecycle in design simulation prototype validation automated software testing manufacturing analysis and network performance optimization and visibility in enterprise service provider and cloud environments.”

Keysight’s customers span the worldwide communications and industrial ecosystems aerospace and defense automotive energy semiconductor and general electronics markets Fauber said.

Keysight also maintains operations in Colorado Springs and Boulder. It acquired Eggplant Software Inc. with U.S. headquarters in Boulder in 2020 for $330 million.

Keysight employs 14300 worldwide and employed about 300 people in Loveland at the time of the spinoff from Agilent. The company recorded revenue of $4.94 billion in 2021.

With Agilent’s retrenchment in Loveland the company negotiated a deal in May 2011 to sell the bulk of the Loveland campus to the city for $5.8 million.

Plans to revitalize the campus were ambitious with the Colorado Association of Manufacturing and Technology eventually selecting the site in June 2011 for an Aerospace and Clean Energy Manufacturing and Innovation Park known as ACE. The project was touted as creating up to 10000 jobs.

But the proposal faltered early on with developer United Properties withdrawing from the project in August 2011 citing unattainable timelines.

Loveland then selected Bowling Green Kentucky-based developer Cumberland and Western to develop the property with the city selling the property to the company for $5 million.

Plans for the ACE park formally ended in March when CAMT withdrew from the project.

Even before that Cumberland and Western had rebranded the site as the Rocky Mountain Center for Innovation and Technology.

Cumberland and Western invested in upgrades to the property including some tenant finishes and successfully lured Lightning eMotors Inc. (NYSE: ZEV) as a tenant. In April 2016 Cumberland and Western announced that EWI a Columbus Ohio-based organization that promotes manufacturing technologies would open an applied research center at RMCIT.

But it all wasn’t enough and Cumberland and Western opted through commercial brokerage CBRE to put the property on the market for $22.8 million in October 2020.

Loveland site sells rebrands

Cumberland and Western eventually found its buyer although not for the full asking price. In late October 2020 a group of local business owners led by Jay Dokter Josh Kamrath and Dan Kamrath purchased the 811000-square-foot property for $15.5 million under the entity RMCIT LLC.

Dokter CEO of Loveland-based Vergent Products Inc. and his partners began working to increase occupancy from an anemic 16%.

The new owners quickly got to work rebranding the property as the Forge Campus in March 2021.

“We just observed all of the potential that didn’t happen and thought ‘We could do that’” Dokter said. “What we saw was 40 to 50 companies in here collocated creating an innovative tech environment. And the price was right too. So we knew that it wasn’t as risky. We also saw building prices were going up for a lot of commercial.”

Cumberland and Western’s initial approach to the property was to secure a single large occupant Dokter said.

Jay Dokter and other investors acquired most of the former Hewlett-Packard Co. campus in Loveland for $15.5 million and are breathing new life into the facility. Christopher Wood/BizWest

“I think there was a fair amount of activity. They seemed to be going more for the grand slam one occupant and that market is extremely limited” he said adding that Cumberland did refocus to allow smaller companies in.

The vision of Dokter and his partners was clear from the beginning: Create an environment in which occupants would build an innovation ecosystem interacting and feeding off of one another.

The owners moved one of their own companies into the Forge — Bongo which provides video-assessment solutions for experiential learning. The investors also plan to relocate another of their companies Vergent Products a contract design and manufacturing company into the facility within a couple of years.

Dokter said one of the key advantages of the Loveland property was the maintenance that Cumberland and Western provided for almost a decade.

Often vacant properties are allowed to decay with damage by weather vandalism and neglect. Not so with the Loveland site. Cumberland and Western continued to employ a team of one part-time worker and three full-time workers to maintain the property and conduct real estate tours.

“The cool thing with Cumberland and Western is that they spent a lot of money maintaining the property” Dokter said. “I never forget the first time I came here to get a tour … there was a nice man waxing the floor over here in an empty building — one of those machines that go back and forth in an empty building. That impressed me that it was quite preserved.”

“Big buildings like this you don’t just shut the lights off and walk away” said Rob Blauvelt property manager for the Forge and one of the full-time workers who maintained the property during the Cumberland and Western years.

Cumberland and Western maintained a contract for upkeep of the 22 acres of roof. Landscaping was maintained although at a lower level than when the property was occupied. Cracks in parking lots were filled. HVAC systems were maintained.

“It was three and a half people watching an empty building for 11 years” Dokter said.

The property’s 16% occupancy at the time of purchase included 12 tenants but that number has doubled to 24. Another five tenants are housed on-site in The Warehouse accelerator a nonprofit organization that occupies 48000 square feet of donated space.

Allison Seabeck executive director of The Warehouse said the organization has three alumni members and three off-site members along with the five onsite members.

A capital campaign has raised $1.1 million out of a $4.8 million capital raise allowing the organization to add a staff member and proceed through Phase I of its construction plan creating space for nine companies.

Phase II of the capital campaign entails raising another $1.25 millon including $750000 to create space for 15 more companies including installation of a series of “garage pods” in the accelerator space providing turnkey manufacturing space for startups that need access to manufacturing floor space equipment ample power compressed air and other features.

Future expansions will include further buildout including community space a training room additional equipment a share marketing studio and other amenities.

Including The Warehouse occupancy at the Forge stands at 54% Dokter said with other leases pending.

One recent addition is Veloce Energy Inc. a Los Angeles-based company that produces modular devices to make electrification easier.

Veloce moved its Colorado location from north Fort Collins into the Forge campus in May. The company employs 12 people locally.

Additionally E.I. Medical Imaging a trade name for OrcaWest Holdings Inc. will move into the Forge. E.I. Medical Imaging develops real-time ultrasound devices for use by veterinarians and livestock producers.

Lightning eMotors which Cumberland and Western first brought to the site has expanded rapidly growing from 142386 square feet when Dokter and his team acquired the property to 250000 square feet and 260 employees. The company provides commercial electric vehicles for fleets and went public in 2021.

The Forge thus far has a mix of large clean-tech and other manufacturing companies.

“They’re more complimentary than you would think” Dokter said of the tenant mix. “That is the whole idea. We want to do more and more mixing and explaining who does what.”

With Vergent Products Dokter already has two clients within the Forge with another three potential clients. That cross-pollination can be seen among other tenants as well he said.

One additional amenity will foster even more interaction: The Forge soon will reopen the old HP cafeteria bringing a variety of local restaurant and catering companies in to provide a mix of dining options.

Blauvelt stressed the quality of the construction that is attractive for potential manufacturers.

“What you have here are structurally sound buildings with solid floors with a massive amount of power a massive amount of heating and cooling water a good amount of compressed air infrastructure for process vacuum … and you have a campus that’s just inviting as a workplace” Blauvelt said.

“This thing has awesome bones” he added “and it’s really easy to fit a business into here. It’s not very challenging to fit a complex operation into this space.”

And that 22 acres of roofs? Future plans call for installation of solar panels further emphasizing the site’s focus on clean technologies.

Stability characterizes Fort Collins site

No city in Northern Colorado has maintained as much of HP’s legacy operations as has Fort Collins a site that opened in 1978 and employed as many as 3200 HP workers at its peak.

In fact HP — both Hewlett Packard Enterprise and HP Inc. — remain prominent employers on the campus located on the northeast corner of East Harmony and Ziegler roads — with HP Inc. leasing space within Hewlett Packard Enterprise’s two buildings on 71.5 acres.

Hewlett Packard Enterprise’s operations there employ 800 workers and are varied.

“The Fort Collins site houses a range of business units and functions — from servers to R&D to marketing. It’s a multi-use facility and not dedicated to any specific part of the company” Adam Bauer a spokesman for HPE said in an email to BizWest.

The Fort Collins campus sits on the East Harmony Road corridor the focal point of a cluster of high-tech companies that includes Broadcom Intel Corp. Advanced Micro Devices and others. “Certainly having other tech players with whom we partner and do business in close proximity helps create an ecosystem that is mutually beneficial” he said. “That’s true in Fort Collins Silicon Valley Houston — everywhere we have a large presence.”

Bauer said that Fort Collins “is an important location for HPE and again is host to a range of business units and functions that span the company. It remains one of our biggest employment hubs in the U.S. and is an important part of our history. We do not anticipate any change to Fort Collins’ role in the company at this time. We actually are in the process of renovating the site to accommodate our hybrid Edge-to-Office working model that arose out of the pandemic.”

HPE leases space to HP Inc. which did not respond to BizWest requests for comment. The city of Fort Collins estimates that HP Inc. employs 1100 local workers but that number could not be verified.

HPE in April 2019 sold a building on the Fort Collins campus — at 3420 E. Harmony Road — to an entity owned by McWhinney Real Estate Services Inc. of Loveland for $21 million. Bauer declined to speculate on any plans to sell additional properties.

“We continuously evaluate our real estate portfolio based on a variety of criteria including usage opportunities for cost optimization and other factors” he said. “I can’t speculate on future real estate transactions.”

The McWhinney building is largely vacant although fully leased. Madwire formerly occupied the third floor and a first-floor gym space but the company has put the space on the sublease market although it continues to pay rent.

Additionally Comcast Corp. (Nasdaq: CMCSA) has vacated 80000 square feet within the building. The company had opened a call center in 2016 with plans to house up to 600 employees.

But those plans changed in September 2019 when the company announced closure of the operation. Comcast’s lease expires in 2027 with the space put up for sublease.

A federal contractor based in Maryland ASRC or Arctic Slope Regional Corp. leased 31000 square feet of the Comcast space in August 2020. The company operates as a contractor to federal intelligence aerospace and health-care information-technology agencies.

Comcast closed its Fort Collins call center in late 2019. Ken Amundson/BizWest

Micro Focus a spinoff of Hewlett Packard Enterprise occupies about 16000 square feet in the building.

Peter Kast a broker with CBRE who is listing space in the building for sublease said the campus and other corners of East Harmony and Ziegler roads benefit from infrastructure put in place to serve HP.

“If you look at it from an infrastructure point of view it’s one of the few places in town that has redundant fiber and redundant fiber so people like this that have needs for those kinds of things there’s not that many choices so in terms of an infrastructure location it’s great” he said.

He noted that HPE HP Broadcom Intel AMD and other high-tech companies in the area capitalize on a concentration of skilled workers.

“The thing that’s so attractive about Fort Collins for these guys is the intellectual capital the people who do this kind of work who are trained to handle whether it’s software or hardware design” he said. “We’ve got a ton of people who do chip design in this town.”

The biggest player in that space locally is Broadcom which has continued to invest in its Fort Collins operation. Although the city of Fort Collins estimates that Broadcom employs 1150 workers locally the company told BizWest in 2019 that it employed 1747 including 1313 employees and 434 contingent workers.

Broadcom owns a large swathe of the former HP campus with its predecessor Avago completing several major expansions.

The company in its most-recent quarterly report filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission cited ongoing supply-chain disruptions brought on by the COVID-19 pandemic and highlighted the importance of the Fort Collins operation.

“We have been and expect to continue experiencing some disruption to parts of our global semiconductor supply chain including procuring necessary components and inputs such as wafers and substrates in a timely fashion with suppliers increasing lead times or placing products on allocation and raising prices” the company reported noting shutdowns at key suppliers and service providers around the world.

“Any similar disruption at our Fort Collins Colorado manufacturing facility would severely impact our ability to manufacture our film bulk acoustic resonator (“FBAR”) products and adversely affect our wireless business” the company said.

Despite those challenges Broadcom HP and related companies remain key components of the Fort Collins economy.

SeonAh Kendall senior economic manager for the city of Fort Collins said Hewlett Packard Broadcom and other companies in the East Harmony Road corridor are “going strong.”

“We are seeing that they’re kind of staying in the area and growing with spinoffs in there as well” she said. “I do think that it is a critical piece for us in terms of the employment as well as the contributions that the companies as well as employees have in our community.

“There are opportunities for additional growth in those locations” she added “and opportunities for a lot of collaboration. I think one of the greatest strengths is that we’re able to retain the talent here. Sometimes we have seen folks leave AMD and go to Intel or leave Intel and go to HP and vice versa.”

She noted that companies in the area work closely with Colorado State University Front Range Community College and the Poudre School District on issues such as talent and retention.

Greeley facility sees different fate

Greeley’s Hewlett-Packard facility was the last to be built the first to close and the only one to be torn down — at least most of it.

The facility opened in 1984 focused on scanners tape drives and other devices but HP closed the operation in 2003 shifting what was then 800 workers to other locations. About 640 workers were transferred to Fort Collins with another 165 shifting to Flextronics International Ltd. Flextronics purchased DII Group Inc. which was buying HP’s tape-storage manufacturing business.

HP put the property on the market and seemed to attract widespread interest at first including for a potential expansion of Aims Community College. But that and other deals fell through prompting HP to sell the building to a group of local investors. HP sold the 355000-square-foot property on 157 acres in August 2004 to Boomerang Properties LLC headed by local investors Bruce Deifik and Jeff Bedingfield a Greeley attorney. The purchase price was $8 million far lower than HP’s $14 million asking price.

“Up to this point HP has not been willing to divide the property or divide the facility” Bedingfield told the Northern Colorado Business Report a predecessor to BizWest in August 2004. “Their desire is to sell everything and let the buyer determine how best to use it.”

Boomerang intended to subdivide the HP building to support perhaps four smaller tenants.

“There’s been a lot of talk that you can’t get big blocks leased that the best thing is to bulldoze the facility” Bedingfield said in 2004. “It’s too fine of a facility to begin talking about any kind of changes to that place other than demising it into large blocks.”

But the new owners also envisioned that surrounding acreage would be transformed into residential neighborhoods retail centers and office uses.

The project soon was taken over by City Center West LP a Denver development company affiliated with Westside Investment Partners Inc. which acquired the building and adjacent acreage for $8.36 million in 2007. Some holdings were owned and developed under the umbrella of BV Retail Land Holdings LLP.

City Center West began selling acreage for retail residential and other uses:

In 2011 the company sold 12 acres to a North Colorado Medical Center/Banner Health entity for $2.34 million. Banner continues to own the vacant land.

In 2014 City Center West launched a commercial development on the northeast corner of 71st Avenue and West 10th Street eventually adding a Bank of Colorado branch McDonald’s Breeze Thru Car Wash and a Les Schwab tire center.

Developers of a self-storage facility purchased land along 71st Avenue. That property now houses Boomerang Self Storage.

A chunk of the HP building — the cafeteria and events center — was redeveloped into the West Ridge Academy at 6905 Eighth St.

City Center West continues to own residential land on the former HP campus but sold the remaining vacant building and some acreage to LaSalle Investors LLC a unit of Waltel Cos. Inc. LaSalle demolished the remaining HP building preparing the site for future development.

But the company faces opposition to plans to rezone the property from Industrial – Low Intensity to Residential – High Density. About 10 neighboring residents voiced opposition to the rezoning request at a June 7 Greeley City Council meeting.

Residents voiced fears that LaSalle planned to build a large apartment complex on the property which they said could exacerbate existing traffic problems.

Several City Council members also voiced opposition to the R-H zoning preferring a less-intensive Residential – Medium Density zoning.

“It’s just too intense right now” Councilman Dale Hall said. “I’m uncomfortable making this R-H. I’m OK with Residential Medium Intensity.”

In the end LaSalle’s attorney asked that the council continue the discussion to the July 19 City Council meeting.

Greeley’s westward expansion

Why Greeley’s HP facility faced such a different outcome than campuses in Fort Collins and Loveland can be attributed to a variety of factors.

First the technology sector in Greeley has never developed to the scale of Fort Collins’ or Loveland which enjoy closer proximity to Colorado State University. Even before HP’s closure Greeley had seen the departure of home-grown printed-circuit-board manufacturer EFTC Corp. founded in Greeley as Electronic Fab Technology Corp. which left for the north Denver suburbs.

But the greatest factor seems to be the pattern of Greeley’s residential and commercial growth which has pushed inexorably westward for several decades.

Benjamin Snow director of economic health and housing for the city of Greeley said the area around “the core of the apple” meaning the HP building has transformed.

HP’s Greeley facility was once on the city’s outskirts with little nearby retail and far less residential development.

“When you look at what’s happened over the last 10 years out there it has sort of defaulted to what I would describe as typical suburban growth” Snow said pointing to the King Soopers and other retail development across 10th Street as well as retail and residential projects on former HP land surrounding the building.

He noted that for years he and his predecessors in the economic-development community sought to preserve the industrial zoning for the building as a way to balance the city’s housing stock with a solid employment center.

“It just never took” he said. “We never could get a secondary use in there … At some point you have to listen to the market signals.”

Although many potential users toured the facility one obstacle he said was that the building had fallen into disrepair.

“Once people went in because that building essentially had been neglected and abandoned for so long … it was kind of a magnet for that kind of vandalism. There was evidence that people were inside the building at different times.”

“Greeley has tried for 20 years to get some industrial users to reinhabit to reanimate that building to no avail” he said.

A solar array added to the company’s facility at 11811 E. 51st St. became operational last week. The 400 kilowatts of power will produce roughly 20% of the annual electricity needs for that 110000-square-foot building said David Rossi senior manager for the Atlanta-based Cox Enterprises’ engineering and sustainability team.

“Through clean renewable power coming from the sun it allows us reduce our carbon impact for this one facility by over 580 tons of carbon per year” Rossi said by phone.

Cox which employs about 500 people in Tulsa has sunk more than $130 million nationally in conservation and sustainability efforts since the start of Cox Conserves the company’s national sustainability program in 2007 he said. The company has done 53 solar projects nationwide in the past 15 years said Gene Coleman who manages operation and maintenance for the company’s renewable assets.

The Tulsa installation encompasses 900 roughly 20-square-foot panels Rossi said. The system also has five inverters devices that convert direct current electricity which a solar panel generates to alternating current which the electric grid uses.

“If there happens to be a time say on a weekend or a holiday when our facility is mostly vacant there could be some times when we push power back to the grid and share that renewable energy with the community” Rossi said. “But more than likely it’s all behind the meter which is true distributed generation with the intent that this power comes to our facility directly.”

Oklahoma ranks 45th nationally in solar energy with 0.18% of the state’s energy coming from the sun according to the Solar Energy Industries Association.

The U.S. Energy Information Administration said earlier this year that solar power is on track to account for nearly half of the country’s new electric generation.

In 2022 it expects 46.1 gigawatts of new utility-scale electric generating capacity to be added to the U.S. power grid. Almost half of the planned 2022 capacity additions are solar followed by natural gas at 21% and wind at 17%.

Since the mid-2000s the the federal government has incentivized homeowners and businesses to switch to solar through an investment tax credit also known as the federal solar tax credit. Currently it allows consumers to claim 26% of the total cost of their solar system installation on their federal taxes.

“Really just three years ago was when the door kind of opened up” Rossi said. “The price of solar has come down enough where we can start to work in areas where just a few years ago wouldn’t have penciled out for a project.”

Those areas of concentration have moved from the coasts to the middle of the country.

“California is a no-brainer for us financially” he said. “Their cost of power is extremely high and I can really make a pencil project there. But their grid is so green I don’t get a whole lot of carbon reduction from the same size project in California as I do in Oklahoma.

“While not as cost-effective in Oklahoma the carbon reduction we get from this project is quite extensive compared to the same-size project we can get elsewhere in the country.”

On July 12 commissioners voted unanimously to recommend the City Council proceed with Cambrian Village a development that will redesign a 1950s-era shopping center at Camden and Union avenues in San Jose. The parcel is being reimagined as an 18-acre urban village combining residential and commercial uses with open space. Commissioner Michael Young was absent.

Commissioner Justin Lardinois said he sees the project as a valuable addition to the area that will create a gathering place for people. He said the Cambrian Park Plaza shopping center was built in a different time and has outgrown its use.

“I see this as an exciting use and adaptation of that land” he said.

The urban village design includes 305 apartments 48 single-family homes with 27 attached accessory dwelling units and 25 townhomes. The village will also offer a 229-room hotel 50 apartments in the senior living center and four acres of open space.

Developer Kimco Realty has pledged to increase affordable housing in Cambrian Village from 5 percent to 10 percent following efforts by Councilmember Pam Foley and Catalyze SV which advocates for sustainable equitable and vibrant places. Affordable housing now includes 30 rental apartments rather than 15 plus the accessory dwelling units.

Affordability gets a serious look

Sean Morley founder of the Morley Bros. real estate firm which is coordinating the land use entitlements said the development team took Foley’s challenge to increase affordable housing seriously. Almost 25 percent of the site is open space and includes underground parking making each unit more expensive to construct than other projects he said.

“Cambrian Village has met most community goals for the project but it cannot achieve all of them and remain economically feasible” Morley said.

Lalo Mendez project development specialist with Catalyze SV said its members are happy about the increased number of affordable homes.

“We applaud the affordability but 100 percent (area median income) is too high” he said. The area median income is approximately $105000. “Lower the affordability to 60 percent to make it affordable for the people who will be working there.”

The housing market is hot in Silicon Valley with the average mortgage in San Jose at approximately $9136 a month with homeowners insurance and taxes — a 51 percent increase from June 2021 and a jump from $8664 two months ago. In May homes were valued slightly above $1.7 million up 22.4 percent from last year with interest rates that have nearly doubled since January. The situation is no better for local renters as the region is one of the most expensive rental markets in the country.

Will Smith a member of Silicon Valley Residents for Responsible Development questioned the project’s environmental impacts and said it would significantly affect air quality and public health.

“Greenhouse gas emissions noise and transportation were not adequately disclosed or mitigated” he said. “The city failed to analyze the significance of energy impacts and water supply impacts.”

Next steps

The Cambrian Village project still requires City Council approval and the parcel — which sits in an unincorporated portion of Santa Clara County — will need to be annexed into San Jose. Foley said councilmembers will consider approving the environmental impact report and initiating annexation on Aug. 9. A vote on annexing the parcel could take place as early as Sept. 13.

Commissioner Sylvia Ornealas-Wise said it’s about time the city annexes the parcel and redevelops it.

“Approving projects this size also allows us the ability to create a lot of jobs and improve the quality of life for the city of San Jose and its residents” she said.

Foley worked with the developer to re-envision its initial plan to create a walkable bikeable community.

“I wish they’d go to 15 percent (affordable housing)” she told San José Spotlight “but I know it doesn’t work for them financially.”

The city requires developers to provide 15 percent affordable housing in projects or pay in-lieu fees toward affordable homes built elsewhere. Since Kimco has not met the requirement at Cambrian Village it has to pay about $7.88 million into a fund for other affordable housing projects Foley said. She appreciates having affordable housing fully integrated into the project with market rate housing.

Alexander Melendrez peninsula and south bay organizing manager at YIMBY said housing is desperately needed and Cambrian Village will improve the underutilized strip mall and parking lot.

“This particular area could benefit from the variety of housing options that are solely needed in the Bay Area” he said.

Chloe 25 began using buy now pay layer services when she was only 17 years old. She was still living with her parents then and liked to spend the modest earnings from her job on new clothes or shoes for nights out with her friends and remembers getting “bombarded” with buy now pay later offers. Speaking to Express.co.uk she said: “I would only be spending £20 here £30 there and the buy now pay later option was at checkout. It seemed like a good idea to me really because I believed that I had the income to pay it off at the time.” Chloe then moved out of her parent's house and took on other financial commitments such as rent bills and food.

She said: “Things genuinely changed really quickly and suddenly and I found myself with bills of hundreds of pounds at the end of each month. I’m not now how it managed to get so high."" Chloe then became pregnant with her daughter at the age of 22 and at this point she had managed to accumulate around £5000 worth of debt across multiple credit cards and other buy now pay later lending companies. She said: “I got a credit card to pay off my buy now pay later debts but it just meant that I built up more debt with the credit card companies. “I was so anxious and overwhelmed with it all. People kept chasing me for money that I just didn’t have I stopped picking up the phone and I started throwing the letters in the bin without reading them. “It made me feel so hopeless growing up I was taught that if you can’t afford it you either save for it or don’t have it. It just spiralled out of control so quickly.” During this period Chloe was too scared to go to her parents for help and began to get frightened by the legal jargon used by companies in their correspondence which mentioned County Court Judgments (CCJs) and repossession.

She said: “I just couldn’t take in what was happening to me I kept thinking people would come to my house and I just buried my head in the sand because I could not face the reality.” Thankfully Chloe stumbled across the debt management charity StepChange and after reaching out they helped her negotiate a payment plan with her creditors. She explained: “StepChange acted as the middleman for me I told them what I could afford to pay back and they arranged it all for me which meant I stopped getting letters and calls and if anything changed I could talk to Stepchange and get it sorted. “They have been a godsend they really helped me get the ball rolling and since they stepped in to help I’ve managed to pay off around £2000.” Chloe said that her debts spiralled through credit card usage but had begun with using buy now pay later. She believes that the concept of buy now pay later is being sold in a “light-hearted way” so people cannot see hows serious it is and that it is “too easy” to sign up. However she does understand the benefits of this type of payment if people understand how it works. Chloe said: “If you need to do a food shop for your family and you don’t have the money then you will choose the option to pay later you are not thinking about the later because you are desperate now.

There are multiple buy now pay later companies on the market currently and some services currently offer a “soft credit check” if a person decides to pay in four pay in 30 days or chooses monthly financing so paying over the course of six to 36 months. A soft credit check is recorded on a credit file but won’t impact a person’s credit score and no other lenders would be able to see it. Chloe believes that further checks should be made for this option of payment the same way credit checks are put in place for those who want to take out a loan. For loans credit cards and mortgages “hard credit checks” are made. This is where the lender will do an in-depth check of a person’s credit report.

Phil Andrew chief executive at StepChange said: ""Buy now pay later is deliberately marketed and presented as a means of payment rather than as a form of credit which is what it really is. It is also marketed not just lifestyle spending but for essentials such as groceries or school uniforms.” StepChange believes that there is currently “very little friction” to prevent customers from building up “significant debt” with this payment practice and argues that it is “vital” that regulation is brought forward to protect consumers. Stronger regulation into buy now pay later is currently being discussed by the HM Treasury.

After 21 years as Heinz Field the Steelers' home stadium has been re-named to Acrisure Stadium after the two sides came to terms on a 15-year agreement.

Bill Cowher a Pittsburgh native whose 15 years as the Steelers coach earned him a spot in the Pro Football Hall of Fame is certainly aware that the stadium re-name has ruffled some feathers among the team's loyal fanbase. But Cowher who was the Steelers' coach when the team moved from Three Rivers Stadium to Heinz Field feels that the re-name will be a good thing for all involved unless you're a Steelers opponent.

""I think it's actually very flattering that a company comes from the outside to want to be a part of Pittsburgh"" Cowher said during a KDKA interview. ""And to me it's not so much about the the name of the venue it's the venue itself. Pittsburgh will always be a very tough place to play if you're a visiting team coming in here because of the people the passion the vibrancy that you feel when you enter into that stadium. So you can call it whatever you want it's what you're going to feel when you enter that stadium and you're an opponent and what you're going to feel like when you walk out of there losing.

""I know that people of Pittsburgh and I've been a Pittsburgher are very very resistant to change at times. But this is more about the economics of the game and trying to keep things competitive. At the same time it ain't going to change the atmosphere that's in that stadium. Whether it's Heinz Field whether it's the Three Rivers Stadium whether it's Acrisure Stadium whatever it may be it's the people in there that make it a special venue.""

Cowher's right. At some point fans will get over the re-name and will return in droves to watch the Steelers play on Sundays. Cowher was also spot on when assessing how the re-name may help from a financial standpoint. While the terms of the Steelers' deal with Acrisure is not currently known the Kraft Heinz Company said in a statement that the team's new partner was ""willing to pay significantly more than we could justify.""

The Steelers made plenty of memories at Heinz Field winning two Super Bowls three AFC titles and a slew of division titles. They'll look to have similar success at Acrisure Stadium which will usher in a new era this season following Ben Roethlisberger's retirement in January.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiK2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRyZW5kaHVudGVyLmNvbS90cmVuZHMvaGVpbnotNTfSAS9odHRwczovL3d3dy50cmVuZGh1bnRlci5jb20vYW1wL3RyZW5kcy9oZWluei01Nw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Chef-Inspired Condiment Collections,"Heinz 57 Taps into the Increase of Chef-Inspired Cooking

Shortage of Dijon mustard sparks a very French food crisis,"Raifalsa makes mustards and mayonnaise. Maurice Rougemont/Getty Images

A shortage of Dijon mustard has left French people desperately searching for a substitute.

Mustard is mainly used to accompany red meats or to make vinaigrettes for salads.

Despite its substitutes Dijon mustard is ""irreplaceable"" and ""indispensable"" to French cuisine.

Dijon mustard is a must-have condiment for most French families – whether it be to accompany red meat or to make a vinaigrette – but an ongoing shortage of the condiment has left French people up in arms.

""We managed to find one pot in an independent grocery store that received only six pots last week"" Nathalie Prevos told Insider.

Despite its name Dijon mustard is produced using seeds from other countries such as Canada. About 80% of the brown seeds used to make the Dijon mustard come from there Luc Vandermaesen director of Reine de Dijon mustard manufacturer and president of the Burgundy Mustard Association told The New York Times.

""The main issue is climate change and the result is this shortage. We can't respond to the orders we get and retail prices are up as much as 25% reflecting the soaring cost of seeds"" he said.

Prevos 50 said: ""My husband uses it often to add to pie or to use alongside crème fraiche and we always use it in vinaigrettes. We have yet to find a substitute.""

France is the world's largest consumer of mustard getting through about 2.2 pounds a year per person according to The Times report. Other countries might be hit by a mustard shortage but France's crisis is unique as it relies so heavily on Canadian seeds.

Paul-Olivier Claudepierre the co-owner of Martin-Pouret which sells French mustards and vinegars told Le Monde it was time to ""relocalize production.""

""We cultivate thousands of kilometers away a seed that we are going to harvest bring to a port transport across the ocean in containers in order to transform it at home"" he said. ""That costs a lot and what a great carbon toll.""

A substitute?

What distinguishes the mustard from other condiment is its kick or as French describe it ""ça me monte au nez"" or ""it's rising into my nose.""

One substitute is raifort a French sauce made of horseradish according to Actu.fr. It belongs to the family of the brassicaceae. It is a root vegetable used as a spice and as a condiment.

Agathe Hochard 24 told Insider that older generations may want Dijon mustard with their steaks but people her age did not: the younger generation would not think twice about it.

""I can't remember a time when I chose Dijon mustard over anything else. I would rather go for a sauce blanche burger or even barbecue.""







However Hochard's mother said Dijon mustard is ""irreplaceable"" and ""indispensable"" to French cuisine.

In most supermarkets in France mustard shelves have been emptied for at least a couple of months with some supermarkets apologizing for the lack of stock. Signs in Intermarché blame ""a drought in Canada"" and Ukraine's ""conflict with Russia"" for the shortages.

US consumers do not appear to be affected however. Neither Kraft Heinz which owns Grey Poupon and McCormick which makes French's mustard nor foresee empty shelves in American stores USA Today reported.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWWh0dHBzOi8vc3RlZWxlcnNkZXBvdC5jb20vMjAyMi8wNy9zdGVlbGVycy1mYW5zLXBldGl0aW9uLXRvLWNoYW5nZS1hY3Jpc3VyZS1zdGFkaXVtLW5hbWUv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Steelers' Fans Petition To Change Acrisure Stadium Name,"If you want to understand how seriously Steelers’ fans hate the new Acrisure Stadium name there’s a literal petition to change its name. A Change.org petition with the goal of removing the Acrisure name has more than 5400 signatures and counting.

Daniel Sass the campaign’s creator wrote the following regarding the petition against the name change:

“Heinz Field is the only sponsored stadium that the team has ever played in. Previously playing at Three Rivers Stadium Pitt Stadium and before that Forbes Field.

But now the Heinz Field sponsorship is no more. It’s new name was just announced and it is HORRIBLE!!!!

“Acrisure Field”

ANYTHING would have been better than that.

An out-of-state sponsor comes in and inflicts this name change on us that isn’t even easy to pronounce.

PLEASE CHANGE THE NAME (“Three Rivers Stadium” would work)”

The Steelers’ name change was a major surprise. While Heinz Field’s naming rights deal was expiring Team President Art Rooney II consistently expressed optimism over being able to work out a new deal with the Kraft Heinz Company. But Acrisure offered the most money reportedly $150 million over 15 years a number Heinz admitted they could not compete with. Acrisure a brokerage firm is owned by Greg Williams who has close ties to Steelers’ minority owner Thomas Tull.

As the campaign points out the Steelers playing in a differently named venue is a rarity. It’s just the fifth different name they’ve called home over their lifetime dating all the way back to 1933 when they played at Forbes Field. They then moved to Pitt Stadium until Three Rivers was built in 1970. Heinz Field became home in 2001. Acrisure is just the second sponsored name in team history. Three Rivers was named after the three rivers that converge in Pittsburgh: the Allegheny Monongahela that pour into the Ohio River. Pitt Stadium was named for the Pitt Panthers while Forbes Field was named after General John Forbes who captured Fort Duquesne in 1758 and set the building blocks for the city of Pittsburgh.

Some have suggested adding a field name in front of the stadium tag. Even Rocky Bleier suggested “Rooney Field sponsored by Acrisure Stadium.”

Steelers legend Rocky Bleier has his own solution to the stadium name issue #Steelers #NFL pic.twitter.com/uVdo1jCouN — Steelers Depot 7⃣ (@Steelersdepot) July 15 2022

But as he admits doing so means no one would ever call it “Acrisure Stadium.” Meaning the company just spent $150 million to be ignored. Not something that would fly with their business model.

The Change.org petition has a goal of 7500 signatures and seems on track to hit that mark later this week. Comments from those who’ve signed echo the distaste of an out-of-state company buying the rights while one pointed to the tradition of keeping it named Heinz.

Of course the petition could reach 75000 signatures and it wouldn’t change a thing. Unless Art Rooney’s name is included the Steelers’ home will remain sponsored by Acrisure. Fans may not like the name and it certainly doesn’t roll off the tongue the way it does Heinz Field but money talks and Acrisure backed up the money truck to close the deal. And so it’ll remain the Steelers’ stadium name through at least 2036 when it obviously could be renewed. Of course by then the Steelers may be thinking about building a new stadium too considering by that point it would be 35 years old.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMijAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5nbG9iZW5ld3N3aXJlLmNvbS9uZXdzLXJlbGVhc2UvMjAyMi8wNy8xOC8yNDgwNzUwLzAvZW4vUHJlcGFyZWQtTWVhbHMtTWFya2V0LVRyZW5kcy1Hcm93dGgtU2hhcmUtU2l6ZS1hbmQtT3V0bG9vay1UaWxsLTIwMjkuaHRtbNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Prepared Meals Market Trends Growth Share Size and Outlook Till 2029,"Pune India July 17 2022 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- The global prepared meals market is expected to gain momentum due to working population’s upsurge during the forecast period.

The investment thesis is rather simple: in a tough time people cut back on pricey nights out and instead stay home and cook.

All of that in-home party food comes from you guessed it grocery retailers such as Walmart (WMT) Kroger (KR) and Costco (COST).

And with all that buying grocers see outsized positive effects on their sales and earnings.

""Food retail stocks (including grocers mass discounters warehouse clubs and dollar stores) have mostly outperformed the S&P 500 during prior recessions (including the 1980s the first Gulf War the Dotcom Bubble and the Global Financial Crisis)"" said Bank of America analyst Robbie Ohmes in a new note to clients.

""We believe that this reflects that recessions tend to drive (1) increased food-at-home spending (the post-Dot.com Bubble recession drove a pause in the decades-long shift toward food-away-from-home while the Global Financial crisis resulted in food-at-home regaining share; and (2) greater consumer price sensitivity that favors consumer trade-down into the discount/value retail channels.""

Ohmes' work shows shares of Walmart have out-performed the S&P 500 in each of the past five recessions.

Costco Kroger Target (TGT) Dollar General (DG) and Dollar Tree (DLTR) have also seen relative outperformance to the S&P 500 in prior recessions.

The market has also gravitated to Kroger shares during recessions. (Bank of America)

""All of the food retailers including Walmart are seeing strong grocery business in this environment"" Ohmes added on Yahoo Finance Live after publishing his note.

While food retail stocks may be a decent place for some investors to hide out amid an ongoing slowdown in consumer spending discretionary retailers are on the other side of the coin.

In early June Target kicked off concerns on the retail sector's health with a shocking decision to liquidate massive amounts of slow-moving inventory and take a more cautious view on near-term profits.

Since then discretionary retailers such as RH (RH) Bed Bath & Beyond (BBBY) and Kohl's (KSS) issued financial warnings for the second quarter. Nike (NKE) took a more measured approach to its full-year financial outlook when it reported quarterly earnings.

Gap (GPS) also fired its CEO this week after another lackluster quarter.

(WTVF) — Around his room you'll find wrestling belts action figures and DVDs. There's no question that Demetrius Trotter is a wrestling superfan.

So when his mother Karen Trotter learned the WWE was coming to town she jumped at the opportunity to buy her son tickets to a match.

She said she Googled Ticketmaster and called a number she thought was for the company.

""I said 'he's totally wheelchair/bed-confined'"" she said. ""'So he has his own wheelchair' I said 'so I just need an area for him to sit in where somebody can sit with him.'""

""He said 'well I tell you what you'll do — is there a Ticketmaster close to you?' I said 'the closest place to me is Krogers'"" said Trotter. ""I said 'it will take me ten minutes to get to Krogers' and he said 'well stay on the phone with me.'""

She thought she was paying $25 for each ticket to the show; it would have been a bargain.

""So I go in and I had him on the phone. So I ask the people in Krogers did they have a Ticketmaster and they said no"" said Trotter.

She said that's when the man on the phone directed her to buy $250 worth of eBay gift cards instead. The money would be transferred to buy the tickets.

She read him the card numbers.

""He said 'well they're not any good.' I said 'you're telling me I just purchased a card —' and he said 'well you need to go to Walgreens.' He said 'how far is Walgreens from you?'""

That's when she realized the operator was a fake.

""The individual they use psychology"" said Lorneth Peters Director of Marketing and Communications for BBB serving Middle TN and Southern KY. ""They learn more about you while they're having that conversation and they know exactly what buttons to push to cause you to move forward with their request.""

Peters said gift card scams have been on the rise in the past year.

""That is one of the easiest scams"" said Peters. ""Why? Because you can't track it. When the money is gone it's gone.""

Trotter said now the hardest part is knowing her son's dream was robbed.

""So now he keeps asking me 'mom where's the tickets at for the wrestling?' and I don't know what to tell him because he's thinking that he's going to the wrestling and then he's not going to the wrestling because we've been scammed out of his money for him to go to the wrestling.""

She hopes others may learn from her experience.

According to Ticketmaster's website the company will never request that you wire funds and it will never ask you to buy a third-party gift card.

Normally sales for the Sunday show are a little slower. This year that is not the case said Kevin Franklin executive director of the air show (and president of Wright Brothers Aero Inc.)

What essentially remains at this point are general admission tickets both men said in an interview last week.

“I think we’re just about sold out of all of our seating” said Franklin who this spring succeeded longtime Dayton Air Show executive director Terry Grevious.

“It’s been a full court press for the last six months” Buchanan said.

Attendance in a “good year” amounts to about 60000 to 65000 over a weekend. Jacquelyn Powell a show board member as well as president and chief executive of the local Convention and Visitors Bureau has told the Dayton Daily News that the economic impact attached to the annual show goes beyond the $2.32 million in direct spending.

Last year an estimated 40000 people attended the show. That’s down compared to historical averages.

But 2021 was unique — that early July weekend saw light but steady drizzle. And Buchanan and Franklin note that in the space of about a month last spring the show went from an initially announced drive-in format to a more traditional set-up which may have been confusing for would be show-goers.

“We were glad just to get a show in last year” Buchanan said.

This year he expects a greater number of static or ground displays. He points to the expected appearance of the de Havilland Vampire making its Dayton debut and Kent Pietsch whom Buchanan called one of the best “stickflyers” in the country.

Other highlights include familiar favorites such as Tora Tora Tora! the C-130 “Fat Albert” the Air Force F-16 Viper Demo Team an Air Force F-15C Eagle the Army Golden Knights Parachute team and much more.

Of course the U.S. Navy Blue Angels and their six F/A-18 Hornets are headlining this year. The Air Force Thunderbirds and Navy Blue Angels alternate as the show’s top attraction each summer.

The show remains relevant symbolically and practically said Tim Gaffney who was involved with the show as a trustee and an aviation reporter for 35 years.

Flight exhibitions in Dayton stretch back to the early 1900s when the Wright Brothers refined powered piloted flight to the delight of spectators on Huffman Prairie. Well into the 21st century the show continues to reflect the heritage and the character of the community Gaffney said.

It gives thousands of people who work at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base and area defense contractors a chance to see their handiwork he said. Missions anchored at Wright-Patterson see to the development and sustainment of Air Force planes and weapons from cradle to grave.

“That’s what these folks make” Gaffney said. “It’s literally their work that we see on display.”

Gaffney remembered when the F-117 stealth fighter first visited the show as a static display in the early 1990s. The base brought a busload of workers to the show see the Lockheed plane in person.

“I remember one guy saying ‘Yeah I’ve been working on this for years and this is the first time I’ve ever seen it’” Gaffney recalled.

Tickets for the 2022 show are on sale at www.daytonairshow.com."

For nearly a year his government had been at war with rebels from the Tigray People’s Liberation Front which was now pushing south from its stronghold near the Eritrean border and threatening to move on the country’s capital of Addis Ababa.

Thousands had already been killed and the United States and the United Nations had accused all the warring parties of blockading aid committing sexual assault and deliberately targeting civilians.

With only a small aging fleet of Soviet-era military jets Abiy needed a way to quickly – and cheaply – expand his air campaign against the rebels. Turkey had just the solution: a military drone known as the TB2 that could be piloted from nearly 200 miles away.

China and Iran also supplied drones but the TB2 outfitted with cutting-edge technology had fast become the new favorite of the world’s embattled nations helping to win wars even when it was pitted against major powers.

On August 18 Abiy met Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan to sign a military pact. It is unclear whether drones were part of the agreement. But two days after the signing publicly available flight records showed that an Ethiopian Airlines charter flight took off from Tekirdağ an hour’s drive west of Istanbul at an airstrip known for testing and exporting the Turkish drones. It was the first of at least three such runs over roughly a month the records show.

Neither the Turkish nor the Ethiopian governments responded to questions about the flights but officials in Turkey have previously acknowledged drone sales to Ethiopia.

Within months Turkish-made drones as well as ones made by China and Iran hovered over crowded town centers across rebel-held Ethiopia watching those below before launching missiles at them. News seeped out of towns like Alamata and Mlazat that the drones’ missiles were killing not just suspected rebels but dozens of people many of them civilians as they rode buses or shopped in markets.

Human rights groups took note of armed drones in the skies and examined images of missile fragments from airstrikes to try to identify exactly what aircraft were involved hoping that publicly naming their origin would prompt the sellers to reconsider their actions.

As the death toll mounted the Biden administration which had authorised sanctions against any party involved in the fighting said it had “profound humanitarian concerns” over Turkey’s drone sales to Ethiopia. And US officials meeting with their Turkish counterparts raised reports of drone use in the conflict. But there the warnings stopped. Unlike its decisive actions targeting drone programs in China and Iran Washington took no further action against the program in Turkey a NATO ally.

So the Ethiopian air campaign continued including a strike by a Turkish-made drone on a camp for displaced civilians in Dedebit that killed 59 people and attracted widespread condemnation. The bloodshed again drew a rebuke from the US this time directed at Ethiopia.

President Joe Biden called Abiy and “expressed concern that the ongoing hostilities including recent air strikes continue to cause civilian casualties and suffering” according to a White House summary of the conversation. Little changed and by late February about six months after Abiy’s visit to Turkey at least 304 civilians were dead from airstrikes according to the United Nations.

The Ethiopian government did not respond to requests for comment but authorities have previously denied targeting civilians in the war.

Today much of the discussion around the TB2 drone centers on Ukraine where it is playing a pivotal role in the war against Russia. Ukraine has put out a steady stream of propaganda videos that show TB2s taking out equipment like surface-to-air missiles and helping other aircraft and artillery target Moscow’s forces.

Some lawmakers in Congress have even cast the drone as a crucial weapon and are pushing for the US to help Ukraine buy more. In Lithuania a recent crowdfunding campaign raised $5.4 million in three and a half days to help Ukraine purchase another TB2.

But the public relations blitz obscures growing concerns around the world about Turkey and the proliferation of a weapon that is changing the nature of modern warfare. At least 14 countries now own TB2s and another 16 are seeking to purchase them. The technology offers even the smallest militaries the capacity to inflict the kind of damage that was once the exclusive province of wealthy Western nations and Turkey seems eager to expand global sales of the weapon.

“They are a game changer” said Richard Speier a former Defense Department official who drafted and negotiated a key international agreement that now governs the sale of armed drones. “It’s going to be necessary to take account of them and put a lot of effort in dealing with the drone problem … [because] you can do things on a small budget that you couldn’t do before.”

Amid the criticism Turkish officials along with the drone maker itself Baykar Technology have defended the TB2 as a critical tool for developing nations and embattled democracies like Ukraine. The drone “is doing what it was supposed to do – taking out some of the most advanced anti-aircraft systems and advanced artillery systems and armored vehicles” Selçuk Bayraktar the firm’s chief technology officer told Reuters in May. “The whole world is a customer.”

Officials tout the drone as the product of Turkish industry with nearly all of its components coming from within Turkey. But time and again wreckage from downed drones in multiple conflicts have shown otherwise. In fact a whole range of components – from antennas to fuel pumps to missile batteries – were made by manufacturers in the US Canada and Europe according to images of wreckage examined by ProPublica and statements by companies some of whom have acknowledged sales to Turkey.

Some lawmakers have called on the Biden administration to pressure Turkey to restrict sales of the drone by suspending exports of US technology that could be used in the uncrewed aircraft. They argue that the drones and their missiles are sparking more instability around the world and in some cases violating American and international arms embargoes meant to contain wars like the conflict in Ethiopia.

“Turkey’s drone sales are dangerous destabilising and a threat to peace and human rights” said Senator Robert Menendez last year as he pushed for an investigation into whether US exports are being used in the Turkish drones. “The US should have no part of it.” Menendez’s office did not respond to a request for comment for this story.

It is unclear though whether the Biden administration will take any further action. A spokesperson for the State Department declined to answer questions for this story providing only a general statement about arms sales. “We encourage all countries to abide by UN arms embargoes avoid arms transfers to persons who are sanctioned by the United States or the United Nations and avoid destabilizing arms transfers” it read.

The people of Lithuania have honorably raised funds to buy a Bayraktar TB2 for Ukraine.

To better understand how Western technology has made its way into Turkey’s armed drones ProPublica reviewed videos and photos of TB2s released by media outlets and government agencies as well as reports by the United Nations and anti-arms-proliferation advocates.

The news organisation then compiled a list of key parts and consulted with US arms experts to check whether their sale violated export regulations. They did not. Many of the components in the TB2s were commercial-grade parts found in a variety of consumer products such as HD video cameras or self-driving cars so they evaded the strict regulatory scrutiny applied to military parts in the US.

Still other countries including Canada have instituted export bans that have kept some key commercial parts from flowing to Turkey. And experts say the US if it chose to could take similar measures at home and step up enforcement abroad.

Cameron Hudson former Director for African Affairs on the National Security Council compared the impact of drones like TB2s to the Stinger missile the shoulder-fired weapons the US distributed to mujahedeen fighters in Afghanistan in the 1980s to repel Soviet forces then spent decades trying to recover.

“As the technology continues to improve as they become cheaper as they become more mobile and portable as you need less infrastructure to operate them they modernise conflict around the world” he said.

Ineffective pacts



The US demonstrated the lethal power of armed drones in the George W Bush and Barack Obama administrations when officials used them for targeted killings in places like Iraq and Afghanistan.

Since then international regulators have largely focused on policing sales of larger models like the Predator and Reaper drones used by the American military. Their primary enforcement tool: the Missile Technology Control Regime an agreement developed toward the end of the Cold War that today has 35 signatories including the US Russia and Turkey. The pact calls on members not to sell so-called Category 1 systems technology designed to carry missiles long distances and deliver nuclear chemical or biological payloads.

Thus far proliferation experts say the agreement has succeeded in stemming the flow of those kinds of weapons. But they added it has failed to capture the rising development of smaller drones like the TB2.

In the last decade China has developed its own drones and marketed them to developing countries while Iran has expanded its drone program to help fight its proxy wars in Syria and Yemen. Israel also runs a major export operation – including surveillance and so-called kamikaze drones – though experts say the country officially restricts the sale of drones capable of firing missiles.

Turkey supercharged its own efforts after the US declined to sell the country armed drones. US officials were concerned about potential human rights violations as Turkish officials planned to use the weapons in conflicts with Kurdish insurgents said Vann Van Diepen who helped oversee nonproliferation programs at the State Department until 2016.

The turning point came in 2015 when Bayraktar an MIT-educated engineer who ran an armed drone programme out of his father’s defence manufacturing firm in Istanbul debuted the TB2. Using a Turkish-made missile he held a demonstration to show that the drone could hit a target from miles away. Bayraktar who would later marry Erdoğan’s daughter touted the TB2s as a way for Turkey to become a global superpower without relying on US drones.

For Baykar and its customers the design had a key feature: the 40-foot-wide 20-foot-long drone can be controlled from ground stations up to 185 miles away just below the range that’s subject to Category 1 missile technology restrictions. The drone also has plenty of high-tech firepower. From an altitude of 18000 feet where it can hover for more than 24 hours the TB2 can find and track targets then hit them with laser-guided weapons usually a lightweight missile called an MAM-L made by the Turkish manufacturer Roketsan.

Western technology parts

Bayraktar portrayed the drones as a Turkish success story designed manufactured and armed by Turkish companies. But it wasn’t long before people searching through the wreckage of downed drones discovered that the TB2s relied on imported parts.

In 2020 for example amid a conflict between Azerbaijan and Armenia images published by local media outlets and the Armenian Ministry of Defense showed parts with identifying information that matched those sold by manufacturers in other countries including the US Hardware that allowed the drones to receive GPS signals from satellites was made by Trimble headquartered in Sunnyvale California.

The drone’s engine was made in Austria by Bombardier Recreational Products based out of Quebec Canada. A sophisticated programmable microchip was made by San Jose California-based Xilinx. The drone’s camera perhaps the most important TB2 component was made by Wescam a Canadian subsidiary of L3Harris based in Melbourne Florida.

In the wake of the revelations several companies including Trimble Bombardier and Xilinx issued statements saying they were surprised to learn their products were being used in the conflict and had taken steps to ensure their parts no longer ended up in Baykar’s drones.

But today key parts continue to be sourced from manufacturers based in Western countries. The German company Hensoldt for example told ProPublica it supplies one version of the drone’s camera. And video of TB2 strikes in Ukraine along with Canadian export records show the drones there still use the camera made by Wescam according to researchers at Project Ploughshares a Canadian anti-arms-trade nonprofit that tracks the proliferation of military technology.

L3Harris Wescam’s parent company did not answer questions for this story but said it “fully supports and adheres to all government export regulations applicable to our products and services used by the US its allies and partners.”

Baykar declined to respond to questions about the source of key components in its drones or how it had obtained them. The company would only say that ProPublica’s questions were based on unspecified “false accusations.” In March Bayraktar the company’s CTO said on social media that “93%” of the components in the TB2s are locally made.

Baykar is not unique in its use of commercial parts for its drones; many of Iran’s and China’s globally marketed drones also use parts that are not necessarily intended for military purposes. But those countries must find ways around a web of US sanctions and export restrictions so they cannot simply buy parts directly from US companies.

Importers in Turkey on the other hand are not subject to such restrictions. The country is a NATO ally and a party not only to the missile technology agreement but also to the Wassenaar Arrangement a broader set of voluntary guidelines set by 42 participating states seeking to control the spread of dual-use technologies that could be used for weapons that destabilise the world. Those qualifications put Turkey on a government list of countries preapproved to import many of the commercial parts found in the TB2s.

Under US rules those components “would not be controlled” said Kevin Wolf who helped oversee the export of dual-use technologies in the Commerce Department until 2017. “You have to rely upon the Turkish government for regulating its export to embargoed or other countries of concern.”

Thriving arms business



Turkey began using and perfecting the TB2s in its own war on Kurdish insurgents – the same conflict for which the US had refused to provide armed drones. From 2016 to 2019 authorities trumpeted their success in press releases about strikes that “rendered ineffective” more than 400 people in the Kurdish-majority southeast of the country where the Kurdistan Workers’ Party or PKK was most active. In strikes both inside Turkey and across the border in northern Syria and Iraq the TB2s delivered massive losses to the PKK effectively putting an end to its ability to launch attacks.

But by 2018 this posed problems for US forces which were relying on the same PKK-linked fighters in the battle against the Islamic State group in the region.

Although Turkey’s actions including its drone strikes did not ultimately keep the US and the Kurds from defeating the group they made the war and its aftermath far more complicated said General Michael Nagata who headed US Special Operations Command until 2015 then served as director of strategy for the National Counterterrorism Center until 2019.

With the proven success of its new tool it soon became clear Turkey did not intend to keep the TB2s all to itself.

In 2019 Turkey sent TB2 drones along with pilots to operate them to Libya to help the Tripoli-based Government of National Accord in a complicated civil war it was fighting against Khalifa Haftar a warlord backed by Russia Jordan and Turkey’s regional enemies Egypt and the United Arab Emirates. Haftar’s forces – which were themselves equipped with Chinese Wing Loong drones provided by the UAE – had mounted a major assault that threatened Tripoli but the TB2s helped push them back.

But by supplying drones and other weapons Turkey as well as Jordan and the UAE broke a UN arms embargo that was meant to keep the Libyan civil war from escalating the UN would later say in a scathing 548-page report.

The UN singled out the Chinese and Turkish drones –which carried out more than 1000 strikes in the battle over Tripoli – saying they transformed the situation from “a low-intensity low-technology conflict” into a bloody war that by the World Health Organization’s count killed more than a thousand people including about 100 civilians.

The Turkish Foreign Ministry did not respond to a request for comment for this story including on the UN’s finding that Turkey broke the arms embargo on Libya. Jordan and the UAE have said they are committed to complying with the UN arms embargo.

Other countries in business



Alarmed by the UN’s findings Congress called for the White House to put forth a comprehensive strategy for countering the destabilising influence of foreign powers in 2020. Senators at the time even wrote to the State Department asking it to “press the UAE Russia Turkey and Jordan to halt all transfers of military equipment and personnel to Libya”.

But the White House did not take action against Turkey or any of the other countries over Libya. And when Azerbaijan looked to retake the long-disputed territory of Nagorno-Karabakh from its neighbor Armenia in 2020 Turkey sold its allies the Azeris TB2 drones.

The TB2s allowed Azerbaijan to quickly control the skies and decisively win the war in just six weeks. Videos of the TB2 drone strikes became ubiquitous propaganda put out daily by the Azerbaijan defense ministry. Some clips played on giant screens set up in public squares in the capital Baku.

Nagata the former special forces commander said Libya and Nagorno-Karabakh should have been a wake-up call for the US military which was surprised when the TB2s “literally turned the tide of war there”.

Beyond the strategic implications though it should have also worried US policymakers because it showed how quickly the drones were proliferating Nagata said. “It is a harbinger of things to come that this is going to expand beyond Turkey” he said. “If Turkey can do this any country with some sort of industrial manufacturing base can do this.”

Indeed while the US has focused on keeping its most advanced systems under control Turkey China and Israel have made hefty profits selling their own drones which are less-sophisticated but often effective said Max Hoffman a former adviser to the UN and the House Armed Services Committee.

“The Israelis and the Chinese and now the Turks have really not caught up fully [to the US] but exploited that middle and down market that the US had let go” Hoffman said. “And obviously Turkey has not had many scruples in who they sell the drones to.”

Some of Turkey’s other NATO allies including Canada did take action curtailing defence exports in 2019 after a Turkish incursion into northern Syria threatened to disrupt the fight against the Islamic State group.

Companies in the dock



Publicly Turkish officials shrugged off the trade restrictions saying the country had enough of an industrial base that it could produce what it needed on its own. But in private Turkish officials as well as the drone maker Baykar pushed Canada to allow the sale of a key part: the MX-15 imaging and targeting system which was made by Wescam. The company had received public funding from Canada including a $75 million grant in 2015 to develop such a system. Upgraded versions of the MX-15 have been used over the years by the Predator and Reaper and by a number of other systems by NATO partners.

The Turkish Foreign Minister told his Canadian counterpart the MX-15 would only be used on drones intended for protecting civilians in Syria against Russian attacks and the Turkish defense ministry told Canada it would not export the cameras to any third party.

But six months later the TB2s showed up in Azerbaijan with Baku’s propaganda drone strike videos clearly indicating the MX-15s were being used there. Photos of crashed drones taken by Armenian forces and posted on social media showed that the cameras had been made in Canada as late as June 2020. This time the Justin Trudeau government undertook a larger review and in October 2020 it suspended all existing export permits that had allowed Wescam to ship the cameras to Turkey.

Canadian officials said Turkey appeared to have broken the UN arms embargo on Libya and illegally exported the TB2s with the Canadian MX-15 camera system to Azerbaijan in violation of its pledges. L3Harris Wescam’s parent company did not respond to questions about the Canadian actions. At the time Wescam declined to comment on the Armenian photographs but it confirmed for Canadian officials that it had sold MX-15s to Turkey under a preexisting permit.

Less than two weeks later though in an apparent bid to keep the parts flowing Erdoğan called Trudeau and surprised him by putting Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy on the phone. Canadian documents released as part of an inquiry by lawmakers show the call’s agenda included the export permits. At the time Ukraine was seeking to add more TB2 drones to its military arsenal.

In 2020 lawmakers in Germany were also pressing to limit the Turkish drone program said Andrej Hunko a member of the Bundestag from the Left Party.

Hunko who had been outspoken over the years about the US drone program joined lawmakers from the Green Party in asking the government to explain weapons sales to Turkey that they believed were connected to the TB2 drones.

The government confirmed that German defense manufacturer TDW had exported missiles and parts to Turkey while another German firm Numerics had sold software. Hunko said he and his colleagues concluded that those sales had helped influence the design of the Turkish MAM-L missiles used by the TB2s.

TDW did not answer questions for this story but referred to a statement it made in 2020 which said it had not sold parts to Turkey since 2019. The statement also said TDW has never had “a relationship for a delivery or supply for the Bayraktar TB2 drone or its armament”. Numerics did not respond to a request for comment.

But Hunko soon found a more direct link after Baykar posted photos of its drone from a military parade in Turkmenistan. The images appeared to show ARGOS II cameras from German manufacturer Hensoldt which later confirmed it had sold the equipment to Turkey for drones undercutting Baykar’s claims that it used only local parts. Hensoldt told ProPublica it continues to supply the ARGOS II for Baykar’s TB2 drones. The camera it said “is developed by Hensoldt’s South African subsidiary and contains no parts that would fall under German export control law”.

Anti-arms activists in the United Kingdom had previously made a similar discovery when they analyzed wreckage of downed drones in 2020. The TB2s had used a missile rack that came from UK firm EDO MBM Technology another subsidiary of Florida-based L3Harris despite Baykar’s claims of local sourcing.

Hunko and other opposition lawmakers in Germany ultimately called for halting exports of key drone parts but the government did not take any such action. Hunko said his concerns continue prompted not only by Turkey’s own use of drones in the region but also by what they mean for warfare in general. “It’s not like if you send [manned] military planes” he said. “It’s lowering the threshold for entering into a war.”

Legal limitations



The issue hit Washington’s political radar in November 2020 after a report from the Armenian National Committee of America or ANCA a pro-Armenia lobbying group that has pushed for tougher action against Turkey. The report contained evidence that TB2 parts found in wreckage of drones shot down by Armenian forces in the Nagorno-Karabakh war had come from US-based firms.

ANCA and other groups critical of Turkey mobilised supporters to write to parts manufacturers winning pledges from many that they would stop selling to Baykar Technology. Six US-based manufacturers whose parts showed up in the TB2 drones responded to ProPublica confirming that they had taken steps to stop direct sales to Turkey of parts that could be used by Baykar for the drones. But experts said it was probably difficult to stop Turkey from acquiring the parts through distributors and resellers on the open market.

That dynamic exposes how US laws which were crafted decades ago to police parts that had an obvious military purpose fall short in the modern era. For instance the US Munitions List – which designates certain materials as defense-related meaning they require licences from the State Department detailing their buyers and end uses – contains things like flamethrowers and the chemicals needed to make C4 explosives.

But other technologies including those used on the TB2 drones appear instead on another list known as the Commerce Control List. Overseen by the Commerce Department these parts do not usually require prior authorisation for sales.

In August 2021 a bipartisan group of 27 members of Congress pressed the Biden administration to take action saying Turkey was using US technology to fuel drone proliferation around the globe. “Turkish actions have continued to run contrary to its responsibilities as a NATO member state” the lawmakers wrote in a letter. “​​The potential for these drones to further destabilise flashpoints in the Caucuses South Asia the Eastern Mediterranean the Middle East and North Africa is too great to ignore.”

The group asked the State Department to assess whether Turkey was violating existing sanctions or NATO rules. They also pressed for a suspension of exports of US.technology that could be used in the TB2s a step the administration hasn’t taken.

In November 2021 Menendez the chair of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee followed up by proposing an amendment to the 2022 National Defense Authorization Act. The measure mandated that the Biden administration investigate whether any US exports since 2018 had been used in the Turkish drones and whether that use and their reexport to other countries violated USs law.

“This amendment is a recognition that we must prevent US parts from being included in these Turkish weapons” he said in a statement at the time. Menendez’s office did not respond to a request for comment for this story.

Turkey pushed back. At the same time that lawmakers were calling on the Biden administration to crack down the Turkish Embassy in Washington hired LB International Solutions on a ​​$544998 contract to lobby on its behalf with Congress according to Foreign Agents Registration Act filings.

The firm in turn paid DC lobbyist Mark W Murray $35000 for setting up more than a dozen meetings with members of Congress including those on the Senate and House Foreign Affairs Committees. Among the items on the agenda: drone sales to Ukraine. Murray declined to answer questions for this story saying “I no longer work for LB International on Turkey.” He referred ProPublica to the lobbying firm which did not respond to a request for comment.

In the end the final defense bill passed in December 2021 did not reference Turkish drones specifically but still required the Biden administration to report to Congress within 180 days on whether US “weapon systems or controlled technology” were used in the Nagorno-Karabakh war. A spokesperson for the Defense Department which is tasked with leading that review said that the department was working on finalising the report and had not yet delivered it to Congress.

US struggles to act



The war in Ukraine however has since softened some of the criticism. Much like Azerbaijan did in 2020 Ukraine has produced propaganda videos of TB2 strikes on Russian forces including a catchy song extolling the drones’ prowess on the battlefield. The drones in turn drew praise from some in Congress.

“We must find ways to quickly provide Ukraine with more armed drones such as the Turkish TB-2 which has been very effective apparently” said Republican Senator Rob Portman speaking on the Senate floor in March.

Senator Marco Rubio a Republican who in 2019 criticised then-President Donald Trump for allowing Turkey to fight Kurdish groups in Syria wrote on Twitter that Ukraine was “inflicting substantial damage on Russia’s supply lines with Bayraktar TB2 Turkish made unmanned combat aerial vehicles”. Rubio who sits on the Foreign Relations Committee declined to comment for this story. Portman’s staff did not respond to a request for comment.

“Everybody in NATO is now looking for ways to deter Putin and up the cost of further Russian military action in Ukraine and the [Turkish] drones as proven on the battlefield are one of the best ways to do that” said Matthew Bryza former US ambassador to Azerbaijan.

Indeed the war has prompted a major effort to arm Ukraine even in countries that had previously sought to stop or slow drone proliferation.

Canada for instance announced in March that it was sending $50 million in lethal and nonlethal aid to Ukraine including “Canadian-made cameras used in military drones and other specialized equipment” – the same MX-15 optical systems that it had banned from being exported to Turkey last year over human rights concerns. Even before the announcement Project Ploughshares the Canadian anti-arms-trade group had concluded that Ukraine’s TB2s were using the cameras.

The analysis was based in part on Canadian export records and Ukrainian video of drone strikes that show the MX-15’s distinctive overlay. Kelsey Gallagher a researcher with the group said the equipment had likely been exported to Ukraine instead of Turkey. Before the Russian invasion Ukrainian officials had announced plans to set up a joint production facility with Baykar in the country.

Canada’s Global Affairs department forwarded questions for this story to the Department of National Defence which did not respond.

The US now faces a slippery diplomatic quandary: On one hand the TB2s are aiding allies like Ukraine which has used them to turn the tide against Russian forces. On the other hand they are rapidly changing modern warfare giving warring factions a way to kill quickly cheaply and remotely.

Pakistan’s military which the US has long refused to sell drones to over concerns about the country’s nuclear weapons program is now advertising the TB2s as a part of its arsenal.

And in Morocco the Polisario Front an opposition group in the disputed Western Sahara region accused the Moroccan air force of deploying drones after a decades-old ceasefire broke down. The Moroccan government has not acknowledged possession of the Turkish drones but in October 2021 Reuters reported that Turkey was negotiating a sales deal for TB2s with the country.

By December video taken by activists captured the drones in the skies and local news reports showed fragments of Turkish MAM-L missiles that had reportedly been used in strikes. Neighboring Algeria denounced what it called “targeted killings committed with sophisticated weapons of war … against innocent civilians.” The Moroccan Foreign Ministry did not respond to a request for comment. Officials have previously denied targeting civilians.

Critics say the US should find ways to slow the spread of Turkish drones.

“The proliferation of this kind of weaponised technology is unstoppable but that doesn’t mean we shouldn’t try to at least create friction against it. And that’s a policy choice” said Nagata the former head of special operations.

Van Diepen the former State official who helped oversee nonproliferation programs said that if the Biden administration chose to take action it could start by activating so-called end-use checks on key drone parts.

The State Department for example has staff in diplomatic missions abroad including in Istanbul tasked with carrying out on-site inspections of companies importing goods from the US and ensuring that the products are not being diverted for other uses.

The programme called Blue Lantern focuses mostly on major sanctioned parties groups like Islamic State or entities linked to states like Iran. While the TB2 components from the US are not directly controlled as military parts the fact they were known to be used to build a military weapons system should have raised flags within the Defense State and Commerce departments former US officials said.

Experts said the US could also use other tools to slow the flow of parts to the drones. Last September for example the White House said it had the authority to penalise any party involved in the Ethiopia conflict. Van Diepen said the Biden administration could use that power to place Baykar Technology on a targeted sanctions list making it illegal for US companies to do business with the firm altogether.

The US has taken similar measures against China and Iran sanctioning Iranian companies and individuals for their involvement in Tehran’s armed drone program and sanctioning Chinese-drone maker DJI for its role in surveillance of ethnic Uyhgurs in Xinjiang.

To some of the strongest critics of Turkey’s armed drones though it appears there is little will in Washington to do more. “Canada they did the due diligence and took actions that haven’t happened here” said Aram Hamparian executive director of ANCA.

In the US “it’s just business as usual. So then why even bother having these laws? And the answer to my question is: So we can use them conveniently when it advances some policy aim.”

It cleverly combines the two for reliable fabrication of multi-level 3D structures and simultaneously solve several practical challenges associated with PR-based grayscale lithography technique. In conventional lithography (Fig. 1f–h) creation of etched features usually follows these steps—coating Photoresist (PR) on the wafer (Fig. 1f); exposing 2D design on the PR with light of appropriate wavelength and energy which causes a photochemical reaction in the PR and makes it dissolvable in a special solvent called the developer (developers are usually highly dilute solutions of extremely corrosive bases like TMAH Tetramethylammonium hydroxide). After exposure the developer is used to wash away the parts of the PR that had been exposed in the previous step thus leaving behind a 2D pattern of PR on the wafer surface (Fig. 1g). Deep Reactive Ion based Bosch Silicon etch is subsequently performed to etch away the exposed parts of the wafer up to a desired depth and we are left with a single-level structure with all the features having the same depth into the silicon wafer (Fig. 1h). To achieve a multi-depth structure using this conventional technique a process flow called LELE (litho-etch-litho-etch) is used. In this process the sequence of steps ‘lithography + etch’ needs to be repeated multiple times with a different exposure design and different etch times in each step. The primary challenge arises in the second lithography step where PR is attempted to be spun on the wafer with features already etched in it. The spin coating process works via PR being puddle dispensed at the center of a Silicon wafer spinning at a high RPM making it spread radially outward to create a thin uniform and conformal coating over the wafer. The spinning process on an already etched wafer is satisfactory (thin and uniform) when the PR thickness (4–10 μm) is much larger compared to the etch height of the features. Thus in some cases of IC fabrication where the already etched feature height is ≤ 1–4 μm the LELE process works perfectly. However in several useful applications of microfluidics liquid cooling optics and semiconductor fabrication these etch depths are of the micro-meso scale and can range anywhere from 10 μm to 500–600 μm. PR spinning on larger step heights (more than 5–10 μm) lead to unsatisfactory coating (Fig. 1i). Several problems like streaking (PR layer being wrinkled after hitting an etched feature or obstacle) fingering (PR getting trapped in a deep cavity/channel and progressing along those channels only) and incomplete coverage (PR hitting the corner of an etched feature and failing to cover the rest of the wafer) mar the spin coating process in the second rounds of lithography. This causes failure of the downstream exposure process whose success relies exclusively on the uniformity of the PR coat—thus leading to failure of the overall process.

We identified two major problems in conventional methods that lead to complicacy in reliable fabrication—unsatisfactory PR coating issues on etched structures with height ≥ 5 μm in LELE processing; and unavoidable and uncontrollable issues associated with partial gray dose exposure in grayscale lithography. In this context we have invented a novel process flow using commonly used cleanroom tools which mitigates all these problems and enables us to create multi-level hierarchical structures with ease. Inspired by grayscale lithography’s principle of 3D patterning the etch mask material we have first introduced an ultra-thin sacrificial layer of SiO 2 in between the PR and the Silicon wafer; the SiO 2 layer now acting as the masking material during the deep Si etching process instead of PR. The idea is to perform multiple rounds of conventional LELE lithography to pattern this newly introduced SiO 2 mask layer instead of attempting to directly pattern the Silicon underneath. After this by deep Si etching this 3D multi-level pattern in the SiO 2 gets scaled vertically and transferred to the silicon—the overall process flow is shown schematically in Fig. 2. In the first step of this process flow the thin (1–3 μm) layer of SiO 2 is first deposited on the wafer through Chemical Vapor Deposition (CVD) at 250–350 °C or thermal oxidation process (≥ 850 °C) (Fig. 2b). Alternatively to make the process more BEOL (back-end-of-line) friendly high density plasma enhanced CVD (HDPECVD) process can be used which can deposit high quality SiO 2 but at a much lower temperature of 90–120 °C by using directional plasma to enhance the deposition process. Following the SiO 2 layer growth/deposition multiple rounds of lithography is performed on the SiO 2 layer with different design and SiO 2 etch time in each of the rounds (Fig. 2c–h). Since the SiO 2 layer is ultra-thin the maximum etch step heights (≤ 3 μm) in SiO 2 is always less than the PR layer thickness (4–10 μm) spreading over them during the spinning process. These low aspect ratio features in the SiO 2 do not interfere with the PR spinning process thus giving rise to perfectly uniform and conformal PR coats on the SiO 2 layer during the multiple lithography steps (Fig. 2f). After the desired 3D profile has been etched in the SiO 2 layer through multiple lithography rounds the wafer is placed in a deep Si etcher which achieves anisotropic profiles in Si via a time-multiplexed deep reactive ion (DRI) process often also termed Bosch etching process54. This etching step is a one-shot process which scales the 3D profile in the SiO 2 vertically by the Si:SiO 2 etch selectivity and transfers it to the Silicon underneath (Fig. 2i). Since this etching step is a single-shot process it also eliminates manual handling of fragile deep etched wafers like in chip stacking or conventional LELE process thus improving process yield from 50 to 90%. Furthermore these structures are now monolithic or made of a single bulk Si substrate which eliminates the several bonding layers that would be required in chip stacking approach—this increases device reliability and robustness; the thermal and mechanical stress cycling induced failures in chip stacked configurations are effectively avoided. All the aforementioned effects combined would result faster processing time more yield higher throughput in industrial mass manufacturing scenarios and ultimately cheaper devices. The two major issues mentioned at the beginning of this section are also mitigated through this process flow—the use of ultra-thin SiO 2 eliminates the PR spin coating issues over etched steps in SiO 2  and performing full dose exposure-based lithography to pattern the SiO 2 layer gets rid of the difficult to characterize problems associated with gray dose lithography. Moreover SiO 2 as a etch hard-mask provides very high selectivity of etch (200–300) with respect to Si which is more than twice that of maximum Si:PR selectivity of 80–100. This enables us to easily make meso-scale structures taller than 500 μm using extremely thin (≤ 3 μm) SiO 2 .

Figure 2 Process flow for creation of multi-level structures using novel approach. (a) Clean bare wafer without features; (b) Intermediate ultra-thin masking material is deposited—in our case SiO 2 is CVD deposited; (c) Photoresist (PR) spinning is uniform this process is not hindered because it is thicker than the underlying SiO 2 layer exposure of Design 1 and development; (d) Using PR as mask layer the underlying SiO 2 is etched to a precise amount \({t}_{1}\); (e) Stripping PR; (f) Second round of lithography is performed—in this situation PR thickness is at least 1.5 times the maximum SiO 2 feature thickness already on the wafer thus spin coating process is successful yielding a thin conformal coat all over the 3D featured SiO 2 . This time design 2 was etched in SiO 2 to a different depth \({t}_{2}\); (g) After two rounds of litho a 2-level structure is made on the SiO 2 ; (h) After two more rounds of litho 2 more levels can be made. In theory \(n\) rounds of lithography is able to make at least \(n\) levels in the structure; (i) The wafer with a 3D structured SiO 2 layer is now etched in a deep Si Reactive Ion Etcher (RIE) to vertically scale the SiO 2 3D pattern by the Si:SiO 2 selectivity (which is around 200–300 for our case) and transfer to the silicon wafer underneath. Finally we are left with an \(n\) level high aspect ratio structure deep structure in Si; (j) In contrast to the multi-level structure this is a single-level structure shown for comparison.

It is also important to note that all the steps used to make up this process flow like lithography (spinning PR exposing sub-10 μm feature design development) SiO 2 deposition or growth on Si wafer SiO 2 reactive ion etch (RIE) and DRI etch of silicon are very commonly employed in the cleanroom microfabrication community. This enables easy transfer of process knowledge from one lab to another something that is almost impossible for grayscale technology47. Furthermore this process flow uses only full exposure lithography which has been extensively characterized and documented for different types and thicknesses of positive and negative resist. The elimination of gray dose exposure deals away with some of the unavoidable issues associated with grayscale technology like gray dose induced PR response curve shifting gray dose profile welling messy surface post-development gray dose dependent dimension distortion224546474849 etc. In absence of these issues expensive and tedious experimental and numerical profile error correction steps that would otherwise be required are also effectively avoided. The only characterization required is related to the etch of SiO 2 and Si both of which have also been extensively characterized by numerous previous researchers. Despite these processes being very common and their characterization data widely available in the microfabrication community we have detailed some characterization data later in the section specific to the tools and recipes we have employed to provide a starting point for anyone looking to fabricate such structures. Information about the specific tools and recipes used in our study can be found in the Supplementary Information (SI) Table 1. The SI Table 3 also contains a tabular comparison of this novel method with the existing processes of chip stacking and grayscale lithography (masked and maskless).

Preliminary tests using this novel process flow (Fig. 2) have demonstrated the ability to create 3D hierarchical features of nominal dimensions (width) ~ 5–10 μm with aspect ratios (height to width ratio) as large as 10–15. The resolution can be further improved to sub-500 nm scale by using e-beam lithography instead of conventional photolithography. The process flow of creating multi-level structures has been tested 5 times with different magnitudes of step heights (250 nm through 1.5 μm) to establish reliability and repeatability.

The resolution and repeatability of the process depends on our ability to precisely characterize the etch rate of Silicon etch rate of SiO 2 and the Si:SiO 2 etch selectivity. Two characterization masks were constructed such that when lithographically aligned will contain small design patches of overlapping straight microchannels and square pillar arrays. Three different characterization wafers were etched for varying amounts with these two lithography masks on three different days. These two masks were etched for varying durations using a 600–800 W plasma of CHF 3 and CH 4 in 3:1 ratio in a reactive ion etching tool named Oxford RIE to generate steps of step heights varying between 250 nm and 1.5 μm in the SiO 2 layer. The SiO 2 etching recipe was so chosen such that the SiO 2 :PR selectivity was ≥ 1. This ensures that the PR layer (4–10 μm) is always sufficiently thick to completely etch the thinner (3 μm) SiO 2 underneath thus eliminating one more parameter (SiO 2 :PR etch selectivity) from needing precise characterization. In this scenario only the SiO 2 etch rate information becomes important. The findings of SiO 2 etch are summarized in Fig. 3. The raw data from which Fig. 3 has been constructed can be found in SI Table 2.

Figure 3 To establish repeatability and standardizability of our method precise characterization of the oxide etch rate is imperative. The characterization wafer consisting of straight channels and square pillar arrays were etched for varying durations (1–100 s) and the etch per second in Å/s has been plotted as a function of the feature type and dimensions. The raw data used to plot these curves can be found in the Supplementary Information. Etch per second was found to be stable around 5 nm/s. However the important observation is the fact that no Aspect Ratio Dependent Etching (ARDE) in SiO 2 is noticed (the maximum variation in etch per second in different geometries was found to be ~ 1 nm/s) showing a consistent etch per second value for different feature dimension and loading conditions. Etch per second was seen to be more influenced by total etch time especially when total etch time is low (≤ 5 s)—this is the result of unpredictable and non-uniform plasma distribution in the etch chamber when etch time is only 1 s. At higher etch times (30 s 60 s 100 s) the etch per second showed less variation and were closer to each other (45–50 Å/s) indicating good process control repeatability and reliability.

Following detailed characterization of the oxide etch rate using our specific recipe we can precisely construct 3D structures in Silicon oxide. The target structures for our extreme heat flux cooling devices are extremely tall (~ 500 μm) needing 3–4 μm SiO 2 layer as the mask. As mentioned before we have chosen an aggressive oxide etch recipe with good SiO 2 :PR selectivity of ≥ 1. This is necessary in order to be able to etch the thick SiO 2 layers (up to 4–6 μm) using a relatively thinner PR layer (4 μm thus maintaining sub-10 μm resolution). Although choosing an aggressive SiO 2 etch recipe (with high etch per second value) leads to worsening of the vertical resolution of our target structures. As seen in Fig. 3 which plots the etch per second (Å/s) as a function of the total etch time and feature dimension the average etch rate was well controlled within 45 and 54 Å/s for a wide range of target structures and for all etch durations above 1 s. At 1 s the etching is severely starved of plasma and etch rate is much lower ~ 30 Å/s. Additionally in 1 s plasma does not have enough time to distribute in the chamber uniformly thus also leading to Aspect Ratio Dependent Etching (ARDE) where the feature dimensions influence the etch rate more strongly (this can be seen in gray (1 s etch) line plot in Fig. 3). Thus the vertical resolution of the 3D structures using our etching recipe is determined by a minimum of 2 s etch and is limited around 10 nm in the SiO 2 layer. This translates to around 2–3 μm when the step is scaled and transferred to the Silicon wafer through DRIE. The etching recipe can be tuned (flow rates of respective gases can be reduced CHF 3 and CH 4 ratio could be decreased) to make it less aggressive and thus reduce the etch per second value—this will lead to better control of the etch and better (sub-10 nm) resolution in the SiO 2 3D structure although at the cost of lowering SiO 2 :PR selectivity. Following characterization of the oxide etching step a deep silicon etching recipe was used in the Plasma-Therm Deep Silicon Etcher (PTDSE) for pattern transfer. This recipe was also characterized using a test wafer with straight channels of widths 100–200 μm. The average Si:SiO 2 etch selectivity over a total 200 μm depth of etch was found to be around 270–290. This etching recipe was developed extensively by a previous work by Hazra et al. who reported etch selectivity of 220–240 and etch rate of 8 μm/min54. The DSE recipe used by Hazra et al. was also extremely aggressive in order to accommodate their extreme total etch height of 1000 μm although this aggressive recipe leads to a reduced Si:SiO 2 selectivity. In our present study the recipe was slightly modified (the silicon etching step ‘etchA’ time was reduced to 3.1 s from 3.354) to increase selectivity and attain straighter more anisotropic etch profile. The progression of etch for our characterization structures (perpendicularly placed straight channels arrays of different widths and spacings between 100 and 400 μm) were investigated. 172 μm of Silicon was found to be etched for 0.61 μm of oxide thus making the average Si:SiO 2 etch selectivity ~ 282. Some of the final multi-level structures obtained through this process flow are shown in Fig. 4.

(a) Multi-level pin fin structures (isometric view) these types of structures cannot be made via conventional chip stacking or double sided etching techniques; (b) (side view) multi-level pin fin array; (c) pin fins and pin holes; (d) straight microchannels offset from wafer surface (the ability to make microstructure slightly offset from surface has immense potential to ease bonding integration and packaging different components together especially for extreme heat flux cooling applications); (e) serrated fin structures of different aspect ratios and spacing; (f) zoomed image of pin–fin pin hole sample; (g) (side view) Serrated Fin structure showing 4 distinct levels; (h) Isometric view of 2-level serrated fin; (i) Overlapping mask designs used to make 3-level serrated fins; (j) 3-level channels with pin-holes made by overlapping 2 mask designs.

Posted on: July 16 2022 04:50h.

Last updated on: July 16 2022 07:50h.

News that MGM Resorts International (NYSE:MGM) may have held talks with the Lim family about acquiring Genting Singapore is the gaming industry’s epic rumor of the week. But some analysts say the Resorts World Sentosa shouldn’t sell itself outright.

The Lims which control the vast Genting Berhad empire own 53% of Genting Singapore. Shares of the casino operator spiked 9% Friday when reports regarding the MGM talks hit the wires. But the Asian gaming company later requested that the Singapore Stock Exchange halt trading in the shares.

In a note to clients JPMorgan analysts imply there’s credibility to the rumors. A Bloomberg article which was the first on the matter cites unidentified sources saying MGM discussed an acquisition with the Lims. But the talks didn’t produce a deal. Likewise other unspecified suitors are said to be mulling offers for Genting Singapore.

While the operator of one of Singapore’s two integrated resorts undoubtedly makes for an attractive takeover target particularly for a gaming company looking to enter or expand in Asia the JPMorgan analysts believe the sale of a partial stake is more likely than a full takeover of Genting Singapore.

Hurdles to Full Sale

There are some potential roadblocks that could hinder an outright sale of Genting and those issues center around corporate debt.

Genting Singapore is the vehicle through which the parent conglomerate services some of its obligations. Under the terms of one of its issues the Singapore gaming outfit must remain in control of Genting. Another tranche of bonds previously sold by Genting is tied to Resorts World Las Vegas and carries a clause that if Genting Singapore is acquired by another company the debt tied to the Strip casino can be redeemed prior to maturity.

If the Lims pursue a partial sale of Genting Singapore the parent company could bolster liquidity with which to service debt and potentially make a long-awaited entry into Macau.

This also offers GENT a potential entry into Macau the missing puzzle in the group” according to the JPMorgan analysts. “Genting Group considered SJM nearly a decade ago but the idea did not go beyond the CRA.”

Under the terms of Macau’s new gaming laws the amount of concessionaires operating there remains at the current tally of six. That means operators wanting to enter that jurisdiction need to do so via acquisition. It’s not confirmed that Genting will make another run at SJM Holdings. But the Grand Lisboa owner is widely viewed as in the worst financial shape of the six concessionaires.

Why Stake Sale Makes Sense

If it’s capital Genting is searching for selling a percentage of its Singapore arm may make more sense than divesting the entire unit.

The reasoning is simple. Resorts World Sentosa is one of just two casinos there and the city-state is more open than other countries in Asia indicating that a sale of Genting Singapore over the near-term could prove hasty and limit the operator’s ability to participate in a rebound.

There’s already talk in the gaming community demand is bouncing back in Singapore indicating Genting may not want to rush to completely divest its operation there.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmdvbGZwYXNzLmNvbS90cmF2ZWwtYWR2aXNvci9hcnRpY2xlcy9nb2xmLWNvdXJzZS1uZXdzLW5vdGVzLWp1bHktMjAyMtIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Tom Doak David McLay Kidd at the center of recent new resort golf course announcements,"At this rate the 2020s might go down as the greatest decade in the history of new golf course construction.

The number of exciting new builds either in progress or recently announced may not be as large in volume as it would have been in the 1990s or early 2000s but the average quality of course being built is off-the-charts good.

And in recent weeks it's gotten even better thanks to two big announcements from beloved one-course facilities that will soon have two stunning big layouts with which to attract adventurous golfers.

The first bit of news comes from Scotland by way of Canada. Cabot the golf resort company that developed Cabot Cape Breton in remote northern Nova Scotia a decade ago recently purchased Castle Stuart Golf Links in - stop me if you've heard this before - remote northern Scotland. Castle Stuart's Gil Hanse-designed golf course opened in 2009 to immediate acclaim landing four Scottish Opens including the 2013 edition won by Phil Mickelson the week before he captured the 2013 Open Championship. Castle Stuart developer Mark Parsinen had planned to expand the footprint of his resort beyond 18 holes but he passed away in 2019 with plans for a second course in existence but more or less shelved.

Now Cabot owned by developer Ben Cowan-Dewar seeks to carry on Parsinen's legacy and fulfill his dream of turning what will now be called Cabot Highlands into a focal point for golfers visiting the rugged Scottish Highlands.

In keeping with Bandon Dunes developer and Cabot supporter Mike Keiser's ""1+1=3"" equation when it comes to turning a curiosity into a destination Cabot has hired Tom Doak to build a new 18-hole course beside Castle Stuart which is set to open in 2024 and will wind around a 400-year-old castle on the property. Cabot Highlands also just finished building a par-3 course which will open next year.

Cabot now has exciting golf courses in various stages of construction at four different sites worldwide. In January they purchased the former World Woods Golf Club in Brooksville Fla. renaming it Cabot Citrus Farms with the promise of overhauling the existing 45-hole footprint. Kyle Franz and Mike Nuzzo are among the architects currently attached to that project. Down in the Caribbean Cabot St. Lucia's Point Hardy Golf Club is expected to open this fall. Finally 3000 miles west of the company's original property Cabot Revelstoke in British Columbia with a golf course designed by Cabot Links architect Rod Whitman is beginning to take shape in the Canadian Rockies.

Kidd adds two U.S. projects

David McLay Kidd who burst onto the scene when he laid out the original Bandon Dunes course at just 26 years of age continues to be rewarded for his unique design style with exciting new projects. In central Washington he will return to Gamble Sands whose original course in 2014 overlooks the Columbia River and is lauded for its scenery and player-friendly design. Kidd followed up with the adventurous 14-hole QuickSands short course in 2021 and has been hired to build a second big course on the rolling high-desert property. That 18-hole layout as yet unnamed will break ground later this year with an eye on a full opening in 2025. The on-site Inn at Gamble Sands is also set for a major expansion.

In the meantime Kidd is hard at work on GrayBull which will be the first built-from-scratch club in the popular Dormie Network a collection of destination private clubs whose members have the run of half a dozen courses the company has bought up over several years including its namesake Dormie Club in Pinehurst N.C. Located in the sand hills of Nebraska close to the town of North Platte GrayBull is expected to open in 2024.

The company returned some service order charges and promised to refund furniture deliveries to those who completed a form. But more than two weeks later tweets show that many Modsy customers are still awaiting updates.

Unfortunately for them Modsy has made it tougher to get in touch. While the company’s website remains operational Modsy recently deleted its Twitter and Facebook pages and made its Instagram account private.

The reason is that Modsy quietly shut down in early July founder and CEO Shanna Tellerman said in an email to TechCrunch. Business of Home first reported in June that leadership intended to wind down the “corporate and legal entity of Modsy” and that most of the company’s e-commerce staff engineers and management had been let go. But Tellerman had declined to confirm this at the time.

“Capital constraints and uncertain market conditions forced the company to cease operations on July 6 and lay off all employees” Tellerman told TechCrunch. Modsy’s assets were acquired by a “new entity” out of an insolvency proceeding she added and some former employees were hired by the entity to take the business in a “new direction.”

“Customers will be notified on next steps on how to address their needs” Tellerman said.

The entity is Pencil LLC legally classified as a “general assignment for the benefit of creditors” — or ABC. (“Pencil” is a nod to Modsy’s legal name “Pencil and Pixel Inc.”). To form an ABC a business — in this case Modsy — enters into an agreement to assign its assets to a unaffiliated third party (e.g. Pencil) responsible for conducting the liquidation of the business. It’s not an untested strategy in the tech industry. E-ink smartwatch manufacturer Pebble went the ABC route when it shut down operations in December 2016. Ill-fated game streaming service OnLive also formed an ABC in 2015 to sell its technology to Sony.

ABCs have the advantage of allowing assets to be quickly sold either for cash (to pay off creditors) or to sell the company to a new owner and keep services operating. The downside is the equity of the original company — including any founder investor and employee equity — is wiped out. A former Modsy employee speaking to TechCrunch on the condition of anonymity said they were informed that their stock options are now worthless.

A link emailed to some Modsy customers directs them to a form for claims “outside of [refunds]” including equity interest wages salaries bonuses severance commissions and contributions to an employee benefit plan. The wording suggests a process to recover money and benefits employees believe that they’re owed but it’s unclear which claims if any will be successful.

Lennar a homebuilder based in Fontainebleau Florida might be partially funding Pencil according to the former employee. TechCrunch couldn’t independently confirm this and Tellerman refused to comment but it’s true that Lennar was a major partner of Modsy’s. In May 2021 the companies announced a collaboration to create “walkable” 3D tours of model homes using Modsy’s technology. And Lennar’s corporate venture arm Len X on its website identifies Modsy as one of its portfolio companies.

“Together with Modsy we are helping Lennar customers imagine their future homes” reads a post on the Len X blog. “With Modsy’s life-like designs customers can visualize what their future floorplan will look like before it’s built work with a designer to customize the interior design to their needs and style and purchase furniture and decor for their new home with ease.”

Upset customers

While the shell of the former Modsy team figures out a path forward several customers say that they’ve been stonewalled by Modsy’s support team — or what remains of it. Five of the seven customers TechCrunch spoke with all of whom applied for refunds in June either hadn’t heard from the company or received boilerplate emails without information about the status of their refunds. One said that they were told they’d see a refund within three to five business days. Another was informed they’d been approved for a refund but weren’t told when to expect it.

“I had $50000 of in-process orders that are in limbo” one customer told TechCrunch on Twitter. “[Modsy has] communicated that they will be fulfilling remaining outstanding orders for furniture but actual logistics on this point have been sparse.”

Said another customer: “[Modsy’s] service was supposed to facilitate returns — that was one of the perks. But that’s not happening. We have $4500 in undelivered or unanswered return request not counting the missing design services.”

Modsy’s initial business model revolved around selling interior design services on top of an AI-powered platform. Prior to founding the company Tellerman was a partner at GV (formerly Google Ventures) focusing on retail 3D and augmented reality technologies.

Using Modsy’s apps property owners could create renderings of their rooms and restyle them in real time or pay a designer for a custom layout. Fixtures could be purchased either through Modsy directly or through partner tools like Crate & Barrel’s 3D Room Designer.

Backers in Modsy included TCV Comcast Ventures Norwest Venture Partners and NBCUniversal. The company’s last funding round closed in May 2019 bringing Modsy’s total raised to $72.7 million according to Crunchbase data.

In May Modsy signaled that it would pivot to offer a software-as-a-service platform Modsy Pro as a service for interior designers. On the company’s website Modsy Pro is described as “online interior design software that will transform the way you do business … bring your client’s space to life with our proprietary room-scan technology 3D renders and easily editable and shoppable designs.”

The move came two years after Modsy made a series of aggressive cuts slashing designer pay and reducing both salaried employees and its network of designers. At the time Tellerman told Business of Home that it was a part of an effort to make the company “leaner.” Business of Home’s reporting also revealed that Modsy in addition to piloting its own furniture line at one point experimented with outsourcing design work to the Philippines and Bulgaria as a way to reduce operating expenses.

The Modsy Pro landing page offers a way for users to apply for early access for the still-beta product. But in light of Modsy’s shutdown the launch appears to be up in the air.",,,,,,,,,,,,

Die Folge: Der Standort in Pullach ist nicht mehr ausgelastet. Die Belegschaft muss zittern. Laut Insidern ist jeder vierte Job in Gefahr.

In der Anlagenbau-Sparte von Linde droht nach dem Rückzug aus Russland ein Stellenabbau. Infolge der Sanktionen gegen die Regierung von Wladimir Putin sind dem amerikanisch-deutschen Konzern milliardenschwere lukrative Großaufträge über Gasverflüssigungs- und Verarbeitungs-Anlagen vor allem vom Staatskonzern Gazprom weggebrochen.

Der für das Geschäft zuständige Vorstand Jürgen Nowicki sprach in einer Betriebsversammlung via Videokonferenz von ""notwendigen strukturellen Maßnahmen am Standort Pullach"" und einem einschneidenden Personalabbau wie aus einem Schreiben des Betriebsrats an die Belegschaft hervorgeht das Reuters vorliegt. Mit den Russland-Aufträgen wäre der Standort vor den Toren Münchens auf Jahre ausgelastet gewesen.

Mehrere Unternehmensinsider sagten geplant sei der Abbau von 400 bis 500 Arbeitsplätzen. Ein Sprecher wollte sich dazu nicht äußern. Im Anlagenbau beschäftigt Linde in Pullach gut 2000 Menschen. Aufträge aus Russland machten zwei Drittel des Auftragsbestandes der Sparte aus.

Betriebsrat sucht nach Alternativen

Der Vorstand geht laut Nowicki davon aus dass ein Drittel unwiederbringlich verloren ist. Die Gewerkschaft IG Metall setzt dahinter ein Fragezeichen: ""Wir sind der Überzeugung dass das nur ein Tal der Tränen ist das nach zwei bis drei Jahren durchschritten sein dürfte"" sagte der Linde-Beauftragte der IG Metall Daniele Frijia am Freitag zu Reuters. ""Der Standort Pullach muss in seiner Breite und Tiefe erhalten bleiben.""

Betriebsratschef Hans-Peter Kaballo sagte Linde dringe auf einen möglichst schnellen Personalabbau. ""Aber das ist der völlig falsche Weg ein hilfloser Versuch."" Linde drohe damit ein Know-how-Verlust während die Personalkosten nur ein Bruchteil der Gesamtkosten seien. Linde sei für die Umstellung von Gas auf Wasserstoff als Energieträger so gut aufgestellt wie kein anderen Anlagenbauer. Das Geschäft sei profitabel bringe aber ohne Russland nicht die geforderten Umsatzrenditen. ""Das wird auch noch drei bis vier Jahre so bleiben. Das macht die Geschäftsführung nervös."" Der Betriebsrat wolle Alternativen zu einem Stellenabbau aufzeigen.

Her image reinventions and music are what make her a true pop icon.

She will perform in 14 cities around the world for the first time since January 2018. Lady Gaga will give her first concert on July 17 as an open-air concert in Düsseldorf after which she will appear in Stockholm Paris London Toronto Washington New York Chicago San Francisco and Los Angeles among others.

It will be the live premiere of the songs from her latest album ""Chromatica.""

Lady Gaga originally wanted to go on tour for the release of the album in 2020. Due to the pandemic however the concerts had to be postponed twice.

German fans of the pop icon should be particularly pleased that the first concert is in Düsseldorf — during her last world tour in 2018 Lady Gaga had to cancel many European concerts due to illness including all of her stops in Germany.

Top star despite health issues

Lady Gaga suffers from fibromyalgia an increased sensitivity to pain colloquially known as soft tissue rheumatism. She spoke with US talk show host Oprah Winfrey in 2020 about how the disease causes chronic pain throughout her body and leads to exhaustion: ""Even sitting here with you today I am in head-to-toe pain"" said Gaga.

Regardless of her illness Lady Gaga is one of the most successful artists in the world. She has won 12 Grammy Awards and has also received an Oscar and two Golden Globes for her acting and music.

The concert promoter Live Nation Entertainment states that she has sold over 36 million albums worldwide.

Around 190 million fans follow her on Facebook Instagram and Twitter — that's more than twice Germany's entire population.

Lady Gaga: a total work of art

Gaga whose real name is Stefani Joanne Angelina Germanotta released her first album in 2008 ""The Fame"" which marked her international breakthrough selling 15 million copies. It included the hit songs ""Poker Face"" and ""Just Dance"" which became two of the world's best-selling singles of all time.

""Chromatica"" is her sixth studio album and features collaborations with musical greats such as Ariana Grande and Elton John.

But even beyond her music Lady Gaga is a total work of art particularly with her shrill costumes.

At US President Joe Biden's inauguration she sang in a bulletproof dress. She sometimes dresses as Jo Calderone her fictional male alter-ego she created in 2010. The meat dress she wore at the 2010 MTV Video Music Awards remains legendary. Early on in her career she was compared to Madonna the ""Queen of Pop.""

Lady Gaga has also demonstrated her acting skills whether in the lead role alongside Bradley Cooper in the remake of the classic film ""A Star is Born"" (2018) or as Patrizia Reggiani the ex-wife of Maurizio Gucci in Ridley Scott's ""House of Gucci"" (2022). ""A Star is Born"" brought her an Oscar nomination for best actress and she won the Academy Award for the song ""Shallow.""

The commercial and critical success of the 36-year-old world star on stage and on the silver screen is reflected in the ticket prices for her concerts: The cheapest tickets in Düsseldorf cost €176 ($177) while the most expensive ones sell for €2239. A few places are still available.

Lady Gaga opens her world tour ""The Chromatica Ball"" on July 17 2022 in Düsseldorf.

The service could fly the expendable drones in as soon as three years the vice president and general manager of the company’s advanced development programs division known as Skunk Works said July 11.

John Clark said in a briefing with reporters before the Farnborough Airshow scheduled for July 18-22 in London that the expendable drones will have a much lower price point than the more advanced systems making a quicker delivery easier.

Lockheed wants those expendable drones available should a conflict with China erupt sometime this decade as top U.S. Air Force officials said could happen. “We’re really talking about something that could be operational in the next three to four years so that our folks in the Pacific have that tool in their toolbox should they need it” Clark said.

The more advanced systems could start showing up in the 2030s Clark said. They would have more capabilities including the ability to return to base for reuse after each mission he added. Lockheed envisions those drones returning to bases established under the Air Force’s Agile Combat Employment concept which includes setting up more austere spread-out bases in some cases using rough runways.

The service has for years worked on adding autonomous and artificial intelligence capabilities to drones. Air Force Secretary Frank Kendall has repeatedly discussed his desire to partner as many as five drones with a manned fighter such as the F-35 or Next Generation Air Dominance platform. Kendall earlier this year said turning the crewed-uncrewed teaming concept into reality is one of his top priorities.

Clark said teaming these uncrewed systems with manned fighters could help the Air Force maintain its combat capability in the next decade as older air frames like the F-16 start to wear out. Lockheed envisions these drones working as part of a “distributed team” each with their own coordinated roles to play and complementing the piloted fighter Clark added.

Clark said Skunk Works isn’t ready to reveal images of the drones it is working on saying that could tip its hand on some of its more advanced design concepts.

But a concept video posted by Lockheed illustrates how this distributed team concept could work. It shows an animation of an F-35 flying alongside a variety of drones including one with a flying wing shape similar to the B-21.

In the video a formation of F-35s and accompanying drone swarms fly into highly contested airspace with some drones serving as target decoys for an enemy’s surface-to-air missiles distracting them while other drones use electronic warfare capabilities against the air defenses.

Other intelligence surveillance and reconnaissance information drones identify the location of hidden surface-to-air batteries and beam that data back to the piloted F-35s the animated video shows. Then another group of armed drones directed by the F-35 pilots flies ahead and shoots down enemy fighters.

Clark said it is important for the advanced drones accompanying piloted aircraft to have radar signatures and survivability that is comparable to the piloted aircraft in the lead so that the drones don’t inadvertently tip off the enemy.

While this drives up the cost he noted it also means the Air Force would have a better chance at getting the advanced drones back and capable of flying again.

He also said the drones could be slower or faster than the piloted fighter in the lead and the concept would still work.

Clark said a drone teaming with a piloted F-35 could for example carry four to eight more AIM-120 Advanced Medium-Range Air-to-Air Missiles. Giving the team of piloted fighters and drones much more firepower gives them a better chance of surviving the mission he said.

Lockheed is working on connecting the drones to F-35s using Joint All-Domain Command and Control technology Clark said. An early concept the company considered Clark said was having a low-Earth orbit constellation of remote sensor satellites that could provide information to a Next Generation Air Dominance fighter or B-21 Raider bomber.

Lockheed then shifted course to looking at low-cost expendable aircraft. Clark said this would be important in a conflict where the Air Force is likely to lose multiple drones in a short period of time. If each vehicle costs $10 million Clark explained those costs start to add up quickly.

For the drones that don’t get shot down the logistics requirements to recover and sustain them so they can fly again could also be considerable he added and if that includes using the Navy to fish out drones that have splashed down in the sea that places the service vessel at risk.

Clark said Skunk Works has also looked at the expendable drones as essentially loitering munitions in some cases. In that scenario the drone would carry out as many of its roles as it could until it flies into a target and “actually ends with a bang” he said.

Lockheed has also worked together with the Air Force Test Pilot School at Edwards Air Force Base in California to test how autonomy and artificial intelligence software could work with an F-16.

“One of the things that we explored was that the uncrewed vehicle it had passive sensors that were fixated on what the crewed system was doing and focusing on it” Clark said. “It would adjust its behaviors and its evaluations based on what it was observing.”

Most importantly he added the human pilot didn’t need to focus a lot of attention steering the drone teammate.

“We’ll never get these types of crewed-uncrewed teaming concepts put in place if we put a lot of workload on the pilots in the system” Clark said. “They already have a heavy burden to bear with the maintenance of their own aircraft and collaboration within a four-[fighter formation] of say an F-35. To go load direct control of a bunch of uncrewed vehicles on top of them is really not a tenable path.”

The presentation depicts various large and small drones high-end and attritable with different roles controlled by a single fighter and integrated into a more comprehensive network of air assets operating in a contested battlespace.

An illustrated video by Skunk Works General Manager and Lockheed Martin CEO John Clark shows an F-35B flying ahead of a ‘flying wing’ UCAV; a UCAV that looks like a wingman with a v-shape tail with swept main wings and an air intake on top of the rear center-fuselage; a missile-like drone called the Common Multi-Mission Truck (CMMT) launched from the F-35 with pop-out wings a v-shape tail and two symmetrical dug-in air intakes on the rear-left and right-hand side and; a bomb-like UAV with a v-shape tail and a dome on the top center-fuselage possibly meant for satellite communication.

The second-last (the one launched from the F-35) is shown to have different modules inside its body implying it can be customized for land-attack and kamikaze (suicide) missions.

How Does The ‘Swarm’ Work?

The CMMT UCAV/UAVs are shown flying ahead of two F-35s and a C-130J Hercules as a part of a CMMT swarm with a Next Generation Air Dominance (NGAD) fighter ahead of them near enemy shores. The enemy territory has several Surface-to-Air Missile (SAM) sites with the flying wing UAV outside its radius.

Two F-35s are flying separately while the more prominent ‘wingmen are leading two more F-35s.’ The wingmen are labeled as ‘EW’ (Electronic Warfare) and ‘Decoy’ with the latter shown drawing the SAM fire and the ones labeled EW sending signals jamming the SAM sites’ radars.

The flying wing drones perform Intelligence Surveillance and Reconnaissance (ISR) sending information to the third group of F-35s which direct/control the wingmen to take appropriate action.

Indeed this concept assumes the ‘peer competitor’ like Russia or China not to have developed wingmen and other aircraft-controlled UCAVs of their own besides not relying on SAMs alone to tackle aerial threats.

Still Futile Against Peer Competitors

Any attack on land controlled by these countries will be primarily defended by their fighter-wingmen-decoy-ISR UAV teams Airborne Early Warning (AEW) aircraft and in the case of China an entire naval flotilla with aircraft carriers carrier-borne fighters and other surface combatants with formidable Air Defence (AD) capabilities.

Clark seems to have recognized this oversight and said Skunk Works then began to explore ‘attritable’ unmanned platforms – cheap dispensable platforms that commanders would be willing to use for high-risk missions instead of costlier advanced ones.

“In the context of any of these fights attrition has got to be a part of the calculus. You can demonstrate any mission concept in an operational analysis venue and show that hey it works once. Can you make it repeatedly work over 30 days when you start to accumulate the losses of a campaign?

If you’re looking at the cost of losing a vehicle let’s say $10 million and your attrition rates are north of 80% those numbers add up very quickly. And then that remaining 20% that you didn’t atrit what’s the sustainment or logistics trail that comes with them to reconstitute them to then go reuse them?” Clark said.

The Defence Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) even considered experimenting with recoverable small drones that can be rescued by naval ships. But again they realized the next time the logistical effort and operational risk of retrieving lost drones in a heavily chaotic and intense battlespace.

This is not to mention the effort to repair and send them back up. An adversary can always deliberately keep shooting down such ‘recoverable’ drones to lure US assets into a rescue mission which could be their real target.

Moreover in a long-drawn-out war adversaries are likely to accept initial losses to learn US forces’ logistical and operational tactics to finalize their countermeasures.

The biggest drawback US forces still face in theatres like the Western Pacific is China’s Anti-Access/Area Denial (A2/AD) missiles and logistics. In the former China’s DF-21D Anti-Ship Ballistic Missile (ASBM) can take out American aircraft carriers from a long distance against which there is admittedly no countermeasure according to US Navy’s Admirals.

As for logistics it is impossible to keep a long-drawn-out war without permanent basing agreements with partner nations and the first island chain quickly coming under attack by China’s DF-23 ballistic missiles.

The US military would therefore have to address these fundamental weaknesses which are more political economic and strategic instead of focusing purely on tactical military solutions.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZmh0dHBzOi8vZGVmYnJpZWYuY29tLzIwMjIvMDcvMTcvaXRhbHktd2VsY29tZXMtZmlyc3QtaW50ZXJuYXRpb25hbC1mLTM1LXRvLWl0cy1jYW1lcmktbWFpbnRlbmFuY2UtaHViL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Italy welcomes first international F-35 to its Cameri maintenance hub,"The F-35 assembly facility in Cameri Italy welcomed its first ever international F-35 for an overhaul as a Norwegian fighter landed there on July 4.

The Norwegian F-35 was sent for repairs to Italy as part of the international collaboration in the Joint Strike Fighter program that will see Cameri maintain the fifth-generation fighters from a number of European operators.

Lockheed Martin the fighter jet manufacturer revealed earlier that the Italian facility had achieved full operational capability for F-35 upkeep this summer.

The first fighter to undergo the major overhaul is set to complete the procedure by November 17 this year according to the Norwegian defense ministry. The plan is that at all times in the next few years there will be a Norwegian F-35 in Italy for maintenance.

Set up as one of only three F-35 assembly facilities worldwide the other two being in the US and Japan the Cameri facility is owned by the Italian government and operated by defense technology company Leonardo as a Lockheed Martin subcontractor.

Cameri will be responsible for the maintenance of Italian British and Dutch F-35s. Italian officials are also working on securing agreements to assemble Swiss and German F-35s at Cameri in the future.

The F-16 is now in the final phase of systems installation before heading into the final assembly and checkout process in Greenville South Carolina.

It’s a bird it’s a plane F-16 production is getting ready to soar!

According to Lockheed Martin’s Facebook page the photo in this post was taken in June and shows the newest and most advanced Fighting Falcon (for an unspecified customer) after having completed major assembly. The F-16 is now in the final phase of systems installation before heading into the final assembly and checkout process in Greenville South Carolina.

On Jun. 16 2022 the company announced that Jordan signed a Letter of Offer and Acceptance for the sale of eight new production F-16 Block 70 aircraft.

The selection of new production F-16 aircraft extends Jordan’s existing fleet of F-16s bringing advanced capabilities to the mission combined with affordable operating and lifecycle costs.

Jordan’s new F-16s will be built in Greenville.

On Jan. 28 2022 the company announced it delivered the first F-16 jet as part of the F-16 Sustainment Depot program back to the US Air Force (USAF).

Lockheed Martin was originally selected for the USAF’s F-16 Sustainment Depot program in December 2020 and the first jet arrived in Greenville for work in spring 2021.

Now the global home of the F-16 Greenville Site Operations provides the F-16 with total lifecycle support – from the production line of the newest and most advanced F-16 to being the first industry F-16 depot in the continental US for sustainment support services.

F-16 production in Greenville enables Lockheed Martin to meet the growing international demand for new F-16s and increase F-35 production in Fort Worth Texas. F-16 production orders between now and the mid-2020s potentially even longer will be completed in Greenville.

Demand continues to soar for new production F-16s. Bahrain became the first F-16 Block 70 customer in June 2018 Slovakia signed Letter of Agreement in Dec. 2018 for 14 Block 70 aircraft and Bulgaria ordered 16 new F-16 Block 70 aircraft.

The F-16 is a critical piece of the 21st century warfare network. With more than 3000 F-16s operating today in 25 countries – including 900 with the US Air Force – we are focused on helping our customers seamlessly and securely connect all assets in the joint battlespace. The F-16 has flown an estimated 19.5 million flight hours and more than 13 million sorties. Today’s latest version the Block 70/72 offers unparalleled capabilities and will be flown by at least five countries beginning in the mid-2020s.

The company said that the PDR was part of a technical process to ensure that its design can realize a precise low-cost speed-of-light technology for military operations.

In March 2021 the US Department of Defense (DoD) awarded Northrop Grumman a $72 million contract under the High Energy Laser Scaling Initiative (HELSI) to demonstrate a HEL prototype using Northrop Grumman’s coherent beam combining technology.

The HELSI is a Pentagon initiative to develop a new 300-kilowatt-class laser weapon prototype for technology demonstration.

“This is an important step in combining high-power laser beams into a single beam that can be scaled for maximum power” said Robert Fleming vice president and general manager strategic space systems Northrop Grumman.

“We’re on track to demonstrate the technology leveraging our decades of experience in the field.”

According to the company the prototype can be scaled up to more than a megawatt. It will be tested at progressively higher powers later this year to prove the coherent beam combining (CBC) design.

Beam combining involves combining the outputs of multiple laser sources to obtain a single high-energy output beam. In contrast ‘Coherent’ beam incorporation would involve the merger of coherent waves – waves with a constant phase difference.

Another method to fuse two laser beams is ‘Spectral’ beam combining (SBC) also known as wavelength beam combining which involves superimposing the outputs of several laser emitters at specific wavelengths in an area to form a single beam.

The SBC technology was used by Lockheed Martin and its subsidiary Aculight Corporation to demonstrate a series of laser weapon prototypes: first the 30 kilowatts then 60 kilowatts and ultimately 100 kilowatts in October 2019 which then also won them a HELSI contract to demonstrate a 300 kilowatts class laser in 2022.

Lockheed Martin is only one of the three companies participating in the HELSI initiative led by the Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD) and the US Army promotes it. Other companies are Nutronics Inc. sponsored by the Navy and General Atomics sponsored by the US Air Force (USAF).

In May 2020 Dynetics also announced that it would work to increase the power of a 100 kW-class system to the 300kW-class system for the US Army and demonstrate a prototype in 2022.

High-Energy Lasers US Military’s Top Priority

The incorporation of laser weapons technology is currently one of the high-priority targets of the US military especially after the US lawmakers asked the armed services to speed up efforts toward developing Directed Energy Weapons (DEWs) in early July.

The US Army plans to have two types of laser weapons systems for air defense by 2022 which include the 50 kilowatts class weapons and 300 kilowatts class weapons fitted on Stryker armored vehicles manufactured by General Dynamics.

The 50-kilowatt laser weapon is designated as the DE-MSHORAD (Directed Energy – Maneuver Short-Range Air Defense) which will be used to shoot short-range rockets artillery and drones. In contrast the 300 kilowatts beams will be used against cruise missiles.

Initially Northrop Grumman and Raytheon competed for the 50-kilowatt laser weapon system. Still Northrop Grumman dropped out of the program while Raytheon recently demonstrated its prototype in May against 60-millimeter mortars and several small medium and large drones.

Meanwhile the US Air Force received its first high-energy laser weapon on July 12 called LANCE (or Laser Advancements for Next-generation Compact Environments) from Lockheed Martin.

LANCE is a pod weapon that can be fitted on an aircraft with the primary laser weapon supplied by Lockheed Martin and the pod carrying LANCE made by Boeing. Also the beam control system that trains the laser on its target is provided by Northrop Grumman.

It is unclear how much power this new laser weapon will produce but reports indicate it will probably not exceed 100 kilowatts.

It is also unknown which aircraft this podded laser weapon will ultimately be tested on or deployed. However Lockheed Martin had previously shown the pod carried by an F-16 fighter jet in its concept art. At the same time Boeing had tested a pre-prototype pod shape on a USAF F-15 fighter."

While Lowes would eventually come out on top and take his 30th MOTUL FIM Superbike World Championship podium it was a stunning fight with Redding as the pair battled it out for third spot.

Lowes was involved in many battles throughout the 23-lap race first with teammate Jonathan Rea in the opening stages of the race and then with Redding in the closing stages as he fought for his first podium of the campaign. Having dropped back to fifth Lowes was promoted to fourth when Alvaro Bautista (Aruba.it Racing – Ducati) crashed out before he hunted down Redding for third. From Redding’s side he started from fourth place but dropped down to sixth at the end of Lap 1 before moving up the order to fourth place; promoted to third following Bautista’s crash.

In the last few laps Lowes was able to close in on Redding and the pair battled it out with it coming to an epic conclusion on Laps 19 and 20. Lowes first got through at the Turn 9-10 chicane before Redding responded immediately into the Melbourne Loop at Turn 11. At Turn 12 Lowes was able to get up the inside of Redding before the BMW rider responded on the inside of Turn 1. At Turn 2 Lowes was able to get underneath Redding to claim third place.

Discussing his battle with Redding Lowes said: “I was really struggling on the bike I didn’t have much grip. Luckily I was battling with Scott and I realised his grip was even less than mine! There were some parts of the track he was so much faster than me and other parts where I was quite a lot faster than him. I kept trying to pass him but he was really late on the brakes until Melbourne Loop. We had a bit where I passed and he passed back. Then he ran a little bit wide at Turn 2. I just managed to get underneath him. If I didn’t get past him enough he was going to come straight back at me and I was losing quite a lot of time. I was quite anxious to get past; it was a good battle.”

Redding who just missed out on his first BMW podium also discussed the battle. He said: “I just lost the last bit of the tyre with five laps to go and there was nothing I could do which was a shame because the podium would’ve been amazing. The battle was kind of short because I had nothing to fight with but I thought I would try anyway. It was good to battle. I had to try but I think it was three laps to go I wasn’t going to hold him for three laps; he had too much of an advantage. It was quite good to be in the battle towards the front of the field.”

In terms of additions to the active roster Brandon Lowe was activated from the 60-day injured list and Ryan Yarbrough was recalled from the taxi squad per Neil Solondz of the Rays. To make room on the 40-man roster for Lowe centerfielder Kevin Kiermaier was transferred to the 60-day injured list with left hip inflammation. To create the active roster space Ralph Garza Jr. and Jonathan Aranda were both optioned to Triple-A.

Lowe has been one of the Rays' top position players as the organization has surged to prominence over the last couple of seasons. Second base has become a full team effort with Lowe on the shelf. Aranda Taylor Walls Vidal Brujan Yu Chang and Isaac Paredes all started at the keystone in July. Lowe has been out since May 15 with a lower-back injury. Before the injury he racked up 133 plate appearances with a .212/.293/.415 triple slash line.

For his small part Aranda stepped in nicely for a seven-game stretch going 6-for-16 at the plate striking out three times without taking a walk. It was the first bit of big league action for the 24-year-old infielder.

Yarbrough tossed 34 innings for the Rays earlier this season with a 5.82 ERA/5.35 FIP. The crafty southpaw has been as consistent a presence as the Rays allow over the past five seasons.

In a separate deal the Rays have claimed Cooper Criswell off waivers from the Angels and optioned him to Triple-A per Solondz. To make room on the 40-man roster Shane Baz was transferred to the 60-day injured list. The 25-year-old Criswell made his major league debut for the Angels last season making a single start. He has registered a 3.50 ERA through 18 innings in Triple-A this season.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMidmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnZpc29yZG93bi5jb20vbmV3cy9yYWNpbmcvd29ybGRzYmsvcmVhLWhlYWRzLWthd2FzYWtpLTEtMi1haGVhZC1sb3dlcy1kb25pbmd0b24td29ybGRzYmstc3VwZXJwb2xlLXJlc3VsdHPSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Rea heads Kawa... | Donington WorldSBK Superpole Results,"Superpole for the fifth round of the 2022 Superbike World Championship was as Friday held under sunlight which was increasing in intensity.

The short 15-minute Superpole session took place after FP3 in which Garrett Gerloff was fastest. But after topping Friday afternoon's FP2 by almost half-a-second Jonathan Rea was favourite to take pole position at what is his home race.

An early crash for Loris Baz at turn one limited his potential for the session (although he was able to get back out later on for 14th) while the early pace was set by Eugene Laverty who sat at the top briefly before the major runners came through.

When they did it was Jonathan Rea who was fastest ahead of Scott Redding while Alvaro Bautista and Toprak Razgatlioglu were the only other riders within half-a-second of Rea after the opening salvos.

Next came the SCQ tyres of course which would provide the optimum grip for a fast time. Once again it was Rea who had the most potential and he was even able to improve on the second lap of the tyre - a rarity with the new-for-2022 SCQs.

Scott Redding was unable to benefit to the same extent with the Q tyre as the SCX on the first run from Rea's tow and he ended up fourth as Alex Lowes and Toprak Razgatlioglu completed the front row.

Alvaro Bautista was fifth ahead of his factory Ducati teammate Michael Rinaldi who completed row two; while Iker Lecuona will start race one later today from seventh alonsdie Garrett Gerloff and Andrea Locatelli on row three.

One bettor's big decision for $1.7 million,"Open Extended Reactions

Wayne Shelton walked into Paycom Center on Tuesday for his first ever NBA playoff game. It was Game 1 of the Western Conference semifinals between the Dallas Mavericks and the Oklahoma City Thunder.

Shelton a single father of one and owner of a real estate appraisal business in Phoenix Arizona is ""nervous as hell."" Over the past year he's become one of the Thunder's biggest supporters -- not for sentimental reasons but because the team may help him cash the parlay of a lifetime.

Shelton avidly watches and bets on sports often using multiple screens to keep up with all of the action. However his method for sports betting isn't exactly conventional: He largely only bets futures very rarely dabbling in day-to-day betting.

""I plant seeds throughout the year"" Shelton told ESPN. ""I bet all the major sports for all the futures divisions whatever. And the whole idea is I'll invest a decent amount but now I get to enjoy the entire season as a sports bettor without having to put more money down. I can enjoy what I invested and enjoy every game because they all matter.""

So over one year ago May 1 2023 when DraftKings offered him a high-limit 50% profit boost he knew he had to take a shot.

Shelton noticed that the Texas Rangers had an outrageously positive run differential a month into the MLB season and on that day believed they were a better shot to win the World Series than their 22-1 odds suggested. He began his process of ""research"" -- but for the purposes of this new bet that term will be used loosely. A family member whose family was ""not really into sports"" started following the Kansas City Chiefs so Shelton felt betting a repeat for the reigning champs could be fun at +600.

Then there was the Thunder who Shelton believed showed potential after a feisty outing as the 10-seed in the play-in tournament. At 70-1 to win in 2024 OKC was the final piece of Shelton's puzzle.

He packaged the three championship futures into a $100 parlay to build a new futures ticket. The payout: $1.7 million.

""I never bet that high on a future especially a lottery ticket like this one"" Shelton said. ""They gave me a high max and I just said 'You know what? This one time max it out let's go.' [I] never do that. [And] here we are.""

In November the Rangers won their first World Series in franchise history. In February the Chiefs repeated as Super Bowl champions. Now the Thunder the Western Conference's No. 1 seed are three series wins away from capturing the franchise's first NBA title since moving to Oklahoma City.

""Most people would prefer to [bet] day-to-day and that's because you get your payout immediately"" Shelton said. ""For someone that does it like me you have to be willing to invest. You have to know you are not going to get paid tomorrow. It's been a year since I made the ticket and I've just enjoyed the ride.""

Shelton aims to have 40 futures tickets active at any given time so he's generally familiar with the options available to him to maximize his profit. However with so much money on the line this time (his previous biggest win was $7000) he has had to think about it a little harder.

The most traditional method is hedging which he did ahead of the Dallas-Oklahoma City series to the tune of a $10000 payout should the Mavericks win. He said he will ""probably"" hedge each round if the Thunder continue to win.

Additionally like all major sportsbooks DraftKings offered a cash out on the wager but at around $75000 following OKC's opening round series win Shelton didn't believe the value aligned and started looking at his options to cash out elsewhere.

After the Super Bowl reports emerged of a betting ticket that was just a Thunder title win away from cashing $1.7 million. Travis Geiger's ears instantly perked up.

About four years prior Geiger Zach Doctor and Guy Dotan all alumni of UCLA founded WagerWire a secondary betting ticket exchange born out of the founders' desires for a place to buy into each other's action. While the company isn't the first of its kind -- PropSwap for example launched in 2015 -- Geiger and his co-founders believe they got in early on something that could become a staple of the betting industry.

""This is not only a way for you to ride with your friends but a way for you to play it like an asset that you're more familiar with like a pair of sneakers like crypto like a stock"" Geiger told ESPN. ""It takes what was a risk class and makes it an asset class. If you game it all the way out it creates a secondary market and as we know secondary markets are kind of an inevitability of capitalism.""

Users sync their sportsbook accounts with WagerWire populating their wagers in the app's system. From there they can shop their bet around to other users or wait for offers to come in. They can of course purchase other users' wagers as well.

The app's bet value calculator tells users how much a given ticket is worth based on the original odds/payout and the probability of it cashing based on events that have already occurred. In Shelton's case WagerWire valued the ticket at just over $180000 ahead of the Thunder's series against the Mavericks.

Expected payout for Shelton's ticket If the Thunder ... Expected Value of Ticket After Game 1 of Thunder-Mavs $228613 Advance to Western Conference finals $330366 Advance to NBA Finals $720420 According to WagerWire calculations.

Geiger wanted the opportunity to land this ticket on WagerWire as it would be the biggest bet the platform ever handled. He reached out to the purported ticket holder -- only it wasn't Shelton but instead a 23-year-old named Sean Koehler who attempted to co-opt the internet fame by claiming the ticket was his.

Shelton caught wind of the scheme and contacted Koehler who admitted to duping media outlets. Shelton eventually verified the bet was his by syncing his DraftKings account in WagerWire. DraftKings declined to comment for this story but confirmed the legitimacy of the ticket.

Though Shelton wasn't sure if he even wanted to sell he listed the ticket on the platform to keep all his options open.

Right now WagerWire makes its money by splitting ""nominal"" buyer transaction fees with sportsbooks which vary from operator to operator. For big transactions like Shelton's -- as well as that of Martwon Weaver who sold a $680960 NFL awards parlay that ultimately lost for $25000 -- the company waives its fees.

The sportsbooks handle all of the actual transferring of wagers -- a feature that keeps the secondary market compliant with betting laws.

""The PropSwap transaction relates to what the holder of the sportsbook ticket wants to do with that piece of paper which is now really a contract between the player and the book"" Nevada attorney Dan Reaser told ESPN about PropSwap in 2017. ""It is not the business of taking wagers to facilitate someone buying or selling that contract.""

Geiger feels that his company's product complements sportsbook's cash-out options which are inherently lower than market value to align with their own business needs. To that end it's possible that WagerWire and similar products could eventually directly integrate with sportsbook interfaces providing a more appealing alternative right in the apps.

It might eventually look similar to the secondary events ticket marketplace: If a user couldn't get the ticket they wanted at the original price they can pay a premium to get in later.

Finding a buyer willing to pay thousands -- or hundreds of thousands in Shelton's case -- to get in on the action can be difficult. This is where another company White Glove Bets enters the picture.

Self-described as a ""concierge service"" for digital betting White Glove Bets has a stable of ""high-level VIPs"" that ordinarily cannot deposit money at major sportsbooks due to the inherent risk they bring with their deep coffers. While they're not what you would call professional bettors these players regularly make six-figure deposits and wagers.

""They have that Type A personality if you will"" White Glove Bets co-founder Kevin Smith told ESPN. ""Many of them are business owners or at least executives that are pretty high up the food chain."" He added that many of the company's clients also work in the financial sector. Smith said the clientele is ""predominantly"" male bettors with some as young as 25 years old. Several have been circling Shelton's ticket.

One of the potential investors who has a particular penchant for futures was very intrigued by the final leg of the wager and expressed interest in buying it. Smith has requested that the potential buyer remain anonymous.

White Glove Bets set them up with WagerWire who facilitated a $100000 offer to Shelton -- who promptly turned it down.

At that time Shelton characterized it as a fair offer given DraftKings' cash out was approximately $55000. But knowing that the Thunder were likely to knock out the Pelicans in the first round of the playoffs he decided to hold onto the ticket anticipating a value increase. He also had some reservations about the still emerging secondary market.

""The first thing that was going through my head was 'Wow ok somebody is considering a hundred grand'"" said Shelton. ""If somebody's willing to offer me a reasonable amount above cash out I'm not going to ignore it no question. It's just that I have to trust the company that I'm talking to or the person I'm talking to and I just don't know these companies well enough to be comfortable saying 'Sure I'll do that.'""

Since then Shelton claims to have gotten several offers over $100000 though he notes that many of these including one for $200000 were not legitimate. Protecting the original ticket remains his top priority.

Still if the secondary market can continue to grow and be taken seriously it could provide the alternative to cash outs that high-end bettors have been waiting for: Only a ""super VIP"" could have the capital to bail Shelton's ticket out above the cash out value and such a buyer could also have the means to properly hedge the bet all the way.

""As [the big betting operators] become more corporate they have less tolerance for high-end VIPs"" Smith said. ""I'm not being critical of them at all or their business model.""

While the financial thrillseekers wait in the wings looking for that moment to make him a life-changing offer Shelton is just enjoying the ride. He says he might take a vacation and wants to meet someone famous if and when he comes away with the money but hasn't put a lot of thought into it because it isn't tangible. For now the betting everyman is staying the course taking his monumental decision day by day.

""My family has been supportive people online -- and there's a lot of them -- have been very supportive and that does help with the immense amount of stress that comes with this"" Shelton said. ""And when I say stress -- find like 30 different emotions bundle them up together and it's that way all the time. But I appreciate that and I appreciate that people haven't been harsh and cruel.""

On Tuesday night with Shelton in attendance the Thunder won the first game of their series. The new value of the ticket according to WagerWire is $228613

""[I'm] relieved that I get a day to breathe"" Shelton told ESPN Wednesday morning. ""Awesome game and environment.""

This was the only game of the series Shelton was planning on attending. Now it's back to Arizona where the largest sweat of his life -- and perhaps others -- will continue.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiaGh0dHBzOi8vbnlwb3N0LmNvbS8yMDI0LzA1LzA5L3VzLW5ld3MvdGVlbnMta2lja2VkLW91dC1vZi1sdXhlLWNhdGhvbGljLXNjaG9vbC1mb3ItYmxhY2tmYWNlLWF3YXJkZWQtMW0v0gFsaHR0cHM6Ly9ueXBvc3QuY29tLzIwMjQvMDUvMDkvdXMtbmV3cy90ZWVucy1raWNrZWQtb3V0LW9mLWx1eGUtY2F0aG9saWMtc2Nob29sLWZvci1ibGFja2ZhY2UtYXdhcmRlZC0xbS9hbXAv?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Teens kicked out of elite Catholic school for 'blackface' awarded $1M by jury after proving it was just acne mask,"Two teens kicked out of their elite California Catholic school while falsely accused of wearing blackface have been jointly awarded more than $1 million after proving it was just a green acne face mask.

The then-students at Saint Francis High School in Mountain View were just 14 when they took a photo during a sleepover in 2017 of them wearing the treatment in solidarity with a friend suffering from severe acne their lawsuit said.

The treatment bought by one of the boy’s moms was light green when applied and turned dark green once dry.

Their “innocent” selfie then went viral three years later when it was found and widely shared during the height of the Black Lives Matter protests following the 2020 murder of George Floyd.

A Santa Clara County jury agreed this week that the school breached an oral contract and did not give them due process before expelling them in 2020 according to the Los Angeles Times.

The students identified only as A.H. and H.H. in the lawsuit were awarded $500000 each and will have their $70000 tuition reimbursed.

“This case is significant not only for our clients but for its groundbreaking effect on all private high schools in California which are now legally required to provide fair procedure to students before punishing or expelling them” said Krista Baughman one of the attorneys for the students.

“The jury rightly confirmed that Saint Francis High School’s procedures were unfair to our clients and that the school is not above the law.”

In a statement A.H.’s family said: “We want to sincerely thank the jury and the court system for helping our boys and our families find justice which now paves the way for their names to be cleared for things they never did.”

The lawsuit had initially sought $20 million. The jury rejected some of the boys’ claims including defamation and violation of free speech.

Representatives for the school said they “respectfully disagree” with the jury’s decision and are “exploring legal options” including an appeal.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRlbGVncmFwaC5jby51ay91cy9uZXdzLzIwMjQvMDUvMDgvZm91ci1mbGlnaHQtYXR0ZW5kYW50cy1zbXVnZ2xpbmctZHJ1Zy1tb25leS1uZXcteW9yay_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Four flight attendants charged with smuggling £6.4m in drug money,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='www.telegraph.co.uk', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /us/news/2024/05/08/four-flight-attendants-smuggling-drug-money-new-york/ (Caused by NewConnectionError('<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x000002185BDDE8C0>: Failed to establish a new connection: [Errno 11001] getaddrinfo failed')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRlbGVncmFwaC5jby51ay91cy9uZXdzLzIwMjQvMDUvMDgvZm91ci1mbGlnaHQtYXR0ZW5kYW50cy1zbXVnZ2xpbmctZHJ1Zy1tb25leS1uZXcteW9yay_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5vcnRoamVyc2V5LmNvbS9zdG9yeS9uZXdzL3RyYW5zcG9ydGF0aW9uLzIwMjQvMDUvMDcvbmotdHJhbnNpdC1jdXRzLXBsYW4tYXNzZXNzbWVudC83MzU1NTcyODAwNy_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,NJ Transit consulting team is looking to transform the agency. And cut $600M,"The conundrum facing the firm charged with restructuring NJ Transit is to find $600 million in cuts while also identifying ways to help the agency evolve into a ""comprehensive transit system"" that meets the needs of modern-day straphangers.

The state is paying North Highland $6.7 million to conduct the study which the company launched in January. It is expected to deliver “quick wins” in June with a feasibility study report in late October or November.

Asked if the North Highland team has provided the month-five update of ""quick wins"" yet and if it will give an update to the public NJ Transit spokesman John Chartier said ""There is no update on North Highland at this time.""

Story continues after photo gallery.

North Highland is trying to answer this central question: “What are the opportunities and next steps for NJT to become the ‘Comprehensive Transit System’ that the public expects even in midst of this challenging environment?”

That is what the consulting team said to the New Jersey Transportation and Treasury departments in its 154-page response to a request for proposals part of a 214-page document withheld from the public for more than two months after NorthJersey.com first filed a public information request.

Contracts are supposed to be provided “immediately” according to state law. In this case the requested document wasn’t produced until after a significant fare hike proposal was approved by NJ Transit’s board even though the main point of the study is to cut 20% of the agency's operating budget.

Analyzing a 'doomsday' scenario

NJ Transit President and CEO Kevin Corbett said the study is partly analyzing a ""doomsday"" scenario — cuts the agency could be forced to make if state aid including a proposed corporate transit fee isn’t passed by the Legislature in time for the July 1 budget deadline.

The other part of the study will examine potential agency improvements good management practices it could adopt and how it could change service to meet ridership in a post-pandemic commuter environment.

“What happens if we don’t get that money?"" Corbett said in response to questions from senators and Assembly members during transportation budget hearings last month. ""We have to be able to come back and say ‘OK if we don’t have this money then we’re talking very dramatic potential cuts certainly nothing that we want to do after working so hard to rebuild the transit system.'""

Five firms are involved in the assessment: Atlanta-based North Highland Co.; Washington D.C.-based CPCS Transcom Limited; Houston-based Amey Consulting; Newton Pennsylvania-based Loutel LLC; and Trenton-based MBI a powerhouse New Jersey lobbying firm.

North Highland’s team will assess NJ Transit across three main categories: administration operations and capital. Here is an overview of the issues the consulting firm will target in each of those fields.

Administration

This piece of the analysis will focus on the workforce organizational design procurement practices use of technology discretionary spending and revenue.

The workforce assessment will provide NJ Transit with a better understanding of the true number of employees needed in each area and what jobs might be automated. NJ Transit’s nearly 12000-person workforce is the biggest area of costs for the agency.

The tech focuses will be applied to planning routes and collecting and using real-time data. NJ Transit currently provides no public data for cancellations of the three light rail systems or the agency’s 253 bus routes.

In addition it is aiming to “enhance existing systems for improved performance and user experience” which could help address data issues that have affected navigation apps offering real-time bus departure data and recent issues customers have reported with the app’s Departure Vision feature for real-time train information.

Operations

The operations section will focus on how to address “historical practices that can sometimes create added burden” on legacy transit systems like NJ Transit with the goal to improve service.

“An external perspective can be helpful in challenging the status quo and we see it as our role to get to the bottom of the ‘how’ and ‘why’ behind existing service operations” the proposal’s authors said.

Some specific issues they’ll explore: how long trains wait at each stop how best to cycle equipment and conduct maintenance what service changes could be made during peak and off-peak hours how to ensure on-time performance how to improve paratransit dispatch how best to cycle through crews how to improve accessibility and how to improve efficiency with train platform assignments.

Another focal point will be how to address post-COVID ridership trends such as longer peak travel times as well as how congestion pricing could affect ridership and “a more regionally distributed network that provides interconnectivity across a more dispersed set of origins and destinations” instead of focusing on Manhattan the proposal said.

Capital

The North Highland team will take a close look at NJ Transit’s assets and how best to manage them including train cars and buses and property to house them.

Much like other legacy transit operators NJ Transit has a mix of inherited outdated equipment and facilities along with some newer equipment and garages including the electric bus fleet and garage in Newton. This has created a “complex web” and “can spiral into a chaotic environment of redundant inventory systems obsolete stock and operational inefficiencies” the proposal said.

The analysis will aim to find redundancies and streamline inventory processes to cut costs."

A prominent mainline Christian denomination plans to divest from five oil companies it believes are not doing enough to address climate change. The vote to divest from Chevron Exxon Mobil Marathon Petroleum Phillips 66 and Valero Energy comes after years of debate in the Presbyterian Church (U.S.A.). On July 6 commissioners at the PCUSA's general assembly voted 340-41 to add those companies to the denomination's divestment list. They join 85 other companies on the list — most with ties to the military or the weapons industry. The move ""gives teeth to selective divestment"" said Aaron Ochart vice moderator of the Environmental Justice Committee who introduced the divestment recommendation to the general assembly which voted online. Since the 1980s Presbyterians have called for a move away from fossil fuels including oil. More recently they have debated whether to divest or to use their investments to pressure companies to change their ways. In 2016 and 2018 votes to divest failed in favor of more engagement. Rob Fohr director of faith-based investing and corporate engagement for the PCUSA said the church's ""Mission Responsibility Through Investment"" committee had hoped to see more change at the five oil companies. But their efforts at engagement failed to make progress he said.

""Divestment is never the goal"" he said in an email. ""Corporate change is the goal. MRTI determined after engagement with these five companies that continued engagement is not likely to yield meaningful change. Meanwhile the climate crisis is only increasing in urgency. We hope this divestment will be received as a clear signal that meaningful change is needed."" The next step in the process will be for the MRTI committee to compile a new version of the divestment list. That list will then be sent to the denomination's pension board and the Presbyterian Foundation for approval. Both groups have already said they will approve the new list said Fohr. During the discussion of the divestment recommendation Tom Taylor president of the Presbyterian Foundation was asked about the financial impact of divesting. He said the impact was ""impossible to know"" and would depend on future market conditions. He also said the foundation would act quickly to divest. ""As soon as possible we will get out of it"" he said. Commissioners who are made up of local Presbyterian church leaders also approved a recommendation to add seven other companies including three airlines for more direct engagement. Those companies are found on a list compiled by the environmental group Climate Action 100 according to the denomination's Environmental Justice Committee. Those commissioners also approved a proposal known as an overture to create a ""Presbyterian Tree Fund"" to purchase carbon offsets for work-related air travel by church staff as well as one titled ""Investing in a Green Future."" Last week a group of three dozen faith groups from seven countries announced they have divested from fossil fuels. The groups include five Church of England dioceses two Catholic dioceses in the United Kingdom 11 Catholic religious orders two Jesuit universities in the United States and the United Methodist Church in Ireland. Darren Dochuk author of ""Anointed With Oil"" a history of religion and the oil industry in the United States said faith groups in the past saw oil and other fossil fuels as a blessing. Some of the early oil tycoons such as the Pew family and Lyman Stewart who helped fund the fundamentalist movement were Presbyterians and many church institutions in the United States were funded by oil money. Divesting from fossil fuels Dochuk said is complicated both for denominations and for local congregations especially those in areas where the local economy depends on the fossil fuel industry.

Several leaders from Marriott International gathered at The Edition Times Square late last week to share updates on how the company is adapting to the changing environment. They were in town for The Exchange Association Masters & Corporate Partnership Conference held at the Marriott Marquis where an estimated 400 sales representatives and general managers from the U.S. and Canada met with an equal number of corporate and association meeting professionals to discuss new demands for both corporate and leisure travel.

Group and Business

Julius Robinson Marriott’s chief sales & marketing officer U.S. & Canada noted that despite the uptick in occupancy some of the company’s customers have not attended a meeting in more than two years. “So it's important that we as an organization stay focused on making sure they feel confident about the travel experience [and] ease of use” he said. Just as importantly he said the company is looking to give its customers best practices they can use for their own meetings.

Marriott’s business travel bookings are not yet back to 2019 levels said Drew Pinto global officer for global sales distribution and revenue management—but he blamed this on booking windows for larger groups. “The small groups are back if not exceeding where we were in 2019” he said. Several months back Marriott’s “special corporate business” was down as much as 40 percent from where it had been. “We've been improving by several percentage points every month” Pinto said adding that the decrease was now down in the “mid-teens.”

Small group bookings like sports teams and weddings came back first Robinson said but have moved beyond the traditional full-service properties into the select-service brands as well. In addition Pinto said companies with a large number of remote workers are using hotels to meet up when they bring teams together. These meetings often are seeking lower-priced suburban properties that may be closer to where people live rather than where they have traditionally worked.

When group customers are booking larger properties they are now seeking blocks of up to 900 rooms two months or 45 days out. “As we talk to customers today because of all the volatility that's out there they don't see that trend changing” he added.

Another notable trend is that customers are looking for more rooms than they had initially requested. Robinson sees two reasons for this: “One the meeting planners are a little less confident about what's going to happen with attendance and so they are a little more conservative in what they contract” he said. Secondly attendees are eager for events that have not been held since before the pandemic so demand is higher than normal. “So there's a lot of conversation back and forth with the hotel on trying to add more rooms and trying to provide more space and flexibility.”

Leisure Travel

Robinson said Marriott is seeing “great demand” from leisure customers and hotels are adapting to new needs from this segment—“as an example extending food and beverage hours at times when you have high demands [from] families in transit.”

Leisure-focused markets that recovered quickly during the pandemic are still going strong Robinson added but urban markets that often cater to business travelers are now reporting improved occupancies. “In this last quarter we've seen not a shift but an addition of customers moving into the urban market” he said. “It's no longer just about Florida Arizona Southern California and the mountains. It's now New York and Chicago and even markets like Seattle which have been down for a while [that] are showing really good signs of recovery.”

Pinto also acknowledged the recent JD Power survey that found overall guest satisfaction in U.S. hotels was down 8 percent. Much of the dissatisfaction he said might come from reduced housekeeping service and limited amenities leftover from the pandemic. The company is responding by increasing focus on members of its Bonvoy loyalty program and Pinto said internal satisfaction scores had improved. Improved communications about what a guest can expect upon arrival have also helped improve satisfaction.

Sustainability

Denise Naguib Marriott’s VP of sustainability and supplier diversity said that people in general are more aware of environmental concerns and want to see changes in the meetings they attend and the travel experiences they book. “Both on the leisure and the meeting side we are very much seeing the sort of the groundswell of the traveler on communicating their demand and desire for responsibility.” To that end every hotel in Marriott's portfolio now has a sustainability tab on its website to share information with both planners and travelers.

Minimizing food waste and carbon footprints during meetings and events is a growing priority among planners and attendees alike. “We are trying to provide tools [and] resources for the meeting planners as well as our hotels so that they can work through these challenges” she said.

Reducing carbon footprints and food waste is not about composting after an event or donating leftover food Naguib added: “It's really understanding how [to] plan for a meeting most effectively to reduce the food waste from being created.” Marriott also is finding ways to offset carbon emissions from meetings which Naguib acknowledged is not a “be-all [and] end-all solution” to the climate crisis. “But from a meeting perspective it's a really impactful way by which meeting planners can move the needle on this and help their attendees and their stakeholders understand that they can hold a meeting responsibly by doing these things” she said.

The company has also developed its own internal teams resources on using disposable materials—like plates and cutlery—at events and ways to use reusable materials instead. “Making sure that end to end the solution is the right one for whatever that product is so important—as opposed to the perception of if it is or isn't sustainable” Naguib said.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUmh0dHA6Ly9yb2JlcnRkeWVyLmJsb2dzcG90LmNvbS8yMDIyLzA3L2otd2lsbGFyZC1tYXJyaW90dHMtbW9kZWwtdC1hcnJpdmVzLWF0Lmh0bWzSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,J.

However Thomas and Heather called off their engagement after a year.

Who is Heather Mascoe?

News broke in March that the former Southern Charm star Ravenel was expecting a child with Heather after ending a custody battle with his ex Kathryn Dennis.

He had been in an on-again-off-again relationship with Heather who is a nurse since last summer according to the Daily Mail.

The disgraced reality star reportedly fought to keep Heather's pregnancy under wraps and claimed that they weren't together but are ""really good friends.""

He said: ""That's how I'd put our relationship really good friends. She's happy and I'm happy.""

But months after the denial the Daily Mail reported that Thomas had described himself as happily engaged to Heather and had no plans to sign a prenup agreement with his fiancée.

He reportedly told friends he feels he doesn't need a prenup with this one.

Why did they end their engagement?

A source gave the reason for their breakup stating: “Thomas and Heather clashed over the design of his Aiken house. They argued over every detail of the renovation. She wanted to make every room a playroom for the kids. She tried to take over the design.

""That along with them being incompatible as a couple led to the breakup…they’re better off as friends.""

When did they have their baby?

Thomas and Heather welcomed their little boy to the world on June 29.

""We've named him Jonathan Jackson Ravenel and he was born by C-section on June 29 7lbs 4oz and 20.25inches long"" Thomas told the Daily Mail.

""We are both very happy. Heather is a phenomenal mom and they're both doing well.""

Jonathan is his third child.

The former South Carolina treasurer also talked about how he told his two children - Kensie 6 and Saint 4 with Kathryn Dennis - about their new little brother. 6 Jonathan Jackson Ravenel is Thomas's third child Credit: Getty - Contributor ""It's kind of difficult to explain to them you know 'This is your half-brother – different mothers same father'"" he told the Daily Mail. ""They were a little confused. In the end I just told them 'You'll understand when you're older!'"" ""But they've Face-Timed with the baby and they're very excited to meet him. ""They're getting ready to spend the week with their mother so we're hoping they'll meet him after that."" Heather herself also has two children - a son 12 and a daughter 13 - with prolific Charleston restaurateur Leo Chiagkouris the site claimed.

Why was Thomas Ravenel fired from Southern Charm?

Thomas was axed from Southern Charm after his former nanny accused him of sexually assaulting her.

Dawn Ledwell claimed Thomas tried to kiss her after returning to his Charleston home drunk in January 2015.

Thomas pleaded guilty to third-degree assault and battery admitting in court that he had tried to kiss Dawn.

He said: “Your honor on the night of the incident I did attempt to kiss her and in so doing I grabbed her arm and that was wrong and I am much appreciative of the opportunity to apologize to her in court today.”

Thomas avoided going to jail by paying a $500 fine.

The reality star was also accused of sexually assaulting a separate woman he met on Tinder in 2015 and reportedly settled with her for $200000.

He served as South Carolina state treasurer for six months in 2007 before being indicted on federal cocaine distribution charges.

He resigned in July 2007 and was sentenced to 10 months in prison for the charges.



Who did Thomas Ravenel date before Heather?

Thomas was married to Southern Charm's Kathryn Dennis - who is now believed to be dating a football player.

After Dennis and Ravenel separated the two were embroiled in a nasty custody battle over their young children hurling shocking accusations against each other in court.

After three years of battling in court they finally agreed to joint custody.

Earlier this year fans speculated their romance might have rekindled.

Kathryn commented about the rumors when a fan account posted a meme about the couple's alleged romance.

The meme read: ""When you get good news that Southern Charm has finally started filming but bad news that these two are officially back together: [picture of Kathryn and Thomas]"".

But Kathryn set the record straight when she commented: ""Not true.""

6 The family at Christmas Credit: Refer to Caption

Talk of a rekindled romance began in January when Kathryn posted a picture of herself leaning into Thomas while accompanied by two friends captioning it: ""I'm nobody's Bond girl.""

Thomas also insisted they're simply co-parenting amicably.

He replied to a fan on Twitter: ""No we’re doing some things together because it makes the kids very happy to see us getting along.

""And in this matter our interests are perfectly aligned.""

The rumors came just one month after the estranged couple spent Christmas together with their kids.",,,,,,,,,,,,

Citibank is an advertising partner of this site as is American Express Chase Barclays and Capital One. Any opinions expressed in this post are my own and have not been reviewed approved or endorsed by my advertising partners. I do not write about all credit cards that are available -- instead focusing on miles points and cash back (and currencies that can be converted into the same). Terms apply to the offers and benefits listed on this page.

Wells Fargo introduced its new Autograph Card this month. It’s an above-average product but not best in class. What’s struck me most about it is that Wells Fargo is making marketing claims that just seem wrong – and that actually undersell other products they have in the process.

The no annual fee Autograph card offers



Initial bonus: 30000 points after $1500 spend in first 3 months



30000 points after $1500 spend in first 3 months 3x earning: dining travel (including transit and gas) streaming services and phone plans [1x everywhere else]



dining travel (including transit and gas) streaming services and phone plans [1x everywhere else] Redemption: points are worth 1 cent apiece with redemptions in $25 increments ($20 at Wells Fargo ATMs)

These are nice 3x categories but it’s basically a cash back card with minimums to cash out. You’ll never get better than 3% back on any of your spend. That’s better than a 1% card and it has no annual fee so a lot of consumers out in the world would do better with this card than they already have. But it’s hardly top of market.

So here’s what I see in an ad when I Google the card:

Wells Fargo claims Autograph is their “best points card ever.” I’m surprised their lawyers allowed the claim because it’s so obviously not accurate.

The Autograph card is basically the old Wells Fargo Propel card but running on the Visa network instead of American Express. The Propel World card used to come with baggage and trip delay; trip cancellation and interruption; return protection and extended warranty and more.

The most direct comparison for Autograph at Wells Fargo would be to their Active Cash card which is a no annual fee 2% back card on everything. Autograph has some nice 3x categories but that’s not obviously better than 2% across the board (just ask Capital One!). Active Cash is probably the more lucrative standalone card and one of the best cash back cards.

Wells wants to call Autograph a points card rather than cash back putting it in a different category from Active Cash. Sure they’re bonusing travel spend but it’s not a points card the way we usually think of those. There’s no elevated redemption option for travel and no transfers to other points programs. Instead you redeem points for cash or for other options like merchandise. Yet even on that technicality the claim doesn’t hold water.

Let’s grant them that they’re trying to define Autograph as a ‘points card’ and not claiming it’s their best cash back card ever (even though that’s really how to think about the Autograph card).

Do the Wells Fargo marketing people not realize they have a much better actual points card than Autograph right now? Wells Fargo issues the Bilt Mastercard.

Bilt has 3x points-earning too (dining) as well as 2x points-earning (travel) also at no annual fee with richer protections like trip delay and cancellation; primary rental car collision damage waiver (versus secondary with Autograph)

More importantly it’s going to earn far more points for most cardmembers than Autograph will – certainly for anyone who rents rather than owns their home and especially as consumers keep and use the card year after year. The Bilt Mastercard lets cardmembers earn 1 point per dollar spent on rent at no cost. It’s the biggest expense item for most people who rent and the Autograph card will generally earn zero points for that spending while the Bilt card earns up to 100000 points per year. Bilt will earn more points for most than Autograph will .

An Autograph point can be cashed out at a penny apiece. In contrast I’ve valued Bilt points at 1.7 cents each (others like The Points Guy use a higher value) thanks to Bilt’s valuable transfer partners like American AAdvantage United MileagePlus World of Hyatt and more. I still can get 8 to 10 cents per point or more in value against the retail cost of a ticket when redeeming transferred points for international business class travel and I use Hyatt points on especially expensive hotel nights and for the kind of suites you won’t be getting with points off a cash back card that earns 1% on much of your spend. Bilt also offers spending points through their travel portal at 1.25 cents apiece which while not how I prefer to use points is still 25% more value than straight 1% redemption value. Bilt’s points are worth more than Autograph’s.

At the end of the day Wells has a card that earns points in a category no one else can match (rent) that’s the biggest expense item for most customers who spend in the category. Each of their points is far more flexible and worth more. And somehow it’s the Autograph card Wells Fargo is spending money to shout from the rooftops as their best points card ever. What could possibly be going on here?

Big bank marketing claims go through extensive legal review. This isn’t a claim Wells Fargo is making lightly but I’m trying mightily to make sense of it. I’m confident they’re well-meaning here but that makes this even more of a mystery.

Wells Fargo has one of the best most innovative products that’s been introduced in the last year in the Bilt Mastercard. That’s a real coup for Wells because until now the bank hasn’t been a player or even competitive in the ‘points’ space.

Maybe it’s just so new to them (their launch party was just in March) that their executives don’t actually realize what they have? Perhaps marketing and legal just don’t know they have a much better card than the one they’re promoting as their best?

Regardless of the reason the consequence is the same: Wells Fargo is advertising in a way that points customers in the wrong direction that will earn many consumers fewer points and deliver less value. And that’s not something Wells Fargo wants to do as it builds its reputation in consumer cards.

Wells already has the very best no annual fee consumer points card offered by any bank in their portfolio. Think of it as Chase Sapphire Preferred but without the annual fee and better transfer partners too – that earns points on rent at no charge but doesn’t offer a signup bonus. Too bad the card is a well-kept secret even inside their own bank!",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMidGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lmd1bGYtdGltZXMuY29tL3N0b3J5LzcyMTE2OS9xaWliLWxhdW5jaGVzLXVucHJlY2VkZW50ZWQtb2ZmZXItZm9yLW1hc3RlcmNhcmQtcGxhdGludW0tY3JlZGl0LWNhcmRob2xkZXJz0gF4aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ3VsZi10aW1lcy5jb20vc3RvcnkvNzIxMTY5L3FpaWItbGF1bmNoZXMtdW5wcmVjZWRlbnRlZC1vZmZlci1mb3ItbWFzdGVyY2FyZC1wbGF0aW51bS1jcmVkaXQtY2FyZGhvbGRlcnMvYW1w?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,QIIB launches 'unprecedented' offer for Mastercard Platinum credit cardholders| Gulf Times,"

Any alternative?,"""Life-saving"" virtual dollar cards in Nigeria has come under attack as leading provider pulls plug. What could make them pull the plug and what are the alternatives for consumers and fintechs alike?

Barter popularly known for its virtual dollar card service announced on Friday July 15 2022 that it was shutting down its virtual card service.

Barter by Flutterwave was the first of many Nigerian fintechs to break the hearts of fintech-savvy Nigerians with the withdrawal of their virtual card service. According to an email Barter sent to users ""effective Sunday 17th July 2022 all our Virtual Dollar cards will be unavailable for any transactions and purchases."" It attributes this unavailability to ""an update from our card partner which will cause the card service to be unavailable for an extended period of time.""

When I saw the Barter announcement my first question was ""Who is this card partner?"" This is because one would expect an African payment giant like Flutterwave to be speaking directly to the card schemes as opposed to working through a card-issuing company to issue Mastercard.

💳 Mastercard is/was an early investor in Flutterwave . They co-led the startup's Series A Extension round that was announced in October 2018. Likewise Visa. In fact the former Chairman and CEO of Visa Joe Saunders was on Flutterwave's Board.

Flutterwave used to issue Visa cards until they switched to Mastercard. Startups who had previously issued virtual Visa dollar cards provided by Barter tell me that it wasn't reliable enough. Hence why they switched to Union54. Even Flutterwave now ""partners"" (AKA use) with Union54 (for Barter).

Who is Union54?

Union54 is the Zambian startup making it seamless reliable and rewarding to issue virtual dollar cards in Africa.

🌍 The '54' in Union54 mimics the number of countries in Africa.

Union54 was officially founded in 2021 by an entrepreneurial couple Perseus Mlambo and Alessandra Martini. Perseus and his wife have been building digital financial services since 2015 when they launched Zazu Africa. Zazu is a neobank and thus needed to issue debit cards to allow its users to spend their money anywhere. But it just wasn't working owing to sponsor bank delays in issuing those cards—""at one point they had to wait for 18 months"" Perseus told Tage of TechCrunch.

As a fix they decided to go direct to Mastercard. They succeeded and became a Mastercard Principle member—allowing them to issue and acquire card transactions. Their decision at Zazu to make this issuing capability available to other African fintechs is what birthed Union54.

The work Perseus and Alessandra are doing is so crucial to the African continent especially Nigeria where there are restrictions on international commerce. But also in Zambia their home country where only about 10% of the adult population has a debit card. Hence financially excluded from participating in the global economy.

Little wonder that in less than a year Union54 raised a $15.1 million Seed from investors all over the world including Tiger Global and Nigerian neobank founder Babs Ogundeyi of Kuda Bank. They are also the first Zambian startup to get into Y Combinator the leading global accelerator.

With Union54's APIs fintechs are able to issue debit cards without worrying about all the complexities of the card business. Union54 takes care of the required Bank sponsorship needed to work with the selected Card scheme (Mastercard in this case). They also facilitate transaction processing and settlement.

As of October 2021 Union54 said more than 50 companies are currently in its API sandbox environment. Four of them—Flutterwave PayDay Plumter and Bitmama— were live. Union54's clientele includes existing startups and new startups ""founded on the basis of Union54’s availability"" Perseus boasts without mincing words. He is not wrong. Startups that offer one debit card for all your bank accounts would fall neatly into this bucket that Perseus describes as being founded on Union54's availability.

Similarly we project that Union54's clientele would have more than quadrupled in the last six months. This growth we believe to be driven by organic marketing—earned media and word of mouth referral—due to the novelty of its solution timing the prevailing consumer need and additional revenue line. On revenue Union54 is the ""only company in Africa that would give you [fintechs] the interchange.” Interchange fees typically accrue to issuers and processors which would be Union54 in this case. But TechCrunch reports that customers of Union54 (the fintechs that on-issue cards through them) earn 1% on each card transaction carried out by the cardholder.

Union54 has also invested in a couple of African infrastructural and cross-border payment startups we know.

The current virtual dollar card outage reported by tens of fintechs in Nigeria is believed to be due to Union54's downtime.

Union54's message to its Partners on its virtual cards' downtime

Dear Partners;

Despite our best efforts on 18th July cards will stop working. We have a number of upgrades and work streams we will be implementing which might take us ~ 6 weeks before we can resume service again.

As a reminder you can defund cards and process float funds via: https://docs.union54.technology/docs/float-refunds. Please make sure to defund all cards by 17th July 2022 in order for us to effect a bank transfer of any remaining floating float funds on the 20th July.

We had hoped to avoid this hiatus but it had proved impossible to do so. As such please accept our apologies for the impact on your business and know that we will back with a stronger and more resilient product.

For the purpose of clarity: new card issuance and transaction processing will stop on the 18th July. All issued cards will not work during this hiatus.

Onwards and upwards.

So why exactly is Union54 down and for how long?

No one knows the exact cause of the downtime—not even the founders of startups using Union54. I'm in three founder-focused groups and I've chatted directly to some of the founders of startups that have publicly come out to announce their virtual dollar card downtime.

Regarding how long Union54's card-issuing offering would be down I estimate six to ten weeks. One affected founder told me ""we'd be back up in six weeks"" via private message. Another founder said ""Probably 7 ish weeks"". So I've added an additional three weeks to account for any uncertainties.

A recurring theme I have heard from speaking with founders is that Union54 is trying to resolve some issues with Mastercard. But that the founders don't know the details of those issues.

What could these issues be? And could it be similar to some of the issues that Flutterwave might have faced some years back with Visa?

A major issue many acquiring players in the Card value chain face is a high rate of chargebacks and fraud. A chargeback is a dispute raised by a customer when they didn't get value for a transaction. Fraud occurs when someone tries to use a Card that they are not authorised to use to authenticate a transaction. The fraudulent use of a chargeback is when customers try to secure refunds even when they got value. So they reach out to the issuer/bank to initiate the chargeback process.

With chargeback processing there are strict resolution timelines otherwise the customer will get their value back ""System accept"". Card schemes have a low tolerance for high volumes of chargebacks filed through an acquirer. Thus many acquirers are willing to turn off merchants on their platform till they can get their processes in order.

Regarding Union54 it's possible that end users of their issued cards are using it to perpetrate fraud on other payment gateways and that's raising a recurring flag with their card scheme Mastercard. So Union54 might be taking a step back to build better chargeback reconciliation and settlement processes.

On the other hand the commercialisation of the card-issuing offering from Union54 might not suffice for their relationship with Mastercard. So two things to note here. Before now Mastercard didn't offer any direct licence to digital-first players partly cause those players couldn't afford Mastercard's quarterly fees (which are in dollars). Banks act as both BIN sponsors and settlement partners to facilitate card issuing and transaction settlement respectively. But Union54's offering makes them a non-bank issuer with the expected backing of a Bank.

Operating in the card space is hard and more than ever consumers are demanding ways to spend their money globally. In the meantime customers can do three things:

request foreign domiciliary accounts from their local banks.

continue to seek alternative consumer fintechs offering virtual dollar cards. For example Sudo Africa Chipper Cash Mono and Changera virtual dollars card offerings. More examples are contained in the link above.

and virtual dollars card offerings. More examples are contained in the link above. seek alternatives that allow above the $20 international spending limit on naira cards. I don't know why but gomoney reviewed my naira card spending limit to $100. So maybe try them.

Consumer fintechs like—Barter Eversend GetEquity PayDay Vesti Busha—who have publicly announced the shut down of their virtual dollar card service will now look to other providers for this solution. Doesn't seem like there is any readily available. Perhaps we are all doomed to check back in two months.

Union54 is pausing for a ""necessary compliance audit""

On Monday (July 18 2o22) Union54's CEO Perseus Mlambo tweeted a screenshot of an internal Slack message stating that ""the pause on service is part of a necessary compliance audit"" which will take place within two weeks.

The loss meant India finished their outing at the fourth and last position in Group D. Only the top team from each group progressed to the quarter-finals while the second and third placed nations advanced to the playoffs.

This was India’s third straight defeat in the competition having earlier lost to New Zealand (100-47) and the Philippines (101-59).

The match against world No. 54 Lebanon started off on a dismal note for India as they were down 18-4 within the first four minutes

Ranked 82 in the world India failed to provide any resistance to the surging Lebanon team and further slumped to 57-23 before half-time.

The match ended 104-63 in Lebanon’s favour putting an end to India’s dismal campaign at the continental showpiece.

Muin Bek Hafeez and Pratyanshu Tomar were the top scorers for India in the match with each of them scoring 11 points. Amritpal Singh was the next best with 10 points.

Lebanon on the other hand were aided by Yousef Khayat’s 15 points and Jonathan Alredge’s 14.

The Philippines ranked 34th in the world started on the front foot as expected against an Indian basketball team ranked 48 places below them.

India’s Pranav Prince dunked to get the scoreboard rolling but the Philippines soon took over the reins and raced to a 13-8 lead. Some great work by Muin Bek Hafeez helped India draw level at 13-13 but it was the last time the Indian team found itself on level terms with their opponents throughout the duration of the match.

With Thirdy Ravena leading the offensive the Philippines ended the first quarter with a seven-point lead before extending it to 18 before half-time as the score read 53-38.

India missing captain Vishesh Bhriguvanshi through an injury failed to mount any sort of resistance in the second half as they kept leaking points. The game ended 101-59 in the Philippines’ favour an olympics.com report said.

India’s final Group D match will be against world No 54 Lebanon on Sunday. The top team from the group will advance to the quarterfinals while the second and third-placed nations will compete in the playoffs for a second chance at making the final eight.

Those connections range from colleagues to boards to corporate investments with additional ties to notorious surveillance systems and an internal monitoring project at McCormick’s firm—the legendary hedge fund Bridgewater Associates—that was directly modeled after the Chinese Communist Party’s autocratic surveillance state.

And in the mind of Trump who is McCormick’s most crucial political ally some of those ties would be about as problematic as a MAGA Republican can get—such as for instance former FBI Director James Comey.

Comey it turns out accepted a senior role at Bridgewater the year after McCormick signed on as the fund’s president. As general counsel Comey oversaw an internal security program whose invasive and sometimes demeaning methods of surveillance and interrogation earned him a reputation as Bridgewater’s “in-house inquisitor.”

Aside from Comey the most prominent of McCormick’s “deep state” affiliations is his recent three-year run as a paid trustee of the secretive government-backed investment group In-Q-Tel—quite literally the Central Intelligence Agency’s very own venture capital firm.

McCormick’s role at In-Q-Tel appears on his candidate financial disclosures where he listed the entity’s name as “IQT.” Tax filings from In-Q-Tel which is registered with the Internal Revenue Service as a nonprofit show that McCormick joined as a trustee in March 2018 and left in 2022 as he pursued his first Senate campaign. He collected an annual $35000 salary logging five hours of work a week according to the tax records and his election bid has since seen hundreds of thousands of dollars in support from executives tied to IQT and its investments.

For McCormick his deep state connections embody the larger political contradictions he’s already been forced to reconcile as a corporate Republican seeking office in the quasi-populist era of Trump.

That tortured balancing act failed two years ago. In the 2022 GOP primary in Pennsylvania the lifelong moderate failed to land Trump’s endorsement—losing that honor and subsequently the GOP primary to Mehmet Oz.

While McCormick got the coveted Trump endorsement this year—though there weren’t any other viable Republicans running in the primary—the dissonance is starker than ever.

Today the MAGA wing of the Republican Party finds itself fully enthralled with conspiracy theories about the intelligence community which Trump and his allies have for years cast as public enemy No. 1. Trump is vowing retribution as a key 2024 campaign plank.

Given that McCormick’s challenge to Sen. Bob Casey (D-PA) will be one of the most contentious races of the 2024 cycle the hedge funder turned true MAGA believer may have to work harder than expected to scrub his deep establishment ties in order to appeal to his new base.

A former colleague of McCormick’s at Bridgewater told The Daily Beast that McCormick was “an honorable man” a “stand-up guy” and an “independent” and “brilliant leader.” But the colleague also put his finger on the Trump issue calling it a “sad reality” that McCormick will have to cave to the whims of the former president.

“He knows that if he wins he won’t get to do what he thinks is right” the person said. “He has his own money and he won’t be so susceptible to outside pressures financially. But he’s still going to have to kiss the ring and that’s unfortunate.”

McCormick’s campaign did not respond to detailed questions for this article.

It’s not clear if Trump knew about McCormick’s work with the U.S. intelligence community including the CIA and Comey. But as it turns out the deep state overlaps in myriad ways with McCormick’s 13-year tenure as a top executive at Bridgewater.

In 2010—the year after McCormick left George W. Bush’s Treasury Department to sign on as Bridgewater’s president—Bridgewater hired Comey who would later come to embody the darkest of Trump’s paranoiac accusations about federal agents.

Bridgewater brought Comey on officially as head of security and general counsel. In practice however Comey’s role more closely resembled that of an “in-house inquisitor” over the first iteration of the firm’s oppressive internal employee monitoring program which would later come to be called “The Politburo.”

Before he led the FBI unleashed a bombshell on Hillary Clinton in the 2016 campaign and got fired by Trump Comey reportedly raked in $7 million per year at Bridgewater. His task was to keep employees in line with the goals of what firm founder Ray Dalio called “radical transparency.” Those efforts included constant surveillance—including recorded meetings and videotaped internal “trials” of employees—with Dalio telling Bridgewater staff that Comey was “like a godfather adjudicating it all.”

The taped meetings were “just the tip of the surveillance ecosystem” at Bridgewater Vanity Fair reported in its profile of Comey’s time with the firm.

“A slew of ex FBI agents staffed the security team. Not only did cameras cover seemingly every inch of the property but they seemed to be watched in real time. Staffers who left their desks even briefly would return to sticky notes left on their computer monitors admonishing them for failing to put up a screen saver” Vanity Fair reported.

Comey would go through employee cellphone and computer records and was apparently so intrusive that he embarrassed one executive into resigning.

But when Comey’s security posse only turned up “little evidence of actual offending behavior to snuff out they created their own” according to Vanity Fair.

In one instance the report said Comey left an executive’s binder clearly labeled and unattended in Bridgewater offices. He then watched as surveillance cameras captured a low-ranking employee discovering the binder and going through it. Comey put the employee on trial and fired him with the approval of Dalio.

Comey however eventually found himself repelled by Dalio’s extremes resigning after two years. (This month Comey happens to be publishing a murder mystery novel that takes place inside a fictionalized version of Bridgewater.)

Dalio however only ramped things up implementing more and more intrusive policies to fully enact his “radical transparency” dogma.

That program it turns out was literally modeled on the Chinese Communist Party’s social surveillance program which Dalio openly admired. He even named the project after the CCP’s own “Politburo” and compared it favorably to “Big Brother” in a 60 Minutes interview.

China of course is another area where McCormick is against the prevailing GOP winds as Bridgewater’s internal culture “reflects aspects of Chinese political ideology” and invested heavily in the region—after McCormick took over as co-CEO in 2017 the fund’s Chinese investments skyrocketed.

The “Politburo” staffed up with officials from the National Security Agency and the CIA. But Bridgewater workers found it “intimidating” and “humiliating” and so intrusive that in 2017 one whistleblower filed a human rights complaint with the state of Connecticut where the fund is headquartered which was covered at the time in The New York Times.

As detailed in a recent book about Dalio titled The Fund the Politburo essentially pitted its employees against each other assigning roles like “auditors” and “overseers” and recording practically every moment of activity—all in pursuit of Dalio’s core “radical transparency” philosophy.

While the system repelled many employees—including Comey and one-time CEO Jon Rubinstein who both left after disagreements with Dalio—McCormick stayed aboard got a promotion and publicly defended Dalio’s “radical transparency.”

Rubinstein quit after a “firing squad” meeting that McCormick personally sat in on according to the book where Rubinstein made the case that Dalio’s increasingly authoritarian policies were creating a “climate of fear.” When McCormick one of a handful of senior executives in the room was personally asked if he agreed with Rubinstein’s take he said he did not according to the book.

McCormick has subsequently defended Dalio. In 2020 when McCormick was asked if he took issue with a fundamental contradiction at the core of the monitoring program—“radical transparency” within the company but kept secret from outside scrutiny—he replied that he “doesn’t think it’s inconsistent at all.”

“Ray has always said this: Radical transparency is not total transparency. There are certain things that we’re not transparent about and consciously so. Personnel and salary discussions for example” McCormick said.

Shortly after rising to co-CEO McCormick joined the board at IQT.

The venture capital nonprofit which former CIA Director George Tenet founded in 1999 has funneled hundreds of millions of dollars in public funds to hundreds of technology firms and startups some of which are still secret.

Today IQT oversees more than $1 billion in assets and even has its own special-purpose acquisition company. Though the group keeps a low profile IQT maintains a close relationship with government intelligence and security divisions and runs “almost all investment decisions” by the CIA.

Many IQT investments seek to cultivate the private development of surveillance technology that could one day benefit the intelligence community and some of them overlap with both Bridgewater and McCormick.

One of those companies is Palantir a tech firm closely tied to right-wing financier Peter Thiel whose sprawling government work has made it a lightning rod for civil rights controversy—and whose fate was “rescued” by IQT’s investment.

Bridgewater itself helped fund Palantir and incorporated Palantir technology to advance its own investments as well as to help monitor Bridgewater employees in the fund’s pursuit of Dalio’s “radical transparency.”

Palantir executives have contributed thousands of dollars to McCormick’s 2024 campaign.

Additionally one of IQT’s current trustees Howard Fox who also served on the board with McCormick has put serious money—more than $150000—behind McCormick’s candidacy in both 2022 and this cycle.

The same is true of other McCormick supporters like the CEO of Tenable an IQT-backed tech firm which announced its public stock offering shortly after McCormick joined the board.

And while it’s true that McCormick brings his own money to the table that hasn’t stopped Bridgewater donors from chipping in. In all Bridgewater employees mostly executives have contributed about $100000 to McCormick’s political aspirations with current president Kyle Delaney throwing $50000 to a 2022 super PAC backing his old colleague.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiS2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmF4aW9zLmNvbS8yMDI0LzA1LzA4L21jY29ybWljay1wYWMtYWQtcGVubnN5bHZhbmlhLXNlbmF0ZS1jYXNledIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Scoop: McCormick PAC launches big ad buy in Pennsylvania Senate race,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.axios.com/2024/05/08/mccormick-pac-ad-pennsylvania-senate-casey on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiS2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmF4aW9zLmNvbS8yMDI0LzA1LzA4L21jY29ybWljay1wYWMtYWQtcGVubnN5bHZhbmlhLXNlbmF0ZS1jYXNledIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiMGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1vcmdhbmZoLm5ldC9vYml0dWFyeS9qb3NoLW1jY29ybWlja9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Obituary | Josh McCormick of Huntington West Virginia,"LEWISBURG WV - Joshua Howard McCormick 38 of Huntington WV formerly of Lewisburg WV passed away May 3 2024 at home.

Along with last year’s first-round selection of tackle Broderick Jones and recent free-agent signings of starters James Daniels in 2022 and Isaac Seumalo in 2023 it seemed as though the job was complete. So when the Steelers were getting ready to make their fourth-round pick few were expecting it to be used on another offensive lineman.

Mason McCormick of South Dakota State would hear his name called with pick No. 119 and become the newest Steeler. Was this pick just meant to add depth or did the Steelers look past other obvious needs thinking they may have found a potential starter in McCormick? As a prospect McCormick was considered a versatile offensive lineman with the ability to play all five positions even though the 57 starts of his college career were spent exclusively at left guard. With the highest possible picks being used to select both tackles and a center over the past two drafts it would appear that McCormick’s fastest (only?) path to playing time is at guard. McCormick is most likely pushing someone off of the roster. Who might that be?

The Steelers rebuild their offensive line

In May of 2022 Omar Khan was named general manager of the Steelers and Andy Weidl was hired for the assistant GM job. Weidl has largely been credited with the push to rebuild the offensive line. Since their hiring Khan and Weidl have replaced every offensive lineman they inherited except left tackle Dan Moore and Daniels. Using back-to-back first-round picks on college left tackles demonstrates their desire to upgrade from Moore. In their first go-around at free agency they spent money on guards Seumalo and Nate Herbig. Both started their careers with the Eagles when Weidl was in the player personnel department in Philadelphia. Things looked solid with Daniels Seumalo and Herbig giving the Steelers three veteran players to man the two guard spots.

Just a month after spending that money the Steelers would use 4 of their 30 allowed pre-draft visits to meet with more guards. At the 2022 draft they would use a seventh-round pick on Spencer Anderson. Anderson like McCormick was touted to have the versatility to potentially play all five positions. He would make the final 53-man roster as a depth player on the interior as the Steelers had four players (Moore Jones Chuks Okorafor and Dylan Cook) make it specifically as tackles.

It doesn’t make enough sense to use a fourth-round pick on McCormick simply for more interior depth with Seumalo Daniels Herbig and Anderson already on the roster. It’s highly unlikely that the Steelers would keep all five. At tackle Moore is the only one with a season’s worth of experience. Jones and Fautanu are locks to make the final 53. Cook lacks experience and versatility but would the Steelers use a fourth-round pick just to replace the fourth tackle when Anderson already supplies that same ability?

Related Pittsburgh Steelers select Washington OT Troy Fautanu with 20th overall pick in 2024 NFL Draft

McCormick is most likely pushing someone off of the roster. Cook Herbig and Daniels are in the final years of their contracts but Daniels is the only one who wasn’t hand-picked by Khan and Weidl. Moving Daniels would create an additional $8.25 million in 2024 cap space. If the Steelers are happy with their alternatives it would make sense to include Daniels in a trade before the start of the season and it would make more sense out of drafting McCormick instead of addressing other needs.

By the end of training camp don’t be surprised if Daniels has a new home elsewhere. Even though it was against FCS competition don’t be shocked if McCormick’s 57 starts at guard are the reason why."

Philiou an Ohio-based franchise owner kept the payroll rolling for the 90 crew members who work at his Mayfield Heights location which is stationed in the east-side suburb of Cleveland.

The restaurant closed its doors on March 28 — and did not reopen again until July 6.

“It was not a hard decision for me” Philiou told Fox Business in a phone interview.

“I’ve been in their shoes” he continued.

“I knew what it would be if they didn’t have a check on a weekly basis.”

Philiou who is 90 years old now immigrated to the U.S. from Greece as a child.

He enlisted in the U.S. Army serving as an infantryman during the Korean War.

He began his career at McDonald’s in 1962 at the very same Mayfield Heights location he owns today.

Philiou’s starting role was as a part-time fry cook gig.

He took the role on while he also worked full-time at the TRW Valve Division plant — an automotive and aerospace parts manufacturer in Cleveland. It has since been acquired.

The proud Army veteran stuck with the fast-food company for 15 years. He took ownership of the Mayfield Heights restaurant in 1977.

“I started from the ground level up” Philiou said. “It’s been a great venture for me and [for] many people that I’ve had the opportunity to work with and learn from.”

Philiou went on to own and operate a few McDonald’s franchise locations in the area; but after more than four decades he’s put his focus on one.

He co-owns the Mayfield Heights location with his daughter and son-in-law Mary and John Powers.

The location underwent remodeling in late March. The project consumed the better part of over three months.

“We needed to get it up to par both facility- and equipment-wise and also [make it] a better place for the employees to be working” Philiou told Fox Business.

“I’m very proud of the store right now. And people feel very proud working in this beautiful store that we just finished.”

Philiou said he currently has about 94 employees who work various shifts part-time.

He’s hoping to grow the team to 105 people.

“Our employees are extremely grateful” Philiou said. “As for the community here which I’m blessed to be working with they’ve been very supportive of us.”

He continued “They also appreciate what we have done to build a brand new store and what we have done as far as for the employees to be paid throughout the process.”

While Philiou couldn’t reveal exactly how much he spent to keep the payroll running he said the Mayfield Heights location will “need to sell a lot of cheeseburgers to make it up.”

But he’s confident they’ll achieve that with the community’s support.

“I’m blessed to be able to do this” Philiou said.

Tiffanie Boyd senior vice president and chief people officer at McDonald’s USA told Fox Business that they’re proud to have Philiou on their team.

“I’m so inspired by Tony’s commitment to his employees and all the meaningful ways he’s recognized them over the years — from encouraging team bonding with regular pizza parties to bigger gestures like offering tuition assistance and paying employees during restaurant renovations” Boyd explained to Fox Business in an email.

She continued “It’s stories like his that have inspired us to celebrate even more crew who step up for our customers every day with our ‘Thank You Crew’ initiative where owners and operators nationwide are finding special ways to thank their crew and managers.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMia2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNic25ld3MuY29tL2xvc2FuZ2VsZXMvbmV3cy9tYW4tc2hvdC1pbi1ib3RoLXNob3VsZGVycy1hZnRlci1hcmd1bWVudC1hdC1tY2RvbmFsZHMtaW4td2hpdHRpZXIv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Man shot in both shoulders after argument at McDonald's in Whittier,"A man was shot in both shoulders following an argument with a pair of suspects at a McDonald's on Saturday.

According to police the shooting was preceded by an altercation between the victim and two other men. He was shot in both shoulders before the pair of suspects fled from the scene on foot.

He was rushed to a nearby hospital for treatment on the gunshot wounds both of which were considered to be non-life-threatening.

Ayrshire Live previously flagged up issues with the service at the town’s Lloyds Pharmacies.

Now MSP for Carrick Cumnock and Doon Valley Elena Whitham has written to the firm’s parent company to highlight growing waits meds going missing and long queues outside the pharmacies.

Ms Whitham said the roll-out of the new service has experienced ‘continued problems’ and she wants it reckoned with — and improved.

In her letter to McKesson UK her second correspondence to the firm in three months she said: “I understand that the rollout of a problematic IT system by Lloyds has resulted in an unacceptable level of service within the local branches which has resulted in issues with repeat prescriptions going missing long waits for prescriptions and queues of people having to wait outside for long periods of time.

“Local store staff are working hard but it is my belief that they are being let down by management that are failing to properly resource the pharmacy which is further compounded by the issues with the new IT systems.”

She added: “I have requested an urgent meeting with Lloyd’s parent company to seek assurances that they have a plan in place to return service levels to an acceptable level as soon as possible.”

Last month Ayrshire Live told how Rab Wilson a leading figure in the campaign group Action for Safe and Accountable People’s NHS (ASAP) was forced to make five different trips to a Lloyds Pharmacy after there were delays to his repeat prescription.

At the time he said the new system was “not good enough” and warned the current issues could have “life threatening consequences” to those who rely on their weekly medication.

Mr Wilson received a response from Lloyds Pharmacy owners McKesson UK saying they were “truly sorry” to learn of his problems and said they would pass the matter on to their Customer Experience Team for further investigation.

There are two Lloyds Pharmacies in Cumnock and one in Auchinleck.

A Lloyds Pharmacy spokesperson said: ""Due to staff shortages in recent weeks our Lloyds Pharmacy in Cumnock has been operating temporary reduced hours. We would like to apologise to our customers and patients for any inconvenience this may have caused.

""These challenges have been caused by an outbreak of Covid-19 resulting in a significant number of our workforce having to self-isolate. In the absence of a full-time pharmacist and other members of staff we use locums to support provide. Unfortunately this difficult situation has been compounded by the recent installation of new IT systems.

""Our priority is always to ensure that the community we serve can access the care they need so in the event of a closure we signpost customers to alternative pharmacies in the area.

""We apologise for the impact on the community and appreciate their patience at this time.”

(Reuters) - Merck said on Thursday its therapy being tested in certain patients with a type of cancer in the uterus lining failed a late-stage trial.

The drugmaker's Keytruda therapy in combination with chemotherapy was being evaluated in about 1095 patients with high-risk endometrial cancer after surgery.

The trial did not meet the main goal of disease-free survival which is the length of time after primary treatment for a cancer ends that the patient survives without any signs or its symptoms.

The study's other main goal of overall survival was not formally tested since the trial failed in showing significant disease-free survival.

Endometrial cancer begins in the inner lining of the uterus or endometrium and is the most common type of the disease affecting the organ.

Merck's Keytruda belongs to a class of medicines called PD-1 inhibitors that work by increasing the ability of the body's immune system to detect and fight tumor cells.

Keytruda is currently approved in the United States for two indications in endometrial cancer one of which is treated using it as a combination therapy with partner Eisai's drug Lenvima.

Endometrial cancer leads to more than 13000 deaths in a year in the U.S. according to government data.

The need-to-know this morning

Pfizer appointed Andrew Baum as its new chief strategy and innovation officer. Baum joins Pfizer from the investment bank Citi where he served as head of global healthcare research. He is joining Pfizer’s executive committee and will report to Chairman and CEO Albert Bourla.

In a mid-stage study EyePoint Pharmaceuticals said its eye drug Duravyu failed to improve disease control compared to a sham injection in patients with non-proliferative diabetic retinopathy.

A deep dive into Amgen’s experimental obesity drug MariTide

There so much buzz around Amgen’s experimental obesity drug MariTide. The company simply saying it was “very encouraged” about interim Phase 2 data led to a 12% spike in Amgen’s stock — even though no new data were shared. STAT’s Elaine Chen answers some hot questions about the closely watched injectable.

Early data show MariTide a monoclonal antibody drug could potentially offer more profound weight loss than other treatments on the market. But it’s already difficult to manufacture peptide drugs like Wegovy and Zepbound — and antibodies are more complex molecules.

Although Novo and Lilly’s stocked dropped a little on Friday the companies are dominating the space and it’d be hard for competitors to catch up. The two companies are also developing next-generation candidates that are further ahead than MariTide. So even if other companies have strong contenders in the obesity space they’d be years away from an FDA approval and “so far behind [Novo and Lilly] that it’s still going to probably be hard to see how they catch up” one analyst said.

Studying stem cells and cancer in low Earth orbit

Turns out the microgravity of low Earth orbit allows scientists to study cancer growth at an accelerated clip. Catriona Jamieson of UCSD’s Sanford Stem Cell Institute is working with NASA to send tumors and stem cells into space — ferried aboard SpaceX and Axiom-3 flights to the International Space Station. STAT’s Nicholas St. Fleur chatted with Jamieson about why aging and oncology could potentially be better understood so far away from our planet.

She was inspired by a 2019 NASA study that showed that after 340 days in space astronaut Scott Kelly came back 2 inches taller than his earthbound twin.

“But then I noticed he had inversions and translocations in his chromosomes. His chromosomes were kind of mixed up in the immune cells which can happen if you have preleukemic conditions developing in your blood so that doesn’t look good” she said. “I thought maybe space is a way to understand stem cell aging when it starts to be premalignant and fully malignant but in an abbreviated time frame.”

Former Spark CTO suing for alleged discrimination

The former chief technical officer of Spark Therapeutics alleges she experienced discrimination and sexism while working there the Philadelphia Business Journal writes. Cynthia Pussinen led nearly 400 employees in Spark’s technical development and operations unit from February 2021 to December 2022.

Pussinen said she faced “repeated and ongoing acts and practices of sex discrimination by some of her male peers and colleagues most notably by Federico Mingozzi” who was the company’s chief scientific officer before leaving this past November. The lawsuit said that CEO Ron Philip allegedly told Pussinen in March 2022 that he was aware of Mingozzi’s “mistreatment” of women. But instead of sanctioning him she alleges Philip told her to “make it work” because everyone but Mingozzi is “expendable” and that “we need him more than he needs us.”

Pussinen who is now CEO of a small regenerative medicine company called Sernova is seeking unspecified economic damages along with compensatory damages for pain and suffering and emotional distress.

Merck may have a competition for ever-scarce BCG

There’s long been a global shortage of the BCG vaccine which has long been used to treat bladder cancer. This may change as FiercePharma points out. A couple of weeks back ImmunityBio won FDA approval for Anktiva an immunotherapy that’s meant to be used along with the BCG vaccine to treat patients with bladder cancer. Now ImmunityBio has partnered with the Serum Institute of India to manufacture BCG globally.

ImmunityBio framed it in a press release as “a long-term solution to chronic BCG supply shortage issues” and intends to produce the treatment “at large scale” so it can be used in combination with Anktiva. Merck has been the only U.S. purveyor of BCG since 2012 after Sanofi and another competitor bowed out due to manufacturing issues. In 2020 Merck laid out plans to boost BCG production but that will likely not come to fruition until at least next year. It’s been rationing BCG since 2019.

Notably an oncolytic virus-based therapeutic made by CG Oncology showed a complete response in about 75% of patients with late-stage bladder cancer new Phase 3 data show. If approved the drug could be used without the aid of BCG.

Unity Software (U -1.78%) was one of those companies that investors pushed to new heights on the back of the metaverse hype created by Facebook when it announced its name change to Meta Platforms (META -0.45%) at the end of October 2021. However it wasn't long before Unity began facing the brutal nature of reality and the stock plunged over 80% from its highs. As a result some investors might now wonder whether Unity can bounce back from its recent market misfortunes.

Here are two reasons Unity's stock could face a tough uphill climb.

1. The Operate Solutions division stumbled

While Unity is best known as a development platform for creating 3D and virtual content the company generates 64% of its revenue through Unity's Operate Solutions division which helps game creators monetize content through Unity Ads and in-app purchases.

Operate Solutions had a strong January start but stumbled in February and March as revenues fell significantly. Further Chief Executive Officer John Riccitiello said during the company's earnings call that the company narrowed down Operate's problems to two self-inflicted issues.

First Unity identified a fault in its platform that reduced the accuracy of its Audience Pinpointer tool -- an ad tool that became popular after Apple's privacy changes. Audience Pinpointer uses machine learning (ML) to help game developers target the users most likely to continue playing a game after installation.

Unity noticed the problem with Audience Pinpointer only after it started generating less revenue. Game creators often measure the effectiveness of their ad campaigns and when the usefulness of Audience Pinpointer fell off because an unspecified glitch the creators stopped using it and revenues dropped.

Second Unity's ML algorithm ingested some bad data from a large customer. Consequently Unity lost the value of a portion of its training data.

As a result of the two issues management estimated an impact on its business of $110 million in 2022 or almost 8% of Unity's full-year 2022 expected revenues of $1.4 billion.

News of Audience Pinpointer's poor performance was first announced on May 10 prompting a 33% stock selloff. And while management promised the issue would not carry over into 2023 investors should be wary of fully trusting Unity's management team as Audience Pinpointer's problems could be a symptom of more significant issues within the company.

2. Unity was unprepared for a poor market environment

Since going public in September 2020 Unity has pursued revenue growth at the expense of profitability. To illustrate this chart shows Unity's operating costs rising faster than its revenues.

U Total Operating Expenses (TTM) data by YCharts

While pursuing growth in the face of rising unprofitability can be a winning strategy when interest rates are low it is a devastating strategy when the Federal Reserve is hiking interest rates.

Rising interest rates erode the value of future earnings -- which hurts unprofitable companies more than profitable companies. And Unity's bottom-line profitability in the form of net income has consistently worsened over the last two years.

U Net Income (TTM) data by YCharts

As you can see above Unity's price-to-sales ratio dropped off a cliff in late 2021 as investors were already mulling the impact of the Federal Reserve raising interest rates to rein in inflation.

Unity reverses course

While Unity might have been pushing for growth at all costs for the last two years it appears management recognizes the environment it is in and has quickly biased the company toward profitability over growth.

On the Q1 2022 earnings call Chief Financial Officer Luis Visoso said the company would reduce spending by $100 million to achieve profitability in the fourth quarter of 2022 -- sooner than previously communicated. And the company expects to be profitable for the full year of 2023.

However since the most significant portion of operating expenses is personnel-related costs Unity plans to achieve its $100 million in cost savings through layoffs. At the end of June Unity fired 4% of its workforce. And according to the website Kotaku the releases occurred several weeks after CEO Riccitiello assured workers that Unity wasn't in financial trouble and that there wouldn't be any layoffs -- a misleading statement that created employee discontent. In addition it doesn't help employee morale that Unity acquired ironSource (IS) whose tools help app developers make money off their creations only two weeks after the layoffs.

So while Unity has a very high upside in its end markets it also has a very high execution risk from the consequences of laying off employees while simultaneously acquiring another company. As a result most investors will probably be better off avoiding this stock.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiU2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnB5bW50cy5jb20vY3BpLXBvc3RzL2lsbHVtaW5hLXBheXMtdG8tc2V0dGxlLXllYXJzLWxvbmctcGF0ZW50LWJhdHRsZXMv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Illumina Pays To Settle Years-Long Patent Battles,"After spending the last 10-plus years in court Illumina and BGI Group have reached a $325 million settlement to resolve a number of patent and antitrust claims across the US centered around the companies’ DNA sequencing technology.

Illumina is forking over the $325 million to settle claims following two recent jury decisions in Delaware and California as well as an antitrust case in California according to a statement on Thursday from MGI Tech a BGI affiliate.

As part of the deal each party will drop any challenges to the California and Delaware jury decisions and Illumina gets a license to the family of patents that BGI asserted in Delaware.

In 2010 Illumina filed a complaint in California against Complete Genomics an MGI subsidiary alleging that the company infringed on three of its DNA sequencing patents with the latter company’s “Complete Genomics Analysis Platform.” In response Complete Genomics asserted that Illumina had “attempted to achieve monopoly power in genome sequencing technology.”

In a later Delaware case Complete Genomics accused Illumina of infringing on its own patents with “two-channel” sequencing systems kits to prepare DNA fragments for sequencing and kits to immobilize amplify and sequence fragments. The company also filed an anticompetitive suit against Illumina in Delaware last year.

Back in November a federal jury ruled that four of Illumina’s five patents in the California case were valid awarding it $8 million according to a Law360 report. But in May a Delaware jury decided that Illumina owes Complete Genomics more than $333 million for infringing on two patents court documents state.

This latest settlement should put an end to the storm of lawsuits — at least for a while. According to MGI’s statement:

“The parties also agree to a three-year period of peace with respect to claims of U.S. patent infringement and violations of any antitrust or unfair competition laws of the United States during which time they will not sue each other or respective customers in the United States or accrue liability for existing platforms.”

Together with an education startup Meta is bringing virtual campuses to U.S. universities. What does studying in virtual reality look like?

The pandemic has presented challenges for universities around the world. Students often had to get used to self-study from home or online courses via video conferencing. Not everyone found that easy.

That's why Morehouse College in Atlanta turned to an American startup specializing in immersive learning. Shortly thereafter the first virtual reality campus was created.

US start-up develops immersive education courses

US start-up VictoryXR has been working on educational software for virtual reality and augmented reality since 2016. Three years later students were able to dissect digital animals in VR for the first time with the Dissection Simulator. In a virtual classroom a hologram of a real science teacher guides students through the process which in real life is not for everyone's stomach.

VictoryXR has won the 2021 Pieoneer Award for digital innovation in learning. The XR startup's partners now include T-Mobile Qualcomm Microsoft and Meta. It was also Mark Zuckerberg's company Metaverse that made the Atlanta virtual campus possible in the first place.

Meta-sponsorship brings virtual campus to life

Morehouse College is one of ten higher education institutions in the U.S. sponsored by Meta. As part of the sponsorship project Meta is supporting each participating college with $500000 and VR headsets like the Meta Quest 2 as they use VictoryXR's immersive teaching tools.

Working with VictoryXR Morehouse faculty developed an immersive learning program in ten weeks. The college now offers courses in subjects such as inorganic chemistry biology and world history.

Like a real classroom but with a digital edge

VictoryXR CEO Steve Grubbs describes his virtual campus this way ""In a metaversity you are all together and you are in a classroom together where you can fist bump you can work on projects together you can break into small groups. A teacher can take a human heart out of a cadaver and hand it to another student. That is the bottom line. It is almost exactly like the brick-and-mortar classroom only better.""

Grubbs says health science courses and history classes would benefit the most from a VR experience. One of VictoryXR's simulations puts students in the courtroom of Harper Lee's novel ""To Kill a Mockingbird."" During the book discussion in class students sit in the virtual environment next to the jurors or in the judge's chair.

""You can understand the book from the perspective of those who sat in the courtroom"" Grubbs said. ""That’s what we are trying to achieve is an understanding that can only being gained by being there. Students get to go stand on the Great Wall of China they can go to Iceland and they can go to the Redwoods Forest once they are learning with our virtual reality.""

Who owns the data?

VR headsets can be used to obtain usage data that manufacturers can use for their research and other purposes. Meta could use the VR data to develop artificial intelligence further or to serve even more personalized advertising because behavior in VR reveals more about a person's character than just clicking on a website. So far a Facebook account is still required to get a Meta Quest 2 up and running.

The social media platform Facebook is considered extremely data-hungry. Data and privacy protectionists therefore criticize it time and again and see the use of Meta products by public institutions as problematic.

Even though the requirement to have a Facebook account will be dropped in August the VR system will continue to record environmental and motion data that can be used to create unique profiles of people.

Data remain the property of the universities

A U.S. college and university news magazine took a close look at contracts between VR headset manufacturers and teaching institutions. All the contracts stated that the universities retain ownership of all data generated as part of the partnerships.

The tour was originally supposed to happen in 2020 the same year The Weeknd released After Hours but COVID got in the way and in the time since then he blessed the entire country with his arsenal of hits during the 2021 Super Bowl Halftime Show and released another new album Dawn FM hence this tour being named the After Hours til Dawn tour as it supports both Dawn FM and After Hours. The two new albums (which are reportedly part of a planned trilogy) are two of his best and most widely acclaimed yet which makes this the perfect time for The Weeknd to enter the realm of stadium shows. On one hand he has a greatest hits’ worth of crowd pleasing singles dating back over a decade and on the other he’s fresh off releasing some of the best music of his career.

The Weeknd’s NYC-area stadium debut at MetLife Stadium on Saturday (7/16) was indeed a spectacle complete with a stage backdrop mimicking a city skyline a runway the length of the entire stadium floor with platforms in the middle and at the end a big suspended moon above the end platform pyro a laser light show ominous cloaked dancers and light-up wristbands that were handed out to the crowd but for the most part The Weeknd commanded the sold-out stadium crowd off the strength of his voice and songs alone. There were no other musicians in sight the dancers were more part of the overall aesthetic than stars of the show – Abel Tesfaye himself was the heart and soul of this concert. And for the most part that was all you needed. His setlist was impeccable with every hit you could think of choice cuts from his two newest albums and classic collabs like “Crew Love” with Drake “Low Life” with Future and “Or Nah” with Ty Dolla $ign.

From before he even took the stage to the moment the lights came back up around 10:40 (no encore) the crowd was eating it all up. Chants of “ABEL” echoed through the stadium before his set — the crowd was already hyped up due to opening DJ sets from Mike Dean and Kaytranada — and the entire crowd rose to their feet the second the lights went down just before his 9PM start time. The energy never lulled once throughout the night and almost everyone that was in earshot of me was dancing and singing to every song. Even the deeper cuts held just as much power as the chart-topping hits (of which he has quite a few). The Super Bowl already cemented him as a motherfuckin’ starboy but this was a triumphant reaffirmation.

What makes Dawn FM one of his best albums since his early game-changing mixtapes is that it reminds you that The Weeknd is at his best when he’s at his darkest and weirdest and the MetLife Stadium show reminded you of that too. This was stadium-sized crowdpleasing pop music but from his visuals to his backing tracks it was clear that this was dark pop music. (He also dropped the trailer for his new HBO show The Idol coming from “the sick and twisted minds” of Abel and Euphoria creator Sam Levinson before his set.) The Weeknd has become such a full-blown pop star that it’s almost hard to remember the days when he was a mysterious singer with a free online mixtape that the indie blogs were buzzing over but the After Hours til Dawn tour reminds you that he still is an enigma at heart… an enigma that sells out stadiums.

The Weeknd’s long-awaited After Hours Til Dawn Tour touched down at MetLife Stadium in East Rutherford New Jersey on Saturday (July 16) and it was likely a night the artist and his fans would never forget.

Over 70000 fans rocking their finest outfits and Weeknd-inspired merchandise packed MetLife Stadium buzzing with excitement as the moment they’ve been waiting two long years for was finally here. The wait for Abel Tesfaye’s tour began when the pandemic shut down his original After Hours arena tour in 2020 and again in 2021 so the anticipation was high and thankfully The Weeknd delivered.

The night opened with an early warm-up set from legendary engineer Mike Dean who provided an atmospheric soundscape for fans as they entered the stadium. Kaytranada took the reins shortly after but when it came time for the main event concertgoers filled MetLife Stadium with boisterous chants screaming out The Weeknd’s name to signal they were ready for the ride.

AD AD LOADING... AD

The Toronto megastar kicked off the show by performing “Alone Again” off After Hours as he popped up from one of the corroded buildings in the apocalyptic city skyline stage setup. From there the XO frontman kept his foot on the throttle with no breaks in between and had New Jersey New York City and the rest of the tristate area in the palm of his hands.

With 16 more shows left on the docket The Weeknd is off to a fiery start with this arena tour. Check out HipHopDX’s Top 5 moments from the night below.

No Doja Cat? No Problem: Kaytranada Holds Down Opening Set

DJ/record producer Kaytranada wasn’t on the bill initially. Doja Cat was supposed to perform but pulled out due to having tonsil surgery. The Weeknd had to call an audible and got Kaytra along with Mike Dean and Snoh Aalegra (on specific dates) to open the concert. Kaytranada rocked MetLife stadium with his trademark dance-tinged sound and had fans busting a move as they made their way to their seats.

Fans Approve The Weeknd’s Forthcoming HBOMax Show “The Idol”

The Weeknd announced he would launch a new show called The Idol in June 2021 on HBOMax. Euphoria mastermind Sam Levinson was tapped to work alongside Abel on the show however they hit a roadblock in April 2022 when Variety reported The Idol was going through a major overhaul. Thankfully the change wasn’t too significant as The Weeknd unleashed the teaser trailer for the show right before he took the stage at MetLife Stadium.

AD AD LOADING... AD

Fans were cheering at each scene of the trailer especially when The Weeknd popped up as his character. While no release date was announced fans were happy to see progress being made with the show.

The Weeknd Strikes Gold Again With Apocalyptic Stage Design

If there’s one thing The Weeknd cares about with his live shows it’s the stage design. Each tour he’s embarked on had a setup that was a sight to see and this tour is no different. The main stage showed an apocalyptic city skyline with various corroded buildings and a massive screen that added flames and other debris to the setup. The city’s design changed with each song adding even more visuals for fans to gaze over. At the other end of the stadium was a replica of the moon hanging from cables with a smaller stage under it.

AD AD LOADING... AD

If that wasn’t visually pleasing enough The Weeknd was accompanied by 22 women in red dresses and veils that covered their faces. The women moved around the stage and even had a routine during specific songs where they swayed their bodies and arms in unison.

Rainy Weather Added A Different Dynamic To The Weeknd’s Set

Artists having a show in an open-air stadium run the risk of rain putting a damper on things but it couldn’t have been better in The Weeknd’s case. In the middle of his set fans felt drops of rain falling on them which came as a surprise given the forecast predicted a calm night.

The rain got heavy at times but fans stayed put as they weren’t letting a downpour ruin their fun. At one point The Weeknd couldn’t believe it was raining and told fans “This is the best night of my life; look how beautiful this rain is man. You can’t even pay for this. I love you guys so much thank you.”

The Weeknd Receives Standing Ovation & Encore Chants From MetLife Faithful

After almost an hour and a half of nothing but hits fans sent The Weeknd off with cheers and a standing ovation fit for a superstar. He motioned to the crowd and gave his thanks to them by opening his arms as if he was giving every single person in attendance a hug.

Following his exit people were screaming for an encore as the lights faded to black and it seemed they were going to get their wish when the stage was illuminated again causing fans to gasp in excitement.

Visitors and players fled the MGM Grand and other Las Vegas properties Saturday night after rumors erupted about an active shooter on the Las Vegas Strip. A gunshot-like noise in the area turned out to be a glass door getting struck by rocks police said in initial reports.

The threatening sound and subsequent rumors led to lockdowns at several casinos along the Strip according to an initial report from the Las Vegas Review-Journal. One of the casinos put on lockdown was The Cosmopolitan of Las Vegas the report claimed.

It was at about 10 pm that a person allegedly hurled rocks at the exterior door in MGM Grand’s front valet area. The suspect was “immediately” apprehended police said. He is likely to be charged with a misdemeanor for destroying hotel property police add.

Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department (LVMPD) Capt. Branden Clarkson explained the “panic” was caused by those “thinking it was possible gunfire given the nature of what’s been happening across the nation” the Review-Journal reported.









The sound “startled people in the valet area” Metro officers confirmed in a 10:38 pm Twitter post. Also fueled by social media rumors some six casinos saw increased police and security guard presence on Saturday night Vital Vegas reported.

Witnesses posting on social media called the incident a “stampede.” Fleeing casino visitors went through a live poker tournament area at the MGM Grand.

Injuries Reported

There were injuries too the posts claim. Police later confirmed one person suffered minor injuries after falling the Review-Journal reported.

A social media poster at the MGM Grand also tweeted that “armed casino security and cops with rifles are moving across the casino floor.”

A short time after the noise MGM Grand security guards blocked off part of the valet area. Repairs were being made to the broken glass.

Vital Vegas called the aftermath from the incident “insanity.”

The response — and ensuing panic across multiple resorts — created far more harm than the incident itself” Vital Vegas said.

Social media posts claimed that the panic also led to “a lot of money” getting lost.

“Everyone left their money in the slot machines. Employees and pit bosses cleared out. Somebody cleaned up. At least four casinos” one poster said.

Metro police made it a priority to inform the crowds on the Strip the reports of gunfire were unfounded.

“We were able to quickly tell people that was not the case” Clarkson was quoted by the Review-Journal. “We had officers on the street saying there was not a shooting.”

There were unconfirmed reports on Saturday night there was a shooting outside the New York-New York Hotel & Casino.

Performance Stopped

The “Mad Apple” Cirque du Soleil show at New York-New York was stopped after 10 pm because of the rumors the Review-Journal said. The lights were put back on. Many audience members fled.

Pedestrians had made their way across the pedestrian bridge that connects the MGM Grand to New York-New York. They came to the theater seeking a hiding place.

Cast members in the show went back to their dressing rooms for safety the Review-Journal said. They locked the doors and remained inside until 10:30 pm when authorities said all was safe. But as of 11:45 pm police officers were still seen in force on the Strip.

Police helicopters remained in the area too the Review-Journal reported.

Las Vegas On Edge

Much of Las Vegas has been on edge because of violent crimes in tourist areas. In recent weeks the Fremont Street Experience in downtown Las Vegas saw several violent crimes. Security and police presence has been upped in the area on weekends.

Since the COVID-19 pandemic Metro police upped officer presence along the Strip in two prior selective enforcement initiatives called “Operation Persistent Pressure.” It targeted violent crime and drug-related activity.

Capt. Brandon Clarkson with LVMPD told reporters one person suffered minor injuries when falling in the immediate panic.

The loud noise caused by someone breaking glass near the valet area of a Las Vegas Strip resort Saturday night brought panic in the tourist corridor as false social media posts of an active shooter started to spread.

Rather the loud bang was caused someone breaking a window in the valet area of the MGM Grand according to Metro Police. The person who broke the glass was taken into custody and faces a destruction of property charge officials said.

In a Twitter post about 30 minutes after the chaos started Metro wrote that “reports of a shooting near the MGM tonight are unfounded. Initial reports are a glass door shattered causing a loud noise which startled people in the valet area.”

“It caused a loud bang there was a subsequent panic thinking it was possible gunfire given the nature of what’s been happening across the nation” Metro Police Capt. Branden Clarkson said Sunday.

The false reports of an active shooter started a chain reaction of discord as people frantically fled the area. Metro said its officers on the Strip were telling those people it was a false alarm but many raced across the pedestrian bridge looking for safety at New York-New York.

In a Twitter post about 50 minutes after the incident started MGM said “operations at MGM Grand and all Strip properties are continuing as usual.”

There was a heavy police presence on the Strip for a few hours after the incident. There were no reported injuries.

An audible crash caused by breaking glass at MGM Grand sent tourists on the Strip into a panic Saturday night and set social media ablaze with false reports of an active shooter.

Someone had broken a window in the casino’s valet area at about 10 p.m. Metropolitan Police Department Capt. Branden Clarkson said at briefing shortly after midnight. “It caused a loud bang there was a subsequent panic thinking it was possible gunfire given the nature of what’s been happening across the nation.”

He said a person was immediately taken into custody and faces a misdemeanor charge of destruction of property.

One person had minor injuries after falling down during the panic Clarkson said but no one was transported to a hospital.

Clarkson said people fleeing the area and saying there was a shooting “created a chain reaction of information.”

“We were able to quickly tell people that was not the case” he said. “We had officers on the street saying there was not a shooting.”

It wasn’t until 10:38 p.m. that Metro confirmed in a tweet that reports of a shooting were unfounded.

Shortly after 10 p.m. social media posts spread like wildfire claiming there was an active shooter on the Strip in the area of New York-New York.

The “Mad Apple” Cirque du Soleil stage show at New York-New York halted just after 10 p.m. after a loud noise was heard outside the theater doors. The house lights immediately went up.

Sources at the theater said people had run across the pedestrian bridge on the Strip connecting MGM Grand and New York-New York and stormed the front doors of the theater seeking a place to hide. “Mad Apple” cast members were then hustled off stage and into their dressing rooms instructed to lock the doors.

The audience reportedly ran from the theater as an official said over the theater’s PA system “We are dealing with a situation. Please bear with us.”

The cast was given an “all clear” directive at 10:30 p.m.

Videos posted on Twitter showed tourists running away from the hotel as Metro officers moved toward New York-New York.

Several hotels were reportedly put on lockdown including The Cosmopolitan of Las Vegas and guests were told to stay away from the properties.

There was still a heavy police presence on the Strip as of 11:45 p.m. There were several ambulances fire trucks and police vehicles on Las Vegas Boulevard while police helicopters swirled overhead.

Two months earlier another false report of gunfire led to a panic on the Strip during a nighttime music festival.

The Lovers & Friends music festival at the Las Vegas Festival Grounds at Sahara Avenue and Las Vegas Boulevard was temporarily paused May 14 because of a panic in the crowd. The concert eventually resumed though many vendors and attendees already had exited the venue.

According to a new report from Nikkei the American semiconductor producer has begun informing its customers that the price of its chips will soon be going up by 10% to 20%. The company mainly attributes the hike to rising costs of production and says that while not the entirety of its offerings will see a price hike it will be affecting the majority of its products.

Intel and Samsung aside Taiwanese microchip giant TSMC also announced previously that it’d be raising prices albeit by a single-digit percentage. The company mainly produces processors for AMD and given AMD Intel and Samsung’s market shares in the industry there’ll be little recourse for consumers looking to purchase processors at previous prices.

Paul Pelosi purchased on June 17 20000 shares of Nvidia a top semiconductor company worth between $1 million and $5 million the Daily Caller reported citing disclosure reports filed by the House speaker.

Senators are expected to convene as early as Tuesday to vote on a bipartisan competition bill to set aside $52 billion to boost domestic semiconductor manufacturing and give tax credits for production Reuters reported.

“It certainly raises the specter that Paul Pelosi could have access to some insider legislative information” Craig Holman a government affairs lobbyist for the left-wing think tank Public Citizen told the Daily Caller News Foundation. “This is the reason why there is a stock trading app that exclusively monitors Paul’s trading activity and then its followers do likewise.”

Samsung Confirms Early Development of DDR6 Memory Has Already Begun Utilizes MSAP Tech & Aims To Deliver Up To 17000 Mbps Speeds

During a seminar in Suwon South Korea Samsung's Vice President for Test and System Package (TSP) revealed that packaging technology is required to evolve as the performance of the memory itself expands in the future. The company confirmed that it is already in the early development stages of its next-gen DDR6 memory which will be utilizing MSAP technology.

According to Samsung MSAP is already being used by its competitors (SK Hynix and Micron) in DDR5. So what is new with MSAP? Well MSAP or Modified Semi-Additive Process allows DRAM manufacturers to create memory modules with finer circuits. This is achieved by coating circuit patterns in empty spaces that were previously left untouched allowing for better connections and faster transfer speeds. The next generation of DDR6 memory will not only leverage MSAP to enhance circuit connection but also adapt to the increased number of layers that will be incorporated into the DDR6 memory.

The previous tenting method only coated areas of the circular copper plate where the circuit patterns will be formed while the other areas were etched out. But in MSAP the areas besides the circuits are coated and the empty spaces plated allowing for finer circuits. As the capacity and data processing speed of memory chips increase packages must be designed to fit that the VP said. As the number of layers increases and processes become more sophisticated the memory package market is also expected to grow exponentially Ko said. In terms of fan-out another packaging technology where the I/O terminals are placed outside the chip to allow chips to become smaller while retaining the ball layout Samsung was applying both fan out-wafer level packages (FO-WLP) and fan out-panel level packages (FO-PLP). via THE ELEC Korea Electronics Industry Media

Samsung expects that its DDR6 design would be finalized by 2024 but commercial usage is not expected after 2025. In terms of specifications the DDR6 memory will be up to twice as fast as existing DDR5 memory with transfer speeds of up to 12800 Mbps (JEDEC) & overclocked speeds blistering past the 17000 Mbps range. Currently Samsung's fastest DDR5 DIMM has a transfer speed of up to 7200 Mbps so that's a 1.7x improvement at JEDEC and 2.36x improvement with overclocked speeds for the next-gen memory chips.

With that said memory manufacturers have already highlighted speeds of up to DDR5-12600 in the coming future so DDR5 definitely has the potential for consumer platforms. Expect faster and more tuned DDR5 memory modules later this year with the launch of AMD's Zen 4 & Intel's Raptor Lake CPU platforms.

MSFT,Microsoft,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiPWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNyZWF0aXZlYmxvcS5jb20vbmV3cy9taWNyb3NvZnQtaGFyZHdlYXItY2xvdGhpbmfSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Microsoft's new clothing line is gloriously 90s,"There were some chuckles this week as Microsoft launched its own clothing line. Yes seriously. Undeterred by Apple's unsuccessful foray into fashion in the 1980s (see evidence of that further below) the tech giant had begun selling a range of clothing under the pun-tastic brand name Hardwear. And the designs were inspired by the company's most mocked piece of software: MS Paint.

The nine-piece collection of tees hats sweats jackets and pants was designed by Gavin Mathieu and it's actually nowhere near as nerdy as you might expect. In fact it's actually pretty cool – and totally unashamedly nineties in both spirit and style. But will people pay these prices? (maybe you will if you have money left after getting a saving with one of the best Microsoft Surface deals).

(Image credit: Microsoft)

Microsoft describes Hardwear as much more than a clothing range – as all good branding should. It says the collection is reflective of the Normcore style a lifestyle aesthetic that ""puts the focus on individuals and not on the clothing they wear"". It's also designed the range to inspire creativity by being simple thus reducing any distractions to creativity. In an article on its website Microsoft says: ""check out the collection but don’t stop at the clothes. Understand and carry the message that creativity is not on you it’s in you and it knows no bounds.""

OK we're loving the message and the story that Mathieu who's the founder and creative director of Supervsn Studios was inspired to become a designer by using MS Paint. We also love the retro style but the prices? A T-shirt with the Windows XP screen saver (Charles O'Rear's photo Bliss) on the back costs $60 the 'cargo tech pants' $150 and the trucker caps $25 (although we're certainly more inclined to pay Microsoft for real clothes than to pay Meta for virtual clothes). You can see the whole Hardwear collection in the Xbox Gear shop.

While Microsoft expanded its focus from software to include hardware a long time ago its entry into fashion comes as something of a surprise. Apple has hardcore fans that would no doubt pay through the nose for a clothing line if it chose to produce one. But Microsoft? In fact it all feels somehow more like something Apple might do...

Oh hold on... It already did. Back in 1986. The Apple Collection as shared by The Trad was very much of its time with brightly coloured snap shirts and polos and of course the then rainbow-coloured Apple logo. Suffice it to say there wasn't a second collection.

Whether you're convinced by Microsoft's Hardwear or not there's no denying that the company now produces some outstanding hardware for creatives. Particularly its Surface range.

Microsoft warns of hackers,"Whenever companies roll out an update for your programs operating systems and devices you should never delay downloading it. These updates can add new functions but they often patch serious vulnerabilities.

For example in May Apple released updates to fix a vulnerability in three of its operating systems macOS watchOS and tvOS. This came a few days after the company rushed out an emergency patch for iPhone and Mac.

But now Microsoft is warning MacBook users to update the macOS operating system. Read on to see what the patch entails and how you can download it.

Here’s the backstory

Your system is at risk if you have a Mac or MacBook and haven’t installed the latest security update yet. According to Microsoft an App Sandbox flaw tracked as CVE-2022-26706 exposes your information to hackers through its Word application.

How it works is rather complex. In essence Apple’s App Sandbox is a secure environment that restricts any damage to macOS devices and user data if an app is infected with malware or a virus. Apple explains it’s a “last line of defense against theft corruption or deletion of user data.”

The unpatched flaw in macOS Launch Services means an infected app can escape the App Sandbox and infiltrate your data.

“Our research shows that even the built-in baseline security features in macOS could still be bypassed potentially compromising the system and user data” the Microsoft 365 Defender Research Team explains.

What you can do about it

The best thing to do is immediately update your Apple device to the latest version Monterey 12.4. Not only does it fix the App Sandbox flaw but it also patches other problems.

Here’s how to get the update:

From the Apple menu in the corner of your screen choose System Preferences .

. In the System Preferences window click Software Update . If your System Preferences doesn’t include Software Update here’s how to upgrade to macOS Monterey or upgrade to an older macOS and use the Updates tab of the App Store app to get app updates.

. Click Update Now or Upgrade Now : Update Now installs the latest updates for the currently installed version. Upgrade Now installs a major new version with a new name such as macOS Monterey. Software Update shows only upgrades that are compatible with your Mac.

or :

The 12.4 update also corrects a Bluetooth problem where an app can gain unauthorized access to Bluetooth and a kernel issue where hackers can execute malicious code.

However according to the latest reports the Redmond giant has been obliged to scrap these plans thereby pushing the major upgrade back to 2024 with new features arriving via a new update-independent initiative instead.

4 Reviews

The newest possible version of Windows 11 is known as 22H2 (or Sun Valley 2) with a successor (appropriately dubbed Sun Valley 3) thought to follow in 2023. In keeping with the Redmond giant's new publicly-stated goal of 1 Feature Update per year it has been projected to emerge as a full upgrade to version 12. However a new leak on the matter purports to shoot this idea dead in the water.

According to WindowsCentral's sources Microsoft has fallen short of its aim to increase the frequency of updates to 1 per year already and has thus shifted its aspirations back down to a 3-year cycle instead. Accordingly as Windows 11 launched in 2021 this pushes the debut of its major upgrade back to 2024.

Nevertheless Microsoft will still be capable of pushing new potentially more Windows 12-esque features out on a more regular basis. This apparently will be done via a new alternative route called Moments already credited with pushing the new weather button on the Taskbar found in the newest Windows 11 updates.

Accordingly any novel additions to the OS could become more like feature drops rather than updates in the immediate future at least until Windows 12 eventually arrives in the next 2 years or more.

The Ontario government is expected to receive its first shipment of the vaccine next week. Health Canada says children will be given doses that are one-quarter the size adults receive.

Health Canada also said they would also be monitoring children and require Moderna to provide updated data on the vaccine's safety and effectiveness.

CBC News talked to parents on the streets of London Ont. to find out what they have to say about getting their young ones vaccinated.

Sabrina Hartin a mother of three girls under the age of 10 said she's going to hold off on getting her kids vaccinated.

Hartin said two of her kids were born prematurely and have dealt with past health concerns. Her four-year-old child Zoey was born three months early and had lung and heart complications.

""We didn't want to get them the vaccine in case it made more problems."" she said. ""We're waiting for it and we're kind of seeing how it goes.""

Hartin said she is vaccinated herself and is practicing precautions like social distancing but wants to wait and see the pros and cons of children getting the vaccine and if there are any long-term effects.

""I'm just kind of keeping an eye on it making sure that there is nothing to worry about right? Because they're kids they can't always speak out about the problem.""

Another family is also going to wait to see if they should vaccinate their one-year-old son.

Alexis White said they might vaccinate their son Darin when he is two or three years old. Right now she said she's breastfeeding and they had already contracted COVID-19 but were only sick for a day and a half.

""I figure he doesn't really need it yet until maybe after I'm done breastfeeding"" she said adding she's not sure when that will happen.

White also said because the vaccine is so new they would wait to give him the shot. Darin Kennedy the one-year-old's father said he's concerned because their child is so young.

""We're pro-shot but I'm just worried because he's a baby...because it is new. That's kind of what's on our minds"" he said.

Another family says they are going to wait but does plan on getting their young ones vaccinated.

""We'll be getting vaccinated…mostly for safety"" said Bryan Robertson who has two sons aged four and two.

While joking with his son Ben Robertson said he isn't a huge fan of needles but they would get the shot for his health.

According to Health Canada around 1.7 million kids across the country are now eligible to be vaccinated.",,,,,,,,,,,,

Courtesy of Colin Puth

Born and raised in Denver 58-year-old Kendra Black has been up and down Colorado Boulevard too many times to count. But she'd never given much thought to the figure of an Indigenous child that stands above a carpet store at 2024 South Colorado Boulevard.""It's been there as long as I can remember"" says the Denver City Council member.But in November Littleton resident Kelly Ryan sent a message asking if Black knew of any efforts ""to get rid of the large and racially offensive 'Mohawk Tommy' signage"" in front of Westcraft Carpets  which is in her council district.Mohawk Tommy a shirtless boy sporting a mohawk haircut with a feather in back was a 1950s Walt Disney Company cartoon creation that Mohawk Carpets — now Mohawk Industries — used in its advertising. You can still see the figure in dolls drawings and even rugs available on eBay...and on that sign on South Colorado Boulevard.The Mohawk Tommy outside of Westcraft Carpets which carries Mohawk products once had hands that were motor-operated and banged a small drum. The drumming feature no longer works and the sign is ""in very poor condition"" says Black. ""The paint is peeling and there’s no longer arms.""""I come at it just from purely 'That shouldn’t be.' That shouldn’t still be. That sign shouldn’t still be up there"" says Ryan who also sent information about Native Americans to the Westcraft owners but never got a response.On the receiving end of those emails was Matt Vagts grandson of the founder of Westcraft who works in the family business.""This guy baited me"" Vagts says noting that Ryan had originally emailed to say he wanted to buy carpeting only to quickly switch to asking the store to remove the sign. ""This guy has harassed me for a year and a half. He’s got some mission. He’s the one that has spawned all of this. It isn’t the Mohawk tribe.""After receiving Ryan's note Black reached out to Darius Smith director of the Denver Anti-Discrimination Office . Smith who's Navajo serves as the staff liaison to the Denver American Indian Commission Smith called Westcraft Carpets to leave a ""really nice message"" he recalls.""I said 'Hey we want to set up a meeting with them and the [Denver] Agency for Human Rights and Community Partnerships and just talk about this'"" Smith says. ""And [Matt Vagts] called me back and was very confrontational.""The conversation calmed down after the two started talking about something they had in common: They'd both attended public school in Denver. Smith went to Montbello High School and Vagts went to South High School ""His high school recently changed their mascot from the Rebel to the Raven"" Smith says. But after they chatted about that for a while Vagts ""talked about how they were honoring the Mohawk and that this was a gift by Disney and...that this political correctness was wrong.""Smith got a call from John Vagts Matt's father a day later.""We had a good conversation. He again talked about how this was a gift from Walt Disney and it’s appropriate and what’s the harm?"" Smith recalls. ""He kind of talked about the political correctness of it all and he pays taxes here in Denver and he pays my salary. I said 'Thank you' and 'Let’s continue to have this conversation.'""John Vagts said he'd talk with a lawyer. And then he stopped returning Smith's calls.After a few months had passed Smith asked Raven Payment to help sort things out. Payment has served on the Denver American Indian Commission since April; she's Mohawk herself. The Mohawk people whose original name is Kanien'kehá꞉ka are from what is now upstate New York and areas to the north and south.""I talked to some family members back home whom we would consider elders. I figured out where essentially Disney created Tommy Mohawk and Mini Mohawk"" Payment says. ""Disney did not create that character in tandem acceptance or association with any Native people.""Payment then drafted a letter for the Denver American Indian Commission which was mailed to John Vagts on June 10.The letter made it clear that the DAIC was requesting the removal of the Tommy Mohawk sign. It noted that the caricature is ""cultural appropriation"" ""highlights the legacy of dehumanizing imagery against Indigenous people"" and is not ""endorsed by the Mohawk people.""""As neighbors and fellow community members we believe that no one deserves to see their heritage insulted no matter how old the imagery may be. It is for these reasons that the DAIC requests Westcraft Carpets and Flooring remove the Tommy Mohawk sign"" the letter concluded.""When I see this image of this little so-called Indian boy I'm like 'That’s not even what we really look like. We don’t dress like that. It’s just these images that are given to us'"" Payment says. ""It’s salt in the wound.""The Denver American Indian Commission has not received a response from anyone at Westcraft.""It’s culturally insensitive and I hope that the owners will be respectful to the culture of the Mohawk people and remove it"" says Black. ""They sent that very thoughtful letter. I don’t know why someone wouldn’t remove it after reading that letter.""Matt Vagts hasn't read the letter he says; his father is on vacation.""We’re a third-generation family that’s been here since 1954. My grandfather put this sign up. It was the only caricature that Walt Disney actually sold to a corporation"" Vagts explains. ""It’s not meant to be derogatory toward Native Americans."" His own mother is a quarter Native American he adds.""Our perspective of this is the sign is a manufacturer's logo and mascot"" he notes. At Mohawk Industries conferences he points out the carpet brand brings a large mascot version of Mohawk Tommy and people pose next to it for photos.Earlier this month Vagts says he emailed the Mohawk Council of Akwesasne which is located in Quebec and New York to get advice on what to do with the sign.The Mohawk Council of Akwesasne has not yet sent an official response. However it has a standard policy for situations such as this.""We’ve never been in support of anything related to caricatures or things depicting stereotypes of Native Americans or First Nations individuals. To support this one would be in direct conflict with how we view these types of incidences. We are not in support of this sign"" says Corine Francis executive assistant to the Grand Chief of the Mohawk Council of Akwesasne.At the same time Francis commends Matt Vagts for reaching out calling his handling of the situation ""very respectable.""If he does get a letter from the council asking for the sign to be removed ""We’ll strongly consider it"" says Matt Vagts. ""We’re not here to insult a culture. But we are also a very long-withstanding business. We’ve been here a long time 68 years. It’s a landmark sign.""But that doesn't justify keeping up something that's offensive according to Payment. ""Ideally the sign will come down and we can all move on from it.""If not though ""I feel like it may generate a further conversation where they may end up finding the Indigenous community at their front door"" she adds. ""That might be the next step if they don’t take it down.""",,,,,,,,,,,,

TAP,Molson Coors Beverage Company,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYmh0dHBzOi8vdmVybW9udGJpei5jb20vbmV3cy8yMDIyL2p1bHkvMTcvdHJhY2tpbmctYmV2ZXJhZ2UtaW5kdXN0cnktdmVybW9udC1pbmZvcm1hdGlvbi1wcm9jZXNzaW5n0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Tracking the beverage industry: Vermont Information Processing,"by Joyce Marcel Vermont Business Magazine It is 1972 in Burlington and a man named Howard Aiken has just created a new service for collecting and processing billing data. Based on that the company he starts Vermont Information Processing soon has six employees. In 2001 Aiken sells the company — now 45 workers strong — to the employees. Since then VIP has grown into a stealth behemoth so secretive that its CEO won't sit for an interview and its top-level employee-owners squirm when asked to quantify the company's revenue.

Today Aiken's little company now located in Colchester is celebrating its 50th year in business. It has grown to 600 employee-owners and is widely credited with revolutionizing the national beer wine and soda industry. Its recent yearly revenues according to ZoomInfo Technologies a leading go-to-market intelligence platform for sales and marketing teams reached $99 million.

Operations Director Louise Morgan who has been with VIP for 25 years concedes the company has gained a reputation for secrecy. “We are kind of stealthy in that regard only because we're not big on marketing ourselves or putting ourselves out there” Morgan said. “We're so busy focusing on our customers and providing what they asked us to do and delivering on those promises that we make.”

VIP's customers range from giants like Anheuser-Busch and Molson Coors to local craft breweries. The company doesn't limit itself to beer; it processes information for companies such as Pepsi as well.

VIP has grown in part through acquisitions including MicroVane in 2003 BDN Collections in 2015 TradePulse in 2017 Vistaar's US Beverage Alcohol in 2020 and Data Consultants Inc BizStride and eoStar in 2022. It now has small offices in Michigan Pennsylvania and Missouri but its main campus remains in Colchester.

Before the rise of computers everything was done on paper. Remember the sales books with the white page the yellow page and the pink page? That was what data looked like when Aiken had his bright idea.

“Howard Aiken founded us as a billing service” said Heather Burnett who has been at VIP for 18 years. “He found a few customers in the southern part of the state. He worked with a hardware company a produce company and a beer distributor. At the end of the day they took their invoices put them on a Greyhound bus and sent them off to Burlington. He rented space on a computer at night because it was the cheapest time to do it and he would key in all the sales reports based on all those invoices wrap the sales reports around those invoices and send them back down south on the bus the next morning.”

Aiken recognized that the one business that always paid on time was the beer distributor.

“He said ‘This the business that I want to be in’” Burnett recalled.

That customer by the way was DeWitt Beverages in Brattleboro. Farrell Distributing in Rutland another VIP client acquired DeWitt several years ago so you could say VIP has serviced at least one company for 50 years. And Leader Distributing a Pepsi bottler/distributor is in Dewitt's old warehouse in Brattleboro and went live with VIP a year ago. So the beverage world spins round and round and VIP thrives.

“One thing that I take from that story is that the very first customer that he worked with is still a customer today” Burnett said. “That is so important to us because it really is about the relationships that we build with our customers — that long-term friendship if you will — that we've developed over all the years. We have several customers like that customers who have been our clients longer than a lot of marriages last.”

Dating back to Prohibition the beverage alcohol industry has comprised three tiers: the producers or the makers of the product; the distributors; and the retailers (grocery stores bars convenience stores etc.). VIP offers data analysis for each tier.

“VIP is a software company that provides solutions for the beverage industry” Morgan said. “We're heavy in beverage alcohol but we also work for a lot of nonalcohol-industry customers like soda bottlers and such. So we have our customers — our suppliers or makers of products — like Anheuser-Busch or Absolut Vodka and then the local distributors distribute that product to the retailers in local markets. We provide solutions for suppliers distributors and retailers to help them streamline their businesses sell more product and operate more efficiently. For many we provide back-end services for improving their businesses so they can sell more product and be more efficient.”

Sierra Nevada Brewing on the West Coast is a pioneer in that regard. It has been in the craft beer business since 1980. It distributes its products in every state in the country as well as in parts of Europe Australia and Asia. It has been a client of VIP for about 15 years.

“We and other suppliers like breweries wineries distillers etc sell our products to distributors who in turn sell all our products into individual retail outlets” said Rhonda Swanson sales information manager for Sierra Nevada. “We have a little over 400 beer distributors around the country that we sell our beer to. When the beer distributors sell beer into each of the retail accounts they share that information back to VIP. Hundreds and hundreds of distributors of beverages send their sales data to VIP every night.”

VIP collects and processes that information and makes it available to suppliers for a monthly fee.

“VIP’s data allows us to have a more granular view of where our product is going at the retail level” Swanson explained. “We use this data to understand where our products are selling well — or not — and to identify opportunities for additional sales. We’ve seen VIP grow and evolve and over the years they’ve developed a variety of tools for suppliers that leverage the sales data they collect from distributors. They are truly a valued vendor partner of ours.”

Closer to home VIP lists among its clients Citizen Cider of Burlington the third-largest craft cider brand in the Northeast.

Justin Heilenbach the president and co-founder of the company which employs 90 people says he is a big fan of VIP.

“We work with wholesalers all over and they're all blown away when we tell them that VIP is located near us and that we know them and we're friends with them” Heilenbach said. “They’re not just managing data for Citizen Cider; they're managing data for global beverages like Budweiser. We're a small customer in the big picture of things. So to be able to have that kind of dialogue with them is awesome.”

VIP provides Citizen Cider with the data and the tools the company needs to evaluate how its brands are doing in the marketplace. “For example” Heilenbach said “VIP has a geo-locator feature that allows a sales rep in downtown Boston to put into their phone all the accounts that sell Unified Press Cider and they'll all show up on the map.”

Citizen Cider can drill down to study a single account or survey the entire national market using VIP data Heilenbach added.

“For example I could look at Brattleboro Co-op and see how many cases of each of our products sold in the last 36 days” he said. “You can go down to the individual account level. You can also look at whole states. Each wholesaler has its own sales team. I can look at what an individual salesperson — one who doesn't work for me but who works for the wholesaler — has sold specifically. We can use that to acknowledge them. ‘Hey you've been our No. 1 rep in the market in the last year; here's a gift card.’ It's an incredible amount of data.”

VIP's data can be a sales tool and can help make marketing strategy. It can help with pricing and inventory management. A company pays for the level of data it needs.

“It's live on our phones” Heilenbach said. “We use VIP data to prepare for every sales meeting. It's the primary way that we manage sales strategy for our business.”

Another VIP client is Zero Gravity Craft Brewery a leading Vermont-based regional brewery that distributes products across New England New York and New Jersey with emerging distribution markets in Pennsylvania; Washington DC; and Virginia. The company currently has around 75 employees and operates out of two facilities one in Burlington and the other in South Burlington.

“Simply put we utilize VIP as a primary tool to help streamline our sales team’s efforts in identifying market trends and opportunities” said Zero Gravity's sales analyst Cody Semmelrock. “VIP is able to provide us with as close to real-time market information as possible. At 50000 feet we can look at year-over-year and month-over-month comparisons for how different distributor sales levels have changed in the marketplace. But the service goes far beyond general sales levels.”

Zero Gravity can then track percentage or volume changes and other key performance indicators across its many different product SKUs (stock-keeping units).

“With this tool we can create a multidimensional scoreboard that will help us win"" Semmelrock said. ""VIP provides our team with essential information in driving efficient and effective sales strategies making sure that we are allocating our resources effectively in each one of our markets. For example we can track how well a given product’s sales increase came directly after a specific marketing campaign in a certain location. These types of insights assure that our spends are achieving the return on investment we would hope for and help make sure we can continue to grow moving forward.”

Solutions

VIP's offerings have grown exponentially more complex over the years.

The company has software developers who develop specific applications for specific customers. Anheuser-Busch for example has 700 distributors across the United States.

“Say I'm Anheuser-Busch” said Morgan. “I want to know where that product is being sold in those markets and what type of accounts are buying those products? Convenience stores? Bars? In terms of the sales and inventory what's happening in the various markets? Like how is Bud Light doing in Dallas? And what do I need to do there to promote my products differently? Or price my product differently? Or what kind of discounts do I want to apply in that area? Based on historical information and insights that VIP collects from those distributors and provides to Anheuser-Busch they can make decisions.”

VIP has competitors in the market.

“We have competitors in the different aspects of what we do” Morgan said. “What I just described is one area of our business and we have a couple of competitors. They're on the smaller side and trying to get in there because we're the larger fish. Everybody wants to come after the big guy.”

VIP does many other things for its clients.

“I mentioned there are 700 Anheuser-Busch distributors” Morgan said. “There are a lot of other distributors that sell other products like Molson Coors products and Miller Lite. There are about 1200 distributors across the United States and some of those distributors use VIP to run their business. They use our software to do their inventory management sales reporting accounts receivable place their orders etc.”

The explosion of craft brewing in the US has certainly helped expand VIP's business.

“A distributor has to manage a lot more products because the complexity of their business has gone up” said Brian Kelly who oversees sales for VIP. “Because it's not just 100 products that they are distributing; it's now thousands in some cases. The complexity of their business certainly has changed and what they would need from a software company such as VIP to help them has provided new opportunities for us. The number of breweries out there that are using our service has grown because of the explosion in craft beer as they need those tools and analysis to understand how to take their business to the next level.”

Employee-Ownership

VIP is one of the largest companies in Vermont to operate under an Employee Stock Ownership Plan. in Vermont.

ESOPs allow employees to own all or part of their company. Individual employees receive shares based on the number of years they have worked for the company.

At VIP the company is 100% employee-owned. After working for the company for one year an employee begins collecting shares through a retirement program.

“When you initially join the company depending on your start date you'll become part of the ESOP” Morgan said. “It's six full years to get fully vested into that. The company gets valued each year and each employee has a certain number of shares. They have a certain ownership stake within the ESOP.”

A reevaluation of the company takes place every year.

“Each year we meet and go through our successes and find out the company valuation and how well things have gone and what that means to us individually” Morgan said. “It depends on how long you've been here.”

When employees leave the company they cash out their stocks and leave with a significant retirement benefit.

Employees at ESOPs are known for their hard work and commitment to their companies as they are working essentially for themselves. This is certainly true at VIP.

Hard work — including often staying at work late to help a client — is a big part of the culture.

“It all starts with Howard and his way of leadership” Morgan said. “He's just a head-down get-the-work-done kind of guy. And that's how we've all grown up here at VIP. We just want to get the work done.”

Morgan described the culture this way: “If we say we're going to do something we want to make sure we're following through on it. If we've promised something to a customer we want to make sure we deliver on it and deliver on it in time and with what we've said we're going to do.”

Long-term relationships with customers are vital to the success of VIP Burnett said.

“It's a big thing” Burnett said. “It's a small industry. They're like our friends and we go back a long way. They enjoy coming to our annual conference which we have here in Vermont. We love bringing people to Vermont showing off our state and bringing business here. They love coming here.”

The perks are good at VIP. In 1990 Aiken opened an in-house child care center for example. Three or four of his female employees were about to have children and he wanted to make it easier for them to continue working.

“Howard is all about family and the work-life balance and providing a space where you can be right there and walk down or see your child and feel comfortable that they're being taken care of” Morgan said.

Today employees also have an on-site gym sports facilities and most recently in partnership with Marathon Health a health clinic across the street — solely for themselves. While most of us must wait months to see a medical professional VIP owner-employees must only wait a day or two.

“It's not only taking care of each other but getting to know our co-workers” Morgan said. “When you walk around here you see people interacting with each other and see the way they get along whether it's playing a lunchtime basketball game together out on our basketball court or working out together in our gym. People walk together and take laps when they need a break from their desk. People do all sorts of things outside of work together. We have soccer teams and field hockey and ice hockey teams. People go to trivia nights together. Or they go get a beer together. We really want people to enjoy where they work. They spend so much time with their co-workers we want them to enjoy it.”

Today And Tomorrow

Aiken is retired now but he remains on the board and is involved in making strategic decisions for the company.

At this point with the domination of hand-held computers in people's phones it doesn't really matter where VIP is located.

“Our customers are spread out across the country anyway” Morgan said. “So being in Vermont is not a hindrance in that regard. Sometimes it's a hindrance in terms of finding resources to work for us.”

Like almost every Vermont company I talk to VIP is having trouble finding new hires. A lot of its growth is by word of mouth; customers are sometimes the best advocates.

If people work hard and fit into the culture well the sky is the limit Burnett said.

“If you work hard and are focused on doing the right thing and helping the customer you never know where you can end up” she said. “When I started I was doing cold calls. And now I'm fortunate to work with some of our largest customers and build those relationships with them and hear what their needs are. It's fantastic.”

The company prefers to hire from within.

“There are different paths people can take just depending on what their skills are” Morgan said. “If they're more technically inclined they might become developers. They might become managers of different teams. They might be a product owner of a particular application.”

Two years of COVID quarantine have proved that it often does not matter where a person works from. The majority of VIP is working a hybrid schedule and enjoys the balance between working from home and coming into the office. VIP is now studying and developing applications that connect the three tiers of their industry: production distribution and retail.

“Say the supplier is Anheuser-Busch and then there are the distributors for example and all the bars convenience stores and gas stations” Morgan said. “We want to continue to work with all those three tiers of the industry and develop applications that help connect those three tiers.”

When VIP develops a pilot program it sometimes works the bugs out with local beverage producers like Citizen Cider.

“It's cool to be near them” Heilenbach said “because when they want to pilot things they do look to their local partners.”

He said his company is going to test a new pricing tool VIP has developed to see if it proves beneficial.

The company has no intention of moving out of Vermont.

“We love being in Vermont” Morgan said. “We love the lifestyle of Vermont and staying true to our roots here.”

And the employee-owners of VIP have no intention of selling the company Morgan said. She sees the future as being very bright.

“We always say ‘Take care of the customers; they're our friends. Develop relationships and take care of each other always’” Morgan said.

On day one: Micky strapped a helmet to his dome (thank god) took a sip of his Monster Energy charged the hill and landed in Patrick Star position at the bottom – the drink never touched asphalt. On day two: he threw himself off the cliff at Steamer Lane for an hour straight in the acid-drop challenge. On day three: he smashed the best part of 12 beers in rapid succession at Emma Wood to spare his (mostly) grog-abstaining peers. And on day four he got the Monster logo inked on the heel of his foot (a notoriously painful area to get tatted).

And why?

The 23 year-old from Ventura’s a team player. He also has a wonderful pain tolerance and a seemingly Sisyphean ability to keep on trucking happily (FYI: he will be making the trek back to Santa Cruz for acid-drop redemption).

The blue team may have been bummed by their dismissal in the latest episode of Highway but their failure to make the mid-trip cut cannot be chalked up to not going hard enough. They simply went hard and then went home.

None more so than Micky.

Stay tuned for more Stab Highway conspiracies.

Stab had a chance to chat the Chapter 11 indoctrinate about acid drops pain thresholds and the perils of the highway.

Stab: Hey Micky thanks for chatting.

No problem. Is this my therapy session? Where I talk about all the dos and don’ts of Stab Highway.

This interview is a safe space; you can talk about whatever you need. Where are you right now?

I’m in Cape Cod Massachusetts. Before COVID hit we would all come out in the summer. I have a big East Coast family spread between Connecticut and Maine. Every day out here you go to the beach from about 10-4 then the bar then a pond then home.

There’s nothing like a family bender.

Yeah it’s incredible when you get drunk with your family because that behavior is excusable. You’re like— it’s 10 am and I’ve had four rum drinks. But that doesn’t matter because this guy raised me—he’s doing it and I can too— it’s the best bonding time.

Some visual therapy before we proceed.

For sure. You’re from Ventura right?

I am from Ventura California. My dad moved to Ventura when he was around 27 years-old; he met my mom. I’m the youngest of two older brothers. My dad was into surfing so he got my two older brothers into it. Naturally I fell in their footsteps.

Did you play any sports growing up?

Yes I decided to play football my sophomore year instead of being homeschooled. I was tight with the middle school coaches who asked me to play so I did. The whole experience was awakening—I went to high school with the jocks and didn’t fit in. When I got tackled everyone would yell “wipeout.” I ended up leaving unannounced to go on a surf trip.

Did you know what you wanted to do with surfing?

When you’re young it’s easy to be influenced by your friends and what they’re doing. For me that was surf contests and I did a few one year but I didn’t like them— I had more fun filming and creating content.

There was a time when I didn’t think surfing would work out so I went to the fire academy. But here I am still doing it comfortable and happy with my decision. The main focus as of late has been Chapter 11.

Who do you like creating with the most?

The Chapter 11 crew—Eithan Osborne Jake Kelley Matt McCabe Dane Reynolds and Hunter Martinez. We’ve been hyper focused on putting surf videos on the internet. The funny the bloopers the bad the good the ripping. Other than that I’ll jump on any obscure project Stab concocts. I’ll let Mikey boss me around; he likes to do that.

Did you and Eithan Osborne have plans to team up before Stab Highway?

Ethan and Rolo were in cahoots with Holly to try to get on the same team. Ivy threw a quick wrench in the works when she picked Eithan right out of the gates. Our fantasies of being on the same team dissolved—it was free game.

The replacement fam.

Can you break down the team dynamics for me?

Kai Paula and Mateus were fired up on the surf challenges and I volunteered myself to do the sketchier grimier ones— like bombing a hill and acid dropping. Ainara did her fair share of challenges—she’s great to be around. We all gelled together nicely even though we didn’t know each other.

So was that your first time doing an acid drop?

It was my first time trying to acid drip off something taller than 10 feet. I’ve never been that guy I think everyone’s influence inspired that. Now I’m set on trying to land that Santa Cruz Acid drop—it’s a lingering thought.

All smiles when the board snaps before ankles.

How does one best prepare themselves for an acid drop?

A front traction pad is essential— the extra traction is good for grip and will keep the board together longer. A good meniscus works too. Oddly enough my knees and ankles were feeling fine after. That challenge and hill bomb on the foamie were my favorites.

The way you clutched that Monster Energy drink on the hill bomb was heroic.

That was the first Monster I’ve had in so long. And I had a couple of beers beforehand with that helmet on—I felt invincible. So I sent it—I didn’t want to hit the parked car so I flew off my board. I remember smacking the ground sliding then a standstill.

A true love story – were you in pain after that?

I wasn’t in pain until one and a half hours into Santa Cruz. I hit my head so I had whiplash but other than that I was fine. Just a sore neck and headache— I told myself it was the sugar from the Monster. Glad I’m not roadkill and lived to tell the story. No more hill bombs that was one and done. Whoever wants to top that can go ahead— it’s your funeral.

How bad did you want to win?

Bad—but I knew if I was going to lose I would lose trying even if that meant getting a monster tattoo. After hill bombing and acid dropping I was not concerned about a piercing or tattoo. But to be honest that piercing hurt bad. More than anything on that trip it was the most pain I felt. My piercing/tattoo artist’s name was Johnny Tijuana from Ventura too.

A Johnny Tijuana speciality.

I guess it was fate. Any regrets your team had after getting eliminated?

I don’t know what else we could have done. The acid drop sticks with me because I don’t necessarily agree with the judgment call. Zeke won because they tried a twist but the challenge was to ride out.

I heard there’s some beef between you two. Is there any truth to that?

Yeah before Highway I had not said a word to or about that guy. My first encounter was with him trying to push me off that rock. At first I thought he was joking but then he pushed harder and I slipped and cut my foot. I said some profane word I didn’t know would make the episode. His actions were childish; I was like— we’re not in the schoolyard here—let me go.

How NOT to set a good first impression.

And if that were the case I probably wouldn’t pick the guy who plays football.…

Another push and he would have found out. Hahaha I’m kidding.

What happens on Stab Highway stays on Stab Highway unless you throw it on the podcast or socials then it’s exploited.

Damn exploiters. Were there any more promising relationships you made on the road?

Yeah the guys were great and Ainara for sure. We all decided to do the kill a 12 pack between your team in 30 minutes at Emma Woods. Mikey said Kai didn’t have to because he’s under 21 so he was out and Mateus had a surf challenge coming up. Ainara hadn’t had a beer in four years because she’s sober from alcohol so I thought I was on my own.

I shotgunned seven or eight beers before making myself throw up. I was struggling to get down the rest of them and then Ainara cracked a beer breaking her vow of sobriety. That’s something I’ll hold onto.

Anything else you want to throw out there?

If you are picked to go on Stab Highway beware and proceed with caution but don’t hold anything back. That’s my disclaimer.

Thanks Micky. I’ll put it on the form for next year.

Whether you're a college student who pulled an all-nighter studying for an exam or an adult heading to work after struggling with insomnia the night before some nights we don't get the recommended amount of sleep for our age range. If you're tired you might need a pick-me-up to get through the day which is often obtained through the consumption of caffeine. On an early morning you may notice long lines at your local Starbucks and Dunkin' Donuts illustrating how many people start their day by drinking caffeinated beverages. In fact the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) reports that approximately 80% of American adults consume caffeine on a daily basis making the stimulant extremely popular.

One popular caffeinated beverage is the energy drink. Some brands that you may have tried in your lifetime are Red Bull Monster and Bang Energy. According to a 2010 article published in Mayo Clinic Proceedings energy drinks typically contain between 70 and 200 mg of caffeine in one 16-oz serving. In addition to bringing energy caffeine is thought to raise a person's heart rate and blood pressure.

Although caffeine is a main ingredient in energy drinks it's far from the only one. The 2010 article explains that energy drinks also contain ingredients like taurine B vitamins guarana ginseng as well as sugar all aiming to boost your energy. Although energy drinks may seem to help you stay awake how does consuming them during the day impact your quality of sleep at nighttime?",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMigQFodHRwczovL3d3dy5uZXdpbmRpYW5leHByZXNzLmNvbS9jaXRpZXMvaHlkZXJhYmFkLzIwMjIvSnVsLzE2L211c3QtdHJ5LXJlaHlkcmF0aW5nLWJldmVyYWdlcy1mb3ItdGhpcy1tb25zb29uLXNlYXNvbi0yNDc3MDI4Lmh0bWzSAYsBaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cubmV3aW5kaWFuZXhwcmVzcy5jb20vYW1wL3N0b3J5L2NpdGllcy9oeWRlcmFiYWQvMjAyMi9KdWwvMTYvbXVzdC10cnktcmVoeWRyYXRpbmctYmV2ZXJhZ2VzLWZvci10aGlzLW1vbnNvb24tc2Vhc29uLTI0NzcwMjguaHRtbA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Must try rehydrating beverages for this monsoon season,Coconut Water: A drink filled with nutritious value that’s low on calories and carbs that coconut water for you.

Like his peers and management Swinburne predicts a second quarter in a row of subscriber losses with Netflix’s 221.6 million global figure likely shrinking. The expert expects Netflix to stay “consistent with global paid net adds guidance (-2 million) but we see potential downside risks from mobile app download trends and we trim our third-quarter net adds (+1.55 million versus prior +2 million) to factor in elevated churn following the release of Stranger Things season 4.” Swinburne also cut his 2023 subscriber growth forecast from 9.3 million to 7.9 million and his price target from $300 to $220 but kept his “equal weight” rating on the stock.

Addressing rising inflation and talk of a recession in more detail Swinburne predicted both could hit Netflix. “Streaming video revenues may prove more vulnerable than expected to a global recession and lower consumer spending levels” he argued. “While Netflix’s leading engagement should help it retain customers its relative price premium is likely an offset as consumers look to trim their streaming bill.”

But the Morgan Stanley expert also touted the streamer’s planned rollout of a cheaper advertising-supported subscription tier. “Tapping into the $160 billion global video advertising spending opportunity in the long term should allow Netflix to drive average revenue per user (ARPU) growth with less reliance on consumer price increases” Swinburne wrote. The analyst concluded by noting that the way investors view Netflix will change over time: “Net adds matter to shares but longer-term ARPU growth expectations matter more.” After all in the past “the majority of Netflix revenue growth came from net adds or customer growth. As the business matures ARPU is shifting from a secondary to a primary driver.” That is why he expects Netflix “to continue to prioritize ARPU growth including continuing to raise prices.”

In a July 12 report Benchmark analyst Matthew Harrigan similarly highlighted: “Tapping into the $160 billion global video advertising spending opportunity in the long term should allow Netflix to drive ARPU growth with less reliance on consumer price increases. In markets with high ad ARPUs like the U.S. Netflix can offer a materially lower priced offering and unlock additional net adds without sacrificing unit economics. Advertising may also prove a consumer-friendly way to monetize password sharing.” Harrigan also noted the changes that the AVOD push could bring to Netflix’s culture. “Departing from its DNA Netflix will also have to divulge full viewing information to satisfy ad market transparency and 3rd-party auditing demands” he argued.

Wells Fargo analyst Steven Cahall in a July 13 report noted that his team’s analysis of monthly active users data implies a second-quarter net subscriber drop of only 1 million. But he stuck to his 2 million decline forecast in line with management guidance. “The main driver of our unchanged estimates is low conviction as we think the historically correlated metrics are less relevant at present for Netflix which appears to be experiencing a new phase of customer churn” he explained. “As such prior correlations are proving less reliable and we do not believe there is sufficient evidence to imply a bullish call into earnings.” And he highlighted: “We also have a downside bias on second-half estimates including sub growth pressure and a foreign exchange headwind to financials.”

So what should investors expect from Netflix in terms of subscriber forecasts for the current quarter? “We sense low conviction across the Street so this is another wait and see quarter with investors likely resetting afterwards” Cahall wrote.

Bank of America analyst Nat Schindler in a June 23 report reiterated his “underperform” rating on Netflix but cut his price target from $240 to $196 “given current market conditions rising costs of content production in addition to several potential costly initiatives.” Schindler added: “Overall while our survey indicates Netflix is currently consumers’ top choice we believe our results are indicative that streaming has very quickly become a commoditized product following the pandemic with original content being a key differentiating factor for a user to subscribe to the service.”

The domestic subscription run-up for Netflix “seems to be at or very near its peak” the Bank of America analyst argued. “The availability of more services in addition to more compelling competitor value propositions have led customers to subscribe to more services on the whole while still keeping Netflix. If a recession were to take hold however it wouldn’t be surprising to see incremental churn.”

Near-term it remains all about sub trends after all. Cowen analyst John Blackledge highlighted as much in his earnings preview which had this takeaway: “Net-net we expect investors will remain focused on net sub trajectory at the (earnings report) as well as third-quarter guide.” He forecasts a paid net decline of 2 million users “given macro competition and password sharing.” But he slightly raised his 2023 net adds projection due to the upcoming ad tier.

“Netflix shares are down 46 percent since first-quarter earnings on 4/19 (and down 69 percent year-to-date) with the pullback reflecting the broader trend among tech sector shares as well as Netflix-specific challenges (high existing penetration in some markets along with password sharing increased competition and macro issues)” Blackledge highlighted. “Meanwhile the stock pullback has led to more attractive valuation in our view ahead of the service’s likely introduction of an ad-supported tier that we estimate could add about 4 million incremental U.S./Canada subs and significant upside to ’23 U.S./Canada revenue.”

Wall Street does expect more updates on a planned crackdown on password sharing and launch of a cheaper AVOD meaning advertising-supported subscriber tier. After all Netflix on July 13 unveiled that it has picked Microsoft as its global advertising technology and sales partner. “We expect more detail on the AVOD rollout password sharing and any rethink to the content strategy to stimulate sub growth” Cahall said. “We think the bias for second-half estimate revisions is downward.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiV2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LndkYXlyYWRpb25vdy5jb20vbmV3cy9uYXRpb25hbC1uZXdzLzUwODI5LWNpdGlncm91cC1lYXJuaW5ncy1iZWF0LWVzdGltYXRlc9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Citigroup earnings beat estimates,"(New York NY) -- Citigroup earnings are beating estimates by a lot.

The reigning champions who are in the final stages of finalizing another star-studded roster have thus far retained much more than they lost during free agency. They are poised to again be the powerhouse of the Western Conference. And if they can find the necessary cap money to keep Kadri the league’s prized unsigned player there will be absolutely no holes in the lineup.

Preventing power forward Valeri Nichushkin and shutdown defenseman Josh Manson from testing the UFA market were all-star moves. And locking up restricted free agent forward Artturi Lehkonen to a five-year contract was similarly as shrewd. Every championship team needs a special fourth line and Colorado prevented Darren Helm and Andrew Cogliano from signing elsewhere and losing two-thirds of that trio.

But defense wins championships. And with the Avs they arguably have the best group of defensemen in the league. They again won’t have to have Patrick Roy in net to win the Stanley Cup. They can again hoist it with prototype backup goalie Pavel Francouz playing behind newcomer Alexandar Georgiev instead of Darcy Kuemper.

Georgiev is the only primary newcomer — which is a good thing for a Cup winner. And he’ll play behind a blueline that other teams can only dream about. Norris Trophy winner Cale Makar will again do his thing with unsung star partner Devon Toews on the first pairing. Young Bo Byram 21 who could become the left-shot version of the right-shot Makar will continue to blossom into Makar’s future first-pair partner beside Manson or fellow shutdown D Erik Johnson. And savvy puck-man Sam Girard will be back after missing the final 13 games of the postseason with a broken sternum.

“We feel really good about it” general manager Chris MacFarland said of the Avs’ stellar defensemen. “They all bring something different and I’d add that (enforcer) Kurtis McDermid is a key part of that … They were really strong in the playoffs. They moved the puck obviously Cale and Taser and Bo and G — they have really good puck skill. And Josh has skill as well and he and EJ bring size and strength and penalty-kill ability.

“So we really liked the mix and they played really well in the playoffs. And we get G back into that group healthy. We feel good about it. It’s a solid part of our lineup.”

Offensively there also is no weakness. Expections for 2021 first-round draft pick Oskar Olausson are high. The young Swede 19 should step in nicely for older countryman Andre Burakovsky — the Avs’ only seemingly costly free-agent loss thus far.

DU pride. The Denver Pioneers had two former coaches get NHL head-coaching jobs within days last week. Jim Montgomery who led DU to the 2017 NCAA championship in Year 5 of his six-year tenure became the 29th head coach of the Boston Bruins. And Derek Lalonde a DU assistant under George Gwozdecky for five years through 2011 became the 28th head coach of the Detroit Red Wings.

“Two DU coaches that are behind Original Six benches is pretty special and we’re really proud of both guys” Pioneers head coach David Carle said.

Carle coached under both Montgomery and Lalonde. Carle was one of Lalonde’s assistants in 2013-14 for the junior-A Green Bay Gamblers of the United States Hockey League. Montgomery then added Carle to his DU staff and ultimately supported him as his successor when he became the Dallas Stars head coach in 2018.

Carle and Montgomery have maintained a close friendship.

“I spoke to him through the process here and there but he’s so swamped right now” Carle said of Montgomery. “The (four) kids and (wife) Emily are on their way out there already. He’s just been busy hiring people and talking to players and obviously they’ve got some big pending decisions on their player personnel. So I really just left him alone besides texting but thrilled for him — an opportunity well deserved in my opinion.”

I have the same opinion. “Monty” deserved a second chance after being let go in Dallas."

The 902-square-foot mosaic constructed with nearly 14500 doughnuts and 48000 ounces of icing was achieved on Tuesday at Basha High School in Chandler.

“We wanted to do something really special to celebrate Bashas’ 90th anniversary” Ashley Shick director of community relations and public affairs for Bashas’ said in a press release. “What could be more special than breaking a Guinness World Records title?

“We’re honored to be a record holder and are thankful for our colleagues customers and friends who came out to show their support for our efforts.”

The successful attempt overtook the previous record of 7040 doughnuts laid out over 512 square feet that was set in January 2012.

The doughnut challenge is the shortest-lived of the events planned for the 90-dayslong anniversary.

There will be gift card giveaways from July 27-Oct. 4 a community choice charity challenge from July 18-Sept. 23 and random acts of kindness Sept. 17-18.

The family-owned chain was officially acquired by California-based Raley’s in December but remains headquartered in the East Valley.

The sale guaranteed the continuation of Bashas’ store service across Arizona and New Mexico while allowing Bashas’ to be a fully formed operating company within Raley’s enterprise.

Bashas’ brands also include Food City and AJ’s Fine Foods.

Almost two years after marrying in Florida John Cena and wife Shay Shariatzadeh did it all over again — this time in a big way!

The newlyweds are once again newly wed having exchanged vows in Vancouver on Friday at the Rosewood Hotel Georgia in a lavish yet intimate ceremony.

TMZ reports the WWE star and actor 45 wore a navy suit and camel leather shoes while Shay 32 was gorgeous in a white halter gown covered in a floral motif. She topped — er bottomed — her look off with Jimmy Choo shoes as sparkly as they come.

Legally wed on October 12 2020 in Hillsborough Count Florida the couple wanted a swankier affair to remember something more romantic and elegant than their courthouse nuptials. Sounds like they go it!

Why Vancouver? Well Shay who was born in Iran was raised in Canada where they met while he was shooting his movie ""Playing with Fire.""

A few days before their first wedding John tweeted “Love involves constant effort. When you are truly ready to let love in and give to love all it needs to flourish I feel there is no greater more rewarding connection.”

He followed up after that first ceremony with this message: “'I will be happy if I only get (x).' This is a great way to mold an entire life spent chasing happiness and never finding joy.”

The actor was first linked to Shay a project manager for Vancouver-based company Avigilon a Motorola Solutions tech company in March 2019 after they were spotted on a four-hour dinner date.

Soon after “Extra” caught up with John who would only say “I'm always happy.”

Cena was previously married to Elizabeth Huberdeau from 2009-2012. He went on to date Nikki Bella and proposed to her in 2017. They called off their engagement in 2018.",,,,,,,,,,,,

Over the past six months or so the majority of markets have fallen a great deal with plenty sitting in bear-market territory (down 20% or more). So the obvious question now is: are there any bargains?

Clearly a fall in price alone does not mean a market is cheap. If a fast-growing stock suddenly warns that its growth has fallen off a cliff it’s share price will fall. But that doesn’t mean it has become cheaper – it merely reflects the company’s diminished prospects. So you need to look at valuations.

Conveniently enough fund manager Meb Faber of Cambria Investment Management has just put out his latest update on cyclically adjusted price/earnings ratios (CAPE) for global equity markets. CAPE is one of our favourite long-term valuation measures. It’s explained below but in short the lower the number the cheaper the market.

One thing is clear – most markets have indeed got a lot cheaper since the start of 2022. The median average CAPE was 18 in January; now it’s 15. The median CAPE on the quartile of least expensive markets has fallen from 14 to ten while the quartile of most overpriced markets are looking more reasonable with January’s median CAPE of 32 falling to 25 now.

In terms of the markets likely to be of most interest the UK was already relatively cheap in January on a CAPE of 15.9. It has held up somewhat better than many of its peers but is now even cheaper at 14.6. The US by contrast while considerably cheaper than it was remains one of the world’s most expensive markets with its CAPE falling from 38.8 to 28 (only India and Denmark are comparably expensive).

At the “cheap” end of the scale three markets trade on a CAPE of less than ten: Poland Egypt and Turkey. All three were also among the cheapest markets in January. Other notable cheap markets include Singapore Chile Brazil and Spain. You can use exchange-traded funds (ETFs) to get access to most of these markets such as the iShares MSCI Poland UCITS ETF (LSE: SPOL). The strategy is to buy a mix of the cheapest markets on the principle of “reversion to the mean” – the idea that historically cheap markets will return to more “normal” valuations.

Of course just because a market is cheap doesn’t mean it can’t get cheaper. The cheapest market in January on a CAPE of 8.1 was Russia. The latest update doesn’t list Russia because it’s uninvestable. This is why diversification is critical – it’s an example to bear in mind before putting money into Turkey or Egypt say.",,,,,,,,,

This week will determine its future,"A version of this story first appeared in CNN Business’ Before the Bell newsletter. Not a subscriber? You can sign up right here. You can listen to an audio version of the newsletter by clicking the same link.

New York CNN Business —

Netflix once a darling of Wall Street is suddenly on the ropes.

The streaming giant will report its second-quarter earnings on Tuesday and it’s shaping up to be one of the most consequential moments in the 25-year history of the company.

Netflix is having a terrible year. In April the company reported that it had lost subscribers in the first quarter of 2022 – the first time that had happened in any quarter for more than a decade. Netflix’s stock subsequently burst into flames (it’s currently down about 70% so far this year) wiping out billions of dollars in market value and the company laid off hundreds of employees.

The loss of subscribers wasn’t the only problem that caused Netflix (NFLX)’s world to be turned upside down like the kids on “Stranger Things.” A weak outlook for the second quarter shocked investors: Netflix (NFLX) predicted it would lose another 2 million in the spring.

Whatever happens Tuesday could reshape the future of the company as well as the entire streaming sector. As goes Netflix so goes streaming.

“There will be hell to pay if they report a number that is significantly higher than the 2 million loss being thrown around” Andrew Hare a senior vice president of research at Magid told CNN Business.

The streaming market has matured and saturated Hare noted. So investors will be asking: “What’s next and where is the growth going to come from?”

Netflix is pinning its hopes on potential savior: advertising.

The company announced Wednesday that it will partner with Microsoft on a new cheaper ad-supported subscription plan. Despite Reed Hastings Netflix’s CEO being allergic to the idea for years advertising is now a major part of Netflix’s plans to boost revenue going forward. The new tier will reportedly come before the end of 2022 but Netflix admits its nascent ad business is in its “very early days.”

The company is also focusing on clamping down on password sharing and focusing on creating compelling content to help turn the tide.

But will any of that matter if Tuesday’s numbers are so lackluster that Wall Street fully turns its back on Netflix?

“Once Netflix becomes heavily undervalued by the market all bets are off” Hare said.

The streamer does have some things working in its favor however.

For starters it’s still Netflix — the streaming leader with 221.6 million subscribers worldwide. It’s also reporting numbers in a marketplace that’s presenting factors out of Netflix’s control such as soaring inflation. So it has those excuses it can rely on to possibly soften the blow with investors.

“Investors will give them time to right the ship but they need to hear more solid plans about the path towards immediate growth” Hare said. “It’s all about communicating how they are evolving the business to ensure they continue to win in streaming… No one has the stomach for a business losing millions of subscribers every quarter.”

Wall Street CEOs grapple with the ‘R’ word

Big banks kicked off earnings season last week placing executives in front of investors and members of the media for questioning.

The rapport was fairly predictable: Bank execs want to discuss things like net interest margin and credit reserve builds. Everyone else had one thing on their mind: Recession.

There’s no denying that the economy is the story and investors believe that banking titans are co-authors. They want to know what happens next.

So here’s what we’ve gleamed so far about the state of the economy to come.

JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon:

Geopolitical tension high inflation waning consumer confidence the uncertainty about how high rates have to go and the never-before-seen quantitative tightening and their effects on global liquidity combined with the war in Ukraine and its harmful effect on global energy and food prices are very likely to have negative consequences on the global economy sometime down the road.

Morgan Stanley CEO James Gorman:

We might head into some form of recession – and I like many of others have tried to handicap it but we are frankly guessing at this stage but I think it’s unlikely to be a deep and dramatic recession at least in the U.S. I think Asia is a little behind. It depends how COVID rolls out and it’s sort of reemerging a little bit in some countries. And then Europe is obviously – is fighting the hardest right now because of the war in the Ukraine because of the pressure on gas and gas prices and so on.

First Republic Bank CEO and founder Jim Herbert:

The Fed has to play catch up. They’re behind and they’re doing – they’re likely to do so pretty quickly. So I think you’re likely to see the recession is probably coming of some kind and it will stabilize a lot of the excesses. I don’t think that it’s threatening overly to us… I think we’re in maybe the second or third inning of what’s going to be required to get inflation under control. That would be my personal opinion.

BNY Mellon president and CEO-elect Robin Vince:

You’ve all seen those charts. The S&P 500 had its worst first half performance in over 50 years 10-year Treasury had the worst start to the year since the beginning of the Index in the early 1970s. And with 150 basis points in rate hikes this is the fastest tightening cycle over six months since the Volcker era at the end of the 1970s. Underneath these headlines what we’re seeing across our platforms is that investors are clearly rebalancing and de-risking. We’re seeing asset reallocation from growth to value higher than expected cash balances and relatively shallow market liquidity making it harder for investors to move risk.

Wells Fargo CEO Charles Scharf:

You’re really looking at a number of scenarios that you need to be thoughtful about and include in your modeling. And for a number of quarters in a row we have had a significant weighting on the downside scenario already. And some of those scenarios are pretty severe right? And so you’ve got weightings on what some might term wild recession more severe recessions so you could create a lot of labels for them. But it’s a number of scenarios that have different severities of downside.

Citigroup CEO Jane Fraser:

While sentiment has shifted little of the data I see tells me the U.S. is on the cusp of a recession. Consumer spending remains well above pre-Covid levels with household savings providing a cushion for future stress. And as any employer will tell you the job market remains very tight.

I’m just back from Europe where it’s a different story. We expect a very difficult winter is coming and that’s due to disruptions in the energy supply. There is also increasing concern about second order effects on industrial production and how that will affect economic activity across the continent. And the mood is of course further darkened by the belief that the war in Ukraine will not end anytime soon.

If you're not caught up on the series yet check out our spoiler-free Resident Evil Netflix review.

Netflix's newly released Resident Evil series is an adaptation of Capcom's globally renowned video game series that gets a whole lot right. Showrunner Andrew Dabb finds a happy medium between original conceptualization and direct callbacks to the game's mechanics or intricacies rooted in Umbrella's flagship virus strains. It's nestled between Paul W.S. Anderson's action-forward non-canon route and Johannes Roberts' mirrored execution of survival horror scenes torn right from Capcom's first two games. Dabb's retooling as a Netflix television show may seem like an even farther swing in terms of settings characters and timelines — but in reality? It's the most Resident Evil-y adaptation we've seen yet.

Whether you've been playing Resident Evil games since the first S.T.A.R.S. helicopter crashed outside Spencer Mansion or only know Anderson's Hollywoodized remix of Capcom's otherwise atmospheric haunted horrors Netflix's show appeases both crowds. It may take place thirty years after the discovery of the T-Virus but Lance Reddick's Albert Wesker provides a link between replayed histories and infected new dawns. The ultimate goal for adaptations is to tell an original story within a universe that's already popularized utilizing what current fanbases adore while reeling in fresh viewers with comprehensible origins. Dabb's Resident Evil retains the very essence of Capcom's games from their investigative puzzles to more shoot-em-up styles made prominent in releases like Resident Evil 6.

By adhering to future timelines Wesker — who yes canonically died in a fatal volcano incident — connects Dabb's dystopian outbreak future with Umbrella's notable sins. Although it's Wesker's daughters who rise as the prominent leads driven apart by their father's childhood experimentations. Young Billie (Siena Agudong) and Young Jade (Tamara Smart) help us understand Albert's livelihood as a Wesker who's assumed parental mode after Raccoon City. Adult Jade (Ella Balinska) and Adult Billie (Adeline Rudolph) explore life in an apocalypse where Umbrella acts without mercy and University researchers seek to find ways to live amongst ""zeroes"" (what the show calls their infected hordes aka zombies).

The cornerstones of Resident Evil are fundamental: Umbrella outbreaks “zombies” and corruption. Anderson's blockbuster actioners starring Milla Jovovich as a fictional Alice may have conditioned mainstream audiences to believe otherwise but Dabb's infinitely more focused on recreating that experience of being stuck trying to decipher elaborate tests or crack a code using collectible items. From Resident Evil — where you control either Chris Redfield or Jill Valentine matching symbols to unlock mansion doors — to Ethan Winters dodging a nightmare fetus crawling around House Beneviento's basement gameplay has always featured non-brawler puzzle interactions. These ""less exciting"" elements sometimes ignored by media representations are a key to Dabb's storylines.

The Resident Evil Movies in (Chronological) Order 8 Images

In Episode 5 titled ""Home Movies"" Dabb accurately encapsulates the experience of Capcom's strategy sleuthing with minimal emphasis on zombie defenses. Adolescent Billie and Jade are home alone in their New Raccoon City crib with an objective — to understand more about Albert Wesker their family dynamic and Umbrella's secrets. What transpires is a series of clue retrievals and problem-solving while Jade's crush Simon (Connor Gosatti) helps them avoid surveillance cameras via FaceTime. It's not about smashing and grabbing or zombie interruptions. Billie and Jade use cleverness and cunning to unlock milestones in Umbrella's corruption which includes evidence that suggests Albert Wesker isn't just an unassuming Umbrella scientist who gets excited about kombucha on tap. These situational challenges match Resident Evil DNA and understand the games more fluently than other adaptations that would rather insert fan-favorite characters into undead shooting galleries.

Resident Evil isn't worsened by its suburbia bubble commentaries nor is any strong focus on character dialogue off base from Resident Evil playthroughs. Readable diary entries unravel the wildest exposition dumps and cutscenes ramble on about kidnapped president’s daughters brainwashed ex-partners broken families — character drama itself is at the core of every Resident Evil game. Most recently Resident Evil Village sent thirsty gamers into an excitable goth heat with their voluptuous Amazonian vampire socialite with zero to do with zombies. Yet Netflix's Resident Evil is getting review-bombed on IMDb because they dared cast a Black Wesker and focus on his Black children as leads? There's no difference between Heisenberg and Lady Dimitrescu's bickering or Billie and Jade's rivalry in the aftertimes — except one is less threatening to demographics who've forgotten what Resident Evil is about.

Dabb's Resident Evil focuses more on T-Virus modifications their unstable mutations and the effects of Umbrella's genetic testing. In the first episode a behemoth caterpillar burrows and viciously attacks Jade to remind us that Resident Evil is filled with spliced threats. Lickers T-dogs and a Tyrant are all there to reassure video game fans that they'll see their greatest foes brought to life — but then a monstrous mutant spider starts massacring trespassers in its underground tunnel. Where Anderson builds his own post-Matrix world of zombie hordes and Roberts sticks rigidly to William Birkin's transformation into Monster Birkin Dabb focuses more on the environmental mutations as Umbrella plays God with global implications. Dabb understands Resident Evil as more than ""point shotgun boom headshot"" in ways that feel plugged into the game franchise's sensibilities.

That's not to besmirch Anderson's or Roberts' adaptations. That's the exciting part about different creative teams rebooting the same source materials — everyone's interpretations can play in private sandboxes. Anderson's franchise may be a convoluted mess of Alice's kick-ass heroism spliced with game subplots like Nemesis Project yet the filmmaker uses Raccoon City and its fallout to unleash some wickedly entertaining adrenaline-pumper zombie combat. Then there's Roberts' adaptation which outside Leon S. Kennedy's weird bumbling officer persona and a killer Jennifer Paige needle drop nails the one-to-one recreation of Racoon City's destruction after Umbrella's carelessness. Dabb finds a new avenue to achieve what Roberts delivers in a less blatant display of fan-servicing while honoring Anderson's spirits of expressive freedoms by blasting forward past the still-acknowledged but old news histories of the game series.

Netflix's Resident Evil series is loaded with Easter Eggs for those who've played through Capcom's entire catalog. Although the timelines largely remain in 2036’s future or prior in South Africa's New Racoon City we still get leather-daddy O.G. Wesker an eyeballs-and-all Lisa Trevor after G-Virus transformation and callbacks to the Arklay Mountains. When Jade is breathless and facing a pivotal calm before incoming storms the camera frames a typewriter at the bottom of the screen to suggest it'd be a good time to save — just in case. Then there are evils like Chainsaw Man the infectious Doberman and Wesker's mind control Scarab seen in Resident Evil: Afterlife. The camera moves to highlight useful objects for characters to mimic angular and precise cinematography especially prominent in early games which aims the show's appreciation of Capcom's material like a bullseye kill shot.

CEO Evelyn Marcus (Paola Nuñez) — daughter of Umbrella legacy and T-Virus inventor James Marcus — is as ruthless and company-driven as any Resident Evil Umbrella patsy. Same for Turlough Convery's menacingly charming Umbrella hitman who orders mass executions like it was Tuesday. Dabb's dedication to expanding the world of Resident Evil still lives breathes and screams Capcom’s influence even when revealing new additions like they're testing characters for upcoming downloadable content packs. Lance Reddick's Wesker comes with a comparison point that he crushes while Marcus and Convery's agent are blank canvases. Lesser shows would insert generic baddies who pale compared to well-known franchise faces but not 2022's Resident Evil. They're cartoonishly evil cover-up addicts who'd rather dope their unwitting partners with test pills than dare watch Umbrella's stock price plunge.

Netflix's Resident Evil represents everything “Resident Evil'' in fresh (sans festering flesh) but attentively familiar ways. For all its alterations Andrew Dabb's series is a union of what both video game and movie audiences know — or don’t — about Resident Evil. Paul W.S. Anderson used title appeal to corner the action junkie market Johannes Roberts lifts entire sequences like silly putty on newspaper and Dabb sees the value in blending both approaches. The latest in a long string of Resident Evil adaptations may be the most faithful yet since there's a hell of a lot more to consider than ""that doesn't look like my favorite character."""

Renters in almost every part of the country have been feeling the sting of increasing prices since the start of the pandemic with the situation growing even more dire over the last few months.

Now PropTrack’s Rental Report for the June 2022 quarter has found the rental market will likely continue to heat up with Sydney and Melbourne to face the brunt of the crisis.

The report found a limited supply in rental properties is driving the competition with the number of new listing in June 2022 13.8 per cent lower than the decade average.

The number of renters per rental property listed on realestate.com.au has risen 28 per cent year-on-year across capital cities with Sydney and Melbourne experiencing the greatest increase.

Capital cities particularly Sydney and Melbourne are expected to continue to experienced rising rent prices. Picture: PropTrack Rental Report June 2022 Quarter

PropTrack Director of Economic Research and report author Cameron Kusher said rising prices for rentals in major cities will continue for some time particularly as more activity returns to these areas post-Covid.

“With overseas and interstate migration returning with borders now reopened it seems likely that rental conditions will tighten further over the coming months” he said.

“This is likely to be most evident in Sydney and Melbourne where rental demand and prices dropped throughout the pandemic but are now rebounding rapidly.”

The report also found that the new financial year means higher land tax charges for investors and higher interest rates in many jurisdictions.

Many areas are experiencing an increase in the number of potential renters. Picture: PropTrack Rental Report June 2022 Quarter

As a result of this many landlords will likely be looking to pass on these rising costs to renters where they can resulting in even higher rents.

Rental prices in Sydney have grown by 6 per cent and 3.7 per cent over the past year.

Rental growth has also been above five per cent across every other capital city.

The median rental price for a house in Sydney is $620 a week and $500 for a unit this is compared to $495 and $410 for rentals in regional NSW.

In Melbourne the median weekly price for a house is $450 and $400 for a unit compared to $420 and $330 in regional Victoria.

Nationally the median weekly rent for a house is $490 and $440 for units.

This table shows the median rents for all dwellings houses and units for all capital cities and regional areas. Picture: PropTrack Rental Report June 2022 Quarter

The biggest year on year increases in rents were seen in Darwin (14.6 per cent) Adelaide (10.3 per cent) and regional areas in South Australia (17 per cent) and Western Australia (12.8 per cent).

The PropTrack report found rents have been rising at the fastest pace in seven years with median weekly rental prices rising seven per cent compared to June last year.

However there could be some good news coming for those in regional areas with Mr Kusher saying there are signs the crisis is easing in some areas.

“There’s already some indication that in certain regional areas rental pressures are easing with more stock for rent and properties taking longer to lease” he said.

“This is logical as the impetus to shift regionally has eased as major cities have reopened. Some people that moved during the pandemic will now return to the big cities while others deciding to stay will look to purchase their own home.”

Australia is still very much in the midst of a rental crisis. Picture: NCA NewsWire / Gaye Gerard

This will come as welcome news to thousands of Aussies with some even left homeless as a result of the rental crisis.

But for other parts of the country rental options are likely going to remain extremely tight into the future with Mr Kusher saying it is “unlikely” that relief is on the way any time soon.

So what is the solution to the crisis? More rental properties.

Unfortunately increasing the number of available rentals is more easy said than done.

“Increased investor purchasing is addressing this but it will take some time to ease the existing pressure” he said.

“Federal and state governments continue to offer incentives to first-home buyers. With property prices falling and rents rising this may encourage some to move from renting to ownership.

“Over time this may ease some of the rental supply pressures but it is likely to mostly be offset by the return of arrivals from overseas most of whom seek rental accommodation on arrival.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMikwFodHRwczovL3d3dy53ZWVrbHl0aW1lc25vdy5jb20uYXUvYWZmaWxpYXRlcy9rYXlvL2FudGhvbnktbWlsZm9yZC1yZXBvcnRlZGx5LWhlYWRpbmctaG9tZS10by1xdWVlbnNsYW5kL25ld3Mtc3RvcnkvOWVhNGY5MDgyZGM4NjNjYTI3MjQyOTYzMGE0YmZjYzHSAZcBaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cud2Vla2x5dGltZXNub3cuY29tLmF1L2FmZmlsaWF0ZXMva2F5by9hbnRob255LW1pbGZvcmQtcmVwb3J0ZWRseS1oZWFkaW5nLWhvbWUtdG8tcXVlZW5zbGFuZC9uZXdzLXN0b3J5LzllYTRmOTA4MmRjODYzY2EyNzI0Mjk2MzBhNGJmY2MxP2FtcA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Former $1 million man makes huge NRL call,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.weeklytimesnow.com.au/affiliates/kayo/anthony-milford-reportedly-heading-home-to-queensland/news-story/9ea4f9082dc863ca272429630a4bfcc1 on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMikwFodHRwczovL3d3dy53ZWVrbHl0aW1lc25vdy5jb20uYXUvYWZmaWxpYXRlcy9rYXlvL2FudGhvbnktbWlsZm9yZC1yZXBvcnRlZGx5LWhlYWRpbmctaG9tZS10by1xdWVlbnNsYW5kL25ld3Mtc3RvcnkvOWVhNGY5MDgyZGM4NjNjYTI3MjQyOTYzMGE0YmZjYzHSAZcBaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cud2Vla2x5dGltZXNub3cuY29tLmF1L2FmZmlsaWF0ZXMva2F5by9hbnRob255LW1pbGZvcmQtcmVwb3J0ZWRseS1oZWFkaW5nLWhvbWUtdG8tcXVlZW5zbGFuZC9uZXdzLXN0b3J5LzllYTRmOTA4MmRjODYzY2EyNzI0Mjk2MzBhNGJmY2MxP2FtcA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMijgFodHRwczovL3RoZXdlc3QuY29tLmF1L2J1c2luZXNzL21lZGlhL3dlc3QtYXVzc2llcy1jb3VsZC1iZS1mb3JjZWQtdG8tcGF5LXRvLXdhdGNoLWVhZ2xlcy1kb2NrZXJzLW1hdGNoLWJyb2FkY2FzdHMtdW5kZXItZm94dGVsLWRlYWwtYy03NTU3MDc30gGSAWh0dHBzOi8vdGhld2VzdC5jb20uYXUvYnVzaW5lc3MvbWVkaWEvd2VzdC1hdXNzaWVzLWNvdWxkLWJlLWZvcmNlZC10by1wYXktdG8td2F0Y2gtZWFnbGVzLWRvY2tlcnMtbWF0Y2gtYnJvYWRjYXN0cy11bmRlci1mb3h0ZWwtZGVhbC1jLTc1NTcwNzcuYW1w?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,West Aussies could be forced to pay to watch Eagles Dockers match broadcasts under Foxtel deal,"WA footy fans could be forced to pay to watch Eagles and Dockers games under a News Corp-backed proposal as the AFL seeks to ramp up the money it makes from the league’s lucrative TV rights.

According to News Corp’s The Australian the AFL wants Seven and Foxtel to increase their bids to as close to $600 million annually to keep them as rights holders until 2029 but Network Ten is considering blowing them out of the water with an offer for both the free-to-air and pay TV rights.

One option on the table the publisher wrote on Monday is for Foxtel to broadcast more live games of Perth and Adelaide’s local teams - both AFL mad cities.

That would mean supporters of the West Coast Eagles Fremantle Dockers Adelaide Crows and Port Adelaide Power would no longer view their beloved teams on Seven and instead be forced to fork out for Foxtel.

Meanwhile Nine is reportedly after a package of Thursday night games but the AFL is believed to be opposed to splitting the rights across more than two broadcasters.

But that all depends on how much is offered."

That would mean supporters of the West Coast Eagles Fremantle Dockers Adelaide Crows and Port Adelaide Power would no longer view their beloved teams on Seven and instead be forced to fork out for Foxtel.

Meanwhile Nine is reportedly after a package of Thursday night games but the AFL is believed to be opposed to splitting the rights across more than two broadcasters.

But that all depends on how much is offered."

Jeanne Shaheen of New Hampshire is requesting a full review of what caused an emergency alarm to befalsely activated at the Seabrook Nuclear Power Station earlier this week after what she called ""a breakdown in communications"" transpired between the plant state and local officials.

The emergency alarm went off Tuesday morning warning many in the area that there was a problem at the plant and advising them to evacuate the vicinity.

""This caused chaos and left police fire and state and local officials with few answers"" Shaheen a Democrat wrote in a letter to the president of NextEra Energy the plant owner on Thursday. ""I am deeply concerned with the insufficient communication during and in the aftermath of this inadvertent alarm.""

The state Homeland Security and Emergency Management agency and NextEra Energy put out statements Tuesday saying the alarm was false more than 30 minutes after beachgoers in nearby Hampton and Rye said they heard announcements at about 11 a.m. about the beaches being closed because of a problem at the plant.

Brian Booth the plant's site vice president sent a letter to Gov. Chris Sununu on Friday saying the siren system was inadvertently activated during routine testing. He wrote that the company is investigating and will take steps to ensure it doesn't happen again WMUR-TV reported.

The plant is about 40 miles (64 kilometers) north of Boston and 10 miles (16 kilometers) south of Portsmouth. It has operated since 1990.

More than 300 major companies including Amazon Procter & Gamble HP and Salesforce have now signed onto a pledge to achieve net-zero emissions by 2040. Net-zero pledges from countries cover about 70% of global gross domestic product and carbon emissions the International Energy Agency said in a report last May.

But net zero -- which calls for a neutral carbon impact through the removal of the same amount of emissions from the atmosphere that an entity releases -- has drawn backlash from activists and some experts. The approach allows companies to continue releasing significant amounts of carbon while pursuing emissions offsets which are difficult to verify and sometimes rely on technology that has yet to be developed environmental advocates told ABC News.

Many advocates have called for companies to instead pursue a goal of ""real-zero"" emissions which calls for the outright elimination of carbon emissions. The more ambitious goal would ensure that companies dramatically reduce carbon emissions and would remove the challenge of developing and vetting carbon offsets advocates told ABC News.

But the paradigm shift toward real-zero emissions goals remains in its infancy and could bring some economic disruption dramatically altering or eliminating industries that rely on fossil fuels such as oil and gas the advocates said.

Katie Tubb research fellow on energy and environment issues at the conservative think tank Heritage Foundation took such concerns further saying a transition toward real zero would be infeasible for many companies deliver only a fraction of the carbon emission cuts needed worldwide and potentially increase costs for companies and consumers.

Advocates however said the urgent need for carbon emissions reduction requires an ambitious approach like real zero.

""Companies use the mantra net zero as a fig leaf for continuing whatever they're doing"" David Klein a mathematics professor at California State University Northridge where he participates in the Climate Science Program told ABC News.

""Think of it as a pot of water being heated by a flame underneath it"" he added. ""As long as that flame is on as long as energy goes into the system the temperature will continue to increase. Instead of net zero we need to decrease the concentration of greenhouse gasses in the atmosphere by radically decreasing emissions.""

A U.N. climate report released in April sounded an urgent alarm that the world is on pace to far exceed an increase of 1.5 degrees celsius above pre-industrial temperatures -- a level beyond which many scientists say climate change will wreak damaging effects. At the Paris Climate Accords in 2015 196 parties committed to set a goal of well below 2 degrees celsius of warming preferably below 1.5 degrees celsius of warming.

""It's now or never if we want to limit warming to 1.5 degrees celsius"" Jim Skea a professor of sustainable energy at Imperial College London said in a statement upon the release of the April U.N. climate report. ""Without immediate and deep emissions reductions across all sectors it will be impossible.""

The U.N. which said it supports an eventual net-zero economy worldwide acknowledged the importance of verifying commitments to net zero. The U.N. says on its website that net-zero commitments ""must be backed by credible action."" In March U.N. Secretary-General António Guterres established a group of experts who will recommend standards for net-zero emissions pledges.

But assessment of an entity's fulfillment of a net-zero goal poses a significant potentially insurmountable challenge that detracts from the global effort to reduce carbon emissions said Tyson Slocum director of the energy program at the consumer advocacy group Public Citizen.

""The ability to effectively oversee and verify these programs is very difficult"" he said noting the challenge of not only estimating a company's emissions but also the carbon savings delivered by its offsets. ""Even if we had better protocols there are concerns about how that's going to work effectively.""

""A lot of the push around net zero and its reliance on offsets is actually a distraction from meaningful action to address the climate crisis"" he added.

The rapid development of renewable energy sources has equipped industry with the necessary resources to embark on the shift to real zero environmental advocates said. Last year renewable energy sources accounted for about 12.2% of total U.S. energy consumption and about 20.1% of electricity generation the IEA said. Worldwide the share of renewable energy in electricity generation stood at 29% in 2020 the group said.

Still few companies have taken up the goal of real zero. One such company NextEra Energy is a holding company that oversees Florida Power & Light a utility company that serves more than 12 million people in the state and aims to achieve real-zero emissions by 2045.

The company believes it can preserve the reliability and competitive price of its electricity while eliminating emissions Chris McGrath the communication leader at Florida Power & Light told ABC News.

""Real zero for us is not a goal that relies on offsets"" McGrath said. ""We're pursuing real zero because we think it's achievable. We think the technology exists now that we'll be able to eliminate emissions and keep the lights on 24/7.""

The company plans to achieve real zero by expanding the share of energy it derives from solar improving battery storage that holds solar energy through dark periods overnight or when it's cloudy continuing its nuclear energy operations and developing green hydrogen technology McGrath said.

Green hydrogen technology would use renewable energy to power a process that extracts hydrogen from water allowing the hydrogen to be used for tasks like powering vehicles or generating electricity. But the technology has not yet been developed leaving the real-zero goal of Florida Power & Light open to criticism that it relies on technology that doesn't currently exist just as some net-zero goals do.

In response McGrath said the technology doesn't represent a major leap in development.

""Burning hydrogen is not a new technology"" McGrath said. ""What's unique for us is using solar power to power the process.""

""We don't pretend there aren't going to be challenges associated with achieving this goal but we've been on this journey for more than two decades"" he added.

Environmental advocates said rapid progress in renewable energy technology has brought real-zero carbon emissions goals within reach but they acknowledged that the shift would disrupt the economy and dramatically impact industries that rely on fossil fuels.

""There are some industries like an airline or a big oil company where that's going to be a bit of a challenge"" said Slocum the director of the energy program at Public Citizen. ""They can't really effectively get to real zero.""

The availability and affordability of renewable energy will ease the transition for many companies he added.

""There are all sorts of readily available technologies employable and affordable that companies and other entities can incorporate into their systems"" he said.

Tubb the research fellow on energy and environment issues at the conservative think tank Heritage Foundation rejected such a rosy outlook. Real-zero emissions cuts from the narrow set of U.S. companies that could access large-scale renewables in the short term would only make up a fraction of the emission cuts needed worldwide she said. Plus the significant shift in operations will impose costs on companies and consumers she added.

""This is a lot of expense for a company to take on with dubious environmental benefits on the global warming side of things"" she said.

Rolf Skar the campaign director for environmental advocacy group Greenpeace USA said the call for wide scale commitment to real zero is realistic rather than radical considering the current pace of carbon emissions and the threat posed by climate change.

""If it's radical it's radical because of the necessity of the crisis we're in now"" he said.",,,,,,,,,

The powerhouse brand’s name has gone up on the barricades in front of the former two-level H&M space on NorthPark Center’s Park Lane side.

The store is opening in “winter 2023” according to the sign which includes the message “Here for however Dallas wants to move.”

While Nike isn’t talking yet this is likely a concept that may not be in Texas yet. When Nike opened in NorthPark in 2011 it was the brand’s first store in the state that wasn’t a factory outlet. The H&M store opened the same month and it too was that chain’s first store in Texas.

According to planning documents filed with the state Nike is planning to spend $3 million to open a Rise store in NorthPark. It’s the brand’s newest concept with only a few open in Guangzhou China; Seoul South Korea; and just last week in London. Published reports say a Rise store is focused on digital innovation and premium personalization.

It must be a pretty elaborate new concept because the sneaker giant already has a large store in NorthPark and the new store will take a while to build.

Nike will be vacating a 25000-square-foot space in the south corridor between Neiman Marcus and Dillard’s. That section of the mall is attracting some larger concept stores from luxury brands.

Louis Vuitton doubled its size at NorthPark with a new store in 2020 and Saint Laurent moved into a bigger store in 2019 from Highland Park Village. Barricades along two other huge spaces in the same corridor have signs up about future moves by Gucci and Burberry.

NorthPark declined to share specifics about the Nike store but said it’s in line with the mall’s leasing strategy “to introduce exciting new flagship concepts across all retail categories.” Several new stores are opening this summer.

NorthPark owner Nancy Nasher has long had a strategy to attract flagships no matter the category ranging from one-offs in Texas such as three-level Italian food emporium Eataly to the biggest local stores for home retailer Williams Sonoma and fashion apparel brand Aritzia.

What makes a store a flagship? NorthPark defines it as a store “featuring the full depth of each retailer’s collection alongside its latest product releases reserved for only a few select locations worldwide.”

NorthPark Center's Nike store opened in 2011. It was the first Nike store in Texas that wasn't an outlet at the time and was one of only six new concept stores that Nike had in the U.S. that year. The 25000-square-foot store is in the south corridor between Neiman Marcus and Dillard's. (Maria Halkias)

Proposals for 10000 new homes in Carlisle are developing at pace.

A business case For St Cuthbert’s Garden Village is set to be submitted to Government by summer 2023.

Carlisle City Council’s Place Panel is set to meet next Thursday to discuss a number of issues around economic growth and councillors will receive an update on the project a scheme to build 10325 new homes south of the city over the next 30 years.

It is hoped the new community will herald an economic boom for Carlisle and is one of the council’s key economic priorities.

The report reveals that the business case will be submitted to Government by summer 2023 so the priority has been “to appoint suitably qualified and experienced legal and financial advisors” to support the project.

Good progress has been made in the early planning stages of the scheme the report said.

A number of risks to the project have been identified as part of the project management. An overriding risk is that a failure to plan comprehensively for the growth of St Cuthbert’s would result in growth occurring to the south of the city in a much more fragmented and incremental nature.

The report added that the main risk remained the continued availability of adequate resourcing for the technical work.

The new community is also intrinsically linked to the delivery of Carlisle’s Southern Link Road.

March and April saw a selection process for legal and financial advisors to support the first stage of planning. A consortium of Sharpe Pritchard and 31Ten Consulting has been chosen.



Sharpe Pritchard has experience in supporting councils with major projects like development corporations. 31Ten financial advisors on housing have previously partnered with Cornwall Council on their own garden settlement.

The proposals took a key step forward earlier this month as the Northern Trust Company entered into a planning promotion agreement with a private landowner for land at the site.

Jane Meek corporate director of economic development told councillors at a meeting last month that work is underway to produce a design code for Carlisle starting with St Cuthbert’s Garden Village.

She said that the city council hopes the 30000 home development would be “an exemplar of good design”.",,,,,,,,,,,,
NOC,Northrop Grumman,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiaGh0dHBzOi8vYXZpYXRpb253ZWVrLmNvbS9zaG93bmV3cy9mYXJuYm9yb3VnaC1haXJzaG93L2hvdy1ub3J0aHJvcC1ncnVtbWFuLXBsYW5uaW5nLWdyb3ctaW50ZXJuYXRpb25hbGx50gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,How Northrop Grumman Is Planning To Grow Internationally,"LONDON—Northrop Grumman recently known for niche high-end aircraft and space systems is looking to increase its presence in Europe through adaptive approaches to how it develops new weapons programs by taking on more of a local flair.

While the company’s biggest work at the moment is large expensive programs for the U.S. such as the B-21 bomber and the Ground Based Strategic Deterrent CEO Kathy Warden in an interview with Aviation Week points to a software-based effort as key to how the company wants to adjust. And the adjustment is needed as more nations are looking to build their own industrial base instead of simply buying American.

“We have European operations and those are always our front into countries in Europe to ensure that we are able to offer them sovereign capability” Warden says. “We have local workforces in the countries where we don’t—we partner to build that industrial base capacity that shows local content—but there is obviously reach-back into assets in the U.S. so that we can bring forward products that are more mature and sell those as well. That model is less favorable today as it was in the past.”

An example of how the company wants to adjust is the Integrated Air and Missile Defense Battle Command System—a complex network integration of sensors software and computer hardware developed for the U.S. Army to create one command-and-control system for air and missile defense.

“At its core it is a set of hardware and software that is an architecture that can be replicated in other countries that connects their inherent capabilities” Warden says. “So if they have their own sensors their own kinetic effectors you don’t take what the U.S. uses you integrate theirs. And at the core what we’re bringing to them is the software and the architecture. That means there’s a lot of local contact in the software development and in the integration of assets that the country already owns. And that model is in my view more of what the future looks like.”

This “hybrid” would take investment in a product already made by another nation—the U.S. for the IBCS example—but then allow another nation to integrate its native systems Warden says. The IBCS has already been picked up by Poland and Northrop is in talks to sell it to Australia Japan and the UK she says.

For aircraft this would follow the broader trend of the open systems architecture that is being engineered into modern production aircraft including Northrop’s B-21. This model keeps the hardware largely the same throughout the aircraft’s life but leaves it open for quickly updating software sensors and other mission systems from multiple vendors.

“The platform itself won’t change probably for decades but the software itself can change very rapidly whether that’s the sensors the vehicle management system communications and I see that being the future for hardware-based systems” Warden says. “That the platform will have stability but the innards if you will of the system will be able to be modernized quite rapidly.”

The biggest growth area Northrop sees abroad is in space with budgets rising in this domain more than others.

“That’s primarily because there is a recognition of what can be accomplished in the space domain and maybe even more importantly that space up until five or six years ago was viewed as an uncontested domain one in which a nation could operate freely wasn’t as congested as it is today” Warden says. “So [there are] lots of new dynamics in terms of how one operates effectively from space and supporting military superiority.”

While some nations are shifting more of their intelligence surveillance and reconnaissance (ISR) missions to space Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has caused a surge of ISR aircraft to the region and that has emphasized the need for this type of aircraft says Tom Jones Northrop’s vice president of aeronautics systems.

“There is and will continue to be a need for persistent regionalized ISR and command and control” Jones says pointing to the company’s RQ-4 Global Hawks E-2D Advanced Hawkeyes and MQ-8 Fire Scouts as relevant aircraft.

“I think that gives the opportunity for a lot of the other countries who will now build up to the ISR and command and control that we think is going to be critical as we continue to monitor the eastern reaches of NATO” Jones says.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiaGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmV1cmFzaWFudGltZXMuY29tL2hpZ2gtZW5lcmd5LWxhc2VyLXdlYXBvbnMtb25lLXN0ZXAtY2xvc2VyLXRvLXJlYWxpemF0aW9uLW5vcnRocm9wLWdydW1tYW4v0gFoaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZXVyYXNpYW50aW1lcy5jb20vaGlnaC1lbmVyZ3ktbGFzZXItd2VhcG9ucy1vbmUtc3RlcC1jbG9zZXItdG8tcmVhbGl6YXRpb24tbm9ydGhyb3AtZ3J1bW1hbi8?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,US Military’s ‘Top Most Priority’ – High Energy Laser Weapons One Step Closer To Realization – Northrop Grumman,"US Defense contractor Northrop Grumman Corporation announced on July 11 the achievement of a significant milestone in high-energy laser (HEL) weapons development with the completion of the preliminary design review (PDR) for a 300 kilowatt Class HEL prototype.

The company said that the PDR was part of a technical process to ensure that its design can realize a precise low-cost speed-of-light technology for military operations.

In March 2021 the US Department of Defense (DoD) awarded Northrop Grumman a $72 million contract under the High Energy Laser Scaling Initiative (HELSI) to demonstrate a HEL prototype using Northrop Grumman’s coherent beam combining technology.

The HELSI is a Pentagon initiative to develop a new 300-kilowatt-class laser weapon prototype for technology demonstration.

“This is an important step in combining high-power laser beams into a single beam that can be scaled for maximum power” said Robert Fleming vice president and general manager strategic space systems Northrop Grumman.

“We’re on track to demonstrate the technology leveraging our decades of experience in the field.”

According to the company the prototype can be scaled up to more than a megawatt. It will be tested at progressively higher powers later this year to prove the coherent beam combining (CBC) design.

Beam combining involves combining the outputs of multiple laser sources to obtain a single high-energy output beam. In contrast ‘Coherent’ beam incorporation would involve the merger of coherent waves – waves with a constant phase difference.

Another method to fuse two laser beams is ‘Spectral’ beam combining (SBC) also known as wavelength beam combining which involves superimposing the outputs of several laser emitters at specific wavelengths in an area to form a single beam.

The SBC technology was used by Lockheed Martin and its subsidiary Aculight Corporation to demonstrate a series of laser weapon prototypes: first the 30 kilowatts then 60 kilowatts and ultimately 100 kilowatts in October 2019 which then also won them a HELSI contract to demonstrate a 300 kilowatts class laser in 2022.

Lockheed Martin is only one of the three companies participating in the HELSI initiative led by the Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD) and the US Army promotes it. Other companies are Nutronics Inc. sponsored by the Navy and General Atomics sponsored by the US Air Force (USAF).

In May 2020 Dynetics also announced that it would work to increase the power of a 100 kW-class system to the 300kW-class system for the US Army and demonstrate a prototype in 2022.

High-Energy Lasers US Military’s Top Priority

The incorporation of laser weapons technology is currently one of the high-priority targets of the US military especially after the US lawmakers asked the armed services to speed up efforts toward developing Directed Energy Weapons (DEWs) in early July.

The US Army plans to have two types of laser weapons systems for air defense by 2022 which include the 50 kilowatts class weapons and 300 kilowatts class weapons fitted on Stryker armored vehicles manufactured by General Dynamics.

The 50-kilowatt laser weapon is designated as the DE-MSHORAD (Directed Energy – Maneuver Short-Range Air Defense) which will be used to shoot short-range rockets artillery and drones. In contrast the 300 kilowatts beams will be used against cruise missiles.

Initially Northrop Grumman and Raytheon competed for the 50-kilowatt laser weapon system. Still Northrop Grumman dropped out of the program while Raytheon recently demonstrated its prototype in May against 60-millimeter mortars and several small medium and large drones.

Meanwhile the US Air Force received its first high-energy laser weapon on July 12 called LANCE (or Laser Advancements for Next-generation Compact Environments) from Lockheed Martin.

LANCE is a pod weapon that can be fitted on an aircraft with the primary laser weapon supplied by Lockheed Martin and the pod carrying LANCE made by Boeing. Also the beam control system that trains the laser on its target is provided by Northrop Grumman.

It is unclear how much power this new laser weapon will produce but reports indicate it will probably not exceed 100 kilowatts.

It is also unknown which aircraft this podded laser weapon will ultimately be tested on or deployed. However Lockheed Martin had previously shown the pod carried by an F-16 fighter jet in its concept art. At the same time Boeing had tested a pre-prototype pod shape on a USAF F-15 fighter.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiP2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZ0LmNvbS9jb250ZW50LzBmOTg3ZWJiLTk2M2ItNDcwMi1iM2I1LWVhMDMzNjc4NWJhYtIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,US defence industry boss calls for clarity on what arms Ukraine needs,"Try unlimited access Only MX$100 for 4 weeks

While Air Force Secretary Frank Kendall declined to say when the service will choose a manufacturer for the fighter jet that will be the cornerstone of the Next Generation Air Dominance family of systems he offered a small clue about the trajectory of the highly-classified program.

“It’s not imminent but it’s not all that far away” Kendall said in an exclusive interview at the Royal International Air Tattoo. “There’s a little hint I’ll drop for you.”

The Air Force has confirmed three elements of the NGAD program so far: a manned sixth-generation fighter the AIM-260 Joint Advanced Tactical Missile currently under development and a suite of drones — what Kendall calls “collaborative combat aircraft” — that will augment the manned fighter in battle.

In June Kendall announced that the NGAD fighter had progressed to the engineering manufacturing and development stage prompting speculation about whether the Air Force had chosen a prime contractor for the program. However later that month Kendall said there was still ongoing competition for NGAD raising further questions about the status of the program.

Although Kendall declined to answer most of Breaking Defense’s questions about NGAD he stated that the program will not have a single prime in the “systems integrator” that oversees the makeup of the family of systems and that the Air Force has separate acquisition efforts for each of the elements.

“The overarching integrator will probably be the government with probably some industry help” he said. “The NGAD platform itself will have a traditional prime [contractor].”

The Air Force has been unwilling to discuss which aerospace companies are involved in NGAD. Boeing Lockheed Martin and Northrop Grumman could potentially manufacture the sixth-gen fighter but it is unclear whether all three are currently still participating in the ongoing competition.

At least one full-scale NGAD fighter demonstrator made its inaugural flight in 2020. Air Force officials have declined to give further details about the maker of the aircraft or its capabilities although they have made clear that digital engineering has been a critical technology that has allowed the service to develop it much more quickly than onlookers had expected.

“What we did was an experimental prototype” Kendall said in June. “We basically had an X-plane program which was designed to reduce the risk of some of the key technologies that we would need for a production program.”

Kendall has said the Air Force plans to field NGAD “by the end of the decade.” How many the service will ultimately buy is still yet to be disclosed.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXGh0dHBzOi8vbWlsLmluLnVhL2VuL25ld3MvdXMtbmF0aW9uYWwtZ3VhcmQtcy1mLTE2LWZpZ2h0ZXJzLXJlY2VpdmVkLW5ldy1zYWJyLWFwZy04My1yYWRhcnMv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,US National Guard's F-16 fighters received new SABR APG-83 radars,"F-16`s APG-83 SABR radar.

US National Guard’s F-16 fighters received new SABR APG-83 radars

The installation of the APG-83 Scalable Agile Beam Radar (SABR) on a fleet of 72 fighters F-16 of the United States National Guard was completed recently in the U.S.

The APG-83 “Scalable Agile Beam Radar” radars are designed by Northrop Grumman Corporation.

The installation of new radars increases fightersnoperational viability and reliability providing pilots with 5th generation fighter radar capabilities.

The new radar with an active electronically scanned array (AESA) allows faster tracking detection and identification of more targets.

Such targets for example include air-to-air and air-to-surface targets air defense radars and longer-range air-to-surface missiles.

In addition SABR’s all-weather high-resolution synthesized aperture radar mapping produces a better surface image than previous systems allowing for more accurate guidance.

“The completion of these deliveries highlights Northrop Grumman’s continued commitment to rapidly field 5th generation radar capability to the fleet to counter and defeat increasingly sophisticated threats to our nation and its allies” said Mark Rossi SABR Program Director Northrop Grumman.

This upgrade is a response to the operational need of US Northern Command to modernize the country’s defense against cruise missiles.

American officials regularly point to Russian and Chinese efforts to develop and implement improved cruise missiles.

The previous radar F-16 had almost zero capabilities against cruise missiles.

“If money were not the decisive factor we would equip them with all aircraft just because it has great capabilities and is much more reliable” said Lieutenant Colonel Trujillo.

Installing SABR radars is arguably the simplest but most effective update that at least part of the F-16 fleet should now receive."

""Hearst Magazines and Yahoo may earn commission or revenue on some items through the links below.""

As an Emmy Award-winning actress dancer singer and entrepreneur Julianne Hough 33 puts her body — and her skin — through a lot. So it makes sense that the products she uses on a daily basis are important to her. We caught up with the multi-hyphenate entertainer to talk about her summer skincare routine making her Broadway debut in the play POTUS upcoming projects and whether she sees a Broadway musical in her future.

When it comes to her morning and nighttime skincare routines Hough tells Woman's Day ""I’ve started using a different face product called Oak Essentials and I use all their balms because I’m all about my skin. With all the makeup I wear it is important for me to have clean smooth skin.""

""For my body it’s all about how I take care of it. And BIC Soleil Escape is my way to replenish my skin and my body in a way that feels luxurious and relaxing while also setting me up for success the next day – especially going into my Broadway shows and constantly applying body makeup. It makes me feel like a brand-new woman every time I focus on my skin whether it’s with shaving or my skincare or with my face – all of it feels so good"" continues Hough who recently partnered with BIC for their Soleil Escape ""Tickle Your Senses"" campaign.

As far as her experience in POTUS working with a cast of women she calls ""so incredible"" Hough says that ""being a part of the community is the best part about being on Broadway. It really is a sense of community where you’re not going to do just this project and never see these people again. This is a deep-rooted community and it’s very special as far as the personal experience. From an artistry experience I get to work with Susan Stroman who is a legend and five-time Tony Award winner as well as Selina Fillinger who is our young playwright. And the entire cast is female mainly our producers and creative team are too so I’ve never experienced a project with this many leaders that are female and it’s been such a joy.""

Hough admits that many people herself included assumed that her Broadway debut would have been in a musical. ""But I think this topic the concept and context of what this play represents reflects where I’m at in my life that I wanted to be a part of this. I do see a future though for musicals and again this isn’t about checking off the bucket list and then peacing out. I want to be part of this community as long as they’ll have me.""

So what's next for Hough's career after POTUS closes in August? In addition to having ""a couple film and TV projects in the pipeline"" she says she's continuing to grow her wine company with actress Nina Dobrev Fresh Vine Wine as well as her wellness company KINRGY. ""There are lots of fun things coming in the next six months to a year.""

""From a life perspective I’m so excited about this phase of life living in New York and feeling the energy and connected to the world. LA feels like the entertainment world but New York feels like the whole world – it’s fashion it’s beauty it’s theatre it’s wellness it’s whatever you want it to be. You have everything here and you’re constantly being introduced to new ideas and people and concepts"" she says. ""I feel like I’m in a very curious stage of life right now.""

Federal prosecutors say Jaymin Vinson a former engineer at Nucor Steel Gallatin received ""kickbacks"" in exchange for his help in steering the contract for a mill expansion project to an engineering architecture and construction firm led by an associate of his.

Through his work with Nucor Vinson 41 met Tony Berenyi owner of the South Carolina-based Berenyi Inc. while working on a separate project in 2008 prosecutors said adding the pair formed a years-long professional and personal relationship.

In court documents prosecutors said the two men had dinner in late 2017 at Belterra Casino Hotel and Berenyi proposed paying Vinson a ""finder's fee"" for steering the contract for the mill expansion project to Berenyi Inc.

The arrangement according to prosecutors was a ""kickback scheme"" in which Berenyi agreed to pay Vinson a portion of his firm's net profits or gross billings from the project.

The kickback began in June 2018 during the initial consultation phase of the project prosecutors said adding Berenyi's firm included those payments as a cost in its proposal to Nucor for construction management services without the company's knowledge or approval.

Berenyi's firm received a construction management services contract for the mill expansion project valued at $14.9 million in October 2018 according to the plea agreement filed in U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Kentucky.

Vinson was paid by Berenyi's company from the billings it received from Nucor for services the firm provided according to prosecutors.

From June 2018 to March 2019 prosecutors said Vinson received eight separate payments via wire transfer or check from Berenyi or his company totaling $452125.

Nucor was unaware of the alleged kickback scheme prosecutors said in court filings.

Berenyi exposed the payments to Nucor in November 2019 prosecutors say adding Vinson was fired following an investigation. Nucor terminated its contract with Berenyi Inc. in December 2019 according to court filings.

Prosecutors say the full loss to Nucor was around $1.1 million or 15% of the payments the company made to Berenyi Inc. before the contract's termination.

A search of federal court records did not return any results for criminal charges filed against Berenyi. A spokesperson for the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Eastern District of Kentucky said she ""cannot talk about any potential or ongoing investigations.""

Vinson's attorney also didn't respond to a request for comment.

'All of my customers are my friends'

Berenyi said his firm has worked with Nucor for 25 years on various projects. He denied the allegations and said Vinson extorted his company.

According to Berenyi Vinson represented Nucor as the project manager for the steel mill expansion and he was in charge of the invoices.

He said he never negotiated fees with Vinson. It was only after his firm was awarded the mill expansion contract that Vinson ""started squeezing us"" Berenyi added.

Berenyi said he informed Nucor as soon as solid evidence of Vinson's alleged extortion was gathered.

He and Vinson have known each other since 2008 Berenyi said but he treated Vinson no differently than any other customer. ""All of my customers are my friends"" Berenyi told The Enquirer. ""I get to know them intimately.""

Court records show Vinson faces possible penalties of up to 20 years in prison a fine of up to $250000 and three years of probation. As part of his plea Vinson has agreed to forfeit the $452125 he received.

Vinson is scheduled to appear for sentencing before District Court Judge David Bunning on March 8 according to court filings.",,,,,,,,,,,,

The RTX 3060 Ti is one of the best graphics cards on its own but it’s these two features that have made the difference for me.

These aren’t crucial to my streaming experience but the quality of life improvements these two features provide make it difficult for me to even think about switching back to AMD graphics.

Recommended Videos

NVENC makes my CPU obsolete

I had been an AMD user for years until I switched to the GTX 1080 Ti in 2020 and upgrading to the RTX 3060 Ti in 2021 for better power efficiency. I was also upgrading my CPU around the same time going from a Ryzen 7 3700X to a Ryzen 9 3950X for streaming. I was excited to finally have one of the best CPUs for streaming and I started tweaking my settings in Open Broadcaster Software for the best quality and performance. But my CPU usage was super high the performance was bad in my games and I was dropping frames on stream.

Get your weekly teardown of the tech behind PC gaming ReSpec Subscribe Check your inbox!

Then I remembered that I had an Nvidia GPU and I had heard that NVENC (Nvidia’s GPU streaming codec) had gotten really good so I decided to check it out. I looked up Nvidia’s guide on how to configure NVENC in OBS configured OBS and tested it out. The results were nothing short of amazing: the footage looked good the performance was great and I wasn’t dropping any frames. There was basically no performance penalty for using NVENC and neither my CPU nor my GPU was working any harder to use NVENC. It was a no-brainer for me to switch from CPU to GPU encoding.

While CPU encoding can have very high quality it’s also a very inefficient way of recording footage. GPU-accelerated encoding by contrast is slightly worse in quality but way more efficient. My specific situation was actually great for GPU encoding because my ITX PC didn’t have the thermal headroom to afford to be inefficient. I just wish I had heard about NVENC before spending hundreds on a Ryzen 9 3950X that doesn’t get to flex its muscles.

Nvidia Broadcast makes my keyboard silent

Like many gamers I use a mechanical keyboard which is great to type on but not very enjoyable to listen to. Whenever I was recording or streaming I’d have to be very careful about whether or not my mic was on because it would always pick up my keyboard as well as other background noises. I’d usually use push to talk or hard unmute my mic whenever I wanted to speak.

That was the case until I started using an app called Nvidia Broadcast which has several features including a green screen effect without needing an actual green screen AI-enhanced audio output and AI-powered background noise removal which is exactly what I was interested in. I turned the feature on and my mic no longer picked up my keyboard or any other annoying background noises.

You might think a feature like this would be too overzealous and would require me to speak loudly or in a certain way but I’ve never experienced any kind of annoyance with Nvidia Broadcast so far and I’ve been using it for almost two years. On the other hand it is a bit lenient and always picks up whenever I clear my throat (which is quite often) so I am still reaching for the mute button every now and then.

That’s not to say Broadcast isn’t amazing; totally removing the clicking of my keyboard from my streams is a massive improvement in quality for the few viewers I have.

If you’re a streamer consider Nvidia

I think these two features alone make Nvidia GPUs extremely compelling for streamers and I could get more use out of Broadcast and its green screen technology if I ever decided to plug in one of the best webcams for streaming. I didn’t get an Nvidia GPU for these features but I’m not eager to switch back to AMD.

However AMD is catching up to Nvidia on the encoding front. The newest version of AMD’s AMF encoder is purportedly on par with Nvidia’s but very few applications (including OBS) have gotten an update to utilize the new encoder. In fact this version of AMF isn’t even all that new; it’s been out for four months. I’m not about to switch to AMD to use an encoder that has no real support and no timeline for when that support will finally come.

There are also alternatives to Nvidia Broadcast’s noise removal feature. RNNoise is an open-source noise removal program that appears to perform similarly to Nvidia Broadcast. However in order to use RNNoise you have to rely on the open source software ecosystem and right now there just aren’t any convenient solutions using RNNoise. For example someone developed an OBS plugin that added RNNoise but literally said “No help provided. If you can figure out how to build and use it have fun!” Nvidia Broadcast is a simple app I can download install and turn on in a few clicks.

Personally it’s Nvidia Broadcast in particular that makes it difficult to me to go back to AMD. I can deal with having a lower-quality GPU encoder or encoding with my CPU at a low-quality setting but I don’t want my viewers to hear my keyboard all the time. This is a really simple but big quality of life improvement that I will continue to take advantage of and it’s even more important if you have a camera.

AMD GPUs have a little ways to go before they’re as good as Nvidia’s for streaming. I don’t doubt they’ll get there eventually but in the meantime I’ll be sticking with my RTX 3060 Ti.

Most potential buyers will be particularly interested in the gaming performance and the performance of the new A350M is disappointing. The good impression from the synthetic benchmarks cannot be carried over and the dedicated A350M is even beaten by the integrated Radeon 680M in many gaming benchmarks. Forza Horizon 5 crashed repeatedly on the Samsung Galaxy Book2 with the Arc A350M during the loading screen but we did not notice any other problems during our review period.

The GeForce MX550 on the other hand offers more gaming performance than AMD's iGPU and is also faster than the Arc A350M. The GeForce sometimes suffers a bit from the small VRAM (2 GB) with very high details and the performance advantage is smaller but these scenarios are usually unplayable anyway.

All in all the GeForce MX550 can handle many titles (when they are not too demanding) in 1080p and high details whereas you will have to reduce the details (sometimes noticeably) with the Arc A350M.

The utility states that it has added 'GPU information for NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4090 (AD102)' but it does not say what the particular information is. It is very likely that initial device parameters have been added. The software is the first to add such support even before GPU-z. The GeForce RTX 4090 specifically has the 'NVIDIA_DEV.2684' PCI ID. Following are the release notes for the latest version of AIDA64:

NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4090 'Rumored' Specifications

The NVIDIA GeForce RTX RTX 4090 graphics card is expected to be powered by the top AD102-300 GPU but it is only the 'Ti' variant that will feature the full chip. The Geforce RTX 4090 will utilize a slightly cut-down configuration.

The NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4090 will use 128 SMs of the 144 SMs for a total of 16384 CUDA cores. The GPU will come packed with 96 MB of L2 cache and a total of 384 ROPs which is simply insane. The clock speeds are not confirmed yet but considering that the TSMC 4N process is being used we are expecting clocks between the 2.0-3.0 GHz range.

As for memory specs the GeForce RTX 4090 is expected to rock 24 GB GDDR6X capacities that will be clocked at 21 Gbps speeds across a 384-bit bus interface. This will provide up to 1 TB/s of bandwidth. This is the same bandwidth as the existing RTX 3090 Ti graphics card and as far as the power consumption is concerned the TBP is said to be rated at 450W which means that TGP may end up lower than that. The card will be powered by a single 16-pin connector which delivers up to 600W of power. It is likely that we may get 500W+ custom designs as we saw with the RTX 3090 Ti.

The graphics card is expected to launch in October 2022 and will be followed by the rest of the Ada Lovelace GPU-powered lineup of graphics cards.

Ltd. has published an official product page outlining the features and specifications of the Glenfly Arise GT-10C0 graphics card. According to the information it is the first product using a GPU developed and designed by Glenfly. It isn't potent with its FP32 TFLOPS figure of 1.5 similar to the old Nvidia GeForce GTX 750 Ti or AMD Radeon Vega 8 iGPU.

It is good to have an official product page now available in the wake of scrappy bits of information and imagery on Chinese social media. However some of the important specs and real-world performance indicators remain elusive.

The Arise GT-10C0 competes in the category with discrete graphics card minnows such as the Intel Arc A380 AMD Radeon RX 6400 and Nvidia GeForce GTX 1630.

The nearest competitor to the Glenfly card is Nvidia’s – if we consider the FP32 performance stats. By this same metric the Chinese 28nm GPU is similar to the old GTX 750 Ti or AMD Vega 8 integrated graphics. We know very little about the underlying GPU architecture for the Chinese GPU and even basic specs like the number of GPU cores and clocks are not shared. However sharing these specs at this point wouldn’t be very illuminating as we have no Glenfly Arise reference point that has been thoroughly independently tested as a base for extrapolation.

Last month we saw some Geekbench tests for what was reported to be a Glenfly Arise 1020 GPU. It isn’t easy to ascertain whether that was a Geekbench misreport of the Arise GT-10C0 or something else. However it came with 2GB of VRAM as we see it is an option for the Arise GT-10C0. Furthermore the Geekbench OpenCL benchmark scores indicate that the Arise 1020 may be an even worse performer than the 10C0 if it isn’t the same GPU performing very severely due to drivers/software and similar lack of maturity issues.

In summary the new information is encouraging as it indicates that the first Glenfly Arise desktop graphics cards are getting ready for launch. Fingers crossed for an informative third-party comparative review published on a Chinese tech site forum or video sharing site like Bilibili in the coming weeks."

My trusty spreadsheet found the 15 pro teams in the four biggest leagues that call the Golden State home are worth a combined $43 billion. That’s more franchises and more value than any other state according to a compilation of valuations by Forbes magazine.

Adding to their affluence California teams are the reigning champs in football and basketball and winner of 2020’s baseball crown. The road to a league title enhances team values and brings cash to local economies.

But the story isn’t simply about packed playoff games hosted across California.

Pro teams also host high-profile events such as Major League Baseball’s All-Star Game festivities which were just hosted in Los Angeles. Basketball’s all-star game was hosted in California in 2018 and hockey’s version was played here in 2017 and 2019.

In February Los Angeles was home to America’s great sports holiday — the Super Bowl. The big game was last hosted in California in 2016 up in Santa Clara.

All of this adds up to victories on another scorecard — the money. Gobs of it.

The combined wealth of California’s 15 pro teams equals one-sixth of the total value of all 124 franchises in the four pro sports. On Wall Street that $43 billion would buy either the O’Reilly auto-parts chain or Valero’s gasoline business or Exelon an East Coast utility.

At $2.9 billion per franchise the average California pro team is one-third more valuable than the typical pro franchise.

It’s all in the flow

California’s sports riches stem from $4.1 billion in annual team revenues — $274 million per team according to Forbes.

The nation’s largest population and the state’s media markets fuel California pro teams to premium valuations. Their winning traditions don’t hurt either. The teams are priced an average 10.5 times sales vs. nine for all pro teams says the trusty spreadsheet.

Yes California fans may be fickle but they do show up to ballparks and arenas. At least 15 million people attended a game in the past season according to a compilation of ESPN attendance stats. That’s 1 million fans per team or 18% above the average team’s crowds.

California fans also will pay up for games. A typical family spends $457 on tickets food and souvenirs to root for their team according to the Fan Cost Index — 5% more than the pro-sport average.

All this money-making begs a big question: Why do cities across the nation frequently offer wealthy team owners handouts to create or enhance the palaces in which teams show off their skills?

In California we have the scandal-tainted negotiations in Anaheim surrounding baseball’s Angel Stadium. There’s also a protracted fight over who should pay what to keep the A’s baseball team in Oakland. San Diego stood its monetary ground and lost football’s Chargers to Los Angeles.

At least the city of St. Louis won $790 million from pro football to help cover the city’s damages tied to the departure of the Rams to Los Angeles.

Note that California’s roster of pro teams would be one franchise bigger if football’s Raiders — worth $3.4 billion — didn’t leave Oakland in 2020 for Las Vegas thanks to a $750 million taxpayer gift to build a shiny black stadium.

Big business

The 124 teams in North America’s four big pro leagues — football basketball baseball and hockey — are worth a combined $276 billion my spreadsheet says.

That’s up $35 billion or 14% from the previous valuation 12 months earlier. That bump is largely tied to the industry’s recovery from pandemic-era business limitations.

If all these pro teams were one company on Wall Street it would rank in the top 25 of the nation’s most valuable publicly held firms. This market worth approximates blue-chip giants such as Pfizer Coca Cola or Chevron.

The combined revenues for the 124 teams is $31 billion yearly — basically a quarter-billion per team. That combined sales take is on par with revenues collected by Netflix or homebuilder D.R. Horton.

Pro sports’ cash flow is linked to the 105 million fans who attended games last season. That’s 850000 tickets sold per franchise — with a family of four spending $435 for tickets food and souvenirs according to the Fan Cost Index.

Footing the bill

Drawing fans to the game in person is only one part of the profit pie for pro sports owners. Let’s talk TV.

The reason pro football franchises are easily the most valuable sports teams is the huge amounts broadcasters are willing to pay for National Football League content.

It’s all about eyeballs. NFL regular-season games draw roughly 17 million viewers on TV — that’s 10 times the audience of pro basketball 15 times baseball and 25 times hockey.

The power of that audience translates to 32 NFL teams worth $111 billion by Forbes math or $3.5 billion per franchise. And NFL values rose $14 billion or 14% in a year.

Perhaps most stunningly football represents 40% of pro sports’ total value. Look around California. The NFL has the Rams (worth $4.8 billion eighth-most valuable pro team) San Francisco 49ers ($4.2 billion No. 10) and Chargers ($2.9 billion No. 35).

The NFL’s overall bounty is driven by revenues totaling $12.2 billion yearly — or $381 million per team. Football equals 40% of all pro teams’ sales.

But because football teams only play eight or nine regular-season home games — compared with 41 for basketball and hockey and 81 for baseball — in-person fandom is proportionally modest. The league draws 18.3 million in-person fans or 571660 per team — 33% below the pro sports average.

But if you go be prepared for a pricey day. The Fan Cost Index shows NFL games cost a family $568 — 31% more than pro sports fans typically pay.

Market basket

The global appeal of the National Basketball Association helps make it the second-most valuable pro league.

Its 30 teams are worth $74 billion (per-team average: $2.5 billion) and that’s up $8.3 billion or 13% in a year. In California that’s the Golden State Warriors (worth $5.6 billion No. 4 nationally) L.A. Lakers ($5.5 billion No. 5) L.A. Clippers ($3.3 billion No. 29) and Sacramento Kings ($2 billion No. 57).

Team revenues total $6.4 billion yearly — $214 million per team. But valuations are pro sport’s highest — 11.6 times sales vs. a 9 industry average.

NBA crowds total 21 million or 695000 per team — 18% below the industry norm. The cost of basketball games for fans is middle-of-the pack — $444 for the typical family 2% more than the 124-team average.

Past its time?

The so-called “American Pastime” is third of four in many pro sports metrics.

The value of the 30 Major League Baseball teams adds up to $62 billion (average: $2.1 billion) — up $5.1 billion or 9% in a year.

In California it’s the L.A. Dodgers (worth $4.1 billion No. 11 of all pro teams) San Francisco Giants ($3.5 billion No. 21) Angels ($2.2 billion No. 53) San Diego Padres ($1.6 billion No. 78) and Oakland Athletics ($1.2 billion No. 95).

Baseball does rake in revenues with a total of $9.6 billion yearly. It equals $319 million per team and 31% of all pro sports sales.

But team valuations are relatively low — 6.5 times sales vs. 9 for all pro teams. Why? Lofty costs due to an extremely long season and high player expenses.

So why are baseball teams often begging for stadium aid?

It has lots of seats to fill. The sport’s lengthy schedules draw 45 million fans or 43% of all pro attendance. The 1.5 million average per baseball per team is 78% above the industry norm.

But baseball is also a consumer “bargain” with a typical family spending $256 per event — 41% less than fans typically pay.

Iced over

The National Hockey League is the major league’s little sibling.

Its 32 teams are collectively worth $28 billion (or a $900000 average). That’s up $7.1 billion or 31% in a year because the sport is heavily dependent on packing fans into an indoor arena. The pandemic made that nearly impossible.

California hockey values run from the L.A. Kings ($1 billion No. 99 of all pro teams) to the San Jose Sharks ($625 million No. 115) to the Anaheim Ducks ($620 million No. 116) by Forbes math.

Team revenues total $2.3 billion yearly — $76 million per team — only 8% of industry sales. But NHL franchises draw above-par values going for 11.5 times sales vs. 9 for all pro teams.

Ice hockey’s small but devoted fan base fills 20 million seats. The NHL’s 646000 per team average however is 24% below the industry norm.

Yet like many niche products it’s a pricey product. A typical family spends $463 a game — 6% more than all fans pay.

Why the handouts?

The average pro franchise is worth $2.2 billion.

And that’s on the upswing. Football’s Denver Broncos are selling for $4.7 billion — twice the previous sports franchise record price paid ($2.35 billion) for basketball’s Brooklyn Nets in 2019.

So it’s bemusing to hear team owners sometimes speak as if they’re impoverished.

Meanwhile nasty family fights break out over ownership of these sporting assets. For example internal battles are brewing for control of the Chargers and baseball’s Baltimore Orioles.

You know there is serious money in these businesses. And to be fair not every owner seeks taxpayer dollars to support their athletic business ventures.

In California new homes for the Rams and Chargers in Inglewood (SoFi Stadium with a $5 billion-plus price tag) and the Warriors in San Francisco (Chase Center with a $1 billion tab) were privately financed. That largesse is proof of the financial muscle of team owners and their athletic industry endeavors.

Bottom line: Any industry worth a quarter-trillion bucks should not be begging cities for financial help to create their “factories.”

“His dad won’t help him anymore and he’s been cut off so he got to work” a source told People of the actor who is reported to be working in the Cayman Islands as a timeshare salesman.

While the well may have run dry for Armie following the “cannibal” scandal that landed him in rehab the Hammer family continues to live high on the hog thanks to great-grandad Armand establishing himself as a billionaire oil tycoon in the 1950s with Occidental Petroleum running the company from 1957 until his death in 1990.

According to 1996’s “Dossier: The Secret History of Armand Hammer” by Jay Epstein the mogul was involved in number of scandals himself ranging from money laundering to Soviet espionage.

Bypassing his own son Julian the business was ultimately passed down to Armie’s father Michael who continues to run the Hammer International Foundation the Armand Hammer Foundation and other organizations under the family name.

Armie’s attorney Andrew Brettler told Page Six Friday following reports of his client working in the Cayman Islands that he could not “confirm or deny the report because Armie hasn’t addressed it. I just think it’s s–tty that if he is selling timeshares the media is shaming him for having a ‘normal job.’”

In addition to the reported new gig a source close to the disgraced “Call Me by Your Name” star told Vanity Fair that Robert Downey Jr. quietly paid for Hammer’s six-month stay at Florida rehab facility and has allowed Hammer and his family to stay at his house to avoid recent media scrutiny.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiSWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZveG5ld3MuY29tL2VudGVydGFpbm1lbnQvYXJtaWUtaGFtbWVyLWN1dC1vZmYtZmFtaWx5LWR5bmFzdHnSAU1odHRwczovL3d3dy5mb3huZXdzLmNvbS9lbnRlcnRhaW5tZW50L2FybWllLWhhbW1lci1jdXQtb2ZmLWZhbWlseS1keW5hc3R5LmFtcA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Armie Hammer has been 'cut off' from family dynasty,"Armie Hammer has reportedly been ""cut off"" from his family leading him to land a job selling timeshares at a resort in the Cayman Islands.

A hotel flyer was posted on social media with a photograph of someone who closely resembled the actor working as a concierge. Armie's lawyer denied it was him but days later sources have confirmed to multiple outlets that the actor is selling timeshares at Morritt's Resort.

Armie ""is currently selling timeshares because he needs the money"" a source told People magazine.

""His dad won't help him anymore and he's been cut off so he's got to work.""

ARMIE HAMMER'S CAYMAN ISLANDS CONNECTION: IS THE ACTOR REALLY SELLING TROPICAL TIMESHARES?

So who is Armie's family?

Armie Hammer's family dynasty

Armand Hammer was the great-grandfather of Armie Hammer. The billionaire oil tycoon was best known for Occidental Petroleum. He ran the company from 1957 until his death in 1990.

Armand was also well known for his scandals and a book was written about the billionaire's life in 1996 by Jay Epstein ""Dossier: The Secret History of Armand Hammer.""

Epstein told the story of a man who had many mistresses laundered money and participated in Soviet espionage. He hung around with important people including Prince Charles and Senator Al Gore Sr.

Armand also made appearances at many presidential inaugurations including Franklin D. Roosevelt's Ronald Reagan's and George H. W. Bush's.

The Hammer family did not create the baking soda brand Arm & Hammer but Armand did invest in the company after attempting to buy it according to Vanity Fair.

Armie Hammer's father Michael Hammer was given Armand's business empire once the billionaire passed ultimately bypassing Armand's own son Julian. Michael continues to run the Hammer International Foundation the Armand Hammer Foundation and a handful of other businesses according to reports.

Michael is known for his party boy persona similar to that of Armie himself.

ARMIE HAMMER'S AUNT CASEY HAMMER PLANS TO SHARE FAMILY SECRETS IN UPCOMING DOCUSERIES

The actor previously explained how his father met his mother Dru Ann Mobley in an interview with Vulture.

""My dad was supposed to be on a flight went to the airport and got hammered and passed out … He missed his flight woke up and was like ‘Oh God I have a meeting'"" he recalled.

Michael rebooked his flight and ended up sitting next to Mobley. The two later married and welcomed Armie and his brother Viktor.

The actor's parents divorced in 2012 after 27 years of marriage.

Who is Armie Hammer?

Despite his financially rich family line Armie has been outspoken about his independence. Hammer previously confirmed his independence from his family in 2017 when he couldn't pay off a bet he made with a filmmaker.

""I’m really proud of that"" he said of supporting himself and his family.

""It would literally bankrupt me and I need to buy diapers tomorrow"" he said about the bet according to Vanity Fair.

Before Armie reportedly became ""totally broke"" his Hollywood career had been on the rise.

The actor launched his career with ""The Social Network"" and continued to grab bigger and better roles. At the beginning of his career Armie was doing well with his names attached to titles such as ""J. Edgar"" ""Mirror Mirror"" ""The Lone Ranger"" and more.

However his career took a hit when articles were written about him that featured headlines like ""Ten Long Years of Trying to Make Armie Hammer Happen.""

Armie seemed to bounce back in 2017 after he was cast in the film ""Call Me By Your Name."" The movie received an Oscar for best adapted screenplay and was nominated for best picture.

The actor was nominated for a Golden Globe for the role.

However after that success Armie hit a rough patch when his wife Elizabeth Chambers filed for divorce. Months later multiple women came forward to accuse the actor of sexual and emotional abuse.

The Shore Conference has plenty of history in producing baseball talent over the years: Al Leiter (Central Regional) has the most career strikeouts of any pitcher born in New Jersey Todd Frazier enjoyed a colorful Big League career that included a 40-homer season and a Home Run Derby championship and several more (Ron Marinaccio Mark Leiter Jr. Anthony DeSclafani Jimmy Yacobonis Brad Brach Matt Thaiss and Jay Groome) are either contributing for Major League teams or on 40-man rosters.

That pool of talent is likely to grow in the coming years as the Shore is steadily becoming a reliable supplier of draft-ready baseball talent. That development will further be on display in the coming days as the 2022 Major League Baseball First-Year Player Draft begins on Sunday with the first 80 picks covering the first two rounds of the Draft (compensation picks included).

Even with MLB cutting the number of rounds in half from 40 as recently as 2019 to 20 in each of the past two seasons there still figure to be a healthy dose of New Jersey players among the 600-plus players selected and several of those will be players that have passed through the Shore Conference.

What follows is a look at nine Shore Conference alumni to watch during the three-day event. The nature of the MLB Draft is such that several of these players may not be selected and some players from the Shore not mentioned in this space could get the call as well. These nine however have put themselves on the radar for this season with their performance and you can read more on each one by clicking on the players' names.

Over a century old and near identical to its original structure the United Methodist Church of Terra Alta (Terra Alta FUMC) has been granted placement on the National Register of Historic Places recognizing the church’s architectural significance.

The congregation is celebrating today with service at 11 a.m. followed by a ceremony at 12:30 p.m. to unveil the new plaque commemorating this designation. A pot-luck luncheon will then be held.

“It’s open to everyone who wants to come” said Roger Lewis chair of the Trustees. “Everybody’s really excited and I think we’ll have a great turnout. We’ll be there to worship God and have a good time.”

A couple of years ago the Terra Alta FUMC decided to apply for the National Register of Historic Places.

“I just felt that it was a building very deserving of national recognition” said Lewis. “It’s a beautiful church it needs to be preserved.”

To qualify for the National Register of Historic Places a property must be associated with a significant event or person represent a distinct style of architecture or a master architect’s work or provide important historical information. The Terra Alta FUMC meets these guidelines due to its features designed by John Charles Fulton a nationally respected architect.

Built between 1900-04 and officially dedicated on June 26 1904 the Terra Alta FUMC has served its community for over a century –118 years.

The church is the only representation of Fulton’s work in Preston County. Fulton designed many other buildings across West Virginia some of which are still standing today and also hold positions on the National Register of Historic Places. These include WVU’s Purinton House Barbour County Courthouse and Doddridge County Courthouse.

A 1956-57 addition was designed by Albert Franklin Tucker a similarly prominent architect. The Terra Alta FUMC is Tucker’s only known work in Preston County and demonstrates his modern style. This expansion called the “education building” allowed for more community events classes charitable services and more.

The building reflects the Romanesque Revival architectural style of the late 19th and early 20th centuries. As one of the few buildings in Preston County fitting this style the Terra Alta FUMC is the area’s best example of this type of architecture.

“You can just tell how special this building is when you enter the sanctuary” said Jennifer Thornton a teaching assistant professor in WVU’s History Department. “It has a corner pulpit curved pews and this lovely vaulted ceiling crowned with a stained-glass dome.”

The State Historic Office connected the Terra Alta FUMC with Thornton for support through the application process. The National Register application research was assigned to Thornton’s Historic Preservation students who enjoyed the opportunity to tour the church and speak with congregation members.

After 2 ½ years of preparation the Terra Alta FUMC was officially placed on the National Register of Historic Places on April 15.

Now that the church has received this status it is eligible for a variety of grants to be used for building upkeep.

“To maintain a building that size periodically there are major expenses” said Lewis. “We’ve been able to handle those expenses to date but if we can apply for grants in the future that will be a great benefit.”

The church’s stained glass windows are undergoing full restoration.

The Terra Alta FUMC has been well-maintained which is rare for a building so old said Thornton.

“Changes to the historic fabric have been limited and the property retains its integrity of materials workmanship feeling and association” describes the National Register form.

Preserving historical buildings like the church is crucial said Thornton.

“For me the most important reason to preserve historical buildings like the First United Methodist Church of Terra Alta is because they are cherished by their communities” Thornton said. “Buildings like this hold so many local stories and memories and are woven into the fabric of community and family histories.”

The church was built by the community for the community and maintains the same values a century later.

“The church bell cast in 1886 is still in use today” states the National Register form. “The same chimes that ring through Terra Alta every Sunday would have rung as the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad brought travelers laborers and industrial products through the town over a century ago.”

VIRGINIA BEACH Va. — The name lines t shirts throughout Hampton Roads. A rec center gym here a park there you never know exactly when you'll see one but if you're around basketball in the 757 there's always a chance. Such is the case when you've held over 50 years of camps usually multiple weeks throughout the summer and every camper gets a t-shirt. The graphics have have surely changed throughout the years but ""Paul Webb Basketball Camp"" remains on each and every shirt. A badge of honor for having spent 5 days learning the game of basketball from a family of coaches that have spent their lives educating the young hoopers of Virginia.

Friday at Corporate Landing Middle School in Virginia Beach a whole new set of campers played final games before they would receive their t-shirts. Well first of course they ate chicken nuggets but then the T shirts. In between games lead to results that fill brackets hung from the wall of the gymnasium documenting a weeks worth of competition that would soon end with a champion.

Paul Webb takes it all in from the bleachers. Ninety three and more than 30 years clear of his time coaching the Old Dominion Monarchs Webb still has his eyes locked in on the games being played in front of him. His eyes scan the gym taking in step back jumpers and free throw routines. His son Eddie runs the camps now but Paul is here every day a counselor to the campers but a legend to the 757.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYWh0dHBzOi8vMjQ3c3BvcnRzLmNvbS9hcnRpY2xlL3NvdXRoLWNhcm9saW5hLWdhbWVjb2Nrcy13b21lbnMtYmFza2V0YmFsbC1hbGl5YWgtYm9zdG9uLTE5MDE5OTU0MS_SAWVodHRwczovLzI0N3Nwb3J0cy5jb20vYXJ0aWNsZS9zb3V0aC1jYXJvbGluYS1nYW1lY29ja3Mtd29tZW5zLWJhc2tldGJhbGwtYWxpeWFoLWJvc3Rvbi0xOTAxOTk1NDEvYW1wLw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,ESPN holds Boston in high regard,"The South Carolina women’s basketball team is coming off of its second national championship in program history and will look to defend its title next season.

Last year’s National Player of the Year Aliyah Boston will return to South Carolina for her senior season and is already being talked about as possibly being the first pick taken in the 2023 WNBA Draft.

On July 7 ESPN’s Alexa Philippou looked at which WNBA players will lead the next generation. Although Boston hasn't made it to the WNBA yet she made the list and was placed as a “future double-double machine.” Here is what Philippou had to say about Boston in the article.

“Fowles is the WNBA's career double-doubles leader with 187 so perhaps the future force in this realm is someone who broke a Fowles record from her college days: Boston the reigning national player of the year in women's college basketball surpassed Fowles' SEC record of 19 consecutive double-double in the 2021-22 season ultimately recording 27 straight and 30 overall on her way to leading the Gamecocks to a second NCAA title in five NCAA tournaments. Across her three seasons under Dawn Staley Boston has averaged 14.5 points and 11.2 rebounds per game -- well within the ballpark of Fowles' career averages of 15.5 and 10.9 at LSU. Following her senior season Boston is projected by many to be the top pick in the 2023 WNBA draft.”

Boston was also under consideration for the 'future defensive player of the year' category.

In 2021-22 Boston averaged 16.8 points per game and grabbed 12.5 rebounds per game.

In the national championship game against UConn Boston scored 11 points and pulled 16 rebounds.

In ESPN College GameDay’s segment on Boston on Feb. 20 it showed her having her high school jersey framed and placed in a business that has a jersey of U.S. Virgin Islands native Tim Duncan.

The individual who would be hanging the jersey in Boston’s honor said “We chose to have a high school jersey for you because you are the most decorated high school basketball player from the Virgin Islands in our history.”

Boston is sure to have a great rest of her collegiate career but also as a WNBA player when her time at South Carolina is complete. She hopes to continue making everyone in the Virgin Islands proud of her accomplishments.

“Everyone knows that I left here when I was young to be a successful basketball player” Boston said. “But I just want to show them that all of this was so I could continue to make them proud.”"

Released The Forrester Wave™: Global Media Management Services analyzes the seven most significant global media management service providers against a 19-criterion evaluation across three categories: current offering strategy and market presence. Designed to help CMO professionals select the right provider for their needs the report assesses the media groups under four designations: Leaders Strong Performers Contenders and Challengers.

With the highest possible scores in six criteria and with the highest score in the current offering category Omnicom Media Group was one of only two providers among the seven evaluated to earn designation as a “Leader” in the report.

Describing OMG as “a good fit for advertisers that require bespoke technology-literate global media teams” the report also noted that “… the agency scales consumer empathy and understanding into quantifiable attention metrics against which advertisers can plan buy and measure. To achieve this vision the company deploys its Omni audience planning portal to power better audience client and employee experiences.”

The report also states that “OMG’s strength lies in initiatives to innovate its Omni portal such as customized client workflow integrations audience data integrations; marketing automation partnerships with Google; and efforts to unite media e-commerce and shopper tactics.”

This finding is borne out by a steady drumbeat of first-mover product and partnership announcements from OMG in 2022 including a multi-year agreement with Affinity Solutions to integrate retailer purchase transactions into Omni; an enterprise-wide partnership with Firework the world’s largest livestream commerce and shoppable video platform to deliver livestream shopping solutions directly to Omnicom clients’ websites; the industry’s first programmatic marketplace for point-of-purchase screens; and the Supply Chain IQ Score which gives media planners day-to-day visibility into SKU inventory data at the physical store digital shelf and inventory-in-transit levels enabling media investment to be shifted away from low inventory products in real time.

Most recently OMG dominated the news cycle at last month’s Cannes Lions International Festival of Creativity announcing a series of first mover strategic partnerships with retail media networks including Walmart Connect Instacart and Kroger Precision Marketing.

OMG CEO Florian Adamski said “As the only agency group to have earned the highest possible score in all three of the criteria that we believe best represent the future of media investment and management – retail media commerce media and intelligence & insights – and as a group that also received the highest possible scores in two criteria that we think are critical differentiators in selecting an agency partner –operations and innovation road map – OMG is clearly a leader in today’s marketplace.

“More importantly as we continue to expand our capabilities and automate our infrastructure and to build new products and partnerships we are assuring that we and our clients will remain leaders – today tomorrow and beyond.”

Receiving Forrester’s designation as a “Leader” is the latest good news for OMG which last month saw its largest agency OMD Worldwide take Media Network of the Year honors at the Cannes Lions festival; while PHD was awarded the $500 million Restaurant Brands International (RBI) business which includes the Burger King Popeyes and Tim Horton’s chains.",,,,,,,,,,,,

The next geo-technology medium for the UAE is semiconductors a strategic battleground in the U.S.-China tech Cold War. Leveraging its economic capabilities the UAE entered the semiconductor space as the primary investor in the U.S.-based manufacturer GlobalFoundries (GF). While the semiconductors industry is one of the most capital-intensive industries globally the UAE’s strategic investment in the sector is part of a larger Emirati strategy to pivot to deep tech and position the country as a global tech leader under Economic Vision 2030.

After years of investing in digital infrastructure developing international relationships and positioning the UAE as a go-to regional center for multinational tech companies the Emirati government has built a platform for making the country a leading digital economy in the Middle East. When the rise of the Covid-19 pandemic caught the world by surprise the UAE emerged as one of the most digitally-empowered economies with the ability to mobilize and rapidly adjust to the needs of the moment. Digital requirements such as a rapid transition to remote working and schooling the implementation of advanced contact tracing mechanisms and a digitally enforced lockdown were much easier for the UAE than they were for countries that do not value tech and innovation or view it as a national security concern.

The UAE’s Tech Vision

The UAE has put forth a national vision that has been foundational in setting goals for various industries but one seems to stand out more than the others. Tech and cyber have become a forefront priority as the UAE seeks to digitize everyday life. Some of the specific areas under the national vision and within the country’s tech sphere include robots and flying taxis advanced drone capabilities data centers tech hub development and investments in the semiconductor industry.

Cruise a company supported by General Motors and Honda is expected to launch its first robo-taxi in Dubai in 2023. The aim is to have 4000 self-driving cars by 2030. According to Crown Prince Sheikh Hamdan of Dubai the emirate is aiming for self-driving trips to make up 25 percent of total trips in the emirate. In addition to robo-taxis the UAE is making the leap to expand its taxi transportation services with electric aircraft. Eve Holding a Brazilian developer has been tasked with the production and delivery of up to thirty-five flying taxis to support Dubai’s efforts to develop urban air mobility. The taxis will be managed and operated by Falcon Aviation Services a local Dubai company. The aircraft are expected to be delivered in 2026. Unmanned aircraft or drones are another major area of focus for investment for the emirate. EDGE a UAE state-owned drone developer recently unveiled its Hunter 2-S swarming drone in Abu Dhabi. The capabilities of the Hunter 2-S include tracking and providing position information while engaging with a target. The drone was made to loiter for an extended period of time and take on surveillance intelligence and reconnaissance missions.

Entering the Semiconductor Game

In an effort to position itself as a tech power outside of the Middle East the UAE has been investing extensively in niche technology sectors that are front and center in the global economy. The semiconductor industry is a prime example. In 2011 as part of the UAE’s effort to diversify its economy away from energy production Abu Dhabi's Mubadala Investment Company a leading sovereign investor acquired Advanced Technology Investment Co. (ATIC) the parent company of the California-based semiconductor manufacturer GF. GF is one of the top five chipmakers globally producing advanced semiconductors for companies such as Apple Intel and Amazon. It is the third-largest semiconductor producer behind only TSMC and Samsung. Recently GF announced plans to expand by building a new $4 billion manufacturing plant in Singapore.

Strategic Investments

Mubadala seeks partnerships in cutting-edge technology recently investing in sectors like energy technology finance pharma intelligence defense technology aerospace and other transportation sciences. In May 2022 it signed a memorandum of understanding with French energy and utility firm Engie to explore the development of vehicle recharging in the Middle East and North Africa region. Investing in the semiconductors industry is very much in line with Mubadala’s strategy and forward-thinking approach.

According to Khaldoon al-Mubarak Mudabala’s managing director and CEO the semiconductor industry will double “within eight to ten years” and “double again after an additional four to five years.” As many things that we use every day require semiconductors from appliances to vehicles the demand for them outweighs the supply he noted. Al-Mubarak added that “there's [only] five foundry businesses global foundry businesses four of which are in Asia” while GF is in the United States Europe and Asia giving the company an edge over its competitors.

While there hasn’t been any word on whether the UAE will try to build up a semiconductor industry at home Abu Dhabi remains a strong investor in the sector. The UAE’s Khalifa University is one of the region’s first academic institutions to offer semiconductor design training. Most recently the UAE’s Next Orbit Ventures and Israel’s Tower Semiconductor established a joint venture to invest $3 billion to set up a chip-making plant in India.

By investing in its tech ecosystem bringing international tech companies home and developing its human capital the UAE has become the region's leading digital economy. The UAE’s investment in GF is part of a larger Emirati ambition to shift its focus to deep tech and establish the country as a worldwide tech leader not one that is limited to the Middle East. With the UAE’s national vision of becoming a global leader in tech and innovation the Emirates may well bring semiconductor production home in the long run.

House Speaker Nancy Pelosi's husband Paul was blasted for buying $5 million of shares in a chip manufacturer days before a legislative vote that could hand $52 billion to semiconductor producers.

On June 17 2022 Paul purchased 20000 shares of NVIDIA considered one of the world's largest semiconductor companies according to the report.

The stock NVIDIA (NVDA) that Paul traded is from the Santa Clara California-based multinational technology company that has been reported to be one of the most watched stocks according to Zacks Equity Research Yahoo Finance reported.

The disclosure reveals that the stock that is estimated to be worth between $1 million and $5 million which Nancy filed with the House of Representatives on Thursday Insider reported.

There's no suggestion that Paul broke the law - but some have questioned whether he may have additional information as to how the upcoming Senate vote will go.

Craig Holman a government affairs lobbyist for the left-wing think tank Public Citizen told the Daily Caller News Foundation that 'it certainly raises the specter that Paul Pelosi could have access to some insider legislative information.'

'This is the reason why there is a stock trading app that exclusively monitors Paul’s trading activity and then its followers do likewise' he said.

The document from the Clerk of the House of Representatives show the stock trades that Paul Pelosi made in 2022 that also include shares he sold from Apple and Visa

Federal records indicate that Paul who was arrested for drunk-driving in May trades tens of millions of dollars worth of stock and stock options each year.

On Tuesday senators will gather to vote on a bipartisan competition bill which allocates $52 billion to boost domestic semiconductor manufacturing and gives tax credits for production Reuters reported.

A shortage of chips has caused disruption in the automotive and electronics sectors forcing some companies to scale back its production. Many companies believe the shortage will linger until late 2023.

The recent trades done by the House Speaker's husband comes at a time when Congress is contesting whether lawmakers and their spouses should be able to buy sell or hold individual stocks at all.

The Pelosi's are among the wealthiest congressional couples according to reports.

Paul Pelosi owner of Financial Leasing Services has amassed a personal fortune of around $135 million.

In 2021 the House Speaker is ranked as the 14th wealthiest member of Congress with an estimated net worth of at least $46123051 Insider reveals.

The Pelosi's (pictured) in a photo at The Kennedy Center Honors are among the wealthiest congressional couples according to reports

Pelosi's accident made news at the time. The San Francisco Examiner reported it on Page 6 in its February 23 1957 edition saying David had warned Paul to slow down

In May Paul Pelosi was arrested for driving while intoxicated.

He was driving his 2021 Porsche home from a dinner party when he pulled on to State Route 29 into the path of Jesus Lopez 48 who was driving north in Jeep.

Photos from the scene obtained by ABC News showed that the vehicles crashed into a wooden fence.

After his arrest he posted bail at $5000 and he was released.

At the time Pelosi's lawyer said: 'Mr. Pelosi was fully cooperative with California Highway Patrol officers who arrived a few minutes later.'

Sixty-five years ago when Paul was 16 he accidentally killed his older brother David 19 who was a passenger in a vehicle he was driving.

The fatal crash happened in Northern California in February 1957 when the sports car Paul was driving recklessly flipped over.

A high school sophomore at the time Paul was cited for misdemeanor manslaughter. In the end there was no court case and he was exonerated by a coroner's jury according to a decades old newspaper report.

Before the fatal wreck his brother had urged his younger brother to drive slower as they approached a tight curve on California's Skyline Highway according to a patrolman quoted by the San Francisco Examiner.

Paul broke his collarbone in the crash but his brother was strangled by a brace he wore to support a neck fracture he sustained in a diving accident.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiP2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZ0LmNvbS9jb250ZW50L2JiMTNkOTEyLTc3M2EtNGMxYS1iZjMzLTM1OGIzYzQwY2E1YdIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Samsung slips further behind TSMC in chipmaking race,"Try unlimited access Only MX$100 for 4 weeks

India's Top 5 Semiconductor Stocks and how They are Faring in 2022

Editor's note: The semiconductor industry is a structural megatrend in the making.

Earlier countries across the globe were excessively dependent on China for semiconductor needs. But the situation is slowly changing as companies are adopting a China plus one strategy.

At present there are only a few companies in the world that make semiconductors.

In India the companies involved in this space directly or indirectly are still very few. But this can change very quickly and the right pick could be the x-factor for your portfolio.

In the future we could also see penny stocks foraying into semiconductor industry owing to strong growth prospects.

In July this year we wrote to you about India's popular semiconductor stocks and how they are faring on the bourses.

Semiconductor Stocks in India and their Performance in 2022

As can be seen from the table above most of the stocks have fallen this year. This is because companies involved in this space are considered high growth stocks.

The thing with growth stocks is they tend to underperform when interest rates rise.

Continue reading to know more about these companies and how they are taking India a step closer to become a chip making powerhouse.

India's Top Semiconductor Stocks and How They are Faring in 2022

In December 2021 we were quick to identify opportunities in the semiconductor space. We wrote to you about the top semiconductor stocks.

Since then semiconductor stocks have been the talk of the town and for good reason.

Technological advancements like the EV revolution and 5G rollout have sent the demand for semiconductors soaring in the last couple of years.

A rise in the use of devices like smartphones and smart TVs in the pandemic further aided demand.

However the pandemic also caused disruptions that throttled supply.

The demand-supply mismatch resulted in semiconductor stocks seeing a sharp rally and touching their all-time highs.

Although the buzz started due to a shortage of chips the Indian government's effort is another driving factor for the industry.

The government has announced a PLI scheme to encourage local manufacturing of semiconductors and setting up display units.

This scheme is worth a whopping Rs 760 bn to be invested over the next 5-6 years.

Global semiconductor giants are also showing interest to set shop in India. This gives the government's plan a much-needed push.

So how have stocks of semiconductor companies performed in 2022 so far? Let's find out.

#1 Vedanta

Mines and metal conglomerate Vedanta has formed a joint venture (JV) with Taiwan's Foxconn to manufacture semiconductor chips in the 28 nm category.

The JV will look at setting up a semiconductor manufacturing plant in the next two years.

To become India's first chip maker Vedanta is seeking 1000 acres of free land water and power at concessionary and fixed prices among other incentives.

In a recent development the government asked the companies to provide more details on how they plan to acquire the required expertise or get a third partner with demonstrated technical capability.

The companies haven't yet disclosed the location of the manufacturing plant.

This is the first joint venture in electronics manufacturing after the government announced the PLI scheme.

Vedanta group is planning to invest US$ 15 bn in a phased manner over the next 5-10 years to make displays and semiconductor chips in India.

Vedanta has also proposed setting up a display fab on its own.

Note this isn't Vedanta's first attempt at foraying into the semiconductor space. Although none of these attempts took off the company is ready for another go.

Shares of the company have come under pressure in the past few months and have fallen over 33% in 2022 so far.

Update: Vedanta has selected the state of Gujarat for its semiconductor project. It will invest Rs 1.5 tn in Gujarat to set up a fabrication plant with Rs 945 bn and a semiconductor fabrication and outsourced semiconductor assembly and test plant with Rs 600 bn.

According to Anil Agarwal Vedanta's chairman they need two such plants to meet the global demand of semiconductors. Hence after setting up a plant in Gujarat Vedanta is also looking into setting up another plant. For this it has received interesting plans from Andhra Pradesh and Maharashtra.

It is expected that the Gujarat plant will start operating from 2024.

To know more about this plant read our detailed editorial on Vedanta and its semiconductor plant in Gujarat.

#2 Rajesh Exports

Rajesh Exports is investing US$ 3 bn to set up the country's first electronic-display plant in the state of Telangana. The company is also an applicant for the government's PLI scheme.

Announcing the investment Telangana Industries Minister KT Rama Rao said:

What was hitherto possible only in Japan Korea and Taiwan will now happen in Telangana.



The creation of a large-scale ecosystem of partners and ancillaries supplying world-class television smartphone and tablet makers. .

Industry body ICEA estimates demand in India for displays will be nearly US$ 60 bn between 2021 and 2025.

Rajesh Exports which has no prior experience in electronics manufacturing is making the investment through subsidiary company Elest.

Elest was incorporated for diversifying into the EV segment along with display manufacturing.

Shares of the company have come under pressure in the past few months and have fallen nearly 20% in 2022 so far.

Update: While there have been no new developments with respect to Rajesh Exports' semiconductor biz the company has been selected for production of advanced chemistry cells for the Rs 181-bn PLI scheme.

However despite the company's increased focus towards high growth sectors such as EV batteries and semiconductor its stock price remains under pressure and trades near its 52-week low.

#3 Ruttonsha International Rectifier

Established in 1969 Ruttonsha manufactures semiconductor devices power rectifiers assemblies and semiconductor diodes.

When the government invited bids for semiconductor fab units Ruttonsha was the only company to register for making compound semiconductors.

Compound semiconductors are different from silicon ones. Around 20% of the world's semiconductors come under this category.

In 2005 Ruttonsha was taken over by the promoters of Silicon Power Corporation USA giving it access to developmental and technological expertise.

Silicon Power Corporation is a leading corporation that provides high power semiconductor devices.

Visicon Power Electronics is a wholly owned Indian subsidiary of Silicon Power Corporation. It's in the business of manufacturing silicon carbide (SiC) wafers and power electronic devices through the epitaxial process.

Ruttonsha has big plans for manufacturing SiC based products in India. It's setting up a fab unit.

Shares of the company have fallen heavily in the past few months erasing gains from January. They are down 2% in 2022 so far.

#4 ASM Technologies

ASM Technologies has formed a 50:50 JV with Hind High Vacuum (HHV). This is to undertake design led engineering and manufacturing of tools sub-systems sub-system components and components for the semiconductor and solar industries.

Speaking on the JV Mr. Rabindra Srikantan Managing Director ASM Technologies said:

We are encouraged by the recent incentives announced by the Government of India for semiconductors electronics and packaging.



This JV enables us to add the best-in-class semiconductor manufacturing capabilities to our existing semiconductor engineering expertise.

ASM Technologies provides consulting and product development services in the areas of engineering services and product R&D.

The main clients of ASM Technologies include reputed customers involved in manufacturing of semiconductor equipment and network devices.

ASM Technologies has recently forayed into areas of virtual reality (VR) internet of things (IoT) and open edX platform management.

In line with other semiconductor stocks shares of ASM Technologies came under pressure after the Russia-Ukraine war. The stock is down close to 40% in 2022 so far.

Update: In a recent interview the company's MD Rabindra Srikantan said that India has a lot of ground to cover and should focus on manufacturing of semiconductors.

Here's an excerpt:

I think many states have given a lot of templates along with the PLI and I'm sure that in the next maybe 18 months-24 months or even sooner we will see some of these getting into production. .

#5 SPEL Semiconductor

SPEL Semiconductor is engaged in offering electronic integrated circuits (ICs). Its products are used mostly in cell phones computers notebooks and personal digital assistants.

Its facility Natronix is India's first and only semiconductor IC assembly & test facility.

SPEL Semiconductor was the only company to register for semiconductor packaging under the government's PLI scheme.

Packaging is an essential part of semiconductor manufacturing and design. It's usually done by an outsourced semiconductor assembly and test (OSAT) vendor.

It affects power performance and cost on a macro level and the basic functionality of all chips on a micro level.

As semiconductor production booms in the country the company is set to benefit from being the only OSAT in the country.

The company's existing customers are some of the biggest integrated device manufacturers (IDMs) and fabless companies in the US Asia and Europe.

It is the only company on the list to have performed well in 2022. Shares of the company are up over 12%.

The road ahead...

If you're looking for growth stocks you might want to get bullish on semiconductor stocks. As industries rush towards digitisation demand for semiconductors will only grow more.

So if you think the semiconductor theme is just temporary and might be over soon think again. The demand-supply mismatch is here to stay and semiconductor stocks will make headlines yet again.

While these stocks have the potential to deliver huge gains you should be very careful about which semiconductor stocks to invest in.

There are only a handful of companies that are currently involved in this space. The right pick could be the x-factor for your portfolio turning into the next Titan or Wipro.

Co-head of Research at Equitymaster Tanushree Banerjee has identified a tech company in India having a dominant role in semiconductor chip designing.

The company has set up management teams in Taiwan South Korea and Vietnam in recent months seeing the growth potential of this business.

With its disruptive capabilities Tanushree believes the company's future seems far more promising than its past.

We recommend you watch the below video where Tanushree shares her views on India's top semiconductor stocks.

Happy Investing!

While the startup ecosystem has hit an unprecedented purple patch in the last few years the wheel of innovation keeps on rolling.

An interesting cog in this wheel is serverless computing which has been powering companies ranging from Fintechs to e-Commerce and even tech pioneers.

But What's Serverless?

We are in an age where applications make our world go round. But did you know that the best organisations such as Netflix BBC Airbnb and Nike leverage the power of serverless computing to deliver their product? Why - you ask? Simple. Developers need agile deployment and scalability – serverless computing allows this without the hassle of procuring and managing servers.

""Developers are leveraging serverless as they don't have to manage any infrastructure and can focus more on the core activities. In India smaller businesses or solo developers can innovate with serverless computing and reduce their costs drastically along with reducing the time spent on running codes"" said P Saravanan Vice-President Cloud Engineering Oracle India.

But does this mean that the age of servers is behind us? Not quite.

The name 'serverless' is quite misleading to begin with. But serverless computing in its most basic form means that a developer does not have to worry about managing servers – as that part is completely handled by a cloud service provider. Servers will always exist as long as there is data!

Every major cloud service provider provides a serverless platform today including IBM Cloud AWS Oracle Google Cloud and Microsoft Azure. A serverless model means that there are no dedicated server resources. Instead the resources are allocated on a 'need-for' basis to applications. This means that the customers only pay for resources used for a certain during of time.

Serverless architecture allows an organisation's developers to focus just on the logic and code without having to worry about scaling fault tolerance and redundancy of the underlying architecture. The cloud service provider has all that covered.

Cloud-first With Serverless

As enterprises continue to digitalise and implement cloud-first strategies serverless architectures are bound to become more and more relevant. It's worth it to have an architecture that takes the burden off the shoulders of engineers who have to perform the additional task of server management while being in charge of innovation too. With serverless they can finally bring applications faster to the marketplace at a lower cost driving revenue and increasing customer satisfaction.

According to IBM 'Serverless in the enterprise 2021' report 85 per cent of IT executives developer executives and developers from large and midmarket companies said that the effort and expense of adopting serverless architecture are worth it.

""Implementing serverless architecture has become an integral part of embracing a cloud-first strategy for IT leaders today"" explained Girish Dhanakshirur IBM Distinguished Engineer & CTO IBM India Software Labs.

""Organisations across industries have gained a significant competitive edge from serverless. Operational cost reduction is a key benefit of a serverless approach. However there are other benefits too like improved application quality employee productivity greater flexibility to scale and faster time to market to effectively respond to dynamic marketplace changes"" he added.

Evolution

Straits Research report from 2022 suggests that the serverless computing market is expected to grow at a CAGR of 26 per cent between 2020 and 2029. SMEs are expected to increase serverless computing adoption to reduce costs and deliver improved products during this time.

Geography-wise the report indicates that North America dominates the serverless market with a CAGR of 42 per cent. But Asia-Pacific is touted as the fastest growing region with a CAGR of 29.5 per cent.

With the ascension of serverless the cloud is embracing the new paradigm which represents a change in infrastructure and software delivery. This new development will allow companies of all sizes to achieve scalability and easy implementation. ""Serverless platforms are continuing their evolution delivering new and expanded functionality for a greater variety of applications including predictable workloads larger processing payloads or applications that require frequent cold starts. In fact our research found that most current users and nonusers are excited about what serverless architectures can do for their organisations and both groups believe that the future is bright for the approach"" said Dhanakshirur.

Endless Possibilities

As companies continue to explore a cloud-first approach they are bound to take an interest in serverless architecture sooner than later. But as we turn another page in our cloud history it will be interesting to see how the businesses adopt the serverless model.

""It remains to be seen if serverless computing will overtake Paas and IaaS as the preferred choice of cloud and become a standard feature or it will remain a niche solution for specific use cases. Either way serverless computing is bound to become a key source for innovation as businesses discover the benefits of this approach to cloud computing"" said Oracle's Saravanan.

But as a country India is still at its initial stages of cloud adoption as businesses take on the journey of digitalisation. ""Having a robust cloud architecture is integral to serverless computing. In India cloud adoption is gaining significant momentum across industries as businesses go through their modernisation journey. As the cloud adoption accelerates serverless computing will also gain widespread traction"" emphasised Dhanakshirur.

For applications serverless seems like the future. And as serverless itself morphs and evolves to address a few of its challenges more use cases are expected to emerge to help organisations scale better and develop faster.",,,,,,,,,

We knew it was coming and we knew Kenworth would launch it with all the gusto and pomp befitting the brand’s top-selling truck. Even so the launch of the new K220 cab-over was more than expected showcasing a tireless warrior transformed with a smart blend of modern features encased in classically Kenworth styling. But after 50 years is this the last major makeover we’ll see for the iconic K-series?

Kenworth events are a big deal. Always have been and given the aspirational notoriety of the brand probably always will be. Historically they don’t happen very often but over the past four or five years there has been a veritable glut of ‘big deals’ from Kenworth and Paccar Australia. All with good reason of course and all producing remarkable results as well as an occasional intriguing insight into bold new developments quietly taking shape behind closed doors.

Obviously enough the latest blockbuster was the recent and typically upmarket release of the K220 cab-over to around 500 customers dealers special guests and media in a purposefully prepared hangar at Brisbane’s Archerfield airbase. With air-race ace Matt Hall performing jaw-dropping aerial stunts it was by any measure a slap-up full throttle shindig to not only launch a new version of an old warhorse but also as one high-ranking Paccar Australia executive poignantly remarked an ideal opportunity to celebrate normality after two years of COVID-induced mayhem and misery.

Anyway while we’ll get to the basic details of the truck shortly suffice to say it would take a fountain of foolishness in a noggin of pure naivety to suggest the K220 will be anything less than a continuation of the incredible acceptance which keeps K-series the dominant model in Paccar Australia’s product portfolio.

Again though the arrival of the substantially reworked cab-over was simply the latest notch in a swathe of celebrations which largely started in 2018 with the first locally assembled DAF to roll out of the Bayswater (Vic) factory. Vitally the truck emerged in sync with the announcement of a $37 million expansion of the Bayswater plant and the unreserved expression of DAF’s critical importance to Paccar Australia’s future. However unbeknown to anyone outside Bayswater’s executive sanctum it was apparently the same year Kenworth started planning for a successor to the stunningly successful K200.

Then came the launch of Kenworth’s highly anticipated T610 conventional and its T410 and T360 siblings followed by the celebration of 50 years of truck production at Bayswater. After that was the 2021 Brisbane Truck Show which saw the arrival of the T410 SAR and the phenomenal almost rock star response to the retrospectively crafted Legend SAR.

Heady days indeed and all the while further cementing Kenworth’s and Paccar Australia’s powerhouse performance at the peak of the Australian heavy-duty truck market despite the brutal ravages and constraints of COVID. A truly amazing effort by a truly intuitive company.

Paccar Australia is however not a company to rest on laurels or let the grass grow under its feet and soon after the arrival of the new conventional models inquiring minds were wondering if the hugely popular K200 would be next in line for a significant makeover. After all the T610 and its siblings were the result of a $20 million overhaul of Kenworth’s conventional armoury and consequently it seemed entirely logical that with more than a decade passing since the K200 skyrocketed onto the market in 2010 the opportunity was perhaps ripe to start work on a refreshed cab-over design. Little did we know that plans were already well advanced.

Still there were at least two factors which caused some people to wonder if there was even the need for a refashioned K-series. One was the K200’s established acceptance and ongoing sales strength in a booming truck market. In effect why change something so successful?

The other and arguably most provocative factor was the growing inference of a boldly unique cab-over being developed in Europe specifically for our part of the world powered by an entirely new lightweight 15 litre Cummins engine with up to 660hp and 2300lb-ft of torque and believed to be set for a 2024 release.

Together these two factors questioned whether investment in a substantially refashioned K-series was altogether worthwhile particularly given strong indications that the new Cummins engine – currently being trialled in Australia – will not be offered in the K-series.

But as the launch of the K220 unequivocally showed a multi-million dollar investment was not only deemed worthwhile but also entirely appropriate for a truck which continues to be the prepotent platform for Kenworth’s strength and success over more than half a century.

However with the winds of change blowing ever stronger from Europe and the absolute certainty that DAF is the core of Paccar’s cab-over future is K220 the last major makeover of Kenworth’s seemingly indomitable K-series?

Right now it appears a question with no definitive answer but as we wrote late last year when first breaking news of the K220’s emergence ‘the only certainty is that despite the increasing costs of producing K-series purely for the Australian and New Zealand markets Paccar Australia is unlikely to ever voluntarily withdraw or kill off its classic cab-over’.

‘Market forces alone will determine K-series’ future but judging by the fact it is still Kenworth’s biggest seller this incredible survivor will be around for many many years yet. Investment in a new K220 version will prove it beyond doubt.

‘If people are prepared to keep paying for K-series in sufficient numbers Paccar Australia will almost certainly continue building it.’

Or as Brad May Paccar Australia’s resolute sales and marketing director asserted when recently asked if K220 was the final evolution of Kenworth’s redoubtable cab-over “It (K220) is by no means the end of the line for K-series. If we have the market to develop it further we will.”

Next Level

Let’s face it without the Australian and New Zealand markets and most notably Australia’s reliance on B-doubles for linehaul freight movements Kenworth’s K-series probably wouldn’t exist today. It would’ve simply drifted into dusty engineering archives several decades ago sometime after American length laws made conventionals preferable and cab-overs obsolete.

Yet as the only cab-over on the Australian market with an entirely American powertrain K-series has probably never known better times in our part of the world despite the fact that for many years now Paccar Australia has been entirely on its own when it comes to investment in the cab-over’s future.

More to the point perhaps Paccar Australia’s engineers and product designers have progressively done a superb job of keeping the aging cab-over relevant productive and popular in the face of fierce competition from highly advanced and increasingly assertive continental brands.

It all started of course in March 1971 when a slimline K125CR rigid model – affectionately known as the Grey Ghost – rolled off an infant Bayswater production line to become the first Australian-built Kenworth truck.

Since then gradual changes have seen the evolution of various cab-over models from the somewhat archaic K100C the marginally less archaic K100E the significantly upgraded K100G the underwhelming K104 which led to the slightly less underwhelming K104B and the stoic but altogether awkward K108.

Then in 2010 came the biggest and best change of all. K200! Defined by a highly distinctive grille design Bayswater engineers had performed the seemingly impossible by greatly reducing the engine cowl to provide drivers with a vastly improved workspace and dash layout and critically good access to the bunk and even standing room between driver and passenger seats. It might be taken for granted these days but K200 was a revolution in Kenworth’s cab-over design.

And now there’s the K220 marketed as the ‘Next Level’ in Kenworth’s cab-over chronicle but unquestionably more evolution than revolution. Even so as Brad May rightly enthused in a press statement “K220 celebrates Australian ingenuity to engineer a uniquely Australian product”.

“It is a development path that has been forged by an amazing collaboration between Australian transport operators and a dedicated and determined local development team that has spanned more than five decades.”

Similarly citing the critical involvement of customers in the K220’s development chief engineer Noelle Parlier stated “Although the K200 has benefited from many years of refinement customers were able to give us several areas of product improvement. It became apparent that our focus should be applied to providing greater driver comfort and technology integration.”

The end result is a truck which is obviously different inside and out yet retains Kenworth’s familiar contours and the design diversity to be configured as a 6×4 8×4 8×6 10×4 or 10×6 with gross combination mass ratings ranging from a nominal 97 tonnes up to around 250 tonnes.

Typically cab options include a 1.7 metre day cab to a 2.3 metre sleeper cab in flat-roof or high-rise aerodynamic form and a 2.8 metre aero ‘big cab’. Side extenders are available on all cab sizes plus there’s a wide range of sleeper storage and bunk options on the 2.3 and 2.8 metre cabs as well as roof fairings.

Critically though K220 also delivers a number of significant advances led by a new electrical package with enhanced capacity to integrate current and future functions from Europe and the US in areas such as safety telematics and powertrain developments.

On the outside the new grille is the most obvious change giving the cab-over a distinctive family resemblance to the T610 and T410 conventionals. What’s more Kenworth says ‘The new grille works with a more efficient fan (and) the new wheel well shield protects the engine bay and critical electrical systems from road spray and debris’.

However ‘The most significant exterior change is the new wind-cheating roof profile. Shaped with the aid of computational fluid dynamics the profile improves aerodynamic efficiency by four percent’ Kenworth claims.

Surprisingly absent from the new model are the vista windows on the front of high-rise roofline and according to Kenworth the decision to forego the windows was ‘Inspired by the success of this change on the T610 for improved sleeper insulation and a more easily maintained cab temperature’.

Likewise ‘The new roof profile increases headroom and provides greater overhead storage space which is now triple the size. The new climate-controlled HVAC (heating ventilation air conditioning) system provides significantly improved performance … in any weather.

Meantime the K220 also has new LED headlamps with integrated indicators and daytime running lights which Kenworth says ‘can be paired with bright bezels to enhance the model’s on-road presence’.

Overall though the most dramatic change is on the inside where a 15-inch (38cm) digital instrument panel provides a complete departure from Kenworth’s typical array of gauges and while uniquely different from the digital dash designs of prominent competitors at least takes Kenworth into the modern realm of digital instrumentation.

‘Intuitive and easy to read’ Kenworth states ‘this new digital instrumentation helps reduce distraction by allowing the driver to control how much information is shown when operating the truck. This can be customised from driver to driver and trip to trip.’

Typical of most modern digital systems ‘The instrument panel will display critical content to alert the driver of all necessary information constantly monitoring vehicle parameters and displaying them as required.’

Furthermore ‘With the press of a button the K220 will perform a comprehensive Systems Check (and) at the end of the day will display a detailed trip and vehicle summary including average fuel economy idle time cruise control usage as well as any potential mechanical issues.’

Kenworth also emphasises easy control of the various functions and settings through ‘a new and improved SmartWheel and stalk mounted controls’ while an eight-inch (20cm) Audio Visual Navigation (AVN) unit on the left of the dash ‘provides easy access display with intuitive controls for truck navigation the audio system and smartphone mirroring’.

The AVN can also be operated through control buttons on the steering wheel.

For the purists though there’s space for the option of up to six regular analogue gauges on the left extremity of the dash fascia.

Continuing the techno trend Kenworth says every K220 is equipped with Paccar Connect Paccar’s proprietary telematics system which offers live tracking and monitoring of the vehicle driver and fleet performance data in easy-to-read reports that can be customised to individual needs.

For drivers ‘the interior is more spacious and quieter than ever (with) more space in the footwell achieved by moving pedals further forward combined with a greater range of seat movement’.

And maintaining the all-important Kenworth image is soft upholstery in traditional studded trim with updated colour choices.

After the initial fanfare and fuss of the K220’s blazing entry a few quiet minutes inside the cab at least revealed user friendly features and system controls in an entirely pleasing environment and an extremely impressive digital dash display. Hopefully it won’t be long before an overnight run will provide the opportunity to better gauge the extent of the new model’s makeover.

Under the cab though it seems the only significant change is in the availability of Eaton’s all-new Endurant XD Pro 18-speed automated transmission behind the quintessential Cummins X15 engine in either Euro 5 or Euro 6 form.

Of course there’s also an 18-speed manual version but it’s the much anticipated automated ’box which sets a new standard for both Eaton and Kenworth. Said to be lighter smoother and engineered to reduce fuel and maintenance costs Kenworth says the Endurant XD uses Eaton’s ‘extreme duty’ clutches equipped with components designed for greater durability lower noise and vibration levels and better low-speed manoeuvrability.

On the subject of safety Kenworth makes considerable claims for its latest cab-over. As the company states ‘Contributing to improved safety for drivers and other road users the K220 has the largest range of active and passive safety options ever offered by Kenworth Australia adding multi-lane Autonomous Emergency Braking and stop-and-go functionality (whatever that means) to a growing list of systems.’

Sounds impressive but typically Paccar Australia chose to keep advanced safety systems on the options list rather than match its major rivals with the standard inclusion of a high-level safety package.

Rest assured though the day is coming within the next few years when world-class safety systems will be an integral standard feature in a highly advanced cab-over from Paccar Australia.

Whether that truck will be badged a DAF or a Kenworth remains to be seen. You never know it might even be called a Paccar. And why not? After all it’s a brand that already reflects prestige and success.

Whatever it’s called we’re expecting to be amazed by a truck which will bring together Paccar’s global strengths to produce something entirely unique to the Australian market and like nothing ever before offered by Paccar Australia.

In the meantime there’s no question the K220 will continue to do what its forebears have done for decades – work hard and work well for as long as it takes before time technology circumstance and cost ultimately combine to create another Kenworth ‘Legend’.",,,,,,,,,
PKG,Packaging Corporation of America,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiNmh0dHBzOi8vZWFydGgub3JnL2dyZWVud2FzaGluZy1jb21wYW5pZXMtY29ycG9yYXRpb25zL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,10 Companies Called Out For Greenwashing,"Greenwashing can be as subtle as a misleading packaging choice all the way to fossil fuel companies touting themselves as being eco-champions. Either way greenwashing is a harmful and deceitful way of advertising that a company is more sustainable than it actually is. Companies that make false claims should be held accountable. Here are 10 companies that have been caught greenwashing in various ways.

—

1. Volkswagen

A classic example of greenwashing is when Volkswagen admitted to cheating emissions tests by fitting various vehicles with a “defect” device with software that could detect when it was undergoing an emissions test and altering the performance to reduce the emissions level.

This was going on while to the public the company was touting the low-emissions and eco-friendly features of its vehicles in marketing campaigns. In actuality these engines were emitting up to 40 times the allowed limit for nitrogen oxide pollutants.

2. BP

Fossil fuel giant BP changed their name to Beyond Petroleum and publicly added solar panels on their gas stations. In December 2019 an environmental group called ClientEarth lodged a complaint against BP for misleading the public with its advertisements that focused on BP’s low-carbon energy products when more than 96% of its annual spend is on oil and gas.

3. ExxonMobil

Oil giant ExxonMobil has a long history of damaging the environment. In 1989 an Exxon oil tanker spilled 11 million gallons of crude oil into Alaska’s Prince William Sound in what was the worst oil spill in US history until the Deepwater Horizon oil spill in 2010. The Exxon oil spill covered 1300 miles of coastline and killed hundreds of thousands of seabirds otters seals and whales. More than 30 years later pockets of crude oil remain in some locations.

Recently ExxonMobil came under fire for advertising that suggested that its experimental algae biofuels could one day reduce transport emissions while it has no company-wide net zero target and its 2025 emission reduction targets do not include the vast majority of emissions resulting from its products.

4. Nestlé

In 2018 Nestlé released a statement saying that it had “ambitions” for its packaging to be 100% recyclable or reusable by 2025. However environmental groups and other critics pointed out that the company hadn’t released clear targets a timeline to accompany its ambitions or additional efforts to help facilitate recycling by consumers. Greenpeace reacted to this by releasing its own statement in which it said “Nestlé’s statement on plastic packaging includes more of the same greenwashing baby steps to tackle a crisis it helped to create. It will not actually move the needle toward the reduction of single-use plastics in a meaningful way and sets an incredibly low standard as the largest food and beverage company in the world.” In Break Free From Plastic’s 2020 annual report Nestlé along with Coca-Cola and PepsiCo were named the world’s top plastic polluters for the third year in a row.

5. Coca-Cola

In the annual report mentioned above by Break Free From Plastic Coca-Cola was ranked as the world’s number 1 plastic polluter it’s second consecutive year at the top. In 2020 the company came under fire when it announced that it would not abandon plastic bottles saying that they were popular with customers.

Despite this the company is adamant that it is making progress in tackling packaging waste. At the time a spokesperson said “Globally we have a commitment to get every bottle back by 2030 so that none of it ends up as litter or in the oceans and the plastic can be recycled into new bottles. Bottles with 100% recycled plastic are now available in 18 markets around the world and this is continually growing.”

Then in June 2021 environmental organisation Earth Island Institute filed a lawsuit against the beverage giant for falsely advertising that it is sustainable and eco-friendly despite being the largest plastic polluter in the world.

6. Starbucks

In 2018 Starbucks released a “straw-less lid” as part of its sustainability drive however this lid contained more plastic than the old lid and straw combination. The company didn’t dispute this but claimed that it is made from polypropylene a commonly-accepted recyclable plastic that “can be captured in recycling infrastructure.” Critics were quick to point out that only 9% of the world’s plastic is recycled so the company shouldn’t assume all the lids would be recycled. Further the US exports about one-third of its recycling to developing countries so it is simply passing its responsibility to poorer countries.

7. IKEA

IKEA was considered a beacon of a major corporation being sustainable before June 2020 when the furniture retailer was linked with illegal logging in Ukraine. In a report by NGO Earthsight the wood certification scheme IKEA uses Forest Stewardship Council was described as an organisation that greenwashes the timber industry. It was accused of failing to catch IKEA’s sourcing of conflict wood and act on it.

Further when IKEA built its “most sustainable store” yet in London in 2019 it did so on top of another sustainable store that was demolished after just 17 years of use.

8. Plastic Bottle Water Companies

A more subtle form of greenwashing can be seen in plastic water bottle companies like Poland Spring Evian and Deer Park that all have nature on their labels. This is laughably ironic considering that plastic water bottles are designed to be single-use and are contributing to the massive plastic waste crisis around the world.

9. Major Banks

The past several years have seen major financial institutions talking a big game about combating climate change yet these are more examples of companies exercising greenwashing strategies. JP Morgan Citibank and Bank of America have issued new “green investment” opportunities. However a report released last year by the Rainforest Action Network showed that big banks – the ones mentioned above but also including Wells Fargo Barclays Bank of China HSBC Goldman Sachs and Deutsche Bank – were still lending enormous sums to the industries that contribute the most to global warming like fossil fuels and deforestations while boasting that they’re the leaders of the green transition.

10. Fast Fashion Brands

H&M Zara and Uniqlo are among the companies that were caught greenwashing over the years. These fashion brands contribute to the massive amounts of textile waste caused by the clothing industry. According to the fashion nonprofit ReMake 80% of discarded textiles globally are incinerated or landfill-bound with just 20% being reused or recycled.

Fast fashion brands also have a habit of advertising its green initiatives widely despite it being a tiny part of its operations. For example in 2019 H&M launched its own line of “green” clothing titled “Conscious.” The company claims to use “organic” cotton and recycled polyester. However the line is nothing but a marketing tactic used to make themselves appear more environmentally friendly. When looking at H&M’s “Conscious” line its mission states: “Shop our selection of sustainable fashion pieces that make you both look and feel good.” However there is no single legal definition for marketing-friendly words such as “sustainable” “green” or “environmentally-friendly.” H&M was then criticised by the Norwegian Customer Authority for “misleading” marketing of their Conscious Collection because “the information given regarding sustainability was not sufficient especially given that the Conscious Collection is advertised as a collection with environmental benefits.”

What Can I Do?

1. On A Personal Level

Ways to approach climate action within our personal lives (hint – it evolves personal action but is not focused on small behavioural changes which whilst worthwhile will not get us there):

Joining a community can be one of the best ways to increase your impact.

First it can enable you to make hundreds of connections in one go.

Second a group of people working together can have more impact than individuals. If you are not already take action by becoming an EO Member to support our mission to encourage a billion climate activists .

If you’re a younger read ask your parents to take action by bringing your whole family on board as a Family Member.

Reflect on the concept of Effective Altruism  a project that aims to find the best ways to help others and put them into practice.

2. On A Professional Level

Ways to approach climate action within the workplace:

Maintain your career path but consider donating a portion of your income to organisations that are focused on achieving meaningful & impactful goals and call out your boss if the company or organisation you work for does not have clear policies that will result in reduced harm to the environment and a pathway to Net Zero.

Ask your boss to support EO by bringing the whole team onboard with EO company membership – and take action together.

Reconsider your career path with excellent advice here .

3. On A Political Level

Ways to approach climate action as a voter or political actor (even if you can’t vote):

Protest – make your feelings known – become a vocal and passionate advocate with friends and family (without being over pushy) of the need for climate action. We need a billion activists to turn this ship around.

Join organisations that are organising climate actions and protests locally whether in your city district or even at school.

Vote (if you can) for politicians who will champion effective climate action by governments.

Vote for parties or organisations that espouse self-reform and the adoption of ‘ Ministers of the Future ’ into government.

""The malware installs multilayer obfuscated PHP backdoors to the web server's file system downloads new payloads for execution and schedules recurring tasks to re-infect the host system"" Palo Alto Networks Unit 42 said in a Friday report.

The unusual activity is said to have commenced in mid-December 2021 and targets Asterisk a widely used software implementation of a private branch exchange (PBX) that runs on the open-source Elastix Unified Communications Server.

Unit 42 said the intrusions share similarities with the INJ3CTOR3 campaign that Israeli cybersecurity firm Check Point disclosed in November 2020 alluding to the possibility that they could be a ""resurgence"" of the previous attacks.

Coinciding with the sudden surge is the public disclosure in December 2021 of a now-patched remote code execution flaw in FreePBX a web-based open source GUI that's used to control and manage Asterisk. Tracked as CVE-2021-45461 the issue is rated 9.8 out of 10 for severity.

The attacks commence with retrieving an initial dropper shell script from a remote server which in turn is orchestrated to install the PHP web shell in different locations in the file system as well as create two root user accounts to maintain remote access.

It further creates a scheduled task that runs every minute and fetches a remote copy of the shell script from the attacker-controlled domain for execution.

Besides taking measures to cover its tracks the malware is also equipped to run arbitrary commands ultimately allowing the hackers to take control of the system steal information while also maintaining a backdoor to the compromised hosts.

""The strategy of implanting web shells in vulnerable servers is not a new tactic for malicious actors"" the researchers said adding it's a ""common approach malware authors take to launch exploits or run commands remotely.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMieWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJsZWVwaW5nY29tcHV0ZXIuY29tL25ld3Mvc2VjdXJpdHkvZWxhc3RpeC12b2lwLXN5c3RlbXMtaGFja2VkLWluLW1hc3NpdmUtY2FtcGFpZ24tdG8taW5zdGFsbC1waHAtd2ViLXNoZWxscy_SAX1odHRwczovL3d3dy5ibGVlcGluZ2NvbXB1dGVyLmNvbS9uZXdzL3NlY3VyaXR5L2VsYXN0aXgtdm9pcC1zeXN0ZW1zLWhhY2tlZC1pbi1tYXNzaXZlLWNhbXBhaWduLXRvLWluc3RhbGwtcGhwLXdlYi1zaGVsbHMvYW1wLw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Elastix VoIP systems hacked in massive campaign to install PHP web shells,"Threat analysts have uncovered a large-scale campaign targeting Elastix VoIP telephony servers with more than 500000 malware samples over a period of three months.

Elastix is a server software for unified communications (Internet Protocol Private Branch Exchange [IP PBX] email instant messaging faxing) that can be used with the Digium phones module for FreePBX.

The attackers may have exploited a remote code excution (RCE) vulnerability identified as CVE-2021-45461 with a critical severity rating of 9.8 out of 10.

Adversaries have been exploiting this vulnerability since December 2021 and the recent campaign appears to be connected to the security issue.

Security researchers at Palo Alto Networks' Unit 42 say that the attackers' goal was to plant a PHP web shell that could run arbitrary commands on the compromised communications server.

In a report on Friday the researchers say that the threat actor deployed ""more than 500000 unique malware samples of this family"" between December 2021 and March 2022.

The campaign is still active and shares several similarities to another operation in 2020 that was reported by researchers at cybersecurity company Check Point.

Attack details

The researchers observed two attack groups using different initial exploitation scripts to drop a small-size shell script. The script installs the PHP backdoor on the target device and also creates root user accounts and ensures persistence through scheduled tasks.

One of the two scripts used for initial compromise (Palo Alto Networks)

""This dropper also tries to blend into the existing environment by spoofing the timestamp of the installed PHP backdoor file to that of a known file already on the system"" note the security researchers.

The IP addresses of the attackers from both groups are located in the Netherlands while DNS records reveal links to several Russian adult sites. Currently parts of the payload-delivery infrastructure remain online and operational.

The scheduled task created by the first script runs every minute to fetch a PHP web shell that is base64 encoded and can manage the following parameters in incoming web requests:

md5 – MD5 authentication hash for remote login and web shell interaction.

– MD5 authentication hash for remote login and web shell interaction. admin – Select between Elastic and Freepbx administrator session.

– Select between Elastic and Freepbx administrator session. cmd – Run arbitrary commands remotely

– Run arbitrary commands remotely call – Start a call from the Asterisk command line interface (CLI)

The web shell also features an additional set of eight built-in commands for file reading directory listing and reconnaissance of the Asterisk open-source PBX platform.

The report from Unit42 includes technical details on how the payloads are dropped and some tactics to avoid detection on the existing environment. Furthermore a list of indicators of compromise reveals local file paths the malware uses unique strings hashes for shell scripts and public URLs that host the payloads.",,,,,,,,,

This past week and weekend includes milestones aplenty for such films as Thor: Love And Thunder Minions: The Rise Of Gru Jurassic World Dominion and the seemingly unstoppable Top Gun: Maverick. But it’s not a free-for-all as audiences now appear more discerning amid the recent barrage of big-ticket titles — adding to that there is a very threatening heatwave across European majors which is complicating matters on several levels.

Disney/Marvel’s Thor: Love And Thunder led the international box office weekend in its sophomore session with an added $60.1M from 47 material markets. The global cume is thisclose to $500M with $498M through Sunday. The overseas drop was 59% from last weekend. That’s a skosh lower than Spider-Man: No Way Home’s 60% sophomore dip (though that movie was a holiday release) and deeper than Doctor Strange In The Multiverse Of Madness (-56%) in the same suite of markets for the second frame.

Regionally Asia-Pacific saw the biggest slide on Thor 4 (-64%) Europe/Middle East/Africa was down 56% and Latin America 53%.

Should we be celebrating or lamenting this major Marvel entry — $500M is nothing to sniff at across two weekends — but it is certainly being dinged by reviews and has competition from a continuously surging Top Gun: Maverick which took back PLFs this session in some markets. Also a codicil for all films right now comps are tough since currency exchange rates have gone haywire. The dollar and the euro are essentially at parity.

Here's the complete guide,"How much is Ether Worth?



Due to the wide range of applications of the technology as a platform the value of ether has also soared over the years. Soon after its launch ether’s valuation was hundreds of US dollars and although it peaked above $1000 in Jan 2018 it fell back soon for the next couple of years.

During the pandemic the value of ether began to rise again this time rising well beyond its previous peak to reach $4600 in November last year. Since the beginning of 2022 along with other cryptocurrencies ether has also been dropping value and even briefly went below the $1000 mark in June before regaining some value again.

As with other crypto investments ether is also prone to high market volatility and investing in this space comes with its own risks — investors need to be aware that they can lose everything.

ELON Musk has a surprise question for hopeful engineers looking to join SpaceX Tesla or Neuralink.

Musk and other technology companies have used riddles to examine candidates' thinking styles - would you make it in Silicon Valley?

1 Musk's top brain teaser is a combination of geometry and logic

Where in the world is Elon Musk?

Musk is a known fan of puns brain teasers and video games that make players think.

In 2015 he told biographer Ashlee Vance about tricky interview questions he'll unleash on potential employees.

Musk's favorite goes as follows:

""You're standing on the surface of the Earth. You walk one mile south one mile west and one mile north. You end up exactly where you started. Where are you?""

If you answered ""North Pole"" you're right but you might not be on the SpaceX team just yet - there's a second answer that Musk is looking for.

CNBC sprung this riddle on passing New Yorkers - most struggled mightily with the second answer.

While Musk mostly just wants to see a candidate's thought process the answer is one mile north of a one-mile circle around the South Pole.

From this position you walk one mile south reaching the high point of the circle.

Then when you walk west for one mile you'll walk in a complete circle - head north for one mile as the riddle says and you're back where you started.

Are you SpaceX's next astronaut?

Rope watch

You have two pieces of rope that are coated in oil - when lit a single rope will take one hour to burn.

How can you use the two pieces of rope to measure 45 minutes?

This riddle appeared in Jimmy Soni’s book The Founders for which he had direct access to executives from PayPal - founder Max Levchin posed this mind-melter to Silicon Valley titan Peter Thiel while they discussed ideas that would make them both rich.

The trick is to light one rope at both ends and the other at one end.

The rope with two flames will burn up completely in 30 minutes.

At this point light the other end of the second rope - remember it's already been burning at one end for 30 minutes.

The second rope will extinguish in 15 minutes giving you 45 minutes of measured time.

Thiel got the answer correct - he and Levchin would go on to build PayPal into a billion-dollar company with an All-Star team of entrepreneurs still powering the Valley today.

Adobe's moped query

You have 50 gasoline-powered mopeds and each tank can carry the moped 100 kilometers - what's the furthest distance you can travel using all 50 mopeds?

The wrong answer one that surely won't help you get hired at Adobe is 100 kilometers.

Here's a hint: all 50 mopeds do not need to travel together or go the distance.

A clever engineer's answer would be to use all 50 mopeds to go 50 kilometers - this will use 50% of the fuel in each tank.

Take the fuel from 25 bikes and pour it into the other 25 - now half the mopeds have full tanks and the other half are disregarded.

Repeat this process every 50 kilometers cutting your stock of mopeds in half from 50 to 25 to 12 to six to three and then finally one.

Remember each time the number of bikes is cut in half you've traveled 50 kilometers - this is done five times giving you 250 kilometers of travel.

The last remaining moped has a full tank capable of traveling 100 kilometers - 350 kilometers is the better answer.

But the best answer according to Interesting Engineering is to empty the tank of one bike as soon as there is space in another.

Ride all 50 bikes two kilometers and take the fuel from one and distribute it among the remaining 49.

Travel a distance of 100 divided by 49 kilometers to clear enough space in the tanks to accept more fuel - repeat until there are no bikes left.

This method yields 449.92 kilometers traveled.

Silicon Valley's adoration for brain teasers comes from an opportunity to watch someone compute a complex math-adjacent problem while on their toes.

The fad of asking brain teasers as interview questions has largely gone out of style after a Google internal study revealed the riddles did not help the company hire the strongest most elite candidates.

Tech employees sharing experiences on anonymous message boards tend to agree that brain teasers are a turn-off for candidates.",,,

The beverage giant is facing cost increases for ingredients and for transportation due to the global factors pushing up prices across the board and may have to pass on this expense to the consumer.

Disruptions in the global supply chain caused by the pandemic and the increasing cost of raw materials have forced Pepsi like other food and drink manufacturers to raise the prices of its products. Some producers have refused to push up prices fearing that it could bring about a drop in demand but PepsiCo appears likely to continue to raise prices to account for inflation.

In recent months the cost of the brand’s products has been increased but it does not seem to have affected the appeal. PepsiCo’s chief financial officer Hugh Johnston told Reuters that the company has not experienced any kind of drop in demand after upping prices for its soft drinks.

“In a world where we’re seeing things like vegetable oil grains and packaging prices rising dramatically I’d be surprised if there weren’t more [price increases] over the course of the next year” Johnston explained.

The privileges of a duopoly

PepsiCo has reached such prominence in the minds of consumers that it would likely take fairly severe price rises for a significant proportion of buyers to turn away from the brand. CFRA Research analyst Arun Sundaram believes their freedom to increase prices without affecting demand stems from the lack of competition in the market.

Arun explains: “It is really a duopoly between Pepsi and Coca-Cola so they have a huge amount of pricing power”.

Data from Refinitiv found that the company’s net revenue for the second quarter of this year rose by 5.2% to $20.23 billion exceeding earlier estimates of $19.51 billion. This came despite a $1.4 billion charge on the company as a result of the withdrawal from the Russian market after the country invaded Ukraine.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiNmh0dHBzOi8vZWFydGgub3JnL2dyZWVud2FzaGluZy1jb21wYW5pZXMtY29ycG9yYXRpb25zL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,10 Companies Called Out For Greenwashing,"Greenwashing can be as subtle as a misleading packaging choice all the way to fossil fuel companies touting themselves as being eco-champions. Either way greenwashing is a harmful and deceitful way of advertising that a company is more sustainable than it actually is. Companies that make false claims should be held accountable. Here are 10 companies that have been caught greenwashing in various ways.

—

1. Volkswagen

A classic example of greenwashing is when Volkswagen admitted to cheating emissions tests by fitting various vehicles with a “defect” device with software that could detect when it was undergoing an emissions test and altering the performance to reduce the emissions level.

This was going on while to the public the company was touting the low-emissions and eco-friendly features of its vehicles in marketing campaigns. In actuality these engines were emitting up to 40 times the allowed limit for nitrogen oxide pollutants.

2. BP

Fossil fuel giant BP changed their name to Beyond Petroleum and publicly added solar panels on their gas stations. In December 2019 an environmental group called ClientEarth lodged a complaint against BP for misleading the public with its advertisements that focused on BP’s low-carbon energy products when more than 96% of its annual spend is on oil and gas.

3. ExxonMobil

Oil giant ExxonMobil has a long history of damaging the environment. In 1989 an Exxon oil tanker spilled 11 million gallons of crude oil into Alaska’s Prince William Sound in what was the worst oil spill in US history until the Deepwater Horizon oil spill in 2010. The Exxon oil spill covered 1300 miles of coastline and killed hundreds of thousands of seabirds otters seals and whales. More than 30 years later pockets of crude oil remain in some locations.

Recently ExxonMobil came under fire for advertising that suggested that its experimental algae biofuels could one day reduce transport emissions while it has no company-wide net zero target and its 2025 emission reduction targets do not include the vast majority of emissions resulting from its products.

4. Nestlé

In 2018 Nestlé released a statement saying that it had “ambitions” for its packaging to be 100% recyclable or reusable by 2025. However environmental groups and other critics pointed out that the company hadn’t released clear targets a timeline to accompany its ambitions or additional efforts to help facilitate recycling by consumers. Greenpeace reacted to this by releasing its own statement in which it said “Nestlé’s statement on plastic packaging includes more of the same greenwashing baby steps to tackle a crisis it helped to create. It will not actually move the needle toward the reduction of single-use plastics in a meaningful way and sets an incredibly low standard as the largest food and beverage company in the world.” In Break Free From Plastic’s 2020 annual report Nestlé along with Coca-Cola and PepsiCo were named the world’s top plastic polluters for the third year in a row.

5. Coca-Cola

In the annual report mentioned above by Break Free From Plastic Coca-Cola was ranked as the world’s number 1 plastic polluter it’s second consecutive year at the top. In 2020 the company came under fire when it announced that it would not abandon plastic bottles saying that they were popular with customers.

Despite this the company is adamant that it is making progress in tackling packaging waste. At the time a spokesperson said “Globally we have a commitment to get every bottle back by 2030 so that none of it ends up as litter or in the oceans and the plastic can be recycled into new bottles. Bottles with 100% recycled plastic are now available in 18 markets around the world and this is continually growing.”

Then in June 2021 environmental organisation Earth Island Institute filed a lawsuit against the beverage giant for falsely advertising that it is sustainable and eco-friendly despite being the largest plastic polluter in the world.

6. Starbucks

In 2018 Starbucks released a “straw-less lid” as part of its sustainability drive however this lid contained more plastic than the old lid and straw combination. The company didn’t dispute this but claimed that it is made from polypropylene a commonly-accepted recyclable plastic that “can be captured in recycling infrastructure.” Critics were quick to point out that only 9% of the world’s plastic is recycled so the company shouldn’t assume all the lids would be recycled. Further the US exports about one-third of its recycling to developing countries so it is simply passing its responsibility to poorer countries.

7. IKEA

IKEA was considered a beacon of a major corporation being sustainable before June 2020 when the furniture retailer was linked with illegal logging in Ukraine. In a report by NGO Earthsight the wood certification scheme IKEA uses Forest Stewardship Council was described as an organisation that greenwashes the timber industry. It was accused of failing to catch IKEA’s sourcing of conflict wood and act on it.

Further when IKEA built its “most sustainable store” yet in London in 2019 it did so on top of another sustainable store that was demolished after just 17 years of use.

8. Plastic Bottle Water Companies

A more subtle form of greenwashing can be seen in plastic water bottle companies like Poland Spring Evian and Deer Park that all have nature on their labels. This is laughably ironic considering that plastic water bottles are designed to be single-use and are contributing to the massive plastic waste crisis around the world.

9. Major Banks

The past several years have seen major financial institutions talking a big game about combating climate change yet these are more examples of companies exercising greenwashing strategies. JP Morgan Citibank and Bank of America have issued new “green investment” opportunities. However a report released last year by the Rainforest Action Network showed that big banks – the ones mentioned above but also including Wells Fargo Barclays Bank of China HSBC Goldman Sachs and Deutsche Bank – were still lending enormous sums to the industries that contribute the most to global warming like fossil fuels and deforestations while boasting that they’re the leaders of the green transition.

10. Fast Fashion Brands

H&M Zara and Uniqlo are among the companies that were caught greenwashing over the years. These fashion brands contribute to the massive amounts of textile waste caused by the clothing industry. According to the fashion nonprofit ReMake 80% of discarded textiles globally are incinerated or landfill-bound with just 20% being reused or recycled.

Fast fashion brands also have a habit of advertising its green initiatives widely despite it being a tiny part of its operations. For example in 2019 H&M launched its own line of “green” clothing titled “Conscious.” The company claims to use “organic” cotton and recycled polyester. However the line is nothing but a marketing tactic used to make themselves appear more environmentally friendly. When looking at H&M’s “Conscious” line its mission states: “Shop our selection of sustainable fashion pieces that make you both look and feel good.” However there is no single legal definition for marketing-friendly words such as “sustainable” “green” or “environmentally-friendly.” H&M was then criticised by the Norwegian Customer Authority for “misleading” marketing of their Conscious Collection because “the information given regarding sustainability was not sufficient especially given that the Conscious Collection is advertised as a collection with environmental benefits.”

Ways to approach climate action within our personal lives (hint – it evolves personal action but is not focused on small behavioural changes which whilst worthwhile will not get us there):

Joining a community can be one of the best ways to increase your impact.

First it can enable you to make hundreds of connections in one go.

Second a group of people working together can have more impact than individuals. If you are not already take action by becoming an EO Member to support our mission to encourage a billion climate activists .

If you’re a younger read ask your parents to take action by bringing your whole family on board as a Family Member.

Reflect on the concept of Effective Altruism  a project that aims to find the best ways to help others and put them into practice.

2. On A Professional Level

Ways to approach climate action within the workplace:

Maintain your career path but consider donating a portion of your income to organisations that are focused on achieving meaningful & impactful goals and call out your boss if the company or organisation you work for does not have clear policies that will result in reduced harm to the environment and a pathway to Net Zero.

Ask your boss to support EO by bringing the whole team onboard with EO company membership – and take action together.

3. On A Political Level

Ways to approach climate action as a voter or political actor (even if you can’t vote):

Protest – make your feelings known – become a vocal and passionate advocate with friends and family (without being over pushy) of the need for climate action. We need a billion activists to turn this ship around.

Join organisations that are organising climate actions and protests locally whether in your city district or even at school.

Vote (if you can) for politicians who will champion effective climate action by governments.

Vote for parties or organisations that espouse self-reform and the adoption of ‘ Ministers of the Future ’ into government.

Gary Vaynerchuk chairman of holding company VaynerX launched VaynerNFT in July 2021 to help brands plan strategize and execute on NFT strategies. At the time he said NFTs were primed to become a “real consumer trend in perpetuity” as he predicted brands would invest heavily in the technology in 2022.

A diverse range of brands have released NFT projects in the past year from Tommy Hilfiger to PepsiCo to the Ukrainian government. But the digital assets have emerged as one segment of a much more comprehensive push from brands into metaverse and Web3 experiences.

Announcing the rebrand of VaynerNFT the company said that while interest in the NFT world “continues to expand dramatically” the past 12 months have also given rise to virtual events and metaverse experiences cryptocurrency acceptance and decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs).

The new Vayner3 is positioning itself as a consultancy that can help brands invest in experiences across the Web3 ecosystem from building branded metaverses to blockchain integration strategies. NFT technology “will remain a cornerstone of Web3” it said.

Vaynerchuk who is CEO of Vayner3 said In a statement: “The world of Web3 is the next iteration of consumer behavior. The team we built at Vayner3 is here to guide the world’s leading enterprises and intellectual property owners through this space.”

The consultancy will continue to be led by Avery Akkineni as president.

Akkineni said there are now “myriad ways” for brands to engage in the Web3 space from loyalty integration programs immersive consumer and digital experiences philanthropy infrastructure to adopting cryptocurrency acceptance.

“While NFTs may have been the word of the year in 2021 there are myriad ways for enterprises to engage in multidimensional Web3 strategies anchored in driving tangible business outcomes” Akkineni said in a release. Akkineni also serves in an advisory capacity across Salesforce Web3 Studios and OneOf an eco-conscious NFT platform.

The consultancy launched with Budweiser as a flagship client and said it now services more than two dozen Fortune 500 companies including PepsiCo Anheuser-Busch InBev Diageo and Coinbase.

Some clients including Budweiser Diageo and PepsiCo are shared with VaynerX’s creative and media agency VaynerMedia where Vaynerchuk is also CEO. VaynerMedia grew revenue by 31% to $188 million in 2021 according to its Campaign US Report Card.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMijQFodHRwczovL20uZWNvbm9taWN0aW1lcy5jb20vdGVjaC90ZWNobm9sb2d5L2JyYW5kcy1ub3ctcm9wZS1pbi1yZWdpb25hbC1pbmZsdWVuY2Vycy10by13aW4tb3Zlci1zbWFsbC10b3ducy12aWxsYWdlcy9hcnRpY2xlc2hvdy85MjkwNzMzOC5jbXPSAZEBaHR0cHM6Ly9tLmVjb25vbWljdGltZXMuY29tL3RlY2gvdGVjaG5vbG9neS9icmFuZHMtbm93LXJvcGUtaW4tcmVnaW9uYWwtaW5mbHVlbmNlcnMtdG8td2luLW92ZXItc21hbGwtdG93bnMtdmlsbGFnZXMvYW1wX2FydGljbGVzaG93LzkyOTA3MzM4LmNtcw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Brands now rope in regional influencers to win over small towns villages,"Elevate Your Tech Prowess with High-Value Skill Courses Offering College Course Website Indian School of Business Professional Certificate in Product Management Visit IIT Delhi Certificate Programme in Data Science & Machine Learning Visit MIT MIT Technology Leadership and Innovation Visit

Talk about the ever-increasing influence of social media influencers . Brands are now roping in content creators in regional languages to popularise their products in smaller towns and villages. Flipkart  Mahindra & Mahindra Maruti Suzuki  and Byju’s among several others are increasingly looking to tap the potential of what they call ‘Bharat social media influencers’ who have a specific genre of content with loyal followers that helps brands micro-target and connect with audiences in non- metros and villages.They are helped by rising popularity of short video apps such as MX Josh Moj and Chingari that target people in tier II and III markets.Take the case of Shubham Mapralkar a Marathi content creator from Narayangaon near Pune who is popular for his videos sharing facts on a variety of subjects. Wild Stone a perfume owned by McNROE Consumer Products recently got him to promote its products on Moj.Jasmine Mishra an Odia creator known for her dance videos on regional songs has worked with brands such as Pepsi and Byju’s to promote their campaigns on Moj.Increasing adoption of short video content across both urban and non-urban regions of the country has made brands realise the effectiveness of such platforms in reaching their target audience said Shashank Shekhar senior director content strategy and operations at ShareChat and Moj.Influencer marketing is changing the rules of brand outreach as social media has emerged one of the primary influences for people in non-metro regions to make buying decisions experts said.A recent report by ShareChat comparing Indians who prefer consuming content in English (‘India users’) versus regional languages (‘Bharat users’) found that Bharat users are more open to expressing themselves online.Bharat is increasingly shopping online with 46% buying gadgets online in 2021 said the report titled The Neo India Report. Other categories like travel bookings food clothing and accessories beauty and skincare are also popular in Bharat it said.“Combining Moj and TakaTak the top short-video platform in India we have a creator community of over 100 million and 300 monthly active users” Shekhar said. “Generally we have seen that over 60% of our creators are from Tier 2 and 3 cities which are also emerging as important markets to access smartphones high-speed internet and the rise of local SMBs.”With growing digital literacy and language-enabled devices there has been a rapid increase in users and creators from non-urban areas. People are using social media to express their creativity while also finding the opportunity to monetise their reach and content.Consumer companies said brand endorsements and recommendations by YouTubers and local influencers have the potential to create a significant impact in the buying decision of consumers.Consumers connect well when the communication is done in local languages they said adding that tie-ups with local influencers are also cost-effective for brands.“This is the era of new-age marketing and influencers are an integral part of building brands” said Veejay Nakra president auto at leading automaker Mahindra & Mahindra.“Reviews by influencers based on their product trials or ownership experience are seen as authentic and credible” Nakra said. “Today even micro-influencers with vernacular content are helping brands like ours reach their target audiences across geographies…(and) to go hyperlocal.”Shashank Srivastava senior executive director at the country’s largest carmaker Maruti Suzuki too said “We rely on these influencers during product launches as they can be effectively tapped as potential audience.”Marketers say brands have been able to cash in on talent from various pockets of the country who are able to connect deeply with audiences within their community with common backgrounds and language preferences.“Besides making ecommerce accessible to millions of first-time users this collaboration also incentivises content creators in the Moj ecosystem” Shekhar of Moj said.",,,

If you haven't subscribed yet you can do that by clicking here.

Fourth doses of COVID-19 vaccines are rolling out to more Canadians as eligibility opens up across the country  but research suggests there are limitations to the impact they can have on the highly contagious BA.5 Omicron subvariant fuelling Canada's first summer surge.

After growing pressure from health-care workers and the general public for access to additional shots some provincial governments have expanded eligibility from just immunocompromised and older Canadians to anyone over the age of 18.

But the move contradicts the National Advisory Committee on Immunization (NACI)'s recent recommendations that a second booster should only be given now to those at highest risk of severe COVID-19 while younger Canadians could wait until the fall.

Data shows that while a third dose offers a significant increase in protection against infection hospitalization and death — a fourth dose gives only marginal benefit against severe COVID-19 for most including short-lived protection against infection even in vulnerable groups.

""That fourth dose does add a small modest decrease to your risk of developing severe illness"" said Angela Rasmussen a virologist at the Vaccine and Infectious Disease Organization (VIDO) at the University of Saskatchewan.

""But I think that also it's limited what we can expect from it — I don't think certainly that we can expect it to stop this wave.""

BA.5 has sparked an unexpectedly timed seventh wave across much of Canada accounting for close to 40 per cent of cases and leading to a significant rise in COVID-19 hospitalizations  due to its ability to evade protection from both vaccination and previous infection.

WATCH | When is the best time to get a 4th COVID-19 vaccine?

When should you get your 4th COVID-19 vaccine? Duration 4:29 Infectious diseases specialist Dr. Zain Chagla explains who should get a second COVID-19 vaccine booster and when.

4th dose protection against infection short-lived

A recent study from Israel published in the New England Journal of Medicine (NEJM) found that while protection against infection and severe COVID-19 increased after a fourth dose in those over 60 the effectiveness of the vaccine against infection began to wane after just several weeks.

A second study from Israel published in the British Medical Journal (BMJ) found that while people aged 60 and over gained additional protection against hospitalization and death in the three weeks after a fourth shot — protection against infection ""quickly decreased.""

Health-care workers were looked at specifically in another Israeli study published in NEJM that found a fourth dose provided only a marginal difference in infection rates compared to those with a third shot and only a slight difference in severity of breakthrough symptoms.

A new Canadian study published in the BMJ analyzed the effectiveness of a fourth dose on Ontario long-term care residents. It found the shot initially improved protection against infection and severe COVID-19 but the duration of that protection ""remains unknown.""

""The science around this right now only has clearly demonstrated benefits of that fourth dose of the vaccine for the groups that (NACI) has outlined"" Dr. Fahad Razak an internist at St. Michael's Hospital in Toronto and the scientific director of Ontario's COVID-19 Science Advisory Table told The Current on July 7.

""Which is older individuals and individuals who are immunocompromised or high risk.""

Research suggests that while there are some people who do benefit from a fourth dose including long-term care residents the elderly and other vulnerable groups data showing a clear benefit to those under the age of 60 is lacking.

Dr. Zain Chagla an infectious diseases physician at St. Joseph's Healthcare Hamilton and an associate professor at McMaster University said older immunocompromised Canadians can benefit from a fourth dose — but younger groups derive ""very minimal benefit.""

""I don't think there's going to be a huge benefit here. It certainly will not change pandemic dynamics in terms of less disease. Really to get any effect of taking the edge off you'd need almost everyone getting fourth doses almost immediately at once"" he said.

""And even then look their immunity is going to wane in six to eight weeks and you're going to see that they're not really going to be protected against infection anyways and BA.4 and BA.5 will still be here in six to eight weeks.""

3rd doses uptake still lacking in Canada

While expanding fourth doses to more Canadians now could have a limited impact on the trajectory of the BA.5-driven wave in much of the country the bigger issue lies with the abysmal uptake of third doses across the country.

Less than half of Canadians have received a third dose which research suggests adds significant protection against severe COVID-19 a number that has remained stagnant for months amid the growing push to expand fourth doses.

""The biggest issue right now is the substantial number of Canadians who have not had a third dose"" said Dr. David Naylor who led the federal inquiry into Canada's national response to the 2003 SARS epidemic and now co-chairs the federal government's COVID-19 immunity task force.

""It's increasingly clear that table stakes for this vaccine are three shots and we need to stop referring to people with two doses as fully vaccinated.""

WATCH | Why 3rd and 4th COVID-19 shots are both important right now:

3rd and 4th COVID-19 shots both important right now says expert Duration 3:59 Infectious disease specialist Dr. Isaac Bogoch explains who benefits most from a fourth dose of COVID-19 but also stresses the need for many people to simply get a third shot.

But Naylor is hopeful that expanding fourth doses to more Canadians could have an impact on the spread of BA.5 across the country even if the data doesn't show a clear benefit for younger age groups yet.

""For someone younger and healthy who has three shots and has had a recent infection I can see the logic in waiting to get a fourth shot"" he said.

""There's no question the marginal yields of a fourth dose are small at an individual level for that population segment — but they are at risk of reinfection and wider coverage may help to slow spread at a population level.""

Chagla said that expanding fourth doses to younger Canadians now in contradiction to NACI's guidelines could actually do more harm than good in encouraging more people to come back for a third shot.

""There are going to be people that say 'Well I'm on dose two they're already saying I need a fourth dose what is the point of these vaccines if they didn't protect me from getting Omicron?'""

""Every one of these doses that goes out public image of what vaccines can do changes with them and we need a lot of people to come back for their third dose.""

Rasmussen from the University of Saskatchewan said her concern is that many Canadians may regard boosters as ""optional"" with limited benefit to immunity. She said messaging around third doses needs to be ""hammered home"" to increase uptake.

""That third dose does provide a significant boost in protection both against severe disease and against infection with Omicron BA.1"" she said.

""That fourth dose is maybe incremental maybe just a modest benefit but the third dose I think it's very clear. At least with BA.1 it does provide significant benefits.""

Updated vaccines on the horizon

Timing boosters to ensure robust immune protection against COVID-19 is becoming increasingly critical with the emergence of Omicron's highly contagious subvariants BA.4 and BA.5 as well as a concerning new subvariant driving a surge in India called BA.2.75 .

While Canadians who opt to get a fourth dose of the original vaccine strain now may only be protected for several weeks against infection updated bivalent vaccines that combine the original shot with protection against Omicron are also on the horizon.

Moderna's bivalent vaccine is one many are pinning their hopes on. But experts worry targeting the original Omicron strain may not be sufficient due to research showing a lack of cross protection immunity against the vastly different BA.2.12.1 BA.4 and BA.5 variants.

""The usual argument for waiting is that we may get better vaccines in the fall. However the data on bivalent vaccines are less compelling or complete than many of us had hoped"" Naylor said.

Bivalent vaccines target the spike protein of the virus. They are different from newer innovative platforms with new targets or modes of delivery like intranasal boosters or pan-coronavirus vaccines .

""It's been a mug's game to guess what the virus will do next and those who get a fourth dose in the near future will still be eligible for any new formulations starting in mid-October or thereabouts.""

These new vaccine technologies can potentially spur a more robust immune response due to the fact that they stimulate another arm of the immune system or target multiple different coronaviruses altogether.

""We don't know when those paradigm-shifting vaccines will be available but it could be a while — particularly if we wait as seems only prudent to get really good data on their effectiveness and safety"" Naylor said.

""To me that reality plus the ongoing spread of BA.5 together argues for getting on with a fourth shot even if it is more of the same with modest marginal yields.""

WATCH | Summer COVID-19 wave sparks concern:

Summer COVID-19 wave sparks concern Duration 2:02 Rising cases have prompted some provinces to declare a seventh wave of COVID-19 which is sparking concern for many health-care workers.

But Chagla said Canadians need to start thinking about the protection COVID-19 vaccines offer differently than they did before. There are going to be ""limits"" to what they can and can't do at both an individual and population level going forward he said.

""The first two doses did incredible things to the world and really changed the disease and actually did alter disease dynamics and the third dose was able to save a lot of people from severe Omicron"" he said.

""But the way this virus has evolved and the way our vaccines are … they're not going to be a long-term solution in preventing transmission and there's no guarantee with an Omicron-specific vaccine that it's going to offer anything different.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmVrYXRoaW1lcmluaS5jb20vZWNvbm9teS8xMTg5MjU4L2RlbW8tcGhhcm1hY2V1dGljYWxzLWxhdW5jaGVzLXJkLWh1Yi1pbi10aGVzc2Fsb25pa2kv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,DEMO Pharmaceuticals launches R&D hub in Thessaloniki,"DEMO Pharmaceuticals has launched a new research and development center one of the largest in Greece in the northern port city of Thessaloniki.

Sittenfeld corruption case: Federal appeals court hears arguments Thursday,"CINCINNATI (WXIX) - Attorneys for former Cincinnati City Council member P.G. Sittenfeld returned to a federal courtroom Thursday to try to overturn his convictions for bribery and attempted extortion.

A three-judge panel with the 6th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals heard arguments from his attorneys and then federal prosecutors.

No decision is expected anytime soon.

Sittenfeld 39 of East Walnut Hills is one of three former Cincinnati council members arrested in 2020 and convicted on federal public corruption charges in a series of cases federal authorities launched in 2017.

At the time of his arrest Sittenfeld was the front-runner in the mayor’s race and repeatedly received the most votes in city council elections.

Sittenfeld rejected a plea deal before his trial that would have limited his punishment if found guilty from probation only to two years or less in prison court records show.

The jury did find him not guilty on four of the six total charges. Those were two counts of honest services wire fraud and one count each of bribery and extortion.

Last year U.S. District Court Judge Douglas Cole rejected Sittenfeld’s request to throw out his convictions and get a new trial.

Sittenfeld failed to present “any persuasive arguments” supporting either motion the judge wrote in his 26-page order.

Judge Cole sentenced Sittenfeld to 16 months in prison and one year of supervised release once he’s out.

In early January Sittenfeld reported to a prison in northeastern Kentucky. Federal Correction Institution of Ashland is a minimum-security prison about 2.5 hours away from Cincinnati.

It was listed as one of America’s “10 Cushiest Prisons” by Forbes magazine.

Federal prosecutors say Sittenfeld promised to support perform “official acts” and “deliver the votes” to help the development of a property with sports betting at 435 Elm Street across from the Duke Energy Convention Center in downtown Cincinnati in exchange for $20000 in donations to his political action fund (PAC) federal court records show.

His indictment alleged he solicited the money in exchange for his support to develop the Elm Street property which former Cincinnati Bengals player turned developer Chinedum Ndukwe envisioned as a hotel and office complex with apartments and a restaurant.

“This was not a single event one-off deal or momentary lapse in judgment” federal prosecutors wrote in his sentencing memo.

“Sittenfeld’s actions were part of a broader strategy to use his position of power within local government and his prospects for higher office to extract financial contributions out of individuals who regularly conducted city business. In doing so Sittenfeld made clear that his support for their city business was tied directly to their contributions to him. This is not faithful public service or even “politics as usual”—this is corruption.”

Sittenfeld’s federal trial attorneys however have repeatedly said that his indictment actually proved he did not commit a “quid pro quo.”

He has always been pro-development they noted contending his actions (raising money for future campaigns) are all perfectly legal and this is typical business conducted by politicians.

Sittenfeld’s lead appellate attorneys are Yaakov Roth and James Burnham.

Burnham is a Washington D.C. attorney considered an expert in federal corruption law because he successfully represented former Virginia Governor Robert F. McDonnell in McDonnell v. United States.

That case was a major challenge to the scope of the Federal corruption laws because the 2016 ruling narrowed the legal definition of public corruption and made it harder for prosecutors to prove that a political official engaged in bribery.

In 2017 then-President Donald Trump appointed Burnham as Special Assistant to the President and Senior Associate Counsel to the President.

Now in Sittenfeld’s appeal Burnham and Roth argue that federal prosecutors didn’t show clear and precise proof of corruption the “quid pro quo.”

If Sittenfeld’s convictions are allowed to stand it would bring “a First Amendment Ice Age” where every politician could face prosecution for fundraising according to his appeal.

“The government engineered a sting to see if (Sittenfeld) would accept a campaign donation in exchange for supporting a local development project. To maximize the sting’s chances of success the FBI approached Sittenfeld through one of his longtime existing donors in connection with a project Sittenfeld had already agreed to support” his appeal states.

“Yet despite the choreography Sittenfeld never bit. Over the course of a year-long prosecutorial Truman Show Sittenfeld rejected the only express quid pro quo his friend offered cautioned him on the legal limits around donations turned away contributions that did not comport with obscure campaign-finance rules and even invited two undercover agents to a dinner party with the U.S. Attorney.”

Several amicus briefs also have been filed in support of Sittenfeld’s appeal

Among them are ones from former U.S. Attorney Generals William Barr and John Ashcroft and the top federal prosecutor for the same government office who prosecuted Sittenfeld Carter Stewart. He was the U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of Ohio from 2009 to 2016.

Sittenfeld’s case they wrote “has two highly unusual features that render it an extreme outlier among campaign-finance bribery prosecutions. First Mr. Sittenfeld’s conduct did not involve the typical signs of wrongdoing that prosecutors expect to see when a public official is engaged in a corrupt enterprise…

“Second the case resulted from a two-year investigation that involved a sting operation specifically intended to uncover evidence of misconduct…The result was a conviction for conduct that was not criminal.”

This is a big recruiting win for the Runnin' Utes as they add a very promising young talent to the mix.

Little announced his commitment via Twitter:

As a 6-foot-4 185 pound guard Little shows the ability to do a bit of everything. He can be the primary ball handler he has a strong handle to go along with good feel for scoring opportunities for himself or others. He can score inside and out and can play off the ball as well. There are a lot of natural playmaking qualities that Little possesses and he's showcased good defensive ones as well. Despite the fact that he saw inconsistent playing time this past season he is still regarded as a four-star transfer prospect.

Utah brought Little in for an official visit this past weekend and were able to make a very good impression. Little is a native of Finland which gives the program valuable relationships in the form of Hanno Mottola Mikael Jantunen and even Lauri Markennan all of whom are connected through the Finland national team.

Little entered the portal after his first and only season with Baylor. The Bears had quite the logjam in the backcourt which led to him looking for a better opportunity elsewhere. Little still showcased his productive potential in games where he got extended playing time.

He is a former top 50 overall prospect and top 10 point guard in the 2023 recruiting class. He committed to Baylor over Indiana and Villanova while also having significant interest from other power programs in college basketball as well. Little earned a 94 four-star rating and No. 9 ranking in 247Sports' 2023 recruiting class.

Little did not play his ""senior year"" of high school at Sunrise Christian Academy but played for the Helsinki Basketball Academy (HBA) in Finland. HBA is a part of the Finland 1st Division basketball league and is essentially a high school program competing against professional players in Finland. Little averaged 21.6 points 9.0 rebounds and 5.8 assists in 20 games in this league during the 2021-22 season.

He joins Utah with three seasons of eligibility and a redshirt remaining. He is the fourth transfer addition and joins Keanu Dawes Mason Madsen and Zach Keller in Utah's transfer portal class. Utah now has five open spots remaining on the roster.

McConnell continues surprising for Pacers,"Former Arizona Wildcats point guard T.J. McConnell is approaching a decade in the NBA an unlikely journey that has even seen McConnell become a playoff X-Factor for his Indiana Pacers. He was a huge part of Indiana nearly pulling off the upset in the first round versus the New York Knicks in a 121-117 Game 1 loss.

McConnell had 18 points three assists and three steals on 9-of-16 shooting in 22 minutes.

McConnell went undrafted in 2015 not thought of as much of a NBA prospect. He was not a shooter at the time and hasn’t developed into one since. He’s generously listed at 6-foot-1 lacks explosive movement and didn’t score too much as a Wildcat either.

What McConnell can do however is read the floor at an expert level and use his quickness from there to shift it mostly to set up his teammates. This got him a shot at making the Philadelphia 76ers roster which he did and he has been a near-constant as a rotation player since.

This season McConnell’s ninth in the league has really seen him break out as a bucket-getter. Yes you read that correctly. From Feb. 6 on McConnell off the bench averaged 13.3 points per game while shooting 58.2% from the field. Again that’s while taking less than one 3-pointer a game and for the season he knocked down 56.8% of his 2s.

McConnell’s quite honestly weird midrange game at Arizona consisting of 12-foot fallaways and other odd touch shots at the rim is now something he’s able to activate more frequently with confidence and a high level of understanding for where the real estate will be. On a spaced-out roster built around floor general Tyrese Haliburton McConnell has the room to scoot around and take his goofy shots.

He’s even got a little bit of shake to his handle despite dribbling like someone from a half-century ago.

T.J. McConnell slices through the defense and gets to the hoop for two 💨 pic.twitter.com/DzNx7AAHj5 — Indiana Pacers (@Pacers) May 7 2024

Defenses just aren’t used to defending someone like him. Looking at guards around his size McConnell was the first to put up at least 10 points a game with under one 3PA/G since Derrick Rose in 2016-17 and Tony Parker in 2015-16 per Stathead. New York was understandably trying to get away with either Jalen Brunson or Miles McBride defending McConnell without using its best perimeter options on him before changing that late.

One of McConnell’s signature attributes is his pace of play which will help the Pacers tremendously against the Knicks. McConnell always wants to get the ball up quickly and is rarely going to waste dribbles looking to at least threaten for the paint whenever possible like one of his all-time favorites Steve Nash. Defensively he will pick guys up fullcourt to do some pest work and moves like a guy who never runs out of energy.

The Knicks play a short rotation and commonly put starters in the low-to-mid 40s for minutes and Indiana was deliberately speeding the game up on both ends to play the long game of wearing New York down. McConnell will be a key part of that effort with his importance in a second-round series still being hard to believe.

Getting a star athlete on a video call for a reasonable fee was an easy sell to fans but not to the athletes—the company had so many athlete no-shows for calls that the effort was scuttled by constant refunds.

He has higher hopes for his second athlete venture: Finlete which keeps the fan meet-and-greet of the first effort but adds what should be a stronger motivator: more money.

“Finlete is a platform that allows fans to support for now minor league baseball players” Connolly said in a phone call. “And with the current amount of money that these athletes make in the minor leagues there’s a really interesting potential return that people participating in Finlete can see.”

Finlete is a new entry in the increasingly popular financial play of athlete investing in which funds swap an upfront payment to an aspiring pro in exchange for a fixed percentage cut of future sports income. Comcast owns 7% of Finlete’s business while famed venture capitalist Tim Draper has a $50000 seed investment in the endeavor.

For Finlete Connolly sees a lot of potential in farm team ballplayers partly because minor league baseball pays most players badly. Finlete’s first athlete Texas Rangers middle infield prospect Echedry Vargas signed with the club out of the Dominican Republic in 2022 for a $10000 bonus–the minimum at the time according to Connolly. Right now Vargas plays in A-ball where salaries max out at $27300. “He’s like a minimum wage guy … but outperforming players that signed for millions of dollars” the executive said.

Finlete is taking a crowd-funding approach selling shares in a Securities & Exchange Commission-registered offering to retail investors. Investors can buy shares in Vargas for $8 (with a 12-share minimum) with the player receiving a $500000 advance. In exchange investors get a claim of 10% of his baseball earnings for the next 25 years if he makes The Show or even if he ends up off-Broadway so to speak in the top pro leagues of Japan Korea and Taiwan according to the player agreement disclosed as part of the offering. If he fails to make the majors stateside or in Asia Vargas won’t owe anything. The offering is still raising money and has about $26000 in commitments according to the Finlete website.

The presence of smart money suggests there’s increasing traction with the idea of swapping a lump sum of cash now for a cut of athlete income later on. The current wave of start-ups was sparked by the initial success of Big League Advance a private fund that is best known for striking a deal with the now-superstar Fernando Tatis Jr. when he was a minor leaguer. Finlete joins the golf pro-focused Commonwealth Sports NFL player-backing Vestible and international soccer player investing Nordensa—which isn’t available to American investors—as more recent entrants to the budding scene.

Conscious of the other competitors in the space the company sees the carryover of the original Cameo-like idea as a key to drawing in fan investors; part of the pitch to athletes too is to build a cadre of supporters early. In Vargas’ case he commits to things such as signing 100 autographs annually and holding meet-and-greets with fans at games as perks to people buying a minimum number of shares and at least two 30-minute video-chat appearance annually under the deal.

“It’s like a PG version of OnlyFans” Connolly said. “You’re involved with the athlete on an intimate level. You get to be a part of the athlete’s journey you get to hear what they’re struggling with and what they’re working on.”

Such a relationship is also potentially lucrative for Finlete. If the current share offering in Vargas’ future income sells its maximum proposed level of $800000 (100000 shares) $300000 goes to cover the offering costs and reimbursements to Finlete. It’s not quite a fair comparison because certain costs aren’t proportional but a typical stock IPO sees about 5% of proceeds directed to expenses and commissions. Finlete also gets the right of first refusal to buy any future baseball-related income Vargas might consider selling.

“We want to do $100 million in revenue in two years. We want to create a trading platform that allows fans to buy and sell their positions … and have over 100 athletes on our platform from Nascar drivers to horse racing jockeys to baseball players and UFC fighters” Connolly said.

That’s a lot of hope riding on the shoulders of Vargas who is currently batting .227 for the Down East Wood Ducks of the Carolina League."

Your perception about who wins depends on the winner because he/she is the one writing the battle story. But no matter who wins there is one thing in common. The winner is always portrayed as good no matter how evil he/she was. This is what modern-day advertising is all about. You can sell dog shit piled up on cat shit by claiming that its packing has been done by the angel of heaven. The narrative creates an aura of goodwill for the targeted population. This is where Marlboro Cigarettes are uniquely placed.

Took nearly 100 years to catch momentum

Marlboro currently the major cigarette brand in the United States is not a new entrant in the market. The cigarette brand owned and manufactured by Philip Morris USA in America and Philip Morris International outside the USA has more than 175 years old history. Moreover contrary to popular opinion it did not originate in the USA. It originated in the capital city of their former master Britain. In 1846 renowned tobacconist Phillip Morris decided to sell tobacco and rolled cigarettes through a shop on Bond Street London. 27 years later Phillips died of cancer but his business did not die. It was taken over by his widow Margaret and brother Leopold. They opened a factory on Great Marlborough Street in the same city. Later various forms of Marlborough went on to dominate the brand.

The first indication of the existence of a brand named Marlborough dates back to 1885. Phillip Morris & Co. had decided to jump on the ships of initial years of feminism. The product was being advertised as ladies’ favourite cigarette. But it was still a long way to go for the company. Due to various workplaces requiring more muscular strength women did not have much earning capability. In places where they were allowed systematic discrimination played a key role in keeping them out of the fold. As a result women customers of the brand or any cigarette brand were not available in large numbers.

Introduction to American consumers

But Phillips and Co. was satisfied with slow and steady growth. In 1902 the company opened its New York subsidiary. However initially it did not have much information about the demography of consumers that is why it took 6 years for the mark “Marlboro” to be registered.

Company spent another 15 years deliberating on strategies to launch “Marlboro” in the country. Its job was made easier by the mass number of women joining the workforce in the wake of men going to military duty during World War I. The empowerment was so vast that women were now engaged in farming a field traditionally believed to be men’s forte. In the United States “The National Women’s Trade Union League” represented and provided job security to lakhs of women. Even after the World War women refused to leave the workforce and by extension financial independence.

The product could not draw the attention of American women

With an eye on putting a dent in the increasing spending capacity of women “Marlboro” brand was finally launched in the US market in 1924. Taking the advantage of its “London originating status” Philip Morris & Co. advertised it as “America’s luxury cigarette”. Additionally it used to be only available at expensive hotels and resorts. Later the company explicitly started to sell it as a women’s cigarette in America as well. Its campaign line kept propagating the women as a weak notion. To pull more common women towards it the slogan used was “Mild As May ”. The message conveyed to the women was simple “Your body is not as strong as men so we are caring for you with a special mild version of cigarette”.

In many ways the subliminal message was patronising and possible that is why in spite of a skyrocketing increase in women’s workforce participation the sales figures did not hit expected numbers. Even relatively affluent white women whose participation rate had increased by 50 per cent between 1890-1940 refused to buy it. The perception of Marlboro being a luxury item also could not fetch numbers. The situation was so bad that just before the start of World War II the product was withdrawn from the market. Though it was later relaunched and after the war the brand did regain some momentum.

Innovation in the wake of scientific onslaught

In spite of news headlines now dominated by anti-tobacco scientific reports Marlboro registered steady growth by the end of 1960s. On an annual basis its sales growth remained steady in the range of 1-10 per cent. However in the first month of January 1964 something astounding and unexpected happened. Surgeon General of the United States gave official recognition to prevailing scientific consensus that Cigarettes cause Cancer. This was an existential crisis for these companies including Marlboro.

While companies like Camel Lucky Strike and Chesterfield caved in Marlboro’s response was on more unexpected lines than the announcement itself. It started a new marketing campaign which later went on to be followed by various other companies. Philip Morris started a new type of advertisement called lifestyle advertising. Through these advertisements Philip Morris focused more on situations surrounding the consumption of product rather than product itself. It did not explicitly tell them how good their product was by citing different sources instead that Philip Morris attached people’s emotions with the product.

Masculinity carried it through

Marlboro’s advertisements were now targeting men as a consumer. The men who had lost touch with their masculine side the men who did not know what masculinity is and finally the gullible men who could be fooled. Marlboro cigarettes were showcased as being smoked by manly men strong in body mind and soul. The meek men designed to cater to the spoken needs of the women were pitched to be replaced by sea captains weightlifters war correspondents construction workers among others. Finally Leo Burnett the Chicago advertiser settled on using Cowboy as “Marlboro man”.

The advertising turned out to be a game changer. Earlier men used to refuse to have Marlboro due to its women-centric market. Marlboro’s cigarettes were considered safer due to them being filtered. The idea of being on the safe side never goes with the concept of masculinity. That is why Phillip Morris initially decided to target only those men who were concerned about Cigarettes causing lung cancer. Additionally Marlboro was also producing milder more aromatic sweeter and less harsh cigarettes by adding ammonia to the tobacco.

Marlboro Man did the trick

The softness in product and hardness in advertising did the magic for Phillip Morris. By telling the public that Marlboro is consumed by heroic men of society as well Phillip Morris eliminated the fear of demasculinization in common men. The sales skyrocketed and the company which held only 1 per cent of the global cigarette market at the beginning of 1964 went on to become 4th largest cigarette brand by the end of year.

For next year it continued its extraordinary compound annual growth rate. In 1972 Marlboro occupied 12.7 percent of the US market and with this achievement along with its foreign markets it went on to become the best-selling tobacco brand in the world a position which it has been reluctant to leave. Even when cigarette advertisements were permanently banned from Television in the 1970s it kept getting virtually free advertising due to the cult of cowboy man. Movies like Robert Altman’s The Long Goodbye (1973) Harley Davidson and the Marlboro Man (1991) Fargo (1996) The Lost World: Jurassic Park (1997) Thank You for Smoking (2005) were some of the significant movies which portrayed Marlboro man. Songs and photographs also played a key role in promotion of Marlboro man and henceforth Marlboro itself.

Stick to the basics: Lessons from Marlboro

It is not that Marlboro relied on secondary sources for its advertising after the Television ban. After 1972 it followed the trajectory of Energy drinks and went on to partner with extreme sports to advertise itself. The status of numero uno tobacco company in the world provided it with the leeway to sponsor Formula One team BRM. In the next two years it sponsored the Frank Williams Racing Cars team whose cars were registered as Iso-Marlboro. In 1974 Marlboro sided with McLaren and the partnership went on to become the longest sponsorship deal between a team and its title sponsor in F1 history. The deal lasted for 23 seasons. After the deal with McLaren ended Marlboro started sponsoring the Ferrari. The deal continued in different forms by the end of 2021.

Besides F1 Marlboro has also been associated with G2 Superbike World Championship Grand Prix motorcycle racing CART/IndyCar World Rally Championship Australian touring car racing IMSA SportsCar among others. Almost every sponsorship was aimed towards pushing more and more men to buy Marlboro cigarettes. On the back of these advertisements it has been expanding its footprints all around the world. After its introduction to 1.4 billion people in India the company’s market value has only increased. In 2021 its global market value was $159.2 billion.

At the same time it has been subject to various controversies as well. But the company focused on its core strength and in spite of so many apparent flaws in the segment it operates it is only increasing day-by-day.

ST CHARLES Mo. — A person accused of armed robbery was shot and killed by a customer of a gas station in St. Charles early Saturday morning.

A news release sent out by the St. Charles Police Department Saturday morning detailed the incident citing a "" violent crime spree"" throughout St. Charles led by the suspect a 26-year-old man from St. Louis City.

The suspect was identified by St. Charles police Sunday as Lance Bush.

Timeline of events

According to the release at 2:58 a.m. an armed robbery occurred at the Mobil On The Run gas station located at 1401 South Fifth Street in St. Charles. Bush allegedly entered the station armed with a knife and threatened the store clerk with the knife. Police said Bush made the clerk open the cash register stole the money in the register and pushed the clerk to the ground.

Bush then reportedly dragged the clerk to the back of the store asking her to show him the safe the release outlined. The clerk was unable to open the safe and was reportedly dragged back to the front counter. The clerk according to the release opened a second cash register ""to stop the assault on her.""

Bush stole the money from the second register and fled the store in a black SUV. The clerk was treated for non-life threatening lacerations left from the knife and was taken to a hospital for treatment St. Charles police said.

When St. Charles police were on the way to the scene of the armed robbery they received a call at 3:14 a.m. for an alarm at the Philips 66 located at 524 First Capitol Drive. Officers found broken glass ""indicating a burglary had just taken place"" said the release.

As the second incident was being investigated a 3:20 a.m. report of another armed robbery and shots fired at the QuikTrip located at 2260 First Capitol Drive was called in.

At the QuikTrip

According to the release when officers arrived at the QuikTrip they found Bush who had been shot by a customer armed with a gun who police say witnessed the armed robbery. Bush was taken to a hospital and pronounced dead.

The customer a 26-year-old man also from St. Louis told police after the events that he had stopped at the QuikTrip and was walking back to his car parked in front of the building when a black SUV pulled into the lot ""abruptly"" according to the release.

St. Charles police said in the release the customer witnessed Bush leave the SUV with a backpack and enter the QuikTrip where he threatened a clerk with a knife at her throat.

The customer then grabbed his handgun entered the QuikTrip and confronted Bush according to the release.

The release said the suspect Bush allegedly grabbed his backpack and said to the customer ""I have something for you"" and approached the customer from behind the front counter. The customer the shot at Bush ""several times"" until the he fell on the floor. Both the customer and the clerk then called 911. Neither person was injured.

The suspect's black SUV was later found to have been stolen Friday from Maryland Heights. Police said items stolen from the Phillips 66 gas station were found in the vehicle.

St. Charles police believe Bush is tied to all three gas station incidents. According to police Bush was homeless at the time of the robberies.

(RNS/PCUSA/Danny Bolin)

A prominent mainline Christian denomination plans to divest from five oil companies it believes are not doing enough to address climate change. The vote to divest from Chevron Exxon Mobil Marathon Petroleum Phillips 66 and Valero Energy comes after years of debate in the Presbyterian Church (U.S.A.). On July 6 commissioners at the PCUSA's general assembly voted 340-41 to add those companies to the denomination's divestment list. They join 85 other companies on the list — most with ties to the military or the weapons industry. The move ""gives teeth to selective divestment"" said Aaron Ochart vice moderator of the Environmental Justice Committee who introduced the divestment recommendation to the general assembly which voted online. Since the 1980s Presbyterians have called for a move away from fossil fuels including oil. More recently they have debated whether to divest or to use their investments to pressure companies to change their ways. In 2016 and 2018 votes to divest failed in favor of more engagement. Rob Fohr director of faith-based investing and corporate engagement for the PCUSA said the church's ""Mission Responsibility Through Investment"" committee had hoped to see more change at the five oil companies. But their efforts at engagement failed to make progress he said.

""Divestment is never the goal"" he said in an email. ""Corporate change is the goal. MRTI determined after engagement with these five companies that continued engagement is not likely to yield meaningful change. Meanwhile the climate crisis is only increasing in urgency. We hope this divestment will be received as a clear signal that meaningful change is needed."" The next step in the process will be for the MRTI committee to compile a new version of the divestment list. That list will then be sent to the denomination's pension board and the Presbyterian Foundation for approval. Both groups have already said they will approve the new list said Fohr. During the discussion of the divestment recommendation Tom Taylor president of the Presbyterian Foundation was asked about the financial impact of divesting. He said the impact was ""impossible to know"" and would depend on future market conditions. He also said the foundation would act quickly to divest. ""As soon as possible we will get out of it"" he said. Commissioners who are made up of local Presbyterian church leaders also approved a recommendation to add seven other companies including three airlines for more direct engagement. Those companies are found on a list compiled by the environmental group Climate Action 100 according to the denomination's Environmental Justice Committee. Those commissioners also approved a proposal known as an overture to create a ""Presbyterian Tree Fund"" to purchase carbon offsets for work-related air travel by church staff as well as one titled ""Investing in a Green Future."" Last week a group of three dozen faith groups from seven countries announced they have divested from fossil fuels. The groups include five Church of England dioceses two Catholic dioceses in the United Kingdom 11 Catholic religious orders two Jesuit universities in the United States and the United Methodist Church in Ireland. Darren Dochuk author of ""Anointed With Oil"" a history of religion and the oil industry in the United States said faith groups in the past saw oil and other fossil fuels as a blessing. Some of the early oil tycoons such as the Pew family and Lyman Stewart who helped fund the fundamentalist movement were Presbyterians and many church institutions in the United States were funded by oil money. Divesting from fossil fuels Dochuk said is complicated both for denominations and for local congregations especially those in areas where the local economy depends on the fossil fuel industry.

""Today's generation probably doesn't realize that this is a relationship generations in the making"" he said. ""So to all of a sudden unravel it or disassemble it is complicated."" Fletcher Harper an Episcopal priest and executive director of GreenFaith an environmental group said the increasing threat of climate change makes divestment from fossil fuels a crucial priority for churches. In the past he said there were worries that doing so would cost churches money. That's no longer the case he said. ""The research has shown you can get out of oil and gas and perform as well as the market"" he said. Along with divesting he said faith groups can work with other activists to put pressure on financial companies to get out of investing in fossil fuels. That's the bigger goal he said.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMidmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmF6ZmFtaWx5LmNvbS8yMDIyLzA3LzE2L2FybWVkLXJvYmJlci1zaG90LWtpbGxlZC1ieS1jdXN0b21lci1jb252ZW5pZW5jZS1zdG9yZS1wb2xpY2Utc2F5Lz9vdXRwdXRUeXBlPWFwcHPSAXVodHRwczovL3d3dy5hemZhbWlseS5jb20vMjAyMi8wNy8xNi9hcm1lZC1yb2JiZXItc2hvdC1raWxsZWQtYnktY3VzdG9tZXItY29udmVuaWVuY2Utc3RvcmUtcG9saWNlLXNheS8_b3V0cHV0VHlwZT1hbXA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Armed robber shot killed by customer at convenience store police say,"ST. CHARLES Mo. (KMOV/Gray News) - Police in Missouri are investigating a violent crime spree in St. Charles that ended with an armed robber being shot and killed.

The St. Charles Police Department reports the crime spree started during the early morning hours on Saturday at a convenience store where a 26-year-old went into the business with a knife and told the clerk he was robbing her.

Police said the man held the knife to the clerk’s throat while she opened the register. He then pushed the clerk to the floor and stole money from the register. He dragged her toward the back of the store asking the location of the safe.

According to authorities the clerk did not have access to the safe so the thief forced the worker to open a second register before stealing that cash and leaving the scene.

Officials said first responders took the clerk to a hospital for lacerations on her left wrist right hand and neck.

Police said they were on their way to that scene when reports of another armed robbery came in at a Phillips 66 gas station. Officers said they found broken glass that looked like a burglary had occurred.

St. Charles police said a third burglary call then came in regarding an armed robbery at a QuikTrip convenience store where shots had been fired.

According to police arriving officers found the 26-year-old suspect shot by a customer during that attempted robbery. First responders took the suspected thief to the hospital where he later died.

Authorities said they interviewed the customer a 26-year-old man who told police he stopped at the gas station to use the restroom and buy something. However he was walking back to his car from the store when he saw a black SUV drive quickly into the parking lot.

The customer said he saw a man carrying a backpack while running into the store and threatening the clerk with a knife according to police.

Officials said the 26-year-old customer grabbed his gun and went back into the store. He then confronted the thief who grabbed for his backpack.

According to authorities the suspect reportedly told the customer “I have something for you” and came around the counter when he was shot and killed by the customer.

Investigators said the customer and the clerk were both uninjured in the incident and the suspect’s car came back as stolen in an armed robbery on Friday with stolen items also found in the vehicle.

St. Charles police did not immediately release the suspect’s identity but urged anyone with further information on the incidents to contact them at 636-949-3300.

The neighborhood’s 53000 residents mostly Latino share their home with 400 industrial sites and five oil refineries. Fumes from the refineries’ leaks and flares pollute the air and cause leukemia and other forms of cancer as well as heart disease asthma and other physical and mental health problems.

To make matters worse Wilmington lies just north of the Port of Los Angeles the busiest container port in the United States and the Port of Long Beach. Together the ships trucks and cargo cranes make these twin ports the largest single source of pollution in Southern California.

This slow environmental violence is made still worse by climate change and resource scarcity breeds illness and early death and drives interpersonal violence a trio of panelists told those gathered as part of a 2022 National Fellowship hosted this past week by USC Annenberg’s Center for Health Journalism.

Adam Mahoney a reporter who covers the environment and climate for Capital B grew up in Wilmington. His childhood home was just a mile from Phillips 66 which emitted the highest volume of toxic gas of the five Wilmington refineries. He grew up seeing firsthand the impacts a long history of environmental injustice and divestment had on his community.

In a six-month series supported by CHJ’s 2021 Data Fellowship Mahoney looked at the connection between Wilmington’s status as “an industrial dumping ground” and the poor health and violence afflicting the community.

Through an intensive data analysis Mahoney found that Wilmington experienced a higher-than-expected death toll during the first two years of the pandemic.

There were 236 “excess deaths” beyond what officials would have expected in a typical non-pandemic year. When Mahoney adjusted for population differences he found that Wilmington experienced 1.5 times more excess deaths than the California average and almost two times as many as neighboring San Pedro and the two other very affluent cities that border Wilmington — Rancho Palos Verdes and Palos Verdes Estates — where pollution rates are much lower.

His findings which were co-published by The Guardian Grist and High Country News were even more alarming given that Wilmington has the fourth-youngest population among 270 neighborhoods in Los Angeles County Mahoney told fellow journalists last week. Further investigation revealed that pollution exacerbated illness was largely to blame for the excess death in Wilmington not COVID-19.

Mahoney’s analysis of death data also brought to light the city’s connection between air pollutants — which can disrupt the endocrine system cognition and mental health — and interpersonal violence.

He found that nearly 200 people had been fatally shot 10 of them by police since the year 2000. “That amounts to nearly 2.5 times as many fatal shootings as the Los Angeles County per capita average and four times as many as those experienced in the cities that border Wilmington — San Pedro Rancho Palos Verdes and Palos Verdes Estates — over the same time period” Mahoney wrote.

Mahoney’s reporting explored the academic theory of “cues to care” which states that “if a community does not have markers to show they should care about the physical environment around them they aren’t going to care and it’s going to impact their relationships with each other.”

The reporter also found that six months after one local organizer built a community garden in a neighborhood hit hard by gun violence the same neighborhood has “seen a difference in how people interact with the physical environment around the garden and one another.” Before people dumped trash and sprayed graffiti; now there is more intention and care paid to the landscape.

Through door-knocking and postcards Mahoney contacted 2200 residents to ask them about what it’s like to live in Wilmington amid the slow environmental crisis unfolding around them. He asked them to fill out a 45-question survey.

A third of the 75 households that participated reported cancer compared with one in 10 U.S. households. Often multiple generations of the families Mahoney interviewed had cancer. More than 50% of respondents reported a member of the household had asthma three times the national average. Similarly depression and anxiety far outpaced the national averages.

Residents told Mahoney they couldn’t risk opening their windows on hot days despite having no air conditioning.

Alicia Rivera a community organizer with the environmental justice group Communities for a Better Environment Wilmington told fellows that community members report feeling anxiety and “are in bad humor” when it’s hot. They hear the clicks of the oil rigs going up and down even when they go to bed she added.

Rivera is using Mahoney’s survey results to challenge the official narrative and to push for regulation from the South Coast Air Quality Management District. Meanwhile oil refining operations keep expanding. That’s why projects like Mahoney’s are so important she said.

When people say that California is very environmentally friendly they’re repeating a falsehood said Julie Sze professor of American Studies at the University of California Davis and author of three books including “Environmental Justice in a Moment of Danger” published in 2020.

There is “a legacy of oil violence policing and pollution that saturates places throughout the state” Sze said.

It’s important to recognize and name climate injustice as violence she said. It is decades of the “slow violence” of pollution born of systemic racism that leads to the “fast violence” of shootings and assaults.

Sze gave the example of Freddie Gray the 25-year-old Baltimore man brutally restrained by police while he cried “I can’t breathe.” Gray ultimately sustained further fatal injuries when he was transported handcuffed and without a seatbelt in the back of a careening police van. Long before the fast violence of his deadly encounter with police in 2015 Gray was slowly poisoned by exposure to lead in his childhood home.

“Slow violence” a term popularized by Rob Nixon a Princeton University English professor generally goes unseen by those not affected.

That’s why it’s critical for reporters writing about injustice to talk with experts who are living and working in the impacted communities said Sze. Journalists can start by asking she said “Who is most vulnerable but least responsible?”

One might say it’s not an exact apples-to-apples comparison.

However a number of sales of similar apartments at a downtown Vancouver condo highrise may tell a story.

And that’s one of a real-estate market that has started to cool after the Bank of Canada started to increase interest rates.

In detail these are condo units at The Pinnacle a 36-storey highrise at 939 Homer Street in Yaletown.

Their numbers all end in “02” meaning they are stacked on top of each other face northwest have roughly the same layout and measurement and feature two bedrooms and one bath.

Let’s take four units that sold before the Bank of Canada made the first interest rate hike in 2022.

In the fall of 2021 unit 1202 sold for $745000; unit 2802 $765000; and unit 1802 $755000.

And then on January 13 2022 unit 2902 sold for $815000.

Less than three months later the Bank of Canada increased its interest-setting rate from the pandemic-era low of 0.25 percent to 0.5 percent on March 2.

The central bank followed this up with 0.5 percent increase on April 13.

[The bank increased rates two more times in June and July and its key rate now stands at 2.5 percent.]

Two weeks later unit 3302 at The Pinnacle listed on April 27 for $799000.

The two-bedroom Vancouver real estate sold six days later on May 3 for $630000.

Compared to the four other previous sales one might say the deal for unit 3302 is an outlier.

Vancouver realtor David Hutchinson is familiar with units at The Pinnacle with numbers ending in ""02"".

That’s because he was the listing agent for an upper ""02"" unit which sold on January 23 2022 for $815000.

The sold price for Hutchinson’s listing was over the property’s 2022 assessment of $766000.

“My client wanted to do a full renovation and he was living there so I advised a smaller job so we could list the property quicker” Hutchinson recalled to the Straight.

The Sutton Group-West Coast Realty explained why.

“I didn't want to wait that current hot market out too long and I didn't want an overly-renovated unit at a higher price because that narrows the buyer pool and the property spends a longer time on the market” he said.

The seller followed the realtor’s advice.

Hutchinson said: “I thought he did a good quality well-timed renovation. If he did not sell at this time it definitely would've taken longer to sell and that could have lead to him having to settle for lower price.”

As for the seemingly outlier of a sale for unit 3302 at $630000 Hutchinson suggested that it may be a “kind of a narrow indication of the recent fluctuation in prices due to the sudden changes in the market”.

These changes are primarily elevated interest rates and what the Vancouver realtor referred to as some “reverse FOMO”.

[FOMO means “fear of missing out”.]

However Hutchinson qualified that although unit 3302 sold at a lower price compared to previous deals there may be other and non-market reasons involved.

“It could be a special situation with the seller like a family situation” Hutchinson said.

“In any case a sale like this affects the market numbers and coincidentally I now have clients that were looking for one-bedroom-plus-den condos now looking for two-bed condos and they seem to be happy with the new inventory that is coming on the market” he added.

Hutchinson may be right in qualifying his statement.

On May 16 another unit with a number ending in “02” listed for $799900 which was slightly above the previous listing price for unit 3302.

Unit 2702 sold six days later on May 22 above its asking price when a buyer snapped it up for $825000.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiX2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWFkdm9jYXRlLmNvbS5hdS9zdG9yeS83ODIzNzg1L2JhY2stb24tdG9wLW1jc3dleW4tcmVhY2hlcy1waW5uYWNsZS1vZi1hdGhsZXRpY3Mv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,King Island's Stewart McSweyn 'flying under radar' ahead of first world champs final,Running at just his fourth meet for the summer the King Islander showed off his skills by leading the pack for the majority of the race however backed off to finish fifth in a 3:35.07.,,,,,,,,,

This story was originally published by the Ohio Department of Natural Resources.

XENIA Ohio — Ohio Governor Mike DeWine and Ohio Department of Natural Resources (ODNR) Director Mary Mertz recently broke ground on Ohio’s 76th state park.

Great Council State Park just north of Xenia will be a connection to Ohio’s Native American and pioneer past.

The area was once home to Oldtown one of the largest-known Shawnee settlements in Ohio. More than 1000 people called Oldtown home from approximately 1777 to 1780. Their stories directly intersect with that of historic settlers like Daniel Boone who was held captive in Oldtown for a period of time.

“This is an exciting step toward preserving an important piece of Ohio’s history” DeWine said. “This project gives us the unique opportunity to connect future generations with the past while protecting the legacy of the Shawnee and inviting them to share their story.”

Great Council State Park will feature a 12000-square-foot interpretive center with an architectural design based on the traditional council house form that was historically used by the Shawnee tribes.

Inside visitors will find three floors of exhibits a theater area a living stream and a gallery. All these displays will honor the Shawnee tribes of the past and allow present-day members to share their stories and legacy.

“This new center will be an educational tool that can take visitors into the past and inspire an appreciation for another time” Mertz said. “We hope to see families school groups scouts and all people use this space to learn more about the tribes who used to call this part of Ohio home.”

ODNR is working with the three federally-recognized Shawnee Tribes to develop the property. The facility is expected to open in 2023.",,,,,,,,,,,,

Bill Demchak -- Chairman President and Chief Executive Officer

Thanks Bryan and good morning everybody. As you've seen we had a strong second quarter highlighted by 9% revenue growth and solid positive operating leverage resulting in PPNR growth of 23%. We maintained strong credit quality. And fees rebounded from the first quarter driven primarily by capital markets activity including Harris Williams and continued growth in card and cash management.

The strong loan growth and rising rates helped us to increase both net interest income and net interest margin meaningfully. Loan growth was driven by C&I where new production increased significantly. And utilization returned to near pre-pandemic levels. Consumer loans also grew driven by mortgage and home equity.

Higher rates continued to adversely impact the unrealized value of our securities book. In response we've continued to reposition the portfolio during the quarter resulting in 60% of our securities portfolio now being held and held to maturity. We returned $1.4 billion of capital to shareholders during the quarter through share repurchases and dividends. Looking forward there is uncertainty in the environment we're operating in including the impact of higher rates supply chain disruptions and inflation.

But regardless of the path ahead macroeconomically we believe having a strong balance sheet a solid mix of fee-based businesses continued focus on expense management and differentiated strategies for organic growth will continue to provide the foundation for our success. And our focus is on executing the things we can control and not getting distracted by what is beyond our control. Along those lines we delivered well on our strategic priorities in the quarter including the build-out of our new BBVA and expansion markets modernizing our retail banking technology platform bolstering our asset management offering and building differentiated and responsible capabilities for our retail and commercial customers in the payment space. As I've talked about recently at conferences our performance in the BBVA markets has exceeded our own expectations.

On Slide 3 you can see the strong growth we've generated in these markets across customer segments. In corporate banking we've seen sales increase 40% linked quarter and maintained a 50% noncredit mix of sales since conversion. We've seen similar growth within commercial banking where sales in the BBVA USA markets are up 32% linked quarter. And noncredit sales to total sales have been approximately 55% since conversion.

In retail banking we've experienced a notable increase in sales for both small businesses and consumers of 16% and 22% respectively. And we continue to invest in AMG. And a big part of that is building a strong customer-focused team that can deliver our brand across our footprint. We have built good momentum in our recruiting efforts over the past few quarters hiring advisors across all areas of the business to help deliver for our clients.

I'll close by thanking our employees for their hard work and dedication to our customers and communities. Moving forward we believe that we're well positioned to continue to grow shareholder value. And with that I'll turn it over to Rob for a closer look at our results and then we'll take your questions.

Rob Reilly -- Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer

Well thanks Bill and good morning everyone. Our balance sheet is on Slide 4 and is presented on an average basis. During the quarter loan balances averaged $305 billion an increase of $14 billion or 5%. Investment securities grew approximately $1 billion or 1%.

And our average cash balances at the Federal Reserve declined $23 billion. Deposit balances averaged $447 billion a decline of $7 billion or 2%. Our tangible book value was $74.39 per common share as of June 30th a 7% decline linked quarter entirely AOCI driven as a function of higher rates. And as of June 30 2022 our CET1 ratio was estimated to be 9.6%.

Given our strong capital ratios we continue to be well-positioned with significant capital flexibility. During the quarter we returned $1.4 billion of capital to shareholders through $627 million of common dividends and $737 million of share repurchases for 4.3 million shares. Our recent CCAR results underscore the strength of our balance sheet and support our commitment to returning capital to our shareholders. As you know our stress capital buffer for the fourth quarter period beginning in October 2022 is now 2.9% and our applicable ratios are comfortably in excess of the regulatory minimums.

Earlier this year our board of directors authorized a new repurchase framework which allows for up to 100 million common shares of which approximately 59% were still available for repurchase as of June 30th. This allows for the continuation of our recent average share repurchase levels in dollars as well as the flexibility to increase those levels should conditions warrant. Slide 5 shows our loans in more detail. During the second quarter we delivered solid loan growth across our expanded franchise particularly when compared to 2021 growth rates.

2021 as you know was characterized by low utilization levels PPP loan forgiveness and in PNC's case a repositioning of certain acquisition-related portfolios. Loan balances averaged $305 billion an increase of $14 billion or 5% compared to the first quarter reflecting growth in both commercial and consumer loans. Commercial loans excluding PPP grew $13 billion driven by higher new production as well as utilization. Included in this growth was approximately $5 billion related to high-quality short-term loans that are expected to mature during the second half of the year.

Notably in our C&IB segment the utilization rate increased more than 120 basis points and our overall commitments were 5% higher compared to the first quarter. PPP loan balances declined $1.2 billion and at the end of the quarter were less than $1 billion. Consumer loans increased $2 billion as higher mortgage and home equity balances were partially offset by lower auto loans. And loan yields increased 10 basis points compared to the first quarter driven by higher interest rates.

Slide 6 highlights the composition of our deposit portfolio as well as the average balance changes linked quarter. We have a strong core deposit base which is two-thirds interest-bearing and one-third noninterest-bearing. Within interest-bearing 70% are consumer and within noninterest-bearing 50% are commercial compensating balances and represent stable operating deposits. At the end of the second quarter our loan-to-deposit ratio was 71% which remains well below our pre-pandemic historic average.

On the right you can see linked quarter change in deposits in more detail. Deposits averaged $447 billion in the second quarter a decline of nearly $7 billion or 2% linked quarter. Commercial deposits declined $8 billion or 4% primarily in noninterest-bearing deposits due to movement to higher yielding investments and seasonality. Average consumer deposits increased seasonally by $2 billion or 1%.

Overall our rate paid on interest-bearing deposits increased 8 basis points linked quarter to 12 basis points. Deposit betas have lagged early in the rate rising cycle but we expect our deposit betas to accelerate in the third quarter and throughout the remainder of the year given our increased rate forecast. And as a result we now expect our betas to approach 30% by year-end compared to our previous expectation of 22%. Slide 7 details our securities portfolio.

On an average basis our securities grew $800 million or 1% during the quarter representing a slower pace of reinvestment in light of the rapidly rising interest rate environment. The yield on our securities portfolio increased 25 basis points to 1.89% driven by higher reinvestment yields as well as lower premium amortization. On a spot basis our securities remained relatively stable during the second quarter as net purchases were largely offset by net unrealized losses on the portfolio. As Bill mentioned in total we now have 60% of our securities and held to maturity as of June 30 which will help mitigate future AOCI impacts from rising interest rates.

Net pre-tax unrealized losses on the securities portfolio totaled $8.3 billion at the end of the second quarter. This includes $5.4 billion related to securities transferred to held to maturity which will accrete back over the remaining lives of those securities. Turning to the income statement on Slide 8. As you can see second quarter 2022 reported net income was $1.5 billion or $3.39 per share which included pre-tax integration costs of $14 million.

Excluding integration costs adjusted EPS was $3.42. Revenue was up $424 million or 9% compared with the first quarter. Expenses increased $72 million or 2% resulting in 7% positive operating leverage linked quarter. Provision was $36 million and our effective tax rate was 18.5%.

Now let's discuss the key drivers of this performance in more detail. Slide 9 details our revenue trends. Total revenue for the second quarter of $5.1 billion increased 9% or $424 million linked quarter. Net interest income of $3.1 billion was up $247 million or 9%.

The benefit of higher yields on interest-earning assets and increased loan balances was partially offset by higher funding costs. And as a result net interest margin increased 22 basis points to 2.5%. Second quarter fee income was $1.9 billion an increase of $211 million or 13% linked quarter. Looking at the detail of each category.

Asset management and brokerage fees decreased $12 million or 3% reflecting lower average equity markets. Capital market-related fees rebounded as expected and increased $157 million or 62% driven by higher M&A advisory seats. Card and cash management revenue grew $51 million or 8% driven by higher consumer spending activity and increased treasury management product revenue. Lending and deposit services increased $13 million or 5% reflecting seasonally higher activity and included lower integration-related fee waivers.

Residential and commercial mortgage noninterest income was essentially stable linked quarter with higher revenue from commercial mortgage banking activities offset lower residential mortgage loan sales revenue. Finally other noninterest income declined $34 million and included a $16 million Visa negative fair value adjustment related to litigation escrow funding and derivative valuation changes. Turning to Slide 10. Our second quarter expenses were up by $72 million or 2% linked quarter driven by increased business activity merit increases and higher marketing spend.

These increases were partially offset by seasonally lower occupancy expense and lower other expense. We remain deliberate around our expense management. And as we've previously stated we have a goal to reduce costs by $300 million in 2022 through our continuous improvement program and we're confident we'll achieve our full year target. As you know this program funds a significant portion of our ongoing business and technology investments.

Our credit metrics are presented on Slide 11. Overall we saw broad improvements across all categories. Nonperforming loans of $2 billion decreased $252 million or 11% compared to March 31st and continue to represent less than 1% of total loans. Total delinquencies were $1.5 billion on June 30th a $188 million decline linked quarter reflecting lower consumer and commercial loan delinquencies which included the resolution of acquisition-related administrative and operational delays.

Net charge-offs for loans and leases were $83 million a decrease of $54 million linked quarter driven by lower consumer net charge-offs primarily within the auto portfolio. Our annualized net charge-offs to average loans continues to be historically low at 11 basis points. And during the second quarter our allowance for credit losses remained essentially stable and our reserves now total $5.1 billion or 1.7% of total loans. In summary PNC reported a solid second quarter and we're well-positioned for the second half of 2022 as we continue to realize the potential of our coast-to-coast franchise.

In regard to our view of the overall economy we expect the pace of economic growth to slow over the remainder of 2022 resulting in 2% average annual real GDP growth. We also expect the Fed to raise rates by an additional cumulative 175 basis points through the remainder of this year to a range of 3.25% to 3.5% by year-end.mLooking at the third quarter of 2022 compared to the second quarter of 2022 we expect average loan balances to be up 1% to 2%. We expect net interest income to be up 10% to 12%. We expect noninterest income to be down 3% to 5% which results in total revenue increasing 4% to 6%.

We expect total noninterest expense to be stable to up 1%. And we expect third quarter net charge-offs to be between $125 million and $175 million. Considering our reported operating results for the first half of 2022 third quarter expectations and current economic forecast for the full year 2022 compared to the full year 2021 we expect average loan growth of approximately 13% by an 8% loan growth on a spot basis. We expect total revenue growth to be 9% to 11%.

Our revenue outlook for the full year is unchanged from the guidance we provided in April. However relative to our expectations at that time we now expect more net interest income from higher rates offset by somewhat lower fees. We expect expenses excluding integration expense to be up 4% to 6%. And we now expect our effective tax rate to be approximately 19%.

And with that Bill and I are ready to take your questions.

[Operator instructions] And our first question comes from the line of Gerard Cassidy with RBC. Please proceed.

Gerard Cassidy -- RBC Capital Markets -- Analyst

Good morning guys. How are you?

Rob Reilly -- Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer

Hey. Good morning Gerard.

Gerard Cassidy -- RBC Capital Markets -- Analyst

Rob can you elaborate a little further on the deposit beta change? Is it purely just the rate of change in interest rates going up so fast? Or is there a deposit mix that's also influencing your new outlook for the beta?

Rob Reilly -- Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer

Hi. Good morning Gerard. Yeah probably both but a little bit more of the former. We're just at that point now where we're seeing rates rising to the point where the betas are becoming active.

They were not that active on the consumer side a little bit on the commercial side in the first quarter and that's picked up a bit. More on the commercial side as we expected and in our case it's our nonoperating deposits that explains the decline there in the second quarter. So you know betas are beginning to move. We expected that and we're ready for it.

Gerard Cassidy -- RBC Capital Markets -- Analyst

Very good. Credit quality obviously was quite strong for you folks similar to the prior quarter. And Bill I don't know -- I know there's a lot of uncertainty out there with what's going on in the world. But it just seems that for your company at least you are so well-positioned from a credit quality standpoint.

And is it -- are we just going to go off a cliff or something at the end of the year with some sort of big recession that has frightened everybody about credit quality for banks in general? Any elaboration on your outlook on credit and the outlook for the economy?

Bill Demchak -- Chairman President and Chief Executive Officer

Yes. Look I don't think there's any cliff involved. I do think that the trouble ahead lies somewhere in the middle of next year you know not any time in the next six months. But what you're seeing inside of our credit book you got to remember that during this period of time we continue to kind of run off a higher risk book from BBVA and our loan growth is largely in higher quality names.

So you know the overall quality of our book actually improves quarter on quarter. Eventually that has to stop. And eventually I think the Fed has to slow the economy to a pace to get inflation under control. And I think that's going to be harder to do than the market currently assumes.

And I think it's going to take longer than the market currently assumes. And when that happens we're going to see credit costs go up at least back to what we would call normalized levels. But I don't think -- I don't see any particular bubbles inside of the banking system as it relates to credit. I think you're just going to see a slow grind with credit losses increasing over time as we get into the slowdown.

Rob Reilly -- Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer

And some normalization.

Gerard Cassidy -- RBC Capital Markets -- Analyst

I'm sorry what was that Rob I'm sorry.

Rob Reilly -- Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer

I'm saying just -- and Bill mentioned it Gerard. Just some normalization which is inevitable.

Gerard Cassidy -- RBC Capital Markets -- Analyst

Yes no I agree. Thank you guys.

Rob Reilly -- Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer

And our next question comes from the line of Bill Carcache with Wolfe Research. Please proceed.

Bill Carcache -- Wolfe Research -- Analyst

Thanks. Good morning Bill and Rob. There was a time where you talked about increasing the mix of your securities given all the liquidity in the system. But as the Fed engages in QT and with the strong loan growth that you're seeing could we see you go the other way and perhaps redeploy some of your securities portfolio paydowns to fund more of your growth such that you actually remix more -- a larger mix of your earning assets toward loans?

Bill Demchak -- Chairman President and Chief Executive Officer

You know I think over time that is probably likely if we continue to see loan growth we do. But you shouldn't mix security balances with the way we think about fixed rate exposure hedging our deposits right? Securities are one way we do that swaps are another way and then of course our fixed rate assets themselves. And then inside of that the duration of the securities we buy. So you know long story short the balance is probably decline.

But we're sitting in a period of time right now where we're very asset-sensitive. You'll notice our balances basically stayed flat through the course of the quarter as we kind of purposely watch and let things roll off here given our view on what we think you know longer term rates are going to ultimately do. So balances could go down just as a matter of sort of algebra in the balance sheet but you know our ability to invest in rising rates is still there in a large way.

Rob Reilly -- Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer

Yes that's right. Well the context -- Bill as you know the context of your question is historically pre sort of the rapid increase in liquidity over the last couple of years we did run about 20% of our securities to our earning assets. We raised that because of all the liquidity in the system. So we're still pretty high on a historical basis but it's still -- Demchak just said that's not likely to change anytime soon.

Bill Carcache -- Wolfe Research -- Analyst

That's very helpful. Thank you. And separately as the Fed proceeds through the hiking cycle at some point I think as you've both alluded to in your comments that's going to presumably slow the pace of growth. But taking your loan growth guidance higher for the year maybe could you speak to how much of that improved outlook is idiosyncratic you know because it certainly does sound like that you're you know expecting a deceleration at some point at the macro level.

Bill Demchak -- Chairman President and Chief Executive Officer

A lot of it just comes from our ability to win new business. You know utilization rates have largely approached where we were I think Rob pre pandemic at this --

Rob Reilly -- Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer

Yeah.

Bill Demchak -- Chairman President and Chief Executive Officer

So there's a little bit of room there. But these new markets and our -- just our ability to win new business. And by the way new business that is you know 50% fee-based is pretty strong. And we feel confident we'll be able to continue to do that independent of what happens in the economy.

Rob Reilly -- Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer

Yeah. And I would just add to that. In terms of the loan growth outlook for the 12 months we're up a bit mostly because of the outperformance in the first half relative to our expectations. So that's sort of truing up so to speak.

Bill Carcache -- Wolfe Research -- Analyst

Got it. And if I could squeeze in one last one. I think it's interesting Bill to think about your commentary around the normalization of credit as the Fed proceeds through its hiking cycle. And you know sort of we think about the long and variable lags that between monetary policy and when that ultimately starts to show up in credit and then when you sort of juxtapose that with what's happening with reserve rates which it's notable that for most of your peers they've drifted below their day one levels.

And I know for you guys there's a BBVA deal and lots of other moving parts but that 1.65 seems relatively conservative. How are you thinking about the trajectory of that from here in the context of the thought process you just laid out of the Fed hiking cycle eventually leading to credit normalization probably as we get into maybe the middle of next year or somewhere in that time frame?

Bill Demchak -- Chairman President and Chief Executive Officer

That's an impossible question to answer given the dynamics of CECL. But you know you should assume -- you know we assume that all else equal credit quality is going to deteriorate at some pace you know from here through the next two years. I just don't think it's going to be all that dramatic. And it almost has to be a true statement given the charge-off levels that we've been seeing.

Rob Reilly -- Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer

Right. And I would add to that you know our reserve levels are above our day one fee so even adjusted for the BBVA acquisition we're appropriately reserved. Now -- and feel good about it.

Bill Carcache -- Wolfe Research -- Analyst

Very helpful. Thank you for taking my questions.

And our next question comes from the line of Ken Usdin with Jefferies. Please proceed.

Ken Usdin -- Jefferies -- Analyst

Hey guys. Just wanted to just ask to dissect a little bit. Rob you mentioned that your outlook for NII is a little bit better. Your outlook for fees is a little softer.

The NII one I think we get just wondering if you can help us understand now what kind of curve you're building in? And is it more just that uptick of rates that offsets that new 30% beta outcome?

Rob Reilly -- Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer

Yeah. Good morning Ken. Yeah. That's exactly right.

So you know higher rate environment NII and the balances that we've generated contribute to the improved NII look. And then you sort of referenced it in terms of the fees mostly in terms of our full year expectations compared to what we thought at the beginning of the year and last quarter some softer on AMG and mortgage as you would expect with the equity markets performing like they are for AMG and interest rates on the mortgage side. So it's sort of a -- the trade-off of the higher rates.

Ken Usdin -- Jefferies -- Analyst

Got it right. Sorry I missed your 3.25% 3.50% comment from earlier. So thank you.

Rob Reilly -- Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer

Yeah.

Ken Usdin -- Jefferies -- Analyst

And then just on the fee side then you had a really good bounce back as you expected especially in the capital market. So what's your -- what's changed there in terms of you know what you're seeing as far as the outlook on the fee side?

Rob Reilly -- Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer

So on the fee side again for the full year most of the change relative to our full year expectations is within AMG and mortgage. On capital markets you'll recall we had a soft first quarter relative to our expectations. We did see the bounce back in the second quarter. So we're back in position with our full year expectations you know in the second half obviously remains to be seen.

Ken Usdin -- Jefferies -- Analyst

OK. And if I could just sneak one more in. You mentioned -- Bill you mentioned all the different ways that you you know can get exposure to variable rates and such. I'm just wondering how are you guys you know thinking about just swaps portfolio you had done some adds in terms of protecting and managing the near-term upside versus the potential of what happens down the road based on Fed funds futures curve expectations and your general view of the economy.

Thanks guys.

Bill Demchak -- Chairman President and Chief Executive Officer

We don't think about the swaps book separate from our basic investing and fixed rate exposure. You know where we sit across the securities book and swaps and everything we do fixed rate we're looking at a curve now where I kind of think the year-end rates in my own mind are probably largely right but I think there's a -- I think the assumption that the Fed is going to start easing in the spring of next year is absurd which means we're holding off at this point because we think there's going to be -- there's still value to be had in the longer end of the curve as people come to the realization that inflation isn't as easy to tame as people might assume and separately that the Fed isn't going to immediately cut simply because the economy slows if inflation is still running high. So we're going to sit pat but not -- we don't think swaps are one thing and bonds are another. We just -- we look at our interest rate exposure.

We're very asset-sensitive. We have an opportunity to deploy in multiple places. We're just not doing it. We basically let everything run down thus far this year.

Ken Usdin -- Jefferies -- Analyst

Understood. OK. Thank you.

And our next question comes from the line of Erika Najarian with UBS. Please proceed.

Erika Najarian -- UBS -- Analyst

Hi good morning. I'm sure if this is the question that's been asked but I just wanted to clarify the loan growth expectation rose the performance has been spectacular the revenues didn't move even though we had the higher loan growth and the higher rate outlook and that's because of the higher beta assumed and also lower fees Rob?

Rob Reilly -- Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer

Well in part. I think the earlier question you might have missed it Erika was the improved outlook for the full year loan growth. The answer was most of that was a true-up to our outperformance in the first half. So we grew loans faster than we thought we would in the first six months which is great.

So we true-up that full year expectation. So all of that is built in to the full year guidance.

Bill Demchak -- Chairman President and Chief Executive Officer

Part of the impact that we're seeing in NII and NIM is actually on our loan yields where the quality of our book is it improves fairly substantially. We've put a lot of very high-grade stuff on. And spreads have actually come in quarter on quarter. So when we look at the out forecast on NII together with loan growth which will be pretty healthy we have in there -- embedded in there this notion that spreads are tighter than they were as we basically improve the quality of the book.

Rob Reilly -- Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer

That's another component. That's right.

Bill Demchak -- Chairman President and Chief Executive Officer

Yeah.

Erika Najarian -- UBS -- Analyst

Got it. And just as a follow-up question. How should we think about deposit growth from here? Bill I think you've been the one that has been vocal about the notion that if loan growth is positive deposit growth should be positive. How should we weigh that relative to you know probably your willful desire to work out the nonoperating deposits out of your balance sheet and you know QT.

Bill Demchak -- Chairman President and Chief Executive Officer

Yes. Well it's a good question. And the answer remains to be seen a little bit. We've clearly seen the larger corporates move liquidity out of the banking system into you know money markets government money markets.

And I think you know as we go forward the combination of QT from the Fed and what they do with their repo facility is going to drive some of the yield available in those funds which in turn is going to drive how much of that sits on bank's balance sheets or not. Outside of those deposits it's more about a rate paid game. And I think deposits kind of you know inside of the retail space and the smaller mid-market commercial space I think deposits actually grow simply because of the loan volume. But you know the mix shift that we've seen in commercial from a little bit less noninterest-bearing into interest-bearing that game is going to play out.

So thus far I mean if you look at total liquidity in the system it really hasn't moved. And of course the Fed hasn't really started their QT program yet. You know what we've seen is a movement of liquidity from banks into money funds as money fund yields started to grow. So this is going to take a while to play out.

Rob Reilly -- Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer

Yes. And our expectations Erika are generally stable As Bill pointed the mix could be different. And then an open question on the nonoperational deposits which we'll either do or not do.

Bill Demchak -- Chairman President and Chief Executive Officer

Yes. A big part of what we've seen go thus far are kind of deposits that we don't really care about. They were -- we kind of call them surge deposits internally which were noncore clients' you know parking liquidity that now have kind of gone into funds.

Rob Reilly -- Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer

And importantly are by definition low margin.

Bill Demchak -- Chairman President and Chief Executive Officer

Yeah.

Erika Najarian -- UBS -- Analyst

Got it. And my last question Bill you said earlier you don't really see any bubbles within the banking system. I think a lot of investors are more concerned about what's outside of the banking system. And interestingly I'm sure you know this statistic very well.

Corporate lending in terms of the bank share of it has declined to 16%. I guess my question to you is do you see an opportunity as rates rise and the you know economy slows down is some of that market share available back to banks in terms of what's happened in the private market? Or was that never credit that you wanted to do anyway? And don't you have a unit within P&C that does third-party recoveries you know in terms of if you have corporate defaults you could be a third-party recoverer if that's the term.

Bill Demchak -- Chairman President and Chief Executive Officer

Yes. Well first I want to see the audit on only 16% of corporate credit being inside of banks but I'm sure there's some way you can get that.

Rob Reilly -- Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer

Yeah.

Bill Demchak -- Chairman President and Chief Executive Officer

No we -- its credit outside of the banking system melts. We play in that in two ways. One is if it's in the real estate space we do that inside of our special servicing arm in Midland. Two is we are very good at working corporate credits and we wouldn't be afraid of buying portfolios of troubled assets.

And three and I think this is what you're referring to is in our asset-based lending group we play the role of senior lender on a very secured basis for -- and basically the agent for the entire capital structure. And as pieces below us struggle the fee opportunity for us to work those loans out on behalf of the B lenders is quite high. Furthermore we continue to be approached by multiple B lenders to basically run their books as they look at what's coming their way. Thus far we haven't agreed to do any of that.

And were we to do it I think it'd be quite lucrative.

Rob Reilly -- Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer

And we've done that in the past.

Bill Demchak -- Chairman President and Chief Executive Officer

Yes.

Erika Najarian -- UBS -- Analyst

Got it. All right. Thank you.

Bill Demchak -- Chairman President and Chief Executive Officer

And our next question comes from the line of Mike Mayo with Wells Fargo Securities. Please proceed.

Mike Mayo -- Wells Fargo Securities -- Analyst

Hi. Can you hear me?

Bill Demchak -- Chairman President and Chief Executive Officer

Yes. Hey Mike.

Mike Mayo -- Wells Fargo Securities -- Analyst

OK. Great. I guess all these questions get down to NIM. So are you forecasting deposits to run off for the year because you've mentioned betas are starting to move.

And I missed the updated guidance because you're guiding for good NII growth. So how much deposit runoff are you assuming in your deposit growth?

Rob Reilly -- Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer

I can jump on that and we covered some of that Mike. Generally speaking and we recognize the fluidity. For the second half we're calling for stable deposits. Some mix change between noninterest-bearing and interest-bearing also an open question in terms of nonoperational deposits and you know what betas are required for that and whether we choose to keep those or not.

So that all remains to be seen. But the outlook is stable. And NIM we do expect to expand.

Mike Mayo -- Wells Fargo Securities -- Analyst

And you talked about tighter loan yield spreads just because you're going up in quality. Are you getting rewarded for this more uncertain outlook? I mean capital markets some assets are pricing at near recession levels but I feel like the lending markets are not doing the same. And are you getting more spread for the added chance of a recession?

Bill Demchak -- Chairman President and Chief Executive Officer

It depends on the lending sector. So we are for example an asset-based -- you know straight spreads on high rated stuff has kind of stabilized. A lot of what we're seeing is just a mix shift in the quality of our book not a change in the market in terms of spread where I think the market continues to be irrational is on the consumer side. You know so auto lending seems you know in our view to be a little bit of a bubble.

And you know some of the things we're still seeing being done on the consumer side. But on the corporate side on the real estate side the shift is moving back toward the banks in terms of our ability to negotiate and get spread and get covenants and get structure. Just not a dramatic shift the way you've seen in some of the headline stuff on capital markets-related issues.

Mike Mayo -- Wells Fargo Securities -- Analyst

So you're getting some of that. Bill can you put this in context? This looks like the fastest commercial loan growth in 14 years. And we haven't had a cycle like this in quite some time.

Bill Demchak -- Chairman President and Chief Executive Officer

Yup.

Mike Mayo -- Wells Fargo Securities -- Analyst

And you know I guess I'm repeating I think what you've said in the past. It's inventory it's credit utilization it's capital expenditures it's working capital some business from capital markets back to the banks. Did I miss anything there?

Bill Demchak -- Chairman President and Chief Executive Officer

No. I mean it's -- thank you for reminding. I mean that's what happened right? We've had inventory build and capex and a little volume back to the banks and boom you get big loan growth.

Rob Reilly -- Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer

And particularly it overlaps Mike particularly on the utilization which has grown.

Bill Demchak -- Chairman President and Chief Executive Officer

Yeah. But that's coming off of their inventory though which --

Mike Mayo -- Wells Fargo Securities -- Analyst

The one I didn't mention that some other banks have mentioned you did not. So I don't want to leave the witness here but in terms of gaining share from nonbanks because you're seeing some you know nonbank entities not on a solid footing as they were in the past. Are you gaining share from them? Do you expect to gain share from them? Are there opportunities to do so? Are you shifting resources? Because I get it you're the national main street bank you're in 30 MSAs. You have a lot on your plate to try to gain share in all those markets.

Meanwhile you have some verticals where you might be able to gain share. What are you doing to try to capitalize on that?

Bill Demchak -- Chairman President and Chief Executive Officer

Yeah. Mike most of those players play in a risk bucket that we don't like to play in right? So the exception to that is in our asset-based lending book where borrowers who might have been able to do a cash flow loan with a BDC at one point are now going to come back to the banks and do it asset-based. But you know on the consumer side the guys who are out there playing subprime consumer or even in the leverage lending side cash flow unsecured we just don't have a big book of business there nor do we want one.

Mike Mayo -- Wells Fargo Securities -- Analyst

OK. And my last one just on CECL. You didn't -- I mean you beat on credit. Your credit is great.

You've always been high quality. You proved it through the global financial crisis. We get it. But with all this talk about a recession out there doesn't that give you cover to go ahead and increase reserves? Like I get it you're above day one CECL but why not just take more reserves out of conservatism?

Bill Demchak -- Chairman President and Chief Executive Officer

It's -- you know we have a model and we run by a model. So we're not allowed to just --

Rob Reilly -- Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer

That's right.

Bill Demchak -- Chairman President and Chief Executive Officer

As much as I'd like to sometimes put my thumb on the scale. We're not --

Rob Reilly -- Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer

We don't do that. We don't do that. CECL is a model-driven approach. And as you pointed out Mike we're above our day one.

John Pancari -- Evercore ISI -- Analyst

Good morning guys.

Rob Reilly -- Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer

Good morning John.

Bill Demchak -- Chairman President and Chief Executive Officer

Hey John.

John Pancari -- Evercore ISI -- Analyst

On the -- back to the commercial loan growth topic I'm sorry if I missed the detail on it but I know you mentioned the $5 billion in high-quality short-term loans that were brought on that you expect to mature in the second half. Can you give a little bit of color on that -- on those balances and what drove it? And maybe a little bit in terms of outlook could you see additional flows in that type of lending as well? Thanks.

Bill Demchak -- Chairman President and Chief Executive Officer

We'd like to see additional flows in that type of lending.

Rob Reilly -- Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer

Sure.

Bill Demchak -- Chairman President and Chief Executive Officer

It's kind of -- that was client -- a handful of clients but client-specific timing issues that you know we were able to serve client needs and their big balances and they're going to run off.

Rob Reilly -- Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer

And we'd like to do that.

Bill Demchak -- Chairman President and Chief Executive Officer

Yeah. That happens again that's great. But these were specific ones we called out both because of their size and also because there are lower spreads in the rest of the book and you know that had some impact on the loan yield this quarter.

John Pancari -- Evercore ISI -- Analyst

OK. And then also related to that in what areas do you expect that you could see some moderation in commercial loan demand as we do get some slowing in economic activity if the Fed succeeds here with the tightening?

Bill Demchak -- Chairman President and Chief Executive Officer

Eventually what you're going to see we've seen utilizations go up as people have built inventories. Now that will reverse itself as we get into a slowdown and people struggle to move inventories it will peak and then they'll grind it to a halt. But I think that's going to end up being the driver. We'll continue to go work and gain share.

And ultimately you know against the money we put out we look at what happens to utilization. And utilization will start to drop through a slowdown peak early into it and then slow down as they try to free up working capital.

John Pancari -- Evercore ISI -- Analyst

OK. Got it. Thanks Bill. And then back to the most reserve front.

I hear you again in terms of the adequacy of your reserve. In your scenarios do your economic scenarios that you run that support CECL did they get worse at all versus last quarter? Or did they -- like how did that change? And then separately did you have any reallocations within the reserve that were noteworthy like coming from you know commercial going into consumer. Can you maybe talk about that? So just trying to get a better feel of your confidence --

Bill Demchak -- Chairman President and Chief Executive Officer

Without getting into the details of CECL I would tell you that we -- within our overall provision we added two reserves as a function of the scenarios we run.

Rob Reilly -- Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer

Yeah. I mean it's pretty stable John. So no big mix changes no big dollar changes. The percentage came down a little bit just because of largely the high credit quality large underwritings we just spoke about improving the mix.

So you know pretty much unchanged.

John Pancari -- Evercore ISI -- Analyst

OK. Thanks Rob.

Rob Reilly -- Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer

Well no so to clarify that. In terms of the dollar amounts and the stable. But inside of that you know obviously our scenarios built in some worsening concepts. But there's QFR as part of that process that offset that.

So end of the day stable.

John Pancari -- Evercore ISI -- Analyst

Got it. OK. All right. Thanks Rob.

In terms of as we think about the outlook for deposit betas and margins if the Fed stops at the end of the year you talked about the deposit beta and deposit growth expectation in the back half. But give us a sense of the asset sensitivity profile of the balance sheet in a world where the Fed stops hiking the 2.10 remains inverted for six to 12 months. And as Bill alluded to we may not get cuts as quickly.

Rob Reilly -- Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer

Right.

Ebrahim Poonawala -- Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- Analyst

In that backdrop do you still expect the margin to drift higher? Or do we start seeing some liability sensitivity where deposits are repricing higher but you're not seeing the benefit on the asset side?

Rob Reilly -- Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer

Yeah yeah. We don't give explicit NIM outlook.

Ebrahim Poonawala -- Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- Analyst

Sure.

Rob Reilly -- Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer

But I would say your question is when does NIM peak. We see NIMs continuing to expand and peaking in '23. So with everything that you described we still see upside in them.

Ebrahim Poonawala -- Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- Analyst

Got it. So safe to assume that even in a backdrop where the Fed stops hiking the NIM should still at least drift higher a bit for a few more quarters. So point noted.

Rob Reilly -- Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer

Yes possibly. And again we're in sort of that context we're talking about '23 then. 2023.

Ebrahim Poonawala -- Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- Analyst

'23 yeah. And I didn't mean to pin you down or ask for 2023 guidance.

Rob Reilly -- Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer

Yeah.

Ebrahim Poonawala -- Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- Analyst

I'm just trying to conceptually think if we go into this period where we've not been where the curve remains flat to inverted for a while what that does to the NIM. And it's not unique to you but I appreciate your color obviously.

Rob Reilly -- Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer

That's right. That's right.

Bill Demchak -- Chairman President and Chief Executive Officer

Yes you have to. The number of pieces that are moving inside of that even if let's assume they get out there and they just freeze and you have a small inversion in the curve and you sit there in that instance betas probably don't move from wherever they were post the last hike. And instead what you're going to see is a increase in fixed rate asset yields that basically roll off from very low yields into higher yields. And then the upside to the extent we want to deploy at that point.

So you see a gain in yields inside of the security book in a static environment simply because everything that was purchased with 1.5% handles rolls off.

Rob Reilly -- Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer

Yeah. That's right. That's why we're still -- some part -- some ways from the peak.

Ebrahim Poonawala -- Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- Analyst

That's fair. I appreciate the perspective. And on the lending side just still wanted to follow up on two things. One like do you have a sense of where customers are in terms of rebuilding inventories like that's been a big driver of growth for the last two to three quarters.

But compared to pre-pandemic are customer inventories back to those levels? Like how would you frame that? And secondly I would love to hear your thoughts about just outlook for the commercial real estate market in this backdrop especially if we get a recession? You've been cautious in the past so would love to hear your thoughts. The inventory question is all over the place because you have a bunch of customers who have more inventory than they want. And you have others you know who are still struggling to build inventory to keep up with supply because of continued supply chain disruption. So I don't know that there's a simple answer on inventories.

Real estate with the exception of the slow burn on office where we just -- we continue to be worried we continue to see slow deterioration we think we're really well reserved. But absent that kind of slow burn the rest of it continues to kind of do OK to improve. And I think that holds even at least on the slowdown that's in the back of my mind. Again I just don't see some big spike into a really ugly recession.

So we have our eye on real estate. We have exposure into the office space that we're reserved against. It's kind of doing what we expected. And beyond that we're not particularly worried about it.

Rob Reilly -- Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer

Yes. And to your point we're well-reserved. And multifamily which is the biggest component of that is very strong.

Ebrahim Poonawala -- Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- Analyst

Got it. And just one quick one. Sorry if I missed it. Did you talk about the pace of buybacks.

How we should think about that in the back half of the year?

Rob Reilly -- Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer

I did in my opening comments. We're going to continue buying back shares roughly at the average rate of what we've been doing the last couple of quarters.

Ebrahim Poonawala -- Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- Analyst

OK. Thanks for taking my questions.

Our next question comes from the line of Matt O'Connor with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed.

Matt OConnor -- Deutsche Bank -- Analyst

As we think about loan loss reserves in call it a moderate recession how high or how much add do you think you have to do? I think for COVID it was around $2.5 billion x the day one CECL impact. But obviously there's been a mix shift the BBVA deal and a lot of factors. But as you guys run your stress tests you know what would cumulative reserve bill be for a moderate recession?

Bill Demchak -- Chairman President and Chief Executive Officer

No way to answer that.

Rob Reilly -- Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer

I was going to say that Bill said there was an earlier impossible question. Yes that one might be number two.

Bill Demchak -- Chairman President and Chief Executive Officer

But I mean remember that reserve build in COVID right? The scenarios we are running I don't remember off the top of my head if it's the kind of employment to 15% higher GDP. We're not -- this has nothing to do with that right? We're going to go into a slowdown and we're going to see an increase in reserves at some point but they're not even going to be related to the thing we saw when COVID -- economy down. Yes just in terms of size. So you almost have to take that whole example set and remove it from the framework of how you think about provisions going forward.

Matt OConnor -- Deutsche Bank -- Analyst

Right. So it seems like you're implying and we've heard from some others that it should be a lot less. But I guess we'll see.

Bill Demchak -- Chairman President and Chief Executive Officer

No no. I can't -- Matt I mean --

Rob Reilly -- Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer

Yes right.

Bill Demchak -- Chairman President and Chief Executive Officer

Only if you think about what those forecasts were right? I mean do you remember they were unemployment going to --

Rob Reilly -- Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer

15% to 20%.

Bill Demchak -- Chairman President and Chief Executive Officer

15% Yes. I mean it was I don't think there's anybody out there who thinks we have to cater the economy by that amount to get inflation under control. That was -- look there could be some world event that causes that but it's not going to be a function of the Fed raising rates and slowing the economy to get inflation under control.

Matt OConnor -- Deutsche Bank -- Analyst

Yup agreed. I mean obviously that's what the market's still worried about. And it's just interesting if you put it relative to capital even if you did what you did for COVID it's only 50 basis points of capital. So --

Bill Demchak -- Chairman President and Chief Executive Officer

Matt look you're bringing up -- this whole issue is the issue I think that you know investors just have completely wrong about the banking system right now. If you look at the market cap that's been pulled out of the banking system and take your worst case reserve build and charge-offs through some cycle it's just wildly wrong. Yes. We'll have increased losses but you know --

Rob Reilly -- Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer

Not to that extent.

Bill Demchak -- Chairman President and Chief Executive Officer

Not to anything close like what we put in during COVID. And more importantly you know I think there's a growth opportunity through a mild downturn for us just given the way we run our business and the business that will come back into the banking systems and out of the capital markets. So I am personally confused about all the concern that sits out there on banking reserves and the coming recession and the impacts on the profitability of banks. It will hurt a little bit but --

Rob Reilly -- Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer

To your point if it's being extrapolated from COVID scenario --

Bill Demchak -- Chairman President and Chief Executive Officer

It's just -- again that's data point that's removed.

Rob Reilly -- Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer

Right.

Matt OConnor -- Deutsche Bank -- Analyst

And then just the flip side got a little over $8 billion of losses in OCI. Obviously a lot of that comes back over time the part that's related to the bond book. Just give us a rule of thumb like how much of that accretes back each year if rates stay here on the kind of the medium longer-term part of the curve?

Bill Demchak -- Chairman President and Chief Executive Officer

Well the held-to-maturity accretes back independent this point. And I don't know you guys --

Rob Reilly -- Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer

We disclosed that Bryan. It's a couple of hundred million.

Bryan Gill

Yes.

Bill Demchak -- Chairman President and Chief Executive Officer

I mean the way we kind of think about it internally given how much we moved is we ought to have pulled a par on the held-to-maturity book adding to our capital base at a pace that largely hedges us against you know further declines in AOCI and the available-for-sale book depending how much of a spike their rates are versus the rolled up. But we feel pretty good about the mix we have at this point. And obviously it's not impacting our capital flexibility vis-a-vis the way we look at AOCI in terms -- inside of regulatory capital.

Matt OConnor -- Deutsche Bank -- Analyst

Yeah I guess what I was asking is like if we just think over the next few years right like all that OCI eventually gets reversed back as the bonds mature you are saddled with $8 billion of losses like a lot of banks having a drag. I'm just wondering you know what's a good rule of thumb? Does that $8 billion come back kind of maybe 1.5 billion 2 billion a year or something like that?

Bill Demchak -- Chairman President and Chief Executive Officer

I mean let's say we've got a [Inaudible] seven years or something.

Rob Reilly -- Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer

Well the short answer is approximately $200 million a quarter $1 billion a year. So that's the number you're looking for. But that's the right neighborhood.

Bill Demchak -- Chairman President and Chief Executive Officer

Sorry that's out of the held to maturity.

Rob Reilly -- Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer

Held to the maturity. Yes the held to maturity.

Bill Demchak -- Chairman President and Chief Executive Officer

We have a separate AOCI loss available for sale.

Rob Reilly -- Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer

Which is dependent on rates. Right.

Matt OConnor -- Deutsche Bank -- Analyst

OK. Thank you.

Rob Reilly -- Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer

Sure.

[Operator instructions] And our next question comes from the line of Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed.

Betsy Graseck -- Morgan Stanley -- Analyst

Thanks. just 1 follow-up on that on the AFS book. I guess the underlying question is is the duration roughly the same as the HTM book. I get that rates will move that mark around but let's say rates never change.

Is it the same duration as HTM?

Rob Reilly -- Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer

Yes roughly. Yes roughly.

Betsy Graseck -- Morgan Stanley -- Analyst

Yes. Yes. OK. And then just separately I know there's a lot of questions earlier about deposits.

And I'm just wondering your loan-to-deposit ratio I think today is around 70% maybe 71%. And in 4Q '19 it was at 83%. So there's lots of room there in the LDR. I'm wondering how you think about it is -- are you happy to go back to 83% in the near term? Or is there a trajectory or a pace that you're comfortable with?

Bill Demchak -- Chairman President and Chief Executive Officer

Look if it's high quality we'd love to go back to 83%. If it's in our risk box and coupled with client relationships where we have really strong cross-sell that would be a great outcome.

Rob Reilly -- Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer

Well that also relates to the deposit pricing and what we choose to do. So yes you're right. We have room and flexibility there as we go through these increased betas and you know growing loan environment.

Betsy Graseck -- Morgan Stanley -- Analyst

Right. So part of the question is just trying to get a sense as to the pace of LDR increaseYou kind of control with the deposit pricing?

Rob Reilly -- Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer

Right.

Betsy Graseck -- Morgan Stanley -- Analyst

So you could let a lot more run off before you start to --

Rob Reilly -- Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer

Yeah. Yeah that's my point. That's the flexibility so we can and we can view these deposits in terms of whether we want to take for them --

Bill Demchak -- Chairman President and Chief Executive Officer

No. I don't think. I mean look our intention here is to keep deposits and grow deposits if we can without having to be aggressive on rate. It's very simple.

And inside of that we'd like to grow loans. And if we manage to do the two things there and grow loan to deposits to 83% we'll be making a boatload of money given the fee mix we get when we grow loans.

Rob Reilly -- Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer

That's a good --

Bill Demchak -- Chairman President and Chief Executive Officer

That would be a great thing to be able to do and we're going to work on it.

Betsy Graseck -- Morgan Stanley -- Analyst

Yeah. Well I mean I guess part of the question is you don't have to be more competitive on deposit rate right now you could wait a few more quarters and you know then move.

Rob Reilly -- Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer

Yeah. That's what I said.

Bill Demchak -- Chairman President and Chief Executive Officer

Yeah.

Betsy Graseck -- Morgan Stanley -- Analyst

OK. All right. Thank you.

Rob Reilly -- Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer

Sure.

Our next question comes from the line of Mike Mayo with Wells Fargo Securities. Please proceed.

Mike Mayo -- Wells Fargo Securities -- Analyst

Hi. I wanted to follow up just because Bill you're just -- seem so adamant that the market cap that's been taken out of your stock you know far exceeds you know credit loss hits that you have in a scenario. So a personal question. You've owned a lot of stock for a long time.

You have a lot of skin in the game. At what point would you put more skin in the game and buy some shares? We haven't seen that I think by any bank CEO. And if you think this is a dislocation and you think it's so unlikely to have you know some kind of deep recession global financial crisis pandemic sort of situation have you thought about that? I mean would you do that?

Bill Demchak -- Chairman President and Chief Executive Officer

You know I think about it all the time. I don't know when I go into details on my own financial situation but it's -- I see a lot of value there. It's interesting. We've had a bunch of senior execs actually enroll in our employee stock purchase plan --

Rob Reilly -- Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer

That's right.

Bill Demchak -- Chairman President and Chief Executive Officer

Which maybe is a simple way for me to get a few shares here and there. But look I think there's a lot of value. I don't know that you're going to see me make a you know giant purchase because as you said I own a lot of stock and it's most of my net worth.

Mike Mayo -- Wells Fargo Securities -- Analyst

Just an extra tone from the top but I guess you said it on the call.

Bill Demchak -- Chairman President and Chief Executive Officer

Yeah.

Mike Mayo -- Wells Fargo Securities -- Analyst

Just one more time on that question. Again you have this disconnect between pricing the capital markets with some other areas and your own expectations. So what you're saying before is that the power or the control has gone back to the banks from the borrower in terms of terms and structure maybe not the same degree of pricing though. And I'm just -- it's that pricing element that -- it's tough for you or anyone to really know how much you should be pricing these loans if you think we might be going into a recession.

So how do you get to that level?

Bill Demchak -- Chairman President and Chief Executive Officer

Look it's -- I mean pricing ultimately is market-driven. And it's -- you know I would expect for a given credit quality we're going to see small backup. Of course pricing is also based on a grid. So as we go into a slower economy and people run another turn of leverage given their performance we'll see jumps in spreads that's built into the existing contract you know because spreads are performance based on a lot of the loans that we do.

So I -- we'll get there. You know more important to us Mike is the cross-sell that we ultimately get. You know at the end loan prices -- as long as we get good structure pricing is important but pricing along with you know the majority of the TM relationship and capital markets business really ups the return that you get from that client relationship.

Rob Reilly -- Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer

And there's a structure component. There's a lot of good companies out there that don't have structures that we would lend into but they could change that.

Mike Mayo -- Wells Fargo Securities -- Analyst

And then I guess one more. Just in terms of your 30 MSAs or your newer markets your BBVA markets do you have any metrics on what market share you have there versus your legacy franchise? Because that would size the opportunity.

Bill Demchak -- Chairman President and Chief Executive Officer

It's small. Big opportunity. Opportunity is big.

Rob Reilly -- Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer

Big opportunity. We don't need to worry about that right now. We just need to do more.

Mike Mayo -- Wells Fargo Securities -- Analyst

OK. All right. Thanks a lot.

According to police on Saturday at approximately 12:42 p.m. the suspect entered the PNC Bank located at 500 Monmouth Street in Gloucester City and handed a demand note to a teller. The suspect received an undisclosed amount of cash then fled the scene. No weapons were reported and no one was injured.

However brick-and-mortar bank branches continue to play an essential role for many consumers when it comes to important financial services like check cashing deposits and atm services. Industry experts say more changes are coming down the pike to meet consumers’ evolving needs and to provide the right mix of digital tools and experiences with more personalized human interactions at brick-and-mortar bank locations.

Leading the charge in implementing some of these changes is one of the largest diversified financial services institutions in the United States PNC which is embarking on a multi-year conversion of its retail branch network in response to feedback and insights gleaned from its customers. Between May 2022 and the end of 2026 more than 60% of its 2600 branches nationwide will convert to a new format. Basic financial transactions will begin to be completed using automated or self-service solutions such as ATMs and video banking freeing bankers’ time to hold more in-depth conversations and truly engage with customers in offering financial advice expertise and solutions to help them meet their financial goals.

“We remain committed to making a positive difference for our customers and communities and to helping all move forward financially” says Kevin McCann retail growth and innovation executive for PNC. “We believe the balance we will be striking between physical and digital banking will allow us to meet our customers where they are by providing that sweet spot of convenient digital tools and meaningful side-by-side personal interactions.”

Those who are less comfortable with the latest technologies and who may be feeling anxious about these changes can put their concerns aside according to McCann who notes that bankers also will be available to spend time helping customers understand the digital tools available to them within and outside of the branch.

Six-time NTT INDYCAR SERIES champion Dixon earned his first victory since May 2021 at Texas Motor Speedway – a span of 23 races the second-longest winless streak of his illustrious career – by capturing the Honda Indy Toronto on Sunday. Dixon drove his No. 9 PNC Bank Chip Ganassi Racing Honda to a victory by .8106 of a second over Colton Herta in the No. 26 Gainbridge Honda.

The victory also was the 52nd of Dixon’s career tying him with fellow legend Mario Andretti for No. 2 on the all-time INDYCAR SERIES win list. A.J. Foyt leads with 67 wins. Dixon’s fourth career Toronto victory extended his record to 18 consecutive INDYCAR SERIES seasons with at least one win and he also has won a race in a record 20 seasons overall.

SEE: Race Results | Race Highlights

“Ended a streak there which is fantastic” Dixon said. “Just so happy for the team. A crazy year for the 9. The PNC Bank No. 9 back in winner’s circle. It just feels so good.

“To be close to Mario every time I’m asked these questions I’m just so thankful that we still have A.J. and him in the pits. We get to see them; we get to talk to them. It’s just fantastic. It’s huge man. I just feel so lucky to be a part of this group.”

Felix Rosenqvist finished third in the No. 7 Arrow McLaren SP Chevrolet to earn his first podium result since his sole career INDYCAR SERIES victory in July 2020 at Road America.

Graham Rahal finished a season-best fourth in the No. 15 United Rentals Honda while NTT INDYCAR SERIES championship leader Marcus Ericsson finished fifth in the No. 8 Huski Chocolate Chip Ganassi Racing Honda.

Ericsson expanded his lead from 20 to 35 points over second-place Will Power in the series standings. Power finished 15th after starting 16th in the No. 12 Verizon Team Penske Chevrolet.

Dixon is fifth in the standings 44 points behind his Chip Ganassi Racing teammate Ericsson. Dixon would tie Foyt as the all-time championship winner in INDYCAR SERIES history with a seventh title.

“Hopefully we’re kind of in the title hunt now” Dixon said. “I’m hoping this is the start of the roll. I know the team definitely deserves it.”

Dixon who started second used canny strategy from his pit box earlier in the race to take the lead for the first time on Lap 32 of the 85-lap race.

Dixon chased NTT P1 Award winner Colton Herta for the first 17 laps around the 11-turn 1.786-mile temporary street circuit around Exhibition Place. The Ganassi team called Dixon for fuel and to change from Firestone alternate “red” tires to the primary “black” tires on Lap 17.

That move prompted Andretti Autosport to call Herta to the pits for an identical tire change on Lap 18 and Dixon – on hot primary tires – passed Herta and his cold primary tires on track during Herta’s out lap after his pit stop. That overtaking maneuver proved decisive and Dixon circulated to the front on Lap 32 when Pato O’Ward surrendered the lead after finally making his first pit stop in the No. 5 Arrow McLaren SP Chevrolet.

“We struggled a little bit on reds” Dixon said of the Firestone alternate tires. “We made some adjustments after this morning (based) on some of the different tracks that we’ve been throughout the year. We had fought with understeer and that definitely wasn’t the case today. It was a tough drive man.”

The race was remarkably clean for the first 44 laps with just one caution for two laps in the opening laps after contact damaged the No. 51 Deloitte Honda of Takuma Sato. But the treacherous bumpy circuit with its unforgiving walls spawned three caution periods between Laps 45 and 60 giving Herta and others a chance to jump Dixon on a restart.

But Dixon held firm and assumed the lead for good under caution on Lap 61 when an off-sequence Rinus VeeKay pitted from the front in the No. 21 Bitcoin Racing Team with BitNile Chevrolet. Dixon led a race-high 40 of the 85 laps with VeeKay second with 18 laps in front.

Herta couldn’t get past Dixon on the final restart of the race on Lap 66. Then Herta focused on his mirrors and resisted intense pressure from behind from Rosenqvist prevailing for second over the Swede by .5384 of a second at the finish.

“Felix was really fast and I’m glad we were able to keep him behind us” Herta said. “He looked like a few more laps and he was going to get us. We struggled a little bit with tire wear at the end but other than that our car was amazing.”

Dixon will split $10000 with his team and a charity of his choice for the victory as part of the PeopleReady Force for Good Challenge.

Meanwhile in his defense Savadi said ""I was there for only half of the day. I didn’t go to chill and enjoy. Today is local election and municipal members have gone away. I had to go there to convince them to come back. While i reached late at night I went for a swim in the morning took a bath and left Goa. Now I’m in constituency. What’s wrong in taking a bath? Congress is trying to poach the municipal members hence they went to Goa. Now they are releasing photos on WhatsApp and creating issues. There’s no flood in my area.""

Notably this is not the first time that Savadi has been mired in a controversy. As the chairperson of the Karnataka Handloom Development Corporation Limited (KHDC) he was seen shoving a woman BJP councilor in the presence of police personnel. The woman who was pregnant at the time of the incident allegedly suffered a miscarriage following the heckling.

Later her husband Nagesh Naik another BJP leader from Mahalingpur in Bagalkot district made charges against the MLA.

“Extraordinary Attorney Woo” which is about to reach 10% viewer rating with only 6 episodes released is currently a hot topic. The drama which failed to air on SBS has rather become a global hit drama through Netflix. Here are the 4 things that “Extraordinary Attorney Woo” doesn’t include in their story but that actually help the drama succeed in becoming a representative work of all the cast members including Park Eun-bin.

◆ Villain

There is no villain who tries to trap or kill the main character. It’s a cliché in dramas these days that they create villains to make fast developments and boost the viewers’ immersion but “Extraordinary Attorney Woo” was different. The two rival law firms Hanbada where Young-woo works and Taesan were expected to compete fiercely over the acceptance of cases with conspiracies but they turned out to be unnecessary details.

In the first episode Young-woo’s senior lawyer Jung Myung-seok (Kang Ki-young) was suspected of being a villain but this character is actually the other way round. He was revealed to be an exemplary boss who is like a warm father to his juniors. A viewer commented “It’s been a long time since I waited and watched a drama on time at exactly 9 p.m with no worries.”

◆ PPL

What if Young-woo takes out a pink aqua lip balm whenever she goes on a field investigation with her love line’s partner Jun-ho (Kang Tae-oh)? What if Jung Myung-seok gives Korean red ginseng extract sticks to his junior lawyers after successful cases? PPL which can break the flow of the drama rarely appears in “Extraordinary Attorney Woo”. Even though Park Eun-bin has been an advertisement model for KGC Ginseng Corporation for 4 years it doesn’t affect her drama.

The same was true for “My Liberation Notes” but there were many scenes and situations in “Extraordinary Attorney Woo” where PPL could be added in different ways such as the sofa kimbap franchise massage chair car cosmetics etc. the planning PD decided to not do so. It is said that the production company AStory which was criticized for adding excessive PPL in its previous work “Jirisan” might have learned a lesson.

◆ No acting holes

The fact that it is difficult to find a bad acting performance is also mentioned as a reason to explain the rise in “Extraordinary Attorney Woo” rating. Among the characters surrounding the female lead there is no actor who gets bad responses for their acting skills. Jeon Bae-soo who plays Young-woo’s father – a graduate from Seoul Law School Baek Ji-won and Jin Kyung who appear as CEOs of two rival law firms as well as Joo Hyun-young who comes out as Woo Young’s best friend Dong Geu-ra-mi all received favorable reviews for their stable performances.

Some viewers compared “Extraordinary Attorney Woo” with “Money Heist: Korea – Joint Economic Area” which is considered a failure. In the case of “Money Heist: Korea – Joint Economic Area” starring Yoo Ji-tae and Kim Yoon-jin some actors’ diction and acting were bad enough for the viewers to comment “You had better turn on Korean subtitles”. In “Extraordinary Attorney Woo” all the actors are said to be doing better than average. In particular the pronunciation and voice control of Park Eun-bin who debuted as Park Sang-won’s daughter in “White Nights 3.98” at the age of 6 are praised as a textbook for junior actors.

◆ Lee Kyung-young

Some viewers jokingly said “I’m relieved that Lee Kyung-young is absent from this drama”. Up until his recent series “Again My Life” Lee Kyung-young has appeared in various works about corruption and power and raised the tension of the shows to the highest level.

Lee Kyung-young who is close to “Extraordinary Attorney Woo” director Yoo In-sik. Director Yoo who waited a year for Park Eun-bin to finish her previous drama “The King’s Affection” cast Lee Kyung-young in his hit series “Vagabond”. Even in this work he appeared as Edward Park the axis of the evil that aims to kill Lee Seung-gi and did not disappoint the viewers with his villain acting.

Experts say this will help many organisations including corporates to utilise their fund marked for social responsibility and also help non-profit organisations to get funds in a more transparent manner. In simple words neither any interest is paid nor principal is repaid under ZCZP.

A gazette notification issued by the ministry said: “Zero Coupon-Zero Principal instrument means an instrument issued by a not-for-profit organisation which shall be registered with the social stock exchange (SSE) segment of a recognised stock exchange in accordance with the regulations made by the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI).”

‘Benefitting all’

The notification also declared the inclusion of ZCZP in the list of securities under Securities Contracts (Regulation) Act 1956. As on date this list included shares scrips stocks bonds debentures debenture stock or other marketable securities derivative units or any other instrument issued by any collective investment scheme security receipt mutual fund units (excluding ULIPs) units issued by any pooled investment vehicle and government securities. These securities can be traded on a recognised stock exchange and such trading can be regulated by SEBI.

Dhirendra Kumar CEO of Value Research said: “This move is certainly going to benefit both — one who wants to donate and one who wants to raise money for social causes. Take the example of a corporate which is mandated to use part of profit under Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) it will get an instrument to invest but not for return.”

The new notification is a follow up to Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman’s announcement in the FY20 Budget. “It is time to take our capital markets closer to the masses and meet various social welfare objectives related to inclusive growth and financial inclusion. I propose to initiate steps towards creating an electronic fund raising platform — a social stock exchange — under the regulatory ambit of SEBI for listing social enterprises and voluntary organisations working for the realisation of a social welfare objective so that they can raise capital as equity debt or as units like a mutual fund” she had said.

Working group

To implement this SEBI formed a working group which recommended that ZCZP bonds be listed on the SSE. They will carry a tenure equal to the duration of the project that is being funded and at tenure they will be written off the investee’s books. Such bond is particularly well suited to investors who are looking to create social impact but do not wish to have their funds returned to them.

However as the group said such bonds are not without risk as there is no guarantee that the social impact that an NPO (Non-Profit Organisation) is promising will in fact be created. Accordingly investors will be keen to channel funds only to credible and legitimate NPOs which the SSE will ensure by requiring beneficiary NPOs to report on social impact in a standardised format. Furthermore the group recommended investors in ZCZP bonds may also be awarded a tax benefit to incentivise their participation in this instrument.

Accordingly last September the SEBI board approved a framework for SSE through which ZCZP can be issued. It has been proposed that the minimum issue size of ZCZP will be ₹1 crore while the minimum application size shall be ₹2 lakh.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiQ2h0dHBzOi8vYWJ0Yy5uZy90eXJyZWxsLWhhdHRvbi1zcG9uc29yLXdoby1zcG9uc29ycy10eXJyZWxsLWhhdHRvbi_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Tyrrell Hatton Sponsor: Who sponsors Tyrrell Hatton?,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://abtc.ng/tyrrell-hatton-sponsor-who-sponsors-tyrrell-hatton/ on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiQ2h0dHBzOi8vYWJ0Yy5uZy90eXJyZWxsLWhhdHRvbi1zcG9uc29yLXdoby1zcG9uc29ycy10eXJyZWxsLWhhdHRvbi_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,,,,,,,,,

So you might want to look at some of the facts that could shape the stock's performance in the near term.

Over the past month shares of this world's largest consumer products maker have returned +5.8% compared to the Zacks S&P 500 composite's -0.2% change. During this period the Zacks Soap and Cleaning Materials industry which P&G falls in has gained 6.5%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?

While media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.

Earnings Estimate Revisions

Rather than focusing on anything else we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.

Our analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price investors tend to buy the stock resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.

For the current quarter P&G is expected to post earnings of $1.37 per share indicating no change from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -0.4% over the last 30 days.

For the current fiscal year the consensus earnings estimate of $6.55 points to a change of +11% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days this estimate has changed +1.6%.

For the next fiscal year the consensus earnings estimate of $6.97 indicates a change of +6.3% from what P&G is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month the estimate has changed +0.3%.

Having a strong externally audited track record our proprietary stock rating tool the Zacks Rank offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate along with three other factors related to earnings estimates P&G is rated Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

Projected Revenue Growth

While earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.

In the case of P&G the consensus sales estimate of $20.81 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of +1.3%. The $84.32 billion and $87.18 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of +2.8% and +3.4% respectively.

Last Reported Results and Surprise History

P&G reported revenues of $20.2 billion in the last reported quarter representing a year-over-year change of +0.6%. EPS of $1.52 for the same period compares with $1.37 a year ago.

Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $20.48 billion the reported revenues represent a surprise of -1.41%. The EPS surprise was +7.04%.

The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates two times over this period.

Valuation

No investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.

Comparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples such as its price-to-earnings (P/E) price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF) to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued overvalued or undervalued whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.

As part of the Zacks Style Scores system the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on) making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued rightly valued or temporarily undervalued.

P&G is graded D on this front indicating that it is trading at a premium to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.

Conclusion

The facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about P&G. However its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.

IT’S THAT TIME of year when we gardeners are shopping shopping shopping often in hot pursuit of just the right plant that will make the design of a bed or the larger landscape hang together—that elusive missing ingredient. But what if the answer isn’t a plant sometimes but a pot or a sculpture or some other non-living elements strategically placed?

Stephen Procter a ceramist specializing in art for the garden has walked through many a landscape with prospective clients helping to figure out the roles such pieces could play.

Stephen who is Vermont-based has for about 20 years has created monumental stoneware vessels that live in the landscape all four seasons. His work has been displayed at public gardens such as Blithewold in Rhode Island and The Mount Edith Wharton’s home in the Berkshires of Massachusetts. He helped me think about what else besides plants can help the garden hang together and how.

sculptural pots in the garden with stephen procter

Margaret Roach: Hi Stephen. I first got to know of your work thanks to the Instagram algorithm [view his account].

Stephen Procter: Thank goodness for Instagram.

Margaret: I know whatever. Because many of my virtual colleagues or whatever friends and garden designer friends and other keen gardener friends follow you there. And so I kept getting shown your posts of your vessels your pots and then so I contacted you and we worked together on a “New York Times” garden column together recently. And since those conversations we had for that story I keep looking around my garden with a different eye I have to say thanks to you. So: thanks to you.

Stephen: [Laughter.] I’m so happy to hear that.

Margaret: Yeah. So your pots are not just flower pots neither in scale nor in purpose. Tell us how big they range and what the intention what their intention initially … [Laughter.] How did this happen? You started making these big pots for gardens didn’t you? About 20 years ago.

Stephen: I sometimes wonder that myself. So so many questions you asked all at once there. I’ll try to take them up one at a time. My zone is sort of 3 to 5-1/2 feet tall for finished pieces the upward limitation being my tolerance for risk and the height of my custom-built kiln. And it’s funny I’ve been to several pottery events recently and I don’t really feel like a potter even though I work in clay.

People say potter or pottery and their mind conjures something quite different from what I do. So I think of myself more as a sculptor who works in clay. My approach is essentially sculptural. When I sit down at the wheel I am thinking about a rough sense of scale and form and it unfolds over several days as I’m throwing. Once in a while I’m working with a jig if I want to replicate a form that I’ve loved before. And I wound up putting them in gardens because they’re too big for most homes.

Margaret: [Laughter.] Yeah they are. They are. So again I said they’re not flower pots. We don’t put soil and plants in them although they do have a hole a drainage hole in the bottom. But neither in scale nor purpose is that what they’re for. But they’re functional. And I know that when we did the “Times” story you were explaining to me that in the world of ceramics there is this sort of we’ll say discussion but it might be a little tenser than that at times [laughter] about functional ceramics functional pottery versus I don’t know what the other end of it is whether it’s art or not.

Stephen: Versus nonfunctional or decorative.

Margaret: Yeah decorative. So yours are decorative but it’s not that they’re not functional. Correct?

Stephen: I think of them as functional in that they inspire people they define spaces they announce significance. I think of them as functional on a quasi-spiritual level if you will. It that’s not too big a claim.

Margaret: Well but I think the garden is I mean to me what else are we doing out there? It’s not just outdoor decorating is it? I mean hopefully it elevates us and the space.

Stephen: Absolutely. And I feel like a piece like this can really focus and amplify that effect in a certain way. The way especially it in a certain sense reorganizes the energy around it in an interesting way and certainly reorganizes the visual field when something like this enters the garden.

Margaret: Yeah. Well when we did the “Times” story you cited a poem which by Wallace Stevens whose work I’d read but I didn’t know the poem “Anecdote of the Jar.” I don’t know if you want to tell us about it but it was beautiful.

Stephen: Sadly I can’t recite the poem. I haven’t read it that recently. But he talks about placing a jar on a hill and what that does to the surrounding landscape. The line I particularly love is “It made the slovenly wilderness surround that hill.” And he talks about how it reorganizes all the relationships of the things surrounding it.

Margaret: Right. And so from that I wrote down one line I remember “The wilderness rose up to it and sprawled around it no longer wild.”

Stephen: Oh I love that line.

Margaret: And so there’s that sort of there’s the thing that’s man-made in the wild space and the two of them are changed a little bit from the relationship yeah?

Stephen: I feel like they enter a conversation of sorts between the man-made and the natural. And one instance of that that’s maybe even a little more intense than the garden which is already cultivated is when clients choose to site a piece of mine in relation to a large stone or a large rock where there’s this huge sort of primal presence of the stone conversing with the tamed stone of the stoneware vessel. It becomes a very interesting conversation to my mind.

Margaret: Right. Now I said in the introduction that yours because they’re this very high-fired stoneware they can stay outside all four seasons. And clearly a lot of… We’re sort of trying to inspire people in this conversation we’re having today on the podcast just to consider sculptural elements in the garden that can do the jobs we’re going to talk about. But some of them aren’t going to be four-season because they’re not going to be weatherproof so to speak. And so that has to be taken into consideration not just the placement and the scale and so forth but also the durability. And yours can do that.

Stephen: Yes. I use what potters call high-fire stoneware for exactly that reason. It’s completely impervious to moisture. To help people understand the difference I sometimes use the comparison of think of the material your dinnerware is made of as opposed to the material a terracotta pot is made of. This is more like the dinnerware. And I often like to go on and joke that added advantage it’s also microwavable and dishwasher-safe.

Margaret: [Laughter.] Yeah if you can haul the 250 pounds of clay into the house and shove it in the microwave. But in other words what I’m trying to say is that this could be a sculptural element a non-plant element of another substance but you’d have to consider its durability and its being weatherproof (or lack of being weatherproof). So that’s just to be kept in mind. So besides the wilderness rising up to it and being changed and it changing the wilderness people kind of rise up to it too when they see one of these don’t they [laughter]?

Stephen: I love watching people interact with these pots. I think of the pots as creatures of sorts and apparently other people do too. They approach them and they stroke them or they pet them or they hug them. There’s a lot of physical interaction that’s very unselfconscious and I see that happening and I always feel like oh the pots work; whatever its mysterious work is is happening in this interaction.

Margaret: So let’s talk about some of the work and some of the roles that a sculptural element like one of your large vessels can play and how do we figure it out where to place such a statement.

So if someone contacts you and says so I’m thinking I want something but I don’t know what or where you sometimes go and go on a walk with them I guess or do it photographically or whatever. But I mean what’s the beginning of that process of that exploration process?

I mean I always say one of the most important things about garden design and I’m no garden designer I just only know some basic principles is don’t forget besides walking around outside don’t forget to go inside and look out the window. Because I also want to have the sense of the outdoors from indoors because I’m indoors a lot right? So I don’t know if you take that into consideration like the placement not just from the outdoor experience but from key views within the living space.

Stephen: Absolutely I do. And it can make a big impact oddly to an indoor room almost as much as to an outdoor space the way it’s framed by a window or beckons someone to go outdoors and be in its presence. It’s a wonderful thing. And particularly for people I just heard recently from a garden designer who lives up in Central Vermont Judith Irven who was talking about she and her husband in the winter sit in their sunroom that faces the hillside where they placed a pot of mine. So they enjoy it all year round from indoors in the winter and it’s a long winter in the mountains where they are and watch how it plays with the snow as it comes and goes and the wind.

Margaret: And I think some of this people may think oh right I’ve used sometimes a pair of well-placed chairs is that type of thing. Even in the winter I leave out certain things and I have one pair that’s way up on the hill at the edge of a meadow and especially in the snow there’s just something so it’s like “Ooh someday I’ll be going back up there and sitting there in the fairer days.” Do you know what I mean? There’s just that.

Stephen: Yes exactly.

Margaret: Yeah that come hither kind of but not right now kind of conversation that I’m having looking out the window at it [laughter]. So let’s talk about some of the things. So someone says I think I want something but I don’t know what and I need your advice. And so what are some of the roles you go wander around or whatever with people? What are some of the things that this type of a statement can do this kind of a vessel or sculpture can do in a garden?

Stephen: I’ll start with some of the more obvious things it can do. And that is to reinforce the structure of the garden that’s already there. The visual destination at the end of a straight path. Or the sort of I think of “greeter function” as you move from one room or area of the garden to another almost like some people might use a granite fence post or something like that. That is a very interesting way to announce that articulation of the structure.

At the inside bend of a path along a garden pathway is another interesting way to create of an arm to swing around [laughter] if you will as you’re moving down the path. So some of those ways that are I think of as classically reinforcing the bones of the garden already.

And then there are more interesting and I think more arguably subtle ways of using them. An organic form that’s partially occluded by a large bush or something like that and reveals only part of itself creates this sense of mystery and intrigue and what is that? And a different way of drawing somebody to it sort of by being coy as opposed to by being so fully present.

Margaret: So it’s not like in a formal garden like in a parterre or a boxwood four-square kind of planting where there’s a pad with a plinth in the middle and it’s this perfect geometry and this vessel is fully exposed in the midst of all this other formality and geometry. It’s not like that. You’re saying it could actually kind of be nestled in and not fully exposed and that’s almost more exciting in some ways.

Stephen: Well exciting in a different way. And both work beautifully. I just had a conversation yesterday with someone who has exactly that very highly structured it’s a very geometric herb garden and she’s looking for a tall vessel to sort of anchor the center of that and looking for a more organic form to put near an exotic Japanese maple which I think would be a really interesting … I mean it’s a very different mood that’s called for in the second place. And she’s talking about a very different kind of pot to enhance that.

Margaret: You were just mentioning two pots and you didn’t necessarily say that they’d be where they’d both be seen at the same time. But when we talked for the “Times” story you talked to me about how sometimes if there is more than one such element it’s almost like they’re having a conversation. That the two vessels almost are speaking to each other and that we connect them even if they’re not literally next to each other or anything.

Stephen: The mind and eye very strongly draw lines between them. It’s so interesting and it’s not just my own experience but people I work with and when we place pieces in the garden it creates this other level of structure. And in some cases this has been a surprising discovery for me a very relatively small piece say a globe of 24 inches tall maybe even a little shorter if it relates to a larger vessel it can hold its own in a large space because it somehow rides the larger energy of the big piece. So a piece that would by itself feel lost if it has a big brother [laughter] it can tag along.

Margaret: So as we’re looking around our gardens and I think this is a good time I don’t know rather than when it’s in full swing. I feel like right now it’s the bones that I’m looking out at and I feel like before I get distracted by oh those colorful flowers over there that are coming in six weeks or whatever. I feel like it’s a good time to think about things like that. And so it’s not just looking for that one moment always. It could be more than one spot and thinking about the relationship between them. And I love I guess because of the nature of the place where I live—and it’s not huge; it’s a couple of acres. But where the house is positioned and the fact that there are woods around it at the perimeter so it feels bigger than it is. And so I love that sort placing things at a distant view creating almost axial endpoints like “Ooh look up there.”

And I know that’s one of the more obvious things that such a sculpture could do but I also love that. I love the sense of not just right here in the immediate distance but let’s look out there too.

Stephen: Yes. And often one placed in the near and one placed far in a sense amplifies the sense of distance. It dramatizes the distance to the far view in a very interesting way.

Margaret: Well and it’s interesting that you say that because when garden-designer friends have come and tried to teach me [laughter] about garden design over the years one of the things they’ve told me when I was like “Oh well I think I want to put a gold-leaf shrub way way in the distance so that it screams to me from across the yard out the window from across the yard.” And they’re like “Yes that’s a great idea. But along the way maybe on the left and right of that sort of axis not a literal path but a visual path maybe you want to have one or a couple of other elements spots of gold to help you travel there.”

So that sort of duet again or it might be a trio [laughter] of pots or plants. So some of the same design ideas I guess is what I’m saying come into play with thinking about these sculptures as opposed just as they do with designing with plants.

Stephen: In a sense they become visual guideposts that take the eye from one point to another to another to another to a destination. In a certain way it reminds me of the way a skillful painter will choreograph how your eye moves over the painting. And I think you can use elements such as this or as you mentioned a particular palette of plant you’re using to accomplish a similar thing.

Margaret: You just said choreograph and you’re giving yourself away because you had a career in music before you became a ceramic artist. Yes?

Stephen: Yes I did. And I was not looking to get involved in clay. It was a sort of surprising midlife seduction. Not one I regret. And strangely I found the transition from music to clay at the meta level very seamless. It felt like working with many of the same elements and working with the same impulses. I sometimes say what I had been doing in sound and time I was now doing with material and space. The common thread being looking to find the line that’s revelatory.

Margaret: Hmmm. So you’re also teaching now. You’re teaching people to make these to create these large vessels. Yes? That’s another that you’ve sort of branched out into that and you’re teaching not only I think at your place but elsewhere including I think in Europe this year for the first time maybe?

Stephen: I am. I have a lovely invitation from two studios in Amsterdam and they’ve put together four days of teaching for me in early June which I’m really looking forward to.

I want to qualify slightly what you said there Margaret. I’m teaching people that technique that I use to build pieces sectionally and I’m hoping that people won’t be building my pots [laughter]. I have discovered over the years against my better judgment I sometimes allow my students to use tools that I have designed and developed specifically to achieve the curves that I’m after. And not surprisingly I discover “Oh my gosh your pot is just like mine. Give me back those tools.” [Laughter.]

Margaret: Right. But you’re teaching the method.

Stephen: I’m teaching the technique that I’ve developed. It’s a little bit distinctive. It’s drawing on bits and pieces from here and there and putting them together in a way that suits my personality and my physique and the way I like to do things. And it’s also very accessible for people. As someone who is in clay self-taught and I’ll say that with an asterisk because we all rely on millennia of experimentation by previous potters. But as someone who’s not formally trained in pottery and just figured out how to do this stuff I feel like what I do and the way I do it is going to be accessible to an intermediate-level potter.

Margaret: I didn’t ask you yet but I have to ask you: your own home garden. Now I know that it’s smallish and I think you told me that your wife maybe had issued a proclamation [laughter] about some changes this spring summer. She said there are going to be some redos of some areas or is there so updates ahead?

Stephen: Instead of being a repository for my firing disasters [laughter] she’d like to get a first. We have the shoemaker’s children phenomenon going on here. So yeah I’ll be bringing home a perfect pot to grace our little postage-stamp garden soon.

Margaret: And is there any new planting going to go on or what all … Is it ornamental stuff or vegetables or both or what?

Stephen: It’s ornamental. We have this tiny little lot that we share with our duplex neighbors and it’s ornamental. My sister had a very brief flirtation with trying to start a garden-design business after she retired from a career as an educator. And she has a talent for it and put in a garden for us. And our main specifications were color all season long and low maintenance. Because the studio consumes me 120 percent and my wife is also involved in clay and runs her own community clay studio. So sadly we don’t have a lot of time to spend in the garden ourselves. So those two requirements suit us well.

Margaret: And now a third requirement which is a pot that isn’t second-handed. No cracks please. No cracks. O.K. [Laughter.]

Well I’m so glad to talk to you again and as I said I hope that this will just some of these thoughts from your experience working with your type of vessels with clients and so forth will be inspirational for people as they think about enhancements to their own garden this year whatever material or vessels or whatever they plan to use. Because I think it’s an important part of the overall design hanging together. And I was so glad to meet you and talk to you. So thank you Stephen.

Stephen: Thank you so much. It’s been a pleasure.

If “liberal Christianity” means Christianity that reflects the cosmology and worldview of a particular era then the earliest Christianity is liberal Christianity. It is only later as cosmologies and worldviews changed that some insisted on clinging to the views of an earlier era because those happened to be part of the worldview of previous generations of Christians including the Bible’s authors. That is why “conservative” Christianity ends up being a very radical departure from earliest Christianity even in the process of fighting to try to keep the same worldview as they had to the minimal extent that that is even possible. By making the assumptions of prior generations into articles of faith they stand against and not with the approach of the earliest Christians even while claiming to defend their specific beliefs.

Let me immediately add that it may not be helpful to speak of Jesus as the “founder” of Christianity as though he was seeking to start a new world religion. Jesus like most “founders” of new religions did not intend to do so but was instead a reformer within his own religion Judaism. The process of getting from there to here reflects the progressiveness of Jesus that I’ll be seeking to highlight here. My point is that to the extent that progressive Christianity has a beginning that beginning is with Jesus and has continued unabated ever since.

Everyone is more progressive or liberal than some people and less so than others. Progressive and liberal are tendencies along a spectrum and not absolute binary categories. In the case of Jesus can anyone really deny that he was open to taking things in a new direction to innovation and change? He taught his followers to do the same. This doesn’t mean that there weren’t elements in which Jesus was conservative just as is true of his progressive followers today. Many progressives are also interested in getting back behind developments in doctrine and institutional structures to a simplicity they associate with Jesus and his first disciples. That’s very Protestant and in one sense is inherently conservatives. Those who are defined as conservatives today often claim to be doing (or at least trying to do) the same thing. But those who are most often labeled conservative are seeking to go back to the supposed original beliefs and practices of Christians and to replicate them irrespective of the changes that have taken place since then and the differences between our own context and that in which Christianity first arose. Progressives on the other hand seek to implement in our time the same openness the same guiding principles that Jesus emphasized. Just as he was open to recognizing genuine and even superior faith among those who tended to be defined out of the people of God in his time (Matthew 8:10) today’s progressive Christians seek to do likewise. As Jesus envisaged Gentiles coming to the messianic banquet to dine alongside the Israelite Patriarchs (Matthew 8:11) Paul and others went against the clear teaching of Genesis which required the circumcision of all who were part of Abraham’s household. Instead these Christians insisted (over against the conservative Christians of their own time) that if God had shown that uncircumcised Gentiles are accepted by pouring out the Holy Spirit on them circumcision must not be essential (Galatians 3:2-5). As I have said here on my blog before “Conservative Christians often claim to be the most faithful interpreters of Scripture. But it seems to me that if we have ears to hear what the Spirit was saying to the churches down the ages it will become clear that focusing on written words and using them to argue against what the Spirit is doing often led people to be on the ‘wrong side’ as far as the Bible’s own perspective is concerned. And part of the message of many parts of the Bible is a warning to learn from such mistakes of the past.” Paul did not feel that pointing out “what the Bible says” settled a matter. Neither did Jesus who famously said that Moses was the one who permitted divorce in scripture but God’s ideal for human beings was lifelong fidelity (Matthew 19:8).

Those who wrote the Gospels in Greek were likewise progressive inasmuch as they cared less about preserving the exact words of Jesus in his native tongue Aramaic than they did about communicating the core of his message as they understood it to as wide an audience as possible which meant writing in Greek the lingua franca of the Eastern Roman Empire. Early Christian apologists like Justin Martyr (the original “apologists” before modern internet debaters sullied the term) stood in this tradition as well being open to Greek and Roman philosophies and the insights they offered. All through the ages there have been those who have stood in this tradition and so in that sense there is an unbroken lineage of progressive Christianity that connects Jesus to the present day. Liberal Protestants closer to our time such as Martin Luther King Jr. must also be included. Many conservatives embrace his emphasis on racial equality completely unaware that he represents a liberal Baptist position. If one reads his essay on the topic of the divinity virgin birth and resurrection of Jesus that he wrote while a student at Crozer Theological Seminary one will find things that reflect the stance of today’s liberal and progressive Christians.

Having put matters in those terms let me now pose an important question: Why Switch to Progressive?

I realize that sounds like a slogan in a car insurance ad but that’s not what I mean here as is hopefully clear from the context. In the first instance the question is about the terminology (which I confess I don’t find all that helpful). Why do people tend to identify as “progressive” Christians nowadays when a generation ago they tended to use the label “liberal”? Progressive doesn’t have a meaning that is clearly distinct from liberal. Moreover some progressive or liberal Christians are theologically conservative but politically liberal while others are the exact reverse. There’s potential for misunderstanding to say the least. However because liberalism reflected a stance that was very modern and shaped by the values of the Enlightenment (just as fundamentalism is shaped by that same context as the flip side of liberalism and a reaction against it) those who have accepted postmodern critiques of liberalism tend to prefer the term “progressive.” Yet the same openness to new insights (whether from biblical study history science psychology or anywhere else) characterize the two. Progressive Christianity thus reflects the present-day iteration of a liberal/progressive approach to God faith and other human beings that we can trace back as far as the very beginnings of Christianity to Jesus himself.

Hopefully the above makes clear another sense in which I want to answer the question “Why switch to Progressive?” Why do I think others should embrace progressive Christianity? Because it reflects the outlook of Jesus and his earliest followers. Christianity has always been bridging gaps including outsiders challenging assumptions and innovating new beliefs and structures. Some deny that and so rather than speak about progressive Christianity I’d much rather talk simply about Christianity or about honest Christianity one that doesn’t pretend that there is no picking and choosing going on just a preservation of a faith in static stagnant sameness. That has never been the case. The key difference between progressive Christians and conservatives is that progressives acknowledge the fact that we preserve things selectively that we pick and choose and that we never fail to experience change. We do not view this process negatively the way conservatives do even though they participate in the same processes however much they might try to deny this is so.

That’s the answer in a nutshell. It could have been briefer as I indicated at the outset. I could have said “Jesus is the founder of progressive Christianity” and left it at that. But many people today treat conservative forms of Christianity as the default as though they genuinely represent the classic historic Christian faith. In actual fact they merely preserve a dogmatic rejection of change that arose in that specific form relatively recently in history. There were conservatives among the earliest Christians and we read about them because they did things like opposing Paul’s proclamation to Gentiles of a gospel that did not require circumcision. It is ironic that today’s conservatives cite Paul’s letters as authoritative when they represent the stance of Paul’s opponents.

TL; DR: The core of Christianity was progressive from its beginning and today’s progressives continue that tradition.

More from a press release issued by American Flat Track:

Bauman Takes Emotional Win at Port Royal Half-Mile

DAYTONA BEACH Fla. (July 16 2022) – Progressive American Flat Track star Briar Bauman (No. 3 Indian Motorcycle/Progressive Insurance FTR750) scored his second straight victory at the Mission Port Royal Half-Mile presented by Appalachian Harley-Davidson thanks to a virtuoso performance at Port Royal Speedway on Saturday evening in Port Royal Pennsylvania.

The two-time Mission SuperTwins presented by S&S Cycle champion had suffered through something of a wins drought by his standards after taking last year’s Port Royal Half-Mile claiming just one triumph in the following 15 races. However Bauman looks to be well and truly back to peak form now adding a second consecutive win to record this season.”

The 22nd premier-class win of Bauman’s career carried some extra significance coming on an evening in which the paddock earlier paid tribute to Ryan Varnes by donning his number #68 en masse for a memorial lap led by the late rider’s family.

After taking the checkered flag in the Main Event Bauman took Varnes’ girlfriend Jennifer Hoshauer for the victory lap.

“Honestly it’s an emotional day for the sport of flat track” Bauman said. “I can’t thank everyone who participates in flat track enough right now. I can’t believe how strong the Varnes family is… All the fans were supporting us during our lap of honor. I don’t normally do burnouts – I don’t know if I’ve ever done one – but I just felt like we needed to do it. It was for Ryan.”

Reigning Mission SuperTwins champion Jared Mees (No. 1 Indian Motorcycle/Progressive Insurance FTR750) pushed Bauman early before falling into the clutches of Jarod Vanderkooi (No. 20 Mission Roof Systems Indian FTR750).

Following some back-and-forth Vanderkooi expertly exploited the extreme high line to rail around Mees with a minute remaining on the clock and then held strong to secure his second runner-up result in a row.

While unable to respond Mees still powered to his third third-place finish in succession. As a result Mees continues to lead the title fight but by just eight points over archrival Bauman (173-165).

For the contest’s opening half Estenson Racing Yamaha teammates Dallas Daniels (No. 32 Estenson Racing Yamaha MT-07 DT) and JD Beach (No. 95 Estenson Racing Yamaha MT-07 DT) ran in tight formation in fifth and sixth respectively. However after that point they went in opposite directions.

Daniels overtook Brandon Robinson (No. 44 Mission Roof Systems Indian FTR750) for fourth and made up ground on the podium before ultimately finishing just over a second off the box. Meanwhile Beach twisted his ankle and was unable to maintain his pace dropping all the way back to 12th by the race’s conclusion.

Robinson rounded out the top five followed home by Mission Production Twins Challenge entrants Jesse Janisch (No. 33 Vance & Hines Harley-Davidson XG750R) and Dan Bromley (No. 62 Memphis Shades/Corbin/Vinson Yamaha MT-07).

Meanwhile Davis Fisher (No. 67 Bob Lanphere’s BMC Racing Indian FTR750) Robert Pearson (No. 27 Rackley Racing/John Franklin Indian FTR750) and Bronson Bauman (No. 37 Latus Motors Racing Harley-Davidson XG750R) completed the top ten.

Mission Production Twins presented by Vance & Hines

Jesse Janisch (No. 33 Vance & Hines Harley-Davidson XG750R) outlasted Dan Bromley (No. 62 Memphis Shades/Corbin/Vinson Yamaha MT-07) to score his third win of the Mission Production Twins presented by Vance & Hines season.

Bromley announced at Port Royal that he was back for the remainder of the season and proceeded to prove in the Main Event that he was back in a big way. The home-state hero stormed to the holeshot and worked up a gap of nearly a half second over Janisch by the race’s mid-distance with the rest of the field even further back in his wake.

Rather than fold Janisch mounted a comeback reeling Bromley back in and arriving at his side with just over two minutes remaining. At that point both riders bucked and weaved mere inches apart with Bromley even reaching over and giving Janisch a friendly tap.

Janisch finally completed the extended overtake and then put his head down to claim a clear victory with almost two full seconds in hand.

With title rival Cory Texter (No. 1 G&G Racing/Yamaha Racing Yamaha MT-07) finishing a couple more seconds back in third the win saw Janisch retake the championship lead by a single point (174-173).

“Man that was some good racing” Janisch said. “About halfway through the Main (Bromley) made one little mistake and I was searching so much trying to find something that would work a little better. Right when he made that mistake I kind of found it. I started working on him. Hats off to the team. The bike is awesome. It’s like a dream come true season so far.

“This one is for (Ryan) Varnes. That front straightaway memorial we did for him was amazing.”

2020 class champion James Rispoli (No. 43 Wally Brown Racing/Haversack KTM 890 Duke) finished in fourth after getting shuffled back to tenth in a hectic opening lap. Despite the immediate disadvantage Rispoli charged hard enough to push Texter late taking the checkered flag just 0.806 seconds off the podium.

The top five was completed by Mikey Rush (No. 15 Hellipower Racing/Las Vegas Harley-Davidson XG750R) who equaled his best finish since returning from the injury he suffered at last season’s finale.

Parts Unlimited AFT Singles presented by KICKER

For the fourth consecutive round runaway Parts Unlimited AFT Singles presented by KICKER title leader Kody Kopp (No. 12 Red Bull KTM Factory Racing 450 SX-FFE) went wire-to-wire to victory.

In what has to pass as a form of consolation to the field Kopp’s dominance was held somewhat in check at Port Royal Speedway. In contrast to the previous three lopsided affairs a group of four riders managed to keep Kopp in sight for race distance.

Dalton Gauthier (No. 79 American Honda/Progressive Insurance CRF450R had the pace to keep Kopp honest consistently fighting back the gap whenever Kopp threatened to shake free. But in the end the KTM ace hit the stripe to claim a 0.646-second margin of victory over his American Honda-backed adversary.

“It feels good to come back and (win) here at Port Royal” Kopp said after taking the sixth win of what’s quickly shaping up to be a historic campaign. “This track is pretty cool. I’m just glad I got to take my sister on a victory lap. Big thanks to my team.”

Kopp’s teammate Max Whale (No. 18 Red Bull KTM Factory Racing 450 SX-FFE) earned his first podium since returning from injury. Whale battled with Gauthier early before being forced to shift his attention to fending off Gauthier’s rookie teammate Chase Saathoff (No. 106 American Honda/Progressive Insurance CRF450R) to hold onto the final spot on the box.

Trent Lowe (No. 48 Mission Foods/Al Lamb’s Dallas Honda CRF450R) rode in podium contention for much of the race before a late bobble dropped him off the chase. He still managed to claim a lonely fifth finishing nearly five seconds ahead of sixth-placed Trevor Brunner (No. 21 Estenson Racing Yamaha YZ450F).

Second-ranked Morgen Mischler (No. 13 American Honda/Progressive Insurance CRF450R) finished a spot further back in seventh as Kopp extended his championship advantage to more than two full races 205-150.

For 20 years the motto of the world social forum has been another world is possible... As we meet today that question is overshadowed by another one. Is this world possible? And the answer is ""no."" This world is not possible. This world is hurdling to self-annihilation. And only the creation of another world can reverse this course. Luckily another world is still possible though the chances of achieving it are diminishing at an ominous rate.

The fate of humanity is at a crossroads. Humanity is confronted with two imminent existential crises: climate catastrophe and nuclear war. The corporate capitalist system is producing an assault on the earth's ecology perpetual war ever-widening inequality an attack on democracy and a rise in fascism. If humanity does not address these crises NOW human civilization is unlikely to survive for future generations.

To save the future the People of the world must defeat a capitalist ruling class led by the United States which is hell-bent on destroying the Earth.

Capitalism is complex and produces a multitude of oppressions. There are thousands of liberatory organizations working on important issues. But we cannot assume these projects are going to organically coalesce into a whole capable of taking power from greed-driven corporate capitalists. In the face of these existential crises our time for ""organizing the organized"" is short.

The fundamental question facing humanity is: ""how can ordinary working people organize on the mass scale necessary to contest for power with the corporate capitalist elite and force the change needed to save the future?""

This essay is a beginning attempt to answer the question with a focus on organizing in the U.S. In addition it is a call for a ""Left"" dialog regarding the ""organization-to-scale question."" We need to imagine the mass organizing institutions needed both nationally and internationally for working people to contest for power.

Corporate Capitalism The Existential Threats and the Common-Sense Solutions Not Taken... Yet

Global corporate capitalism led by the hegemonic state the United States is a fundamentally immoral and irrational system. In capitalism both states and corporations are designed to maximize short-term power and profits for the super-wealthy corporate elite. The ideology assumes the benefits will trickle down to working people. In practice capitalism prioritizes short-term profits for the wealthy over the well-being of the people and even the survival of the human species. In all realms of society corporate capitalism is unable to take common-sense actions to prevent predictable crises when doing so undermines short-term power and profits (e.g. fortifying the sea wall in New Orleans to prevent flooding when hurricanes hit regulating factory meat production to prevent the development of antibiotic-resistant bacteria organizing a strong global public health system to prevent pandemics outlawing automatic and semiautomatic guns to prevent massacres eliminating debt-driven speculation that has repeatedly crashed the global economy using diplomacy to prevent foreseeable wars). Likewise the apocalyptic threats of climate catastrophe and nuclear war are worsening and capitalism is not taking the bold action necessary to stop humanity's march towards species self-annihilation.

Global warming is destroying the capacity of the earth to support humans and other life. Distinguished climate scientist James Hansen recently summarized the science from an expert report he had prepared for the court case Juliana v. United States in which a group of young plaintiffs sued the government for not protecting their right to a livable future. Man-made greenhouse gasses mostly CO2 are trapping heat in the earth's atmosphere at an accelerating rate. A 2022 report by United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) stated that humanity must take swift action. To limit global temperature rise to 2degC (3.6degF) global greenhouse emissions must start declining before 2025. The longer humanity delays decisive action the greater the risk that progressive climate warming will become irreversible. There are almost daily reports of dramatic changes in the earth's environment indicating that the climate catastrophe is accelerating now.

The possibility of an omnicide nuclear war has also been increasing. There are currently nine countries with nuclear weapons. The launch of one nuclear weapon can trigger a series of retaliations resulting in a global nuclear holocaust. Over the last 70 years there have been multiple close calls in which the decision of one person averted nuclear war. With both Democratic and Republican support the United States has committed to modernizing its nuclear weapons arsenal triggering a new global nuclear arms race. At the start of 2022 before the Ukraine War the Bulletin of Atomic Scientists which maintains the ""Doomsday Clock"" warned ""the Clock remains the closest it has ever been to civilization-ending apocalypse because the world remains stuck in an extremely dangerous moment."" Moreover the current proxy war between the United States and Russia greatly increases the likelihood of the accidental or purposeful use of nuclear weapons. A nuclear exchange between the United States and Russia would end human civilization. Undoubtedly the doomsday clock will tick closer to ""midnight"" in 2023.

The good news is humanity can prevent these crises and in doing so create a more democratic loving caring and sustainable society. IPCC Chair Hoesung Lee reported ""We are at a crossroads. The decisions we make now can secure a livable future. We have the tools and know-how required to limit warming.""

The solution to the climate catastrophe is a government-led third industrial revolution that quickly transitions the oil gas and coal-powered economy to a solar and wind-powered economy. The principal technological challenges to implementing a global Green New Deal (GND) are (1) building the solar and wind energy generation capacity to power society (2) creating a digital energy grid for managing intermittent energy across the system (3) upgrading buildings transportation and other infrastructure to support and be compatible with the new green energy system and (4) dismantle the old oil gas and coal industries while safeguarding a just transition for workers in those industries.The GND is potentially the basis for a high-wage full-employment economy empowering workers for decades to come. Many authors have described the possible nuts-and-bolts implementation of the GND.

The solution to preventing a nuclear war omnicide is developing international peace agreements and institutions for implementing the agreements based on the concept of common security ""the idea that nations and populations can only feel safe when their counterparts feel safe."" The ultimate goal is nuclear disarmament. International peace groups have recently released a Common Security 2022 Report which details many common-sense steps that can be taken to achieve common security. During the Cold War pressure from the international peace movement pushed the U.S. and U.S.S.R. to negotiate a series of nuclear arms control treaties that reduced the risk of nuclear war. Part of the context of the build-up to the current war in Ukraine was the U.S. unilaterally withdrawing from several of these nuclear arms control treaties. Possibly the war in Ukraine could have been averted if the U.S. and E.U. would have been willing to reach a negotiated settlement that took into consideration Russia's security concerns.

The Attack on Democracy and the Politics of Inaction

Despite the available common-sense solutions politicians and corporate elites are not taking the necessary steps to avert catastrophe. The United States the dominant nation-state in the world system is leading humanity down a path of self-destruction. The two-party political system in the U.S. is controlled by a very rich corporate capitalist ruling class. The ruling class in particular factions associated with the fossil fuel military and financial industries oppose addressing the climate and nuclear war crises because it would undermine their wealth and power and possibly the dominant position of the U.S. in the global capitalist system.

At this historical moment the Republican Party's top concern is its own perceived existential threat. The demographics of the U.S. are changing. Republican strongholds such as Georgia and Texas are hitting the tipping point in which Whites are no longer the majority. The Republicans fear that their coalition of the rich White Christian nationalists and White populists is not large enough to maintain their power democratically. Consequently they are committed to dismantling democracy and institutionalizing a form of minority rule. The January 6 2021 coup attempt was just the most dramatic manifestation of a party-wide commitment to ending democracy in the U.S.

As described by voting rights reporter Ari Berman in Mother Jones since 2020 the Republicans have been implementing a ""slow coup."" Emboldened by the ultra conservative supreme court which declared political gerrymandering legal in Republican-controlled states the Republicans are creating the legal foundations for a ""New Jim Crow"" minority rule with four primary strategies: allowing the rich and corporations to spend unlimited money in elections literally buying politicians extreme gerrymandering voter suppression laws making it more difficult for people of color and other disenfranchised groups to vote and ensuring that election counts are under the administration of Republican-appointed election officials. With a rigged electoral system and control over the Supreme Court for at least the next several decades Republicans are emboldened to remake the U.S. in their image. The repeal of Roe v. Wade is just a step towards their goal to dismantle human and civil rights. A series of supreme court rulings over the last decade has been building the legal foundation for authoritarian rule in the U.S.

To many Democrats the Republicans appear crazy and disconnected from reality. QAnon Stop-the-Steal Anti-Masks Anti-Vaccinations and White Supremacist History Denial are all obviously factually wrong. Even crazier the Republican anti-public health stance seems self-defeating causing tens of thousands of deaths among Republicans.

However the Republican culture of crazy is a political choice. It immunizes Republican opinion from counterfactual information and creates a narrative in which the Republicans specifically White people are the defensive victims. It is an ideological framework that energizes high citizen engagement and justifies radical action including violence.

Tragically the Democratic Party is not a clear alternative to the Republican Party for promoting multicultural multiracial working-class interests defending democracy or protecting the Earth. The Democratic Party coalition is made up of Silicon Valley and Wall Street elite the suburban professional-managerial class (white-collar workers) and a multicultural working-class base. The essential contradiction of the Democratic Party is that the rich fund and run the party while its voting base is the multicultural working class. Thus the common dynamic in the Democratic Party is that the progressive wing pushes for legislation to empower the working class while the corporate wing cooperates with Republicans to stop reform. Gridlock prevails frustrating working-class voters.

This dynamic has played out again under the Biden administration. When Biden was elected there was hope his administration would address working-class priorities. Senators Manchin and Sinema refused to overturn the Senate filibuster to pass the Build Back Better bill. Working people would have benefited from Build Back Better in many ways. The bill created over 7 million jobs over 10 years funded free pre-school for children and free community college expanded Medicare and Medicaid lowered prescription drugs costs made child tax credits permanent created 12 weeks of paid family leave invested in affordable housing and gave incentives for buying electric cars and other climate initiatives. Without the passage of Build Back Better at the end of 2021 a pandemic child tax credit that was giving 35 million families 250 to 300 a month expired.

Regarding inflation according to progressive economist Robert Pollin the Federal Reserve's recent interest rate hike is another example of government policy that prioritizes the interests of the rich over the working class. The FED interest rate hike is designed to increase the unemployment rate which will decrease workers' bargaining power and thus lower worker wages. This policy undermines labor organizing and increases the likelihood of a recession. It also does not address corporate causes of the inflation including disruptions in poorly planned supply chains and monopoly price-gauging particularly by oil companies.

The corporate Democrats are not organizing a serious fight back against the Republican attack on disenfranchised groups and democracy. A Republican senate filibuster killed two voting rights bills. Many voter rights advocates have expressed frustration with the Biden Administration's refusal to forcefully lead on the defense of voting rights. Again the problem is that robust voting rights would empower the multiracial working-class majority thus threatening the interests of the corporate elite in the Democratic Party. The corporate Democratic elite cannot create the political condition in which voters could actually demand that the Democrats deliver on policies that are highly popular among its base (e.g. universal healthcare 15-dollar minimum wage voter rights the right to unionize finance regulation) because those policies are opposed by their rich donors. Even on core values such as the right to an abortion corporate Democrats have a long history of prioritizing collegial cooperation with Republicans over fighting for fundamental rights.

The corporate Democratic elite view Bernie Sanders' attempt to unify the party based on a multiracial working-class agenda as an existential threat to their power. In the 2022 primaries corporate Democrats and Republican political action committees have worked hard to defeat progressive candidates.

As an alternative to class politics corporate Democrats have promoted a unifying Cold War-like narrative demonizing Russia glorifying militarism and ""defending democracy"" (U.S. hegemony) globally. The corporate Democrats believe they are more responsible stewards of the global capitalist system than Trump. From their perspective this is evident in their willingness to ""stand up to Russia."" Demonstrating this ""resolve"" the Biden administration refused to negotiate regarding the possibility of Ukrainian neutrality in the lead-up to the Ukraine War. We don't know if a settlement could have been reached however a diplomatic effort that addressed Russia's primary security concern was not even tried.

The Ukraine War is a disaster for global peace and security and U.S. democracy. With high-minded moralistic and triumphalist rhetoric the Biden administration has transformed the conflict into a proxy war with the goal of regime change in Russia. Pursuing a war to defeat Russia creates the situation in which nuclear weapons are most likely to be used thereby ending human civilization. The Democratic Party is transmuting itself into the War Party and the war is making the day-to-day stress of working people of all races and nationalities worse in the midst of a pandemic. A quagmire war in Ukraine increases the likelihood that the Republicans will win the elections in both 2022 and 2024.

In sum the two-party system functions as a racist divide-and-conquer strategy that breeds conflict anger cynicism and alienation. Because neither party clearly represents the multicultural multiracial working class's interests politics is dominated by the Republican ""cultural war"" scapegoating people of color immigrants the LBGTQ community and women. Many working people never see their interests represented in the system and stop voting and participating in politics. Over the last 40 years the country has moved rightward.

In a speech given in 2018 Angela Davis reminded us that an alternative politic centered in the common interests of the multicultural multiracial working class is possible. She stated:

Feminist theories and organizing approaches have helped us understand the deep connections that link... struggles. Given the demagoguery emanating from our current government and the explicit exploitation of racism and xenophobia to persuade poor working-class white populations that their interests call for an attack on racialized communities. It is important to point out that the suffering of poor White and working-class communities has been caused pretty much by the same economic phenomena that are responsible for the rise of mass incarceration the prison industrial complex and for the reasons that lead people from Central America Mexico elsewhere in the global south to migrate to other countries.

Toward A Multicultural Multiracial Working Class United Progressive Front and the Campaign to Save the Future

This moment demands the formation of a United Progressive Front (UPF) a unified coalition of progressive civic human rights and labor groups independent of the Democratic Party to launch a Campaign to Save the Future. Both the Republicans and the Democratic Party are pushing the world towards self-annihilation. Only a movement organized in a mass democratic institution committed to representing the interests of the super-majority multicultural multiracial working class can inspire the hope participation discipline and solidarity necessary to force system change now.

The great challenge the ""Left"" must take on is to develop a mass unifying social change strategy in the context of the sclerotic two-party system designed to preserve capitalist power and prevent social change. Historically the U.S. Left has failed this task. It is this generation's historical mission to try again... and succeed. As Marx wrote ""Men make their own history but they do not make it as they please; they do not make it under self-selected circumstances but under circumstances existing already given and transmitted from the past.""

The 2022 and 2024 elections are incredibly important. Without a massive Democrat turnout to stop the Republicans in 2022 and 2024 the Republicans will further rig elections and solidify their domination of government for at least a generation. With Republicans in power humanity has little hope of stopping the climate catastrophe. In early primaries Republicans are turning out at a higher rate than Democrats.

In the short run the UPF must focus on organizing the mass voter turnout necessary to defeat the Republicans. People will act if they understand the stakes in 2022 and 2024 and if they believe the multiracial working class has the mass institutional capacity and solidarity necessary to be effective. In 2020 many voters said ""I like Bernie's ideas but I don't think he can win."" What they were saying is ""I don't think the multiracial working class has the institutional capacity and solidarity necessary to battle capital."" Mass action and a common political agenda inspire hope and participation. For example millions of people acted in the Black Lives Matters protests. We need to institutionalize that spirit so ""the People"" can act in unison day in and day out. Everyone must understand that mass voting is a necessary but not sufficient tactic for defending democracy and saving the world. The multiracial working class is the majority. If we vote en masse we win.

The UPF will need to democratically decide on clear demands a media campaign a get-out-the-vote campaign and a street-mobilization strategy. Clear demands will put pressure on both the Democratic and Republican parties. For example the UPF can have mass rallies demanding that the government and FED maintain a full-employment economy and fight inflation by stopping monopoly price gouging.

There needs to be a clarion call to action. The UPF will need to create a detailed plan for coordinating on-the-ground organizing in urban suburban and rural working-class neighborhoods. Coalition partners should reach out personally to activists who participated in Black Lives Matter protests and the Bernie and Warren campaigns but who stopped participating in activism during the pandemic. Coalition partners should ask them to get active again and help lead the UPF. The alternative media will have to report daily on the Campaign to Save the Future as relentlessly as the Right trumpets ""Stop the Steal."" There are already many local grassroots groups working on getting out the vote for 2022. There needs to be a common website to go to where activists can figure out how they can plug into campaigns and the get-out-the-vote effort. In sum the goal is to create an institutional home for a self-conscience multiracial working class to come together and organize as a democratic mass movement. A unified competent organization will inspire hope and participation.

As a mass multiracial working-class voting block independent from the Democratic Party with a street presence the coalition will have the power to pressure the Democratic Party to address core working-class demands. If the multiracial working class regularly voted en masse it would dramatically change U.S. politics. In 2016 ""unmarried women Millennials (aged 18-34) African Americans Latinos and all other people of color"" represented 59.2 percent of the eligible voting population."" In 2004 it was 44.6%. A study of the 2016 presidential election by the Poor People's Campaign found that if the low-income population voted at the same rate as the high-income population and they voted against the winning party they could have flipped the winner in 15 states.

I hope the UPF will also demand that the U.S. negotiate directly with Russia to end the Ukraine War. Wars end either in negotiated settlements or the complete defeat of one side. The current Biden policy of pushing for the defeat of Russia increases the likelihood of a nuclear war a long quagmire war and exponentially more death and destruction in Ukraine. To resolve the climate/nuclear war crisis the U.S. needs a new foreign policy based on diplomacy and compromise not global military hegemony.

Some will argue that it is useless to organize for the election because the Democrats are not much better than the Republicans or the Left should focus on labor instead of electoral organizing. There is some truth in these arguments. However we need to organize in the world as it is. There is no possibility that the Republicans will ever address the climate/nuclear war crises. The Republicans are fundamentally committed to climate change denial militarism racism attacking immigrants and replacing democracy with authoritarian rule. Also it is difficult to imagine how organized labor can make gains under a Republican administration. Historically mass people's movements have been able to pressure the Democrats to pass some progressive policies.

In the two-party system the multicultural working class has two main enemies the corporate Democrats and the corporate Republicans. The Left does not have the power to beat them at the same time. The strategy implemented by Sanders and the Squad is to take the corporate Democrats on in the primaries and the Republicans in the general election. It means making defensive votes (voting for the lesser of two evils) when an offensive vote option (voting for candidates that you really want) is not available. It is harder to motivate people to vote in defensive elections. Working people are more likely to turn out for every election if they understand that mass voting is part of the UPF's long-term strategy for contesting for power with the capitalist class. In the long run if the UPF can organize a super-majority multiracial working class voting bloc it can then decide whether the best strategy is to take over the Democratic Party or form a third party.

Building the Institutional Capacity and Solidarity Necessary to Save the Future

The first step to a collective agreement to form the UPF is collective acceptance of the fact that as currently organized the Left cannot build the power necessary to avert the climate catastrophe/nuclear war crises. Historically the Left in the U.S. is fractured. We have thousands of organizations working on many important issues. But we have never had an umbrella coalition or institution to form a united multicultural working-class identity grounded in a common political project.

There is no workers' party in the U.S. due to both repression and the straight jacket of the two-party system. The good cop bad cop winner-take-all system prevents the development of a mass third party. In parliamentary systems with proportional representations third parties can grow organically over years accumulating power from election to election. In a two-party system even a tiny third party can act as a spoiler taking enough votes from the lesser evil party to give elections to the more evil party. Most voters do not want to gamble on a third party.

On the Left there is a practical comfort with fragmentation. It is easy to default to an ethos of ""Let a Thousand Flowers Bloom."" There are many types of oppression. It makes sense for an activist to focus on issues that hit ""closest to home."" Activism and democracy are hard even in small groups of like-minded people. Developing a uniting political project is fraught with difficulty. There will be conflict. Working through it and staying united will be challenging.

Yet over the last 10 years there has been a palpable yearning for a common political project of a united multicultural working class. The Occupy Wall Street slogan was ""We are the 99%."" The 2016 and 2020 Sanders presidential campaigns and 2020 Warren campaign were exciting because they contested for multiracial working-class power at the national level. Millions of people donated to and joined the campaigns. After 2016 motivated by Bernie Sanders' success in the primary and the threat of Trump there was an upsurge in Left organizing in the U.S. New national groups such as Indivisible Our Revolution and Justice Democrats formed and established groups such as Democratic Socialists of America and Working Families Party grew and became more active. In the wake of the murder of George Floyd on May 25 2020 Black Lives Matter organized the largest street mobilization in U.S. history. One study found that the Black Lives Matter labor and other protests played a role in motivating people to vote for Biden in 2020.

Historically there are many examples of the Left's fractured organizational structure limiting its ability to contest for power and win. The 2020 Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren primary campaigns never united. The corporate Democrats united behind Biden and won. After the election of Biden in 2020 the Left did not organize an independent mass mobilization to demand the multiracial working-class agenda (e.g. the Green New Deal voter rights Protecting the Right to Organize Act student debt relief a $15 minimum wage Medicare for All etc.) Instead progressive groups deferred to the Democratic Party's inside-Washington DC deal-making political strategy. No long-standing multiracial working-class priorities passed. The activist base was demoralized or turned their attention to local struggles.

Hopefully the UPF coalition can evolve into a permanent uniting organization a proto-party. In an essay entitled ""A Blueprint for a New Party"" Seth Ackerman presented a strategy for building a nationwide multicultural working-class proto-party. He discussed the long history of the Left's inability to organize a uniting institution in the two-party system. He argued that a new party could incorporate as a social welfare organization a 501(c)(4) democratically adopt a platform and then make case-by-case decisions about running candidates in a major party primary or as an independent. Adopting this strategy the new party could minimize the possibility that their candidates would be ""spoilers.""

A new proto-party would give the united multiracial working class an institutional home that could take on the crises of climate catastrophe nuclear war and democracy head-on. It could operate independently of the Democratic Party and compete for power in the Democratic Party. It would give working people a democratic forum to work through differences and craft a united political strategy distinct from the corporate agenda. The proto-party could do both grassroots and electoral organizing and have a street presence.If millions of working people joined the party it could raise the big money necessary to compete in politics in the U.S. Moreover it could hire hundreds of organizers to build on-the-ground solidarity and action.

There will be many challenges. The proto-party will have to address the current ""race vs. class"" debate on the Left. The corporate capitalist elite use racism to ""divide us against each other."" A divided multiracial working class cannot contest the capitalist elite's monopoly on both business and political power which subordinates all working people Black Brown and White. The party will have to develop an independent foreign policy and take on U.S. militarism and imperialism. The people cannot be free or safe at home if the U.S. spends trillions of dollars trying to rule the rest of the world with coercion and violence. The party will have to organize with activist groups globally to forge a new people's international and devise global actions to pressure capital to save the future (e.g. international boycotts or strikes targeting the U.S.). Globally the people must demand that climate catastrophe war and inequality end now.

To Have a Future We Must Organize to Scale and Claim the Future

To save the future the People of the world must defeat a capitalist ruling class led by the United States which is hell-bent on destroying the Earth. Unfortunately this is not hyperbole. In the U.S. that means organizing the multiracial working-class unity necessary to stop the authoritarian Republican Party from taking power and killing democracy and an imperialist Democratic Party which is prioritizing U.S. global hegemony and militarism over saving democracy and the planet.

I will end with an example of an on-the-ground call for unity. In 2022 dark money political action committees such as a PAC tied to the American Israel Public Affairs Committee have spent historic amounts of money to defeat progressive candidates in competitive Democratic primaries. For example in Pennsylvania Congressional District 12 PACs spent over 3 million dollars in a failed attempt to defeat progressive candidate Summer Lee. Lee won by less than a percentage point. Summing up lessons learned from the campaign in an episode of the podcast Bloc Party (5/24/2022) Justice Democrat Campaign Director Geoff Simpson stated

The biggest lesson we can take away from this is there is very little margin for error if we are going to get millions of dollars spent against us on the Left. And it took the whole Left throwing down for Summer in order to get her across the line... That is what it is going to take in future races all of us working together to defeat the other side that has an endless bank account. They can spend unlimited amounts of money... On what can we do better?... The Left ... needs to commit earlier in races. Early money is worth so much more than getting money in the last two weeks. It allows you to build campaign infrastructure. It allows you to plan out how you are going to spend those dollars talking to voters across the different mediums that are available. We need the Left to get in sooner on races and invest early and that is going to make us more successful at the end of the race...

Facing our current reality is terrifying. It is understandable that as individuals and communities we struggle with isolation and hopelessness and focus on day-to-day survival and distractions to get by. After two and half years of the pandemic and a criminally negligent corporate and government response people feel disheartened and alienated.

But our private lives are not a respite from reality. We are living through a pivotal moment in human history. We are responsible to our children's children's children to organize a united liberation movement despite the odds. The antidote for our collective existential fear is a mass unified organizational plan to defend democracy and to force the implementation of known technical solutions to the climate and nuclear war catastrophes. Victory will be found in mass institutionalized solidarity.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxhcHJvZ3Jlc3NpdmUuY29tL3Byb2dyZXNzaXZlLWlzc3Vlcy90aG9tLWhhcnRtYW5uLWFwb2xvZ2l6ZXMtZm9yLXJlcHVibGljYW4tb25zbGF1Z2h00gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Thom Hartmann Apologizes for Republican Onslaught,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='news.google.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /articles/CBMiYmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxhcHJvZ3Jlc3NpdmUuY29tL3Byb2dyZXNzaXZlLWlzc3Vlcy90aG9tLWhhcnRtYW5uLWFwb2xvZ2l6ZXMtZm9yLXJlcHVibGljYW4tb25zbGF1Z2h00gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen (Caused by NewConnectionError('<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x000002185C606830>: Failed to establish a new connection: [WinError 10051] A socket operation was attempted to an unreachable network')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxhcHJvZ3Jlc3NpdmUuY29tL3Byb2dyZXNzaXZlLWlzc3Vlcy90aG9tLWhhcnRtYW5uLWFwb2xvZ2l6ZXMtZm9yLXJlcHVibGljYW4tb25zbGF1Z2h00gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen"

Tribune-Review

Electricity bills in Pennsylvania are increasing sharply this summer driven in large part by a tight market for natural gas industry experts say.

The boost in electric rates has come as air ­conditioning units are cranked up for the summer.

That makes it a good time for Pennsylvania residents to explore online tools that can help them determine whether they could save money by switching the company that supplies their electricity.

“The vast majority of electricity is generated by the burning of natural gas — on the wholesale energy market where all of our utilities get their electricity” said Pennsylvania Consumer Advocate Patrick Cicero. “When the natural gas price increases it has a direct effect on the price of electricity and natural gas prices are up right now.”

With the U.S. shipping more liquefied gas overseas as a result of the war in Ukraine the natural gas supply has not kept up with demand Cicero said.

“Like most Pennsylvanians I am concerned with the impact that rising energy prices have on consumers’ ability to afford their electricity bills” he said. “The wholesale marketplace where all the utilities are going is high and it’s going to remain high at least for the rest of this calendar year.”

PTC adjusted several times a year

According to the Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission default service rates for residential consumers who don’t shop for a specific competitive electricity supplier jumped by as much as 45% last month.

Utilities typically adjust that default service price or Price to Compare (PTC) either twice a year or quarterly. The PTC includes costs for generating electricity and transmitting it to the local utility’s distribution system and accounts for between 40% and 60% of a consumer’s total electricity bill depending on the utility and the consumer’s power usage.

“The other part of your bill goes to your utility to maintain the poles the wires and the infrastructure that get the energy to your home or your business” PUC spokesman Nils Hagen-Frederiksen said. “Those rates stay constant for years at a time” triggering a lengthy investigation by the PUC if a utility wants to make a change.

West Penn Power’s PTC increased as of June 1 by 44.6% up from 5.67 cents per kilowatt-hour to 8.2 cents. That means the utility’s typical residential customer using 750 kilowatt-hours of electricity will see their monthly bill rise from $74.91 to $93.89 — an overall increase of about 25%.

West Penn Power spokesman Todd Meyers said the increase should be reflected in July bills for customers who don’t shop independently for an electricity supplier.

“The Price to Compare increased due to increases in the cost of natural gas and other commodities used as fuel to generate power” said Will Boye spokesman for West Penn Power parent FirstEnergy. “We purchase electricity through a competitive auction process and do not profit when the Price to Compare increases due to higher purchased power costs.”

The utility’s PTC will be subject to adjustment again Sept. 1.

Hagen-Frederiksen said it is too soon to speculate what may happen with PTC figures in September. “When we have a clear idea what those energy prices are going to be we will reach out to consumers” he said.

West Penn Power’s June 1 price is in line with or cheaper than rates charged by many other utilities operating in the state. MetEd’s new PTC is about 7.9 cents per kilowatt-hour representing a 16% increase while PPL’s rate is up by about 38% from 8.9 cents per kilowatt-hour to 12.3 cents.

For Duquesne Light customers a range of three PTC rates has increased by a little more than 17% to 9.36 cents per kilowatt-hour for standard residential service and respective rates of 8.23 cents and 8.87 cents for homes where electricity is the primary energy source for space heating and for homes that have an add-on heat pump.

Duquesne Light won’t adjust its PTC rates again until December.

The company “competitively bids the energy supplied through the default service rate to secure the best prices possible for customers” spokeswoman Ashley Macik said. “DLC encourages customers to evaluate all options when it comes to the supply portion of their bill.”

Seeking a supplier

Looking for a competitive electricity supplier instead of relying on the default price offered by the utility is one option consumers can explore to seek savings.

“Folks need to be careful to make sure that they know the product terms fees and variability of their energy contract if they choose to shop for an alternative (electricity) provider” Cicero said.

According to the PUC competitive suppliers must provide customers an easy-to-read one-page summary of the electricity contract.

Cicero suggests consumers mark the end of the contract on their calendar so they have ample time to weigh electricity supply options before that date arrives.

He also recommended using online tools at either of two state websites when comparison shopping for electricity.

More than 100 licensed suppliers are listed at papowerswitch.com the PUC’s official site for comparing electricity prices.

Saving just one cent per kilowatt-hour could translate to more than $100 a year in savings depending on power usage the PUC notes.

The Pennsylvania Office of Consumer Advocate also offers online resources for comparing electricity suppliers at oca.pa.gov/electric-shopping-guide.

There are third-party consultants that might offer to help consumers sort through offers from electricity suppliers. Authorities urge caution when customers actually pay their electricity bills through a third party; consultants that provide that service must be licensed by the PUC.

As an alternative to comparing competitive supplier offers residential electricity consumers may check with their utility to see if they can sign up for a standard offer program. If so the consumer will receive a fixed rate for one year at a 7% discount from the utility’s Price to Compare.

According to the PUC the standard offer is “a win-win for the electric shopper and supplier alike. The customer wins with potential savings on electric generation over the course of a year with little or no risk while the supplier gains a new customer now actively participating in the competitive market.”

Consumers also may want to consider whether a supplier offers a time-of-use program charging a lower rate for electricity that is used during off-peak hours typically between 9 p.m. and 9 a.m. Shifting laundry or dishwasher loads to those hours can result in a savings under such a program.

MEMPHIS Tennessee — The Southland Mall in Whitehaven has sat dilapidated—looking partly abandoned for years.

Now a Starbucks plus other stores are opening at the first enclosed mall in the Mid-South.

Public Storage (Aug. 1) as well as Starbucks and AutoZone (early 2023) are confirmed to open at Southland Mall—all announced a year after a push for cleanup on the property.

Sears and Macy's the property’s previous two flagship stores vacated leaving over 30000 square feet empty.

Have you heard? Whitehaven's finally getting a @Starbucks at #SouthlandMall.



An AutoZone and Public Storage too. I spoke with an area restaurant owner who wants #Whitehaven to keep its economic momentum going. @ABC24Memphis pic.twitter.com/FM5Izc6dn2 — Rebecca Butcher 🦋 (@RebeccaB_TV) July 17 2022

""We cook with love on the spot—Whitehaven’s finest” Chef Precious Thompson Jones said.

It’s a momentous move for the historic Whitehaven neighborhood—one that businesses on Brooks Road are feeling. The restaurant that Jones owns Fabulous Flavors is no exception.

“This whole area was dead"" Jones said. ""All these businesses mostly were closed down. My food truck burnt up one night and I put on Facebook ‘God I need you to release me some land.’""

Chef Jones purchased the space for her restaurant on faith.

Soon after that post someone told her the whole building was on sale.

“I was like what? My husband just lost his job too and I was like 'are you ready to trust god with me?'”

So Jones poured her love of cooking into her new culinary endeavor.

The road to opening wasn’t easy.

“I’ve been a convicted felon since ’18"" Jones said. ""When I came home my first job was the Waffle House.”

The former Memphis City Schools cafeteria lady got into the Second Chance Program to get on her feet.

“I believe in giving other people chances because I got another chance and that was the best thing to ever happen to me—to lose my freedom” she said.

The entrepreneur said about new businesses coming to Southland ""It’s a blessing—Whitehaven coming up. More jobs—we need less crime.”

Chef Precious knows that first-hand.

Her restaurant was vandalized and burglarized multiple times.

“They bust my TVs they bust the doors they knocked my cameras down and he took him a drink of water.”

It’s an issue Whitehaven is seeing more of with a recent upswing in property damages and burglaries.

The Greater Whitehaven Economic Redevelopment Corporation is expanding grants to include exterior cameras. They will be plugged into MPD's network to solve more crime.

“We always need good cameras to catch photos of everything going on"" Jones said. ""The good parking lots—we need that as you can see we got holes in the parking lot. The signage falling off the building.”

The list goes on.

Jones said to keep new investments from pulling out security is needed.

""People want to feel safe"" she said. ""I have people calling me ‘like is it safe around there?’ Yes it’s safe.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiOWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZyZWV0aGluay5jb20vZW5lcmd5L3JlbmV3YWJsZS1lbmVyZ3ktc3RvcmFnZdIBP2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZyZWV0aGluay5jb20vZW5lcmd5L3JlbmV3YWJsZS1lbmVyZ3ktc3RvcmFnZT9hbXA9MQ?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Alternative batteries are solving the biggest problem in renewable energy,"This article is an installment of Future Explored a weekly guide to world-changing technology. You can get stories like this one straight to your inbox every Thursday morning by subscribing here.

Many of the cheapest cleanest sources of power are dependent on environmental conditions — turbines can’t spin if the wind isn’t blowing and solar panels can’t harvest energy if the sun isn’t shining (usually).

Fossil fuels don’t have that consistency problem — you can burn coal or natural gas at any time to produce electricity — so we rely on them for times when renewable energy isn’t available.

Storing renewable energy when the supply is high can accelerate the transition to a world powered by clean energy but traditional lithium-ion batteries — like the ones in your smartphone — aren’t perfect for this use.

Many of the cheapest cleanest sources of power are dependent on environmental conditions.

That’s because those batteries self-discharge meaning they’re constanting losing a bit of their stored energy. As a result we can only store energy in them for a few days or weeks — we can’t bank power captured in the windy spring and use it in the relatively still fall.

Lithium-ion isn’t the only kind of battery though.

Across the globe groups are using other types of batteries — some well established others brand new — for renewable energy storage. Here are a few of the alternative batteries helping the world decarbonize and transition to a more sustainable future — one grid at a time.

Water batteries

People have been using gravity to store energy for more than 100 years with pumped hydro storage systems or “water batteries.”

These systems require two lakes or reservoirs with one located at a higher elevation than the other.

When the grid has excess energy it’s used to pump water from the lower reservoir to the higher one. When more power is needed water from the upper reservoir flows down again which drives hydroelectric turbines.

The advantages: Water batteries are one of the cheapest ways to store energy in terms of kWh and we know they work — there are more than 150 already in operation and they accounted for about 95% of the world’s energy storage capacity in 2020.

That means we don’t need to worry about developing new technologies to use them for renewable energy storage and the US has enough technically feasible sites to double the amount of energy it stores in water batteries.

The drawbacks: Building water batteries is expensive and time-consuming and constructing one in a place with few changes in elevation or no natural reservoirs is particularly costly.

Massive water batteries also face problems common to a lot of megaprojects: delays and cost overruns. The world’s largest pumped hydro project Snowy 2.0 in Australia is six years behind schedule and will cost three times more than originally planned (not counting upgrades to the grid to accommodate it).

Efficiency is also a concern: you lose 15-30% of your energy to the cycle of moving the water up and back down again and some kinds of reservoirs (damming rivers for example) can disrupt natural ecosystems.

The latest: The Nant de Drance pumped storage power plant in the Swiss Alps became operational in July 2022. With a storage capacity of 20 million kWh — as much as 400000 electric vehicle batteries — it’s one of the most powerful water batteries in Europe (although just a fraction of the size of Snowy 2.0).

Developers dug more than 10 miles of tunnels to connect the Emosson and Vieux Emosson reservoirs for the water battery — in total the construction process took 14 years and cost $2.1 billion.

Sand batteries

Another way to store excess renewable energy is to trap it as heat in some material such as water volcanic rock or — the latest medium to be explored — sand in a well-insulated container.

When electricity is needed the heat from a sand battery can be used to boil water creating steam that spins turbines. The heat can also be distributed directly as heat keeping buildings warm in winter months and supplied with hot water year-round.

For some forms of clean energy such as wind power sand storage requires first converting electricity into heat but solar and geothermal energy can be directly captured as heat — no conversion required.

The advantages: Sand is cheap widely available and easy to store. It can also be heated to higher temperatures than other battery mediums such as water — with the right insulation it could go higher than 980 degrees Celsius (1800 degrees Fahrenheit).

Sand batteries could be built essentially anywhere — they can even be constructed underground to save land.

The drawbacks: Energy is lost when it’s converted from one medium to another so a thermal battery isn’t as efficient for generating electricity as it is for direct heating.

New technology could change this though — MIT recently unveiled a heat engine that converts heat to electricity more efficiently than a traditional turbine.

When the sand battery’s stored heat is used directly as heat it is 99% energy efficient.

The latest: The world’s first commercial-scale sand battery is now operational in Finland. The battery looks like a silo but instead of wheat it’s filled with 100 tonnes of sand that can be heated to 500 C (932 F) using excess solar and wind power.

The sand battery has a ​​8 MWh capacity (roughly equal to 160 electric vehicle batteries) but unlike lithium-ion EV batteries it can store that heat for months with little loss. When the heat it stores is used directly as heat — which it currently is — it is 99% energy efficient according to its maker Polar Night Energy.

Flow batteries

Compared to water and sand batteries flow batteries are a more technically complicated renewable energy storage solution.

They consist of two tanks of liquid electrolyte solution. In one tank the solution is positively charged and in the other it is negatively charged. These solutions are pumped into a cell where they remain separated by a membrane.

In this cell the chemical energy of the solutions can be converted into electricity and discharged or vice versa through a process involving electrodes and the movement of electrons and ions.

The advantages: Compared to their lithium-ion cousins flow batteries are less likely to catch fire and lose little storage capacity — even after thousands of cycles. Their self-discharge is low and when the flow battery isn’t in use it doesn’t lose any energy.

Flow batteries are easier to scale than lithium-ion batteries — instead of building more batteries all you need to do is increase the size of your tanks — and because they don’t rely on geography they can be installed in more locations than water batteries.

The drawbacks: Flow batteries are relatively new in terms of renewable energy storage — as of September 2021 global installed capacity was just 1.1 million kWh (~22000 EV batteries) — so they aren’t as proven as water batteries.

Flow batteries also have a lower energy density than lithium-ion batteries — you need large tanks to store a lot of energy in them — and most of them require vanadium a metal that is expected to increase in demand and cost.

The latest: In November 2021 MIT researchers published a paper detailing their creation of a new flow battery that replaces the traditional liquid electrolyte with a thicker jet-black substance that resembles molasses.

The recipe for this electrically conductive mixture doesn’t include vanadium and in testing it outperformed traditional vanadium flow batteries in terms of both performance and cost — ironically suggesting that the future of energy could rely on a black sludge just like the past.

Samsung may be abandoning its own chip for Galaxy S23

Samsung Electronics may be abandoning its own smartphone processor in favor of a Qualcomm Snapdragon chip the latest questioning of the company’s ability to design and manufacture advanced processors.Multiple analysts and tipsters are predicting that for the upcoming Galaxy S23 series set to be released early next year the company has chosen Qualcomm's Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 from Taiwan’s TSMC over Samsung's own Exynos 2300 the latest in the family of chips that have been at the heart of Galaxy smartphones since 2011.Ming-Chi Kuo an analyst at TF International Securities said that Qualcomm will likely be “the sole processor supplier” for Galaxy S23 models due primarily to lower-than-expected performance of the Exynos 2300.If Samsung was going to use Exynos for the S23 the specifications of the chipset should have been circulated by now.“Since the development of application processors precede the manufacturing of smartphones details of the Exynos 2300 should have come out this time for the launch of Galaxy S23 early next year” said Jeong In-seong a semiconductor specialist who authored ""The Future of the Semiconductor Empire.""“But no specifics yet and it seems that Samsung internally developed the Exynos 2300 and presented it to the smartphone business but the division decided not to use them” he said.Exynos-branded chips are designed by a division named System LSI and manufactured by Samsung Foundry.If true the move would be a break from the past practice of either mixing Exynos and Snapdragon chips depending on the region.Samsung Electronics declined to comment saying that such issues are kept secret until the official release of products.Industry insiders think there must be a significant performance disparity between Samsung's newest chip and the competing Snapdragon chipset because of a gap in manufacturing technique and architectural design.Qualcomm is considered to have superior processor design than Samsung Electronics'. On the manufacturing front devices with TSCM chips tend to perform better than those with Samsung-manufactured chips even though they are made in the same manufacturing node.“Even though the Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 is made using TSMC’s 4 nanometer process and the Exynos 2300 by Samsung Foundry’s 4 nanometer process there probably is a substantial difference in processing speed and energy efficiency” Jeong said.Qualcomm selected TSMC over Samsung Electronics for the production of its latest chipset after the Snapdragon 8 Gen 1 which was made by Samsung showed disappointing results.Samsung's big problem in manufacturing is lower production yields especially after it started using a relatively new lithography technology based on a range of extreme ultraviolet (EUV) wavelengths.The yield rate is the amount of a silicon wafer that is successfully made into dies which are themselves packaged to become semiconductors. The lower the yields the less product produced.Semiconductor experts believe that severely low yields can affect the overall quality of chips as well as the costs of production since they indicate that the manufacturing process has problems generating chips in accordance with the clients' designs.Although Samsung Electronics never officially releases its yield rates the chipmaker admitted in conference calls that it experienced challenges in ramping up yield rates for advanced manufacturing techniques such as 5 nanometer and 4 nanometer processes.Both the Galaxy S21 and S22 models faced complaints of overheating and lower-than-expected processing speed. The S21 line was powered by Exynos 2100 and Snapdragon 888 and the S22 by Exynos 2200 and Snapdragon 8 Gen 1.Exynos-powered Galaxy phones showed lower average scores in processing speed than the same Galaxy model with the Snapdragon chips according to several benchmarking test tools like Geekbench.The underperformance of recent Exynos chips prompted Samsung Electronics to gradually increase the volume of Snapdragon-powered Galaxy S models.In the case of the Galaxy S22s 70 percent of the units shipped had the Snapdragon chipset and the remaining 30 percent Exynos according to Kuo the analyst.Shipments of Galaxy phones equipped with Exynos processors totaled 83 million units in 2021 down 17.8 percent over a year earlier according to Korea Investment & Securities. That figure includes budget Galaxy A lines run by mid-range Exynos chips.The reduced adoption by Galaxy phones translated into a decline in market share in the global markets.“Samsung Exynos’ share declined in the first quarter of 2022 due to losing share to Qualcomm in the flagship Galaxy S22 series smartphones and due to the low yields of the 4nm premium Exynos chipsets” said market tracker Counterpoint Research in a report.Counterpoint Research said that Samsung Electronics commanded 7.4 percent market share in the global smartphone chipset market in the first three months lagging behind Qualcomm at 43.9 percent and Apple with 26.4 percent.In response to the recent fiasco Samsung Electronics is trying to revamp both its smartphone and chipmaking businesses.The tech giant recently launched a team dedicated to enhancing the performance of smartphone’s main processor according to local media outlets.The team brought together key engineers from the smartphone System LSI and foundry divisions to collaborate on the development of future processors optimized for Galaxy phones.Roh Tae-moon chief of Samsung Electronics smartphone business told employees in a meeting that the manufacturer considers making a main processor exclusively tailored for Galaxy models.The Exynos chips are not exclusively customized for Galaxys as they are supplied to Chinese vendors like Vivo.BY PARK EUN-JEE [park.eunjee@joongang.co.kr]",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTmh0dHBzOi8vY2hyb21ldW5ib3hlZC5jb20vc25hcGRyYWdvbi03Yy1wbHVzLWdlbi0zLWNocm9tZWJvb2tzLWluLWRldmVsb3BtZW50L9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Snapdragon 7c+ Gen 3 Chromebooks are now in development,"There’s been a ton of news surrounding the Snapdragon 8cx for Chromebooks in the past week but a new discovery in the Snapdragon 7c lineup also caught my attention recently as we uncovered the latest of these devices – ‘Evoker’ – hitting development cycle in the Chromium Repositories. As it showed up I began wondering once again if this device and others like it could possibly be built on the new Snapdragon 7c+ Gen 3 that Qualcomm announced back in December of last year.

Up to this point I’ve only had a suspicion that this was the case. After all when you look at the code names of the processors in Snapdragon Chromebooks (SC7180 and SC7280) it feels like it is clear that the 7180 is the 7c Gen 1 and the 7280 would be the 7c Gen 2. However as we pointed out in the post about ‘Evoker’ that logic isn’t so clear-cut. We’ve seen Chromebooks launch with baseboards built on the SC7180 containing the Snapdragon 7c Gen 2 and not a single one of them used the SC7280-based boards like ‘Herobrine’ ‘Hoglin’ Villager’ ‘Senor’ or ‘Evoker’. With that info alone I had a gut feeling that the SC7280 must instead be the Snapdragon 7c+ Gen 3 but I had no solid evidence of that until now.

A bit of confirmation for the Snapdragon 7c+ Gen 3

As I was looking for some proof that the SC7280 is somehow linked to the Snapdragon 7c+ Gen 3 I finally came across something quite interesting: a commit adding NVMe support for SC7280 boards. This made me a bit curious and after seeing it I began searching for this feature in the Snapdragon 7c and 7c Gen 2 product listings from Qualcomm. And to my surprise neither of those SoCs supports it.

With that in mind I then looked a bit deeper into the Snapdragon 7c+ Gen 3 spec listing and you can likely guess what I found there: NVMe support as a new updated feature. With the clear lack of support for this faster higher-end storage option in the Gen 1 and Gen 2 of the Snapdragon 7c it seems pretty clear at this point that the addition of NVMe for the SC7280 boards in the Chromium Repositories points to those boards being the new Snapdragon 7c+ Gen 3.

Why there may be internal naming confusion

So why the naming confusion? I don’t know this as fact but I can wager a guess as to why this happened. You see the SC names are generally for internal use. Perhaps when Qualcomm decided to put out the Snapdragon 7c Gen 2 they were going to call it the Snapdragon 7c+ like they do with their other chips. Most of their flagship phone SoCs get a “plus” version during the year that keeps most of the cores in place and just raises the clock speeds. This is exactly what the 7c Gen 2 is: a 7c with higher clock speeds.

For some reason however Qualcomm chose to put this small bump out into the world as a full generational upgrade in the Snapdragon 7c Gen 2 and most likely the internal code name for what was already in the works as the next evolution of the 7c (the 7c+ Gen 3) was simply left as SC7280. So that would mean that internally the naming for these SoCs would have been SC7180 for both the Snapdragon 7c and what should have been the 7c+. Gen 2 likely was slated to be what the 7c+ Gen 3 has become and instead of going back to rip out internal code names they just left it as-is.

advertisement

Either way I feel quite confident that the devices being built right now in the SC7280 group are all likely to be equipped with the Snapdragon 7c+ Gen 3 and that is exciting. This chip should show a marked improvement in speed over the existing 7c Chromebooks on the market and should do so with great battery life too. With the Snapdragon 8cx on the way more MediaTek Chromebooks in the pipeline and these upcoming 7c+ Gen 3 devices around the corner the ARM-based Chromebook race is really just beginning.

A crazy rumor out of Korea emerged in May alleging that Samsung would skip high-end Exynos processor launches in 2023 and 2024. It’s quite the claim as it would mean Samsung’s Galaxy S23 and S24 would exclusively use Qualcomm Snapdragon silicon.

Veteran analyst Ming-Chi Kuo has since partially echoed this claim asserting that the Galaxy S23 is likely to use Snapdragon power only. That would be a major turn of events for Samsung which has used a dual-sourcing approach for its Galaxy S flagships for years. But there are several reasons why this could be a good thing.

Reason 1: One Galaxy flagship to rule them all

Robert Triggs / Android Authority

Perhaps the most important argument in favor of a Snapdragon-only Galaxy S23 series is that it would give consumers one version regardless of where they bought the device.

Users in Europe the Middle East India and Africa have traditionally received the Exynos variant — although only Europe got an Exynos Galaxy S22 this year. This has been a major downer in years when the Exynos chipset was inferior meaning that consumers in these regions were getting a less powerful phone for a similar price if not higher.

The Exynos-powered Galaxy flagships have typically lagged behind Snapdragon variants in terms of horsepower and developer support.

Even when the Exynos variant was comparable in terms of sheer power Samsung’s chipsets still lagged behind in other areas such as gaming support. We saw a clear example of this when Diablo Immortal was released as the game had severe issues on Exynos models ostensibly due to a lack of developer support. This isn’t necessarily Samsung’s fault but Qualcomm silicon is usually a priority for many developers. Issues like these are rare and quickly fixed if they occur on a Snapdragon chip.

We’ve also seen minor differences between Exynos and Snapdragon versions when it comes to photo and video quality. DXOMark reports that the Exynos Galaxy S22 Ultra was edged out by the Snapdragon variant in most scenarios bar video quality and low-light telephoto image quality.

So switching solely to Snapdragon silicon for the Galaxy S23 series should mean users in traditional Exynos regions would finally be getting the same phone for their money. And there doesn’t seem like a better time to make this decision than now.

Reason 2: This could be a one-sided war in 2023

There’s reason to suspect that a Qualcomm and Exynos showdown in 2023 would result in a massive defeat for Samsung’s silicon.

The Snapdragon 8 Gen 1 and Exynos 2200 used in this year’s S22 series are both manufactured by Samsung but our own testing showed that Qualcomm pulls ahead of the Exynos 2200 for GPU performance. The results are closer when looking at sustained performance though. Related: Samsung Galaxy S22 benchmarked — Snapdragon 8 Gen 1 versus Exynos 2200

However Qualcomm is switching back to Taiwan’s TSMC to manufacture the latest Snapdragon 8 Plus Gen 1 — the mid-year refresh of the standard Snapdragon 8 Gen 1. If Qualcomm’s claims are to be believed this could be its most impressive mid-cycle upgrade yet with 30% efficiency gains over the standard 8 Gen 1 and a ~10% boost to CPU and GPU clock speed. The efficiency claim is particularly impressive since the company doesn’t usually emphasize it with mid-year chips. These gains are mostly borne out in the real world too as the ROG Phone 6 Pro delivered better benchmark results than Snapdragon 8 Gen 1 phones most of the time.

All of this suggests that TSMC offers superior manufacturing capabilities compared to Samsung’s foundry. Furthermore various rumors indicate that Qualcomm is sticking with TSMC for the Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 chipset which would put it ahead for another year.

Analyst Ming-Chi Kuo echoed similar sentiments a few days ago claiming that Samsung might not adopt the Exynos 2300 for the Galaxy S23 because it can’t compete with the next-generation Snapdragon SoC. He asserted that the Exynos chipset would be made on a Samsung 4nm process while the Snapdragon chip would be made on TSMC’s 4nm process.

But could this simply be a case of Qualcomm making a better chipset rather than a demonstration of one foundry’s manufacturing supremacy over another? Well we do have one more piece of evidence.

The Galaxy S20 series is widely acknowledged to have been a low point for the Exynos line as the Snapdragon 865 handily beat the Exynos 990 in benchmarks (particularly GPU tests). Curiously — or not — the Qualcomm chipset was manufactured by TSMC back then while the Exynos 990 was made by Samsung.

This isn’t necessarily a smoking gun but it sounds like Samsung’s Exynos line might be in for a similarly huge drubbing if we got both Exynos and Snapdragon Galaxy S23 phones next year.

Reason 3: No more worrying about feature parity

Robert Triggs / Android Authority

By going for a Snapdragon-only Galaxy S23 line-up Samsung wouldn’t need to worry about feature parity. We’ve seen it happen several times over the years when Samsung has to ditch a cool feature offered on one variant because the other variant doesn’t support the same capability.

One prominent example was the Galaxy S8 series officially missing out on 4K/60fps recording because the Snapdragon 835 lacked it. Similarly the Galaxy S10 series missed out on 8K recording even though the Exynos 990 supported it as the Snapdragon 865 didn’t offer it. The Galaxy S22 series also seems to miss 8K HDR functionality because the Exynos 2200 doesn’t support it.

Samsung wouldn’t need to worry about feature parity if there was only one version to begin with. And this also opens the door for the Galaxy maker to take full advantage of Snapdragon capabilities such as 8K HDR recording.

Why skipping Exynos could be cause for concern

Supplied by Samsung

Despite the many potential upsides to a Snapdragon-only Galaxy S23 series there are still a few potential downsides to such a move.

Perhaps the most pressing concern is the ongoing global chip shortage. It seems like the worst might be over for now but the decision to go with one chipset means that Samsung won’t have any flexibility if Qualcomm or TSMC run into production issues. Worst-case scenario? Samsung might not be able to bring the Galaxy S23 series to some markets or these regions could receive limited stock.

Another potential concern for a Snapdragon-only future is that Samsung might see price pressure from Qualcomm. The Snapdragon maker could theoretically charge top dollar for these chips putting pressure on Samsung to maintain its profit margins by increasing the cost of the Galaxy S23 range.

There’s also the possibility that the Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 turns out to be a major disappointment leaving fans with no alternative model if they still want to stick with the Galaxy S23 range. Then again smartphone makers tend to get their hands on chips way ahead of time giving them some wiggle room to switch to an alternative processor if need be. A clear precedent for this was the Galaxy S6 range: Rumors circulated prior to launch that Samsung had dropped the Snapdragon 810 for the Exynos 7420 due to overheating issues with the Snapdragon silicon.

A Snapdragon-only Galaxy S23 series could also stop Samsung from implementing some advanced hardware features if the Snapdragon chip doesn’t support it. We already talked about Exynos chips occasionally supporting some video quality options before the equivalent Snapdragon SoC offered them. But we’ve also seen Exynos silicon support features like AV1 decoding and hardware-based ray tracing before Snapdragon processors. Fortunately it seems like the former is a lock for the Snapdragon 8 Gen 2.

The benefits likely outweigh the downsides

Robert Triggs / Android Authority

Despite these concerns regarding a Snapdragon-only Galaxy S23 range there are clearly numerous potential upsides to the situation.

For one consumers in Europe could finally get a phone with the same performance as models in other regions. This would also mean the same support for gaming and camera quality across all variants as well as the same feature-set without artificially holding one variant back.

Either way it certainly seems like 2023 could be a very interesting year for fans of Samsung smartphones. But here’s hoping that the rumors are true and Samsung is indeed working on something almighty for 2025.

We have seen this new mid-range chipset in phones like the Moto Edge 30 and Nothing Phone 1. On the other hand the Snapdragon 870 is more than a year old nine months older than the Snapdragon 778G Plus. We have seen this chip in newly launched mid-range phones like the iQOO NEO 6 POCO F4 5G and the realme GT Neo 3T. But how do these two chips compare to each other? Let’s find out in this post.

Snapdragon 778G Plus vs Snapdragon 870 Comparison

1. CPU Performance

Let’s start with the performance’s most crucial part of any processor. The Snapdragon 778G Plus comes with an 8-core architecture which includes 1x 2.5 GHz – Kryo 670 Prime (Cortex-A78) core 3x 2.2 GHz – Kryo 670 Gold (Cortex-A78) cores and 4x 1.9 GHz – Kryo 670 Silver (Cortex-A55) efficiency cores. The CPU here is clocked at 2500 MHz. It is based on a 6nm fabrication process which is more power-efficient when compared to the 7nm fabrication process on the Snapdragon 870.

The Snapdragon 870 features an 8-core architecture with 1x 3.2 GHz – Kryo 585 Prime (Cortex-A77) core 3x 2.42 GHz – Kryo 585 Gold (Cortex-A77) cores and 4x 1.8 GHz – Kryo 585 Silver (Cortex-A55) efficiency cores. The CPU has an advantage over the Snapdragon 778 Plus as it is clocked higher at 3200 MHz. This makes the Snapdragon 870 a clear winner regarding CPU performance. However things aren’t too dark for the Snapdragon 778G Plus. It performs almost similarly in day-to-day usage.

2. GPU Performance

As for the GPU the Snapdragon 778G Plus comes with the Adreno 642L GPU clocked at 500 MHz. On the other hand the Snapdragon 870 has a more powerful GPU the Adreno 650 which is clocked higher at 675 MHz. There is no conflict that the Snapdragon 870 has the better GPU performance. For instance the Snapdragon 870 performs almost 30% better than the three Snapdragon 778G Plus regarding gaming performance.

3. Benchmarks

If you’re into benchmark scores here are a few benchmarks from some of the most popular benchmark apps.

On AnTuTu 9 the Snapdragon 778G Plus scores 5791 comparatively less than the 684672 on the Snapdragon 870. The Snapdragon 870 beats the Snapdragon 778G Plus in all aspects whether CPU GPU memory or UX. The Snapdragon 870 scores 18% higher than the Snapdragon 778G Plus.

On GeekBench 5 the Snapdragon 870 scores higher than the Snapdragon 778G Plus in single-core and multi-core performance. The Snapdragon 870 precedes the 778G+ in single-core by 22% and in multi-core by 14%. The Snapdragon 870 scores around 1000 in single-core and 3380 in multi-core whereas the Snapdragon 778G Plus scores 815 and 2941 in single-core and multi-core respectively.

On 3DMark Wild Life the Snapdragon 870 performs 58% better than the Snapdragon 778G Plus. 3D Mark is a cross-platform benchmark app that tests the GPU performance of a device.

It should be no surprise that the Snapdragon 870 beats the Snapdragon 778G Plus in terms of performance in both CPU and GPU departments.

Snapdragon 870 is a flagship-grade chipset from Qualcomm. In contrast the Snapdragon 778G Plus is more of a mid-range chipset with high performance. The only edge that the Snapdragon 778G Plus has over the Snapdragon 870 is that it is built on a more power-efficient 6nm architecture compared to the 7nm on the Snapdragon 870.

4. Display & Camera Support

As for display support the Snapdragon 778G Plus can go up to FHD+ @144Hz. On the other hand the Snapdragon 870 can go higher up to 4K @60Hz or QHD+ @144Hz. Both the processors are HDR10 and HDR10+ capable.

As for the cameras or video recording the Snapdragon 778G+ can record and playback videos up to 4K at 30FPS. The Snapdragon 870 takes it a notch further by being able to record and playback 8K at 30FPS and 4K at 60FPS videos. Moreover the Snapdragon 870 can also record videos directly in Dolby Vision which the Snapdragon 778G Plus cannot.

5. Connectivity

Both the processors are 5G capable but the Snapdragon 870 has the edge over the Snapdragon 778G Plus (X53 5G modem) due to the more advanced X55 5G modem. The download and upload speeds on the Snapdragon 870 are better as well. The download speed on the Snapdragon 870 is more than 2X higher than that of the Snapdragon 778G Plus. As for the upload speeds it is around 33% better. The Snapdragon 778 Plus has an advantage in the Wi-Fi department as it supports Wi-Fi 6E instead of the Wi-Fi 6 on the Snapdragon 870.

Which One is Better?

The answer to this question is straightforward: the Snapdragon 870 is the better one. It is better in terms of performance display or cameras. However the Snapdragon 778G Plus has a better architecture based on a 6nm fabrication process making it more power-efficient. Also it is nine months younger than the Snapdragon 870 which means better reliability in the future.

If you want the best performance for your buck go for the Snapdragon 870. Otherwise the Snapdragon 778G Plus performs very well and has advantages. It should also be noted that Snapdragon 778G Plus phones are more affordable than the Snapdragon 870 ones.",,,

JACKSONVILLE Fla. – Florida Gators quarterback Anthony Richardson said in a statement on Sunday that he will no longer use the nickname “AR-15″ because it shares similarities with the weapon often used in mass shootings.

The nickname comes from his initials and his jersey number 15.

Richardson said he doesn’t want to be associated with the high-powered rifle that has been connected a number of mass shootings in the country. The gunman in the deadly mass shooting at Robb Elementary in Uvalde Texas for example reportedly used an AR-15-style rifle.

The 21-year-old quarterback who is expected to become the starting quarterback for the team this fall said he also plans to rebrand a clothing line that used his now-former nickname.

Richardson tweeted a statement that read:

“After discussions with my family and much thought I have decided to no longer use the nickname ‘AR-15′ and the current apparel line logo which features a scope reticle as part of my branding. While a nickname is only a nickname and ‘AR-15′ was simply a representation of my initials combined with my jersey number it is important to me that my name and brand are no longer associated with the assault rifle that has been used in mass shootings which I do not condone in any way or form. My representatives and I are currently working on rebranding which includes the creation of a new logo and transitioning to simply using ‘AR’ and my name Anthony Richardson.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiX2h0dHBzOi8vbmV3cy5za3kuY29tL3N0b3J5L25hc3N0YXItb3duZXItcHJlcGFyZXMtNTAwbS1zYWxlLW9mLWNsb3VkLXNlcnZpY2VzLXByb3ZpZGVyLTEyNjUzOTE10gFjaHR0cHM6Ly9uZXdzLnNreS5jb20vc3RvcnkvYW1wL25hc3N0YXItb3duZXItcHJlcGFyZXMtNTAwbS1zYWxlLW9mLWNsb3VkLXNlcnZpY2VzLXByb3ZpZGVyLTEyNjUzOTE1?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Nasstar-owner prepares £500m sale of cloud services provider,"The owner of one of Britain’s biggest providers of managed cloud services is to begin exploring a £500m-plus sale of the business.

Sky News understands that Mayfair Equity Partners has hired investment bankers to prepare a review of strategic options for Nasstar.

City sources said on Sunday that Raymond James had been appointed to oversee the review.

A sale process is expected to take place next year with interest anticipated from strategic buyers and financial investors.

Nasstar designs implements and manages hybrid connected multi-cloud solutions and communication platforms for enterprise and public sector customers.

Clients include Eurostar the NHS EE and the Ministry of Defence.

People close to the company say it has been playing an important role in clients' transition to digitally led operations as they adapt to hybrid-remote working.

Estimates suggest that the global public cloud computing market is worth close to $370bn and is expected to grow rapidly until the end of the decade.

Last year Nasstar recorded £114m in revenue and £22.1m in earnings before interest tax depreciation and amortisation with the latter nearly doubling from the prior year - driven by a string of acquisitions and the launch of additional services.

Mayfair's original investment in the group now called Nasstar took place in 2018 when the private equity firm led a management buyout of GCI Group from chairman Wayne Martin and the bank-backed Business Growth Fund.

Since then the business has become a broader technology services provider buying Modality in 2019 Nasstar the following year and KCOM's national ICT Services business in 2021.

Two years ago Wayne Churchill a former Easynet Group executive joined Nasstar to lead its transformation.

The company now employs more than 1000 people.

Mayfair's preparations for a sale of Nasstar follow a flurry of deals in the broader industry including Version1's sale to Partners Group for £675m and Providence Equity Partners' acquisition of Node4 for roughly £300m.

The company's latest official test tries to make the case for the A750 against Nvidia's midrange GPU but many questions remain as both companies and AMD prepare to launch new cards in the second half of this year.

This week Intel published a brief benchmark of its upcoming Arc A750 graphics card claiming it compares favorably with Nvidia's RTX 3060 in a few popular games. Previous Arc benchmarks both official and unofficial have been mixed thus far.

The primary title Intel tested in its video (above) is Cyberpunk 2077 but it also showed comparisons for Control F1 2021 Borderlands 3 and Fortnite. All the comparisons show the A750 performing about 15 percent better than the 3060. Intel's card manages around 60 frames per second in Borderlands Control and Cyberpunk at 1440p using the high graphics preset. F1 and Fortnite run well north of 120fps.

However the comparison doesn't mention image reconstruction – another area where Intel wants to compete with Nvidia. All the tested games except Borderlands support Nvidia's DLSS which would likely give the 3060 much higher framerates. Currently none are on the list of games planning to feature Intel's XeSS. Only Cyberpunk and F1 support AMD FSR.

The other Arc GPUs are also set to compete with Nvidia's entry-level and mainstream cards but some tests have been disappointing. Official A730M and A770M benchmarks put them close to the RTX 3050 Ti and 3060. The A770 is supposed to match the 3070 Ti but tests in April showed markedly worse results possibly owing to incomplete Intel drivers. Last month an early review of the budget A380 was even more dismal.

While Intel's graphics cards are still only available in China and South Korea the company maintains that it plans to launch them in other markets later this summer. Nvidia and AMD will each launch a new generation of GPUs later this year which will likely further outperform Intel's products.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiU2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZXZlcmdlLmNvbS8yMDIyLzcvMTYvMjMyMzIyMTcvaW50ZWwtYXJjLWdwdS1hNzUwLXNldHRpbmctZXhwZWN0YXRpb25z0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Intel is setting expectations low for its Arc GPUs,"Intel’s tempering expectations for its upcoming Arc A750 Limited Edition GPU. In a new video that’s just three minutes long the chipmaker gives us the briefest of glimpses at the card’s pretty average on-paper performance.

Before we dive in it’s important to note that the A750 is supposed to be one of Intel’s top-of-the-line GPUs as indicated by the “7” at the front of its name. Intel’s naming conventions have the Arc 5 and Arc 3 sitting below the Arc 7 which are supposed to offer midrange and entry-level performance respectively.

During the video Intel’s Ryan Shrout boots up Cyberpunk 2077 on a PC with the A750 chip installed and instead of giving us a long look at gameplay Shrout skips straight to performance. With the game set to the “high-quality” preset and 2560 x 1440 resolution Shrout says the card gets “just under” 60 frames per second (FPS) on average which isn’t bad but not necessarily what you’d expect from a company like Intel’s debut into discrete graphics cards.

Intel’s Arc A750 performs 1.06 to 1.15 times better than the standard RTX 3060. Image: Intel

Shrout shows off benchmark tests next revealing how well the card fares against the entry-level Nividia GeForce RTX 3060. The Intel Arc A750 performs 1.06 to 1.15 times better than the standard RTX 3060 on games like Cyberpunk 2077 F1 2021 Control Borderlands 3 and Fortnite. But these benchmark tests come with an asterisk — Shrout points out that “the performance of Arc won’t look like this in all games” and describes the test as “a great view of what Arc is capable of with the right game enablement and software engineering.” (Not to mention that these tests weren’t performed by an independent party.)

Obviously it’s impossible to tell how a card really performs until we try it out for ourselves but this first look offered by Intel isn’t exactly mind-blowing. Intel’s Arc A750 GPU is set to launch later this summer but Intel has already released its A370M and A350M mobile GPUs in a few different notebooks as well as the entry-level Arc A380 desktop GPU in China (which is supposed to hit the global market later this year).",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMib2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnR3ZWFrdG93bi5jb20vbmV3cy84NzQzNC9zaW1wc29ucy1oaXQtYW5kLXJ1bi1yZW1hZGUtaW4tdW5yZWFsLWVuZ2luZS01LXdpdGgtcnR4LWVmZmVjdHMvaW5kZXguaHRtbNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Simpsons Hit and Run remade in Unreal Engine 5 with RTX effects,"Talented programmer Reuben Ward is remaking Simpsons Hit and Run in Unreal Engine 5 with RTX graphics AI upscaling and more.

The result is absolutely glorious...but you won't ever get to play it. Ward has no plans to release the files for viewers or fans.

Ward was able to import Simpsons Hit and Run world files directly into Unreal Engine matching up the textures as well to give Springfield its signature stores shops and locales--Kwik-E-Mart Lard Lad Donuts the Power Plant etc. Then Ward was able use AI upscaling on all the textures in the game (there's about 1400 of them) sharpening everything from signs to buildings and roads. A ton of custom shaders later reubs was able to make the world pop more than it ever had on the PS2 and Xbox versions.

Then came the vehicles and a GTA-style character switching system that lets you swap directly to another Simpsons character--from Marge to Homer to Apu for example.

The remake project actually stretches as far back as 2021...and we definitely recommend checking out the videos in their entirety.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiemh0dHBzOi8vd2NjZnRlY2guY29tL252aWRpYXMtZmFzdGVzdC1uZXh0LWdlbi1ncmFwaGljcy1jYXJkLWZvci0yMDIyLXRoZS11cGNvbWluZy1nZWZvcmNlLXJ0eC00MDkwLWdldHMtc3VwcG9ydC1pbi1haWRhNjQv0gF-aHR0cHM6Ly93Y2NmdGVjaC5jb20vbnZpZGlhcy1mYXN0ZXN0LW5leHQtZ2VuLWdyYXBoaWNzLWNhcmQtZm9yLTIwMjItdGhlLXVwY29taW5nLWdlZm9yY2UtcnR4LTQwOTAtZ2V0cy1zdXBwb3J0LWluLWFpZGE2NC9hbXAv?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,NVIDIA’s Fastest & Next-Gen Graphics Card For 2022 The Upcoming GeForce RTX 4090 Gets Support In AIDA64,"Popular diagnostic tool AIDA64 has now added support for NVIDIA's fastest and next-gen graphics card of 2022 the upcoming GeForce RTX 4090.

AIDA64 Adds Support For NVIDIA's 2022 Flagship The GeForce RTX 4090 Graphics Card

The NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4090 will be the green team's flagship offering this year replacing the RTX 3090 which launched almost two years ago. Since the graphics card has most of its device id & info leaked out already AIDA64 decided to support it within its latest BETA version (6.70.6033) which is available here.

The utility states that it has added 'GPU information for NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4090 (AD102)' but it does not say what the particular information is. It is very likely that initial device parameters have been added. The software is the first to add such support even before GPU-z. The GeForce RTX 4090 specifically has the 'NVIDIA_DEV.2684' PCI ID. Following are the release notes for the latest version of AIDA64:

SMTP / support for TLS v1.2

GPU information for AMD Radeon Pro W6600 (Navi 23)

NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4090 'Rumored' Specifications

The NVIDIA GeForce RTX RTX 4090 graphics card is expected to be powered by the top AD102-300 GPU but it is only the 'Ti' variant that will feature the full chip. The Geforce RTX 4090 will utilize a slightly cut-down configuration.

The NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4090 will use 128 SMs of the 144 SMs for a total of 16384 CUDA cores. The GPU will come packed with 96 MB of L2 cache and a total of 384 ROPs which is simply insane. The clock speeds are not confirmed yet but considering that the TSMC 4N process is being used we are expecting clocks between the 2.0-3.0 GHz range.

As for memory specs the GeForce RTX 4090 is expected to rock 24 GB GDDR6X capacities that will be clocked at 21 Gbps speeds across a 384-bit bus interface. This will provide up to 1 TB/s of bandwidth. This is the same bandwidth as the existing RTX 3090 Ti graphics card and as far as the power consumption is concerned the TBP is said to be rated at 450W which means that TGP may end up lower than that. The card will be powered by a single 16-pin connector which delivers up to 600W of power. It is likely that we may get 500W+ custom designs as we saw with the RTX 3090 Ti.

The graphics card is expected to launch in October 2022 and will be followed by the rest of the Ada Lovelace GPU-powered lineup of graphics cards.

The suit dated July 7 was filed in Montgomery County Circuit Court by family members of Mabel Amos who served as Alabama Secretary of State from 1967 to 1975 al.com reports.

According to the lawsuit the board trustees benefited personally ""using the funds in the Trust to educate their children at out-of-state expensive colleges and were not in financial need while members of Amos’ immediate family were in financial need.""

The suit seeks to remove Regions as the trustee bank and require it to pay back all distributions to the trustee children.

The suit also calls for compensatory and punitive damages.

Amos' will established a memorial trust in her name with Union Bank which eventually merged with Regions.

According to the lawsuit Regions began charging ""outrageous"" fees when oil was discovered on Amos’ property in contrast to ""reasonable"" fees when there were only natural gas wells there.

In the suit the plaintiffs claim that Regions was paid about $7000 for spending five hours a week administering the trust in 2010.

Within a year that same five hours a week cost $92736. From 2002 to 2018 the suit claims the trust paid more than $1 million in administration fees to Regions.

The number and dollar amount of scholarships also increased from $21794 through five scholarships in 2011 to $214000 among 17 scholarships two years later.

Notices about today’s 11 a.m. final service for the Disciples of Christ body of believers at 850 Tipton Lane even have referenced such an upbeat perspective.

And a closing note in the bulletin to be distributed at the fond farewell mentions the importance of carrying “the hope of the resurrection” into the future.

“It’s bittersweet” said the Rev. Lanny Lawler the church’s pastor from 2004 to 2015 and one of today’s scheduled speakers for the expected 90-minute service. “You have memories of a lot of good times and memories of the overall legacy that the church has contributed. And that legacy continues.

“But it’s always sad when a congregation closes its visible ministry.”

Nance Aurand-Humpf chair of the church’s board acknowledged that emotions have been rather raw. She joined the 67-year-old church in 2002 when weekly worship attendance remained a fairly stable 115 people per Sunday.

“I think that we’ve all been grieving since February” she said referring to the time of the decision to disband after the congregation shrunk to fewer than 30 people. “But I think that we now have found our way to acceptance.”

Yet she figures there clearly will be tears amid the gathering. The church’s past and even its very formation hearkens to a day when community leaders J. Irwin and Xenia Miller were among not only this city’s more visible champions of racial harmony and equality but also representatives of that and more nationwide. The Millers figured prominently into the church’s social justice footprint according to the church’s history and past leaders such as Lawler.

The former pastor mentioned that the prominent couple’s groundwork along with the efforts of many others helped pave the way years later in 2014 for North Christian to officially become what is known as an “open and affirming congregation” — welcoming people from the LGBTQ population into all elements of membership and leadership. In fact Lawler considers that move to be perhaps the highlight of his ministry at the church.

That came to complete fruition when Pastor Tonja Gerardy a member of the LGBTQ population was named North Christian’s minister several years ago.

Just as the towering 192-foot-high spire of the Eero Saarinen-designed celebrated structure reaches optimistically and symbolically skyward so its worshippers have aimed in their history to reach upward toward equality and inclusiveness for all. And they began such in 1955 on the cusp of the civil rights movement and at the dawn of more women moving into the workplace and even into leadership roles there and soon in communities nationwide.

“The church has consistently been led by pastors who defined their mission as serving both their congregation and their larger communities and who carried out ambitious social justice goals through advocacy cross-sector collaborations and interfaith partnerships” wrote New York City architect Bryony Roberts in a church history report compiled for the prestigious Getty Foundation Grant application in 2019.

The church’s own history records show that the 43 members who left First Christian Church downtown to form North Christian in October 1955 did so to be more inclusive of women and minorities to be strongly ecumenical toward other believers and to actively promote more diversity. Plus they also wanted the new church to be less “socially restrictive” as leaders put it since First Christian leadership at the time strongly advised against activities such as card playing and dancing.

Yet in a push for peace positivity and grace North Christian members carefully and publicly stated that the growing and developing north side of Columbus needed a church to serve the people. That seemed true enough at the time as other denominations began planting churches there.

The 1964 building itself on the National Register of Historic Places is currently being considered for the possibility of programming space for the Bartholomew County Public Library. But library leaders have said that decision possibly could be more than a year away.

Former members say they face uncertainty too. Their basic question: where to worship now?

Joy Kraft Lawler a North Christian elder and an ordained minister herself finds herself wrestling with that question.

“I don’t know where I will go to church next” she said. “But I feel strongly called to be a Disciple (of Christ).”

When architect Saarinen was asked in spring 1964 how long a just-built church should last he told the North Christian elders it should be “for generations” according to a story in The Evening Republican.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiuAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5zdGx0b2RheS5jb20vbGlmZS1lbnRlcnRhaW5tZW50L2xvY2FsL3dlbGxuZXNzL2EtaHVnZS1kaXNhc3Rlci1zdC1sb3Vpcy10cmFzaC1jb21wbGFpbnRzLW9uLXBhY2UtdG8tc2V0LWEtcmVjb3JkLXRoaXMteWVhci9hcnRpY2xlXzI2ZWJlOTA0LWY5NWMtNWI1Yy04YzZlLTllMTM2N2Y0YzljZC5odG1s0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,'A huge disaster': St. Louis trash complaints on pace to set a record this year,"ST. LOUIS — It was a garbage month for trash collection here in June.

An understaffed division buckled amid a seasonal surge in demand coupled with a new mandate to restart recycling service. Dumpsters across the city were left untouched and overflowing for weeks. And residents let City Hall know it flooding social media and aldermen’s voicemails with their frustration. Reams of complaints followed.

“This is a huge disaster” said Alderman Joe Vaccaro who represents Lindenwood Park and other southwestern neighborhoods.

Mayor Tishaura O. Jones has largely been quiet on the issue. But her spokesman Nick Dunne said she cares deeply. In recent weeks the administration has sent out crews on weekends and ramped up maintenance to keep trucks on the street.

“The mayor and other folks in the administration check in on this every single day” Dunne said. “We know that city residents want service they can rely on.”

Last week Jones put trash commissioner Todd Waelterman on leave.

Two days later the mayor a prolific voice on the social media service Twitter tweeted her first substantial comments on the issue: “We are working overtime to improve reliability of our refuse service” she wrote. “Thank you in advance for your patience.”

In the past two weeks the grumbling has dipped some.

Still the 4700 complaints of overflowing containers and missed trash pickups through June mark a new high for the city putting it on pace to shatter annual records. And it comes at a tough time: The city is already struggling to fix a 911 center that puts callers on hold and an ambulance service that arrives late to emergencies.

“It adds yet another item to a long list of reasons that people don’t want to live in the city” said Alderman Tom Oldenburg who represents St. Louis Hills and other southwestern neighborhoods.

If it doesn’t get better fast observers say elected officials from the top down can expect consequences.

“Nothing irritates the citizenry more than the city failing in basic services” said Ken Warren a political scientist at St. Louis University. “Complaints can rise and politicians can lose.”

‘You can’t go to Disneyland’

St. Louis has had problems with trash for a while. Five years ago the problem was the trucks: The city lacked the money to keep the fleet up to date and on some days nearly half of it was out of commission. A trash fee hike fixed that but then last year a labor shortage hit.

By July the city was throwing out recycling with the trash in much of the city in an effort to catch up on understaffed routes. Residents who still wanted to recycle had to take items to drop-off facilities themselves.

In August City Hall started offering a $3000 hiring bonus to attract new employees but even that couldn’t close the gap. At the same time new hires could get a $5000 hiring bonus from Waste Management Inc. which provides trash services to cities in St. Louis County.

So in late May when the administration announced plans to restart recycling collection after months of complaints from some residents the crews weren’t ready. The division was still about 10 drivers short of the 50 it needed to run smoothly.

And within weeks aldermen were hearing it from residents and telling city staff they were sacrificing one service for another.

Streets Director Betherny Williams denied those allegations and assured aldermen that trash was her employees’ No. 1 priority.

But Randy Breitenfeld the deputy refuse commissioner conceded the recycling restart came at the “absolute worst time” as trash volumes were spiking at the start of summer. And he didn’t have to tell residents:

They could smell it all over.

Complaints rained down in neighborhoods from Penrose to Patch. Gravois Park resident Amanda Price reported going three weeks without pickup. Shaw resident Mike Duffy a developer watched trash fill every dumpster in his alley pile 4 feet high on top of that and then spill out into new piles around it. Dana Liljequist a chef who lives in Dutchtown said a visitor told him his alley looked like a war-torn Beirut. “I don’t know what they’re doing with our money” he said.

Dawn Butler of the West End said she often calls the city about trash and workers tell her they’ll be there when they can. Bulk pickup is even worse she said. “There’s a running joke around here that you have to call them to let them know you have trash and then call them again to remind them” she said.

By late June aldermen were calling for a halt to the recycling restart to focus on fixing the trash problem.

“Sometimes you have to resist political pressure and tell people some hard facts” Alderwoman Sharon Tyus who represents Wells-Goodfellow and other northwestern neighborhoods told city staff in a hearing. “When daddy loses his job you can’t go to Disneyland.”

A ghost story

Williams the streets director didn’t cancel the new recycling pickup. She told reporters the day after the hearing that crews had begun working seven days a week and that mechanics would soon begin a second shift to get through a truck maintenance backlog.

But Vaccaro said he didn’t see the point of paying so much overtime when people could take recycling to collection points throughout the city. “They just need to make trash the priority” he said.

Alderman Christine Ingrassia whose ward runs from Midtown to Tower Grove East said the city had to raise wages if it wanted to see improvement. “We aren’t paying people enough for them to be loyal” she said.

Duffy the Shaw resident argued the city should just get out of the business.

“There’s a market-based solution to this” he said. “If we don’t want to do that then we should just fold and let the county take us over.”

Dunne the mayor’s spokesman said recycling isn’t the problem wages are under negotiation and privatization isn’t really an option — the city uses special trucks to pick up alleyway dumpsters he said and contractors don’t have the same equipment.

Besides those contractors have had their own struggles of late. Officials in Ferguson and St. Louis County said Republic Services had trouble staffing routes there last month an issue echoed in cities large and small across the country.

City Hall is however considering changes. It’s trying to figure out which parts of the city generate the most — and least — trash. Then it could send more trucks to places that generate more trash. “We’re hoping to identify some opportunities where we can be more efficient” Dunne said.

But that could be politically perilous: Early results from a city study showed that many of the lower-yield areas would be on the less populous north side whose voters helped make Jones the first Black woman to be St. Louis’ mayor.

But failing to find a long-term solution to the mess could be equally dangerous. There’s an old ghost story in politics about a mayor in Chicago Michael Bilandic who couldn’t clear the streets after a snowstorm in the 1970s. He promptly lost reelection.

It was one of the first things that came to mind for former Alderman Joe Roddy who left office last year after more than three decades in office.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiggFodHRwczovL3d3dy5hemNlbnRyYWwuY29tL3BpY3R1cmUtZ2FsbGVyeS9zcG9ydHMvbmZsL2NhcmRpbmFscy8yMDIyLzA3LzE2L3Bob3Rvcy1hcml6b25hLWNhcmRpbmFscy1zdW1tZXItZGF5LXNlcnZpY2UvMTAwNzg5MTUwMDIv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Photos: Arizona Cardinals Summer Day of Service,"Photos: Arizona Cardinals Summer Day of Service

None of this makes much sense. Barcelona remains over $1 billion in debt. It must cut its annual wage bill by $144 million to satisfy La Liga’s stringent financial regulations. It has announced the signings of two players it has not yet been able to register while it sorts out the budget. And yet somehow Barcelona has gone ahead and decided to spend a reported $50 million on a player who turns 34 next month who had only one year left on his contract and was desperate to leave his previous club.

That Robert Lewandowski is a brilliant footballer can hardly be doubted. He has scored 312 goals over the past 12 seasons in the Bundesliga. In 78 Champions League games for Bayern Munich he scored 69 times (including two against Barcelona in last season’s group stage and one vs. Barça in the infamous 8–2 quarterfinal drubbing in 2020). He is the model of the modern center forward as he is mobile happy dropping deep and attacking from wide and lethal in front of goal. He can head and he can press. Had he not been a near-contemporary of Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo he would probably have won multiple Ballons d’Or. As it stands he has won the last two FIFA Best Men’s Player awards.

And he is a young 33. He is clearly supremely fit. His nutritionist wife famously has him eat dessert before the main course which apparently helps the body burn fat more efficiently. As evidence goes Lewandowski would seem like a pretty convincing case study. Age hits all players eventually—even Ronaldo began to slow in his mid-30s—but Lewandowski should have at least a couple more years at somewhere near his peak. In his eight seasons at Bayern he missed just 23 games through injury.

But Lewandowski’s quality is hardly the issue. When Joan Laporta succeeded Josep Bartomeu as Barcelona president in 2020 his prime job seemed to be sorting out the finances of the club. Barcelona was blessed with a raft of talented young players—Gavi Pedri Ansu Fati Sergiño Dest Riqui Puig among them—who it seemed might provide a cost-effective exciting largely locally based core that could tide the club over as budgets were trimmed. If things got really bad a couple might have been sold. When Ferran Torres now 22 was picked up from Manchester City for €55 million ($62 million at the time) with the potential to rise to €65 million it seemed like a more ambitious move but one rooted in the same logic: Buy young develop and then potentially sell on.

Lewandowski does not fit that model. He will have no resale value. He will almost certainly improve Barcelona but it’s very hard to see how a signing of his heft could be considered a priority given the club’s financial instability. Barça could already select a forward line from Ansu Fati Torres Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang Memphis Depay and Ousmane Dembélé (the latter’s contract has just been extended when releasing him would have been an easy way of reducing the wage bill) and that was before a $58 million deal was agreed upon for Leeds United’s Brazilian star Raphinha. And as Lewandowski arrives Barcelona is trying to force Frenkie de Jong out despite owing him $17 million in wages he deferred during the pandemic (and it’s not clear at all that de Jong is the only player in that situation).

Barcelona even seems aware of how dreadful this all looks at least if you believe the story in El País that the fee for Lewandowski is actually $60 million with Barcelona agreeing to pay extra to force the deal through in return for silence about the additional $10 million.

This summer seems like an enormous gamble for Barcelona. Perhaps some argument can be raised that Lewandowski is as near a sure thing as any transfer ever is. His acquisition reinforces a message of business as usual. But amid the greater amount of spending this summer it seems entirely unjustified. Barcelona hopes to be able to afford it by selling percentages of future television revenues and nearly half of the company it set up to run its marketing. Mortgaging the future though is a very dangerous approach. It feels as though Barcelona is rolling the dice on some kind of European Super League being established sometime soon (with a case currently going through the European courts to test whether UEFA is abusing a monopoly position) which in theory could present a cure to its financial woes and render any current concern moot.

And this seems like a risk for Lewandowski too. His relationship with Bayern—always businesslike rather than especially warm—is clearly fractured beyond repair. He wanted to get out and he has often spoken of his desire to play in La Liga. Clásicos featuring him and Karim Benzema would boast a new layer of appeal. But he must know what a risk this is and what he forced his way into. And perhaps that is part of the lure. After eight years of easy league titles at Bayern perhaps the challenge of resurrecting Barcelona is what he needs.

On the pitch Barcelona is building a squad that could be fascinating to watch this season. Off of it though meltdown feels worryingly close.

Going thrift shopping is always an adventure. You never know what you might find while digging through a bargain bin of shoes or a barrel full of backpacks and belts. If you’re lucky you might even stumble upon a piece of artwork that’s worth displaying in your home. And even if you don’t think any of the pieces are up to par yet you might be able to give a painting new life by adding your own flair to it.

In fact there is a whole community of people who are skilled at finding old pieces of artwork and giving them upgrades. Let me introduce you to the Repaintings subreddit. This group is dedicated to “repainting and transforming thrift store paintings” and as you'll soon see some of the members are incredibly talented. We’ve gathered a list of some of our favorite repaintings that have been shared in the group down below so you can see what all of these creative individuals are capable of doing with simple second hand finds. Be sure to upvote the paintings that inspire you the most and then if you’re interested in checking out even more we’ve got another Bored Panda piece on the same subreddit for you to view next right here.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTGh0dHBzOi8vYmxlZWRpbmdjb29sLmNvbS9jb21pY3MvbWFydmVscy0xMi1wcmV2aWV3LWFsbHMtd2VsbC10aGF0LWVuZHMtd2VsbC_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Marvels #12 Preview: All's Well That Ends Well?,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://bleedingcool.com/comics/marvels-12-preview-alls-well-that-ends-well/ on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTGh0dHBzOi8vYmxlZWRpbmdjb29sLmNvbS9jb21pY3MvbWFydmVscy0xMi1wcmV2aWV3LWFsbHMtd2VsbC10aGF0LWVuZHMtd2VsbC_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiRWh0dHBzOi8vYmxlZWRpbmdjb29sLmNvbS9jb21pY3MvaXJvbi1tYW4tMjEtcHJldmlldy11bmZyaWVuZGx5LXNraWVzL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Iron Man #21 Preview: Unfriendly Skies,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://bleedingcool.com/comics/iron-man-21-preview-unfriendly-skies/ on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiRWh0dHBzOi8vYmxlZWRpbmdjb29sLmNvbS9jb21pY3MvaXJvbi1tYW4tMjEtcHJldmlldy11bmZyaWVuZGx5LXNraWVzL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMia2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoaXNpc21vbmV5LmNvLnVrL21vbmV5L21hcmtldHMvYXJ0aWNsZS0xMTAyMDI0Ny9CZXRoLUJ1dHRlcndpY2stdGFraW5nLUppZ3Nhdy1icmFuZC1sb3ZlZC5odG1s0gFvaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cudGhpc2lzbW9uZXkuY28udWsvbW9uZXkvbWFya2V0cy9hcnRpY2xlLTExMDIwMjQ3L2FtcC9CZXRoLUJ1dHRlcndpY2stdGFraW5nLUppZ3Nhdy1icmFuZC1sb3ZlZC5odG1s?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Beth Butterwick taking Jigsaw back to brand she loved,"Focused: Beth Butterwick joined as the pandemic struck

Beth Butterwick is blunt about what she found when she arrived at Middle England favourite Jigsaw. She had been asked to help revive the business by super-rich backer and Carphone Warehouse founder David Ross. Meeting him over coffee in late 2019 was enough to convince her it was an opportunity she couldn't pass up.

'I came to fix the product and return Jigsaw to what it was' she says of the label that famously once employed the Duchess of Cambridge.

'I'd got a long-standing love for the brand. It was my go-to shop for work clothes when I started at Marks & Spencer as a graduate trainee in the 1990s. Jigsaw was all about classic pieces but with a very edgy style that always had a twist' she adds.

'That's what it had lost. It had blended in with other high street retailers. It had become very homogenised' she adds.

Butterwick 56 agreed to parachute in as an emergency turnaround consultant. But within a few months of her arrival the pandemic struck.

Painful decisions were needed quickly. Its men's and kids' ranges were axed the international business mothballed and more than a dozen stores closed – leaving just over 40.

'If you are being ruthless you have to stop doing things that aren't working' says Butterwick who has since accepted the chief executive's job.

It has retreated from Birmingham Manchester London's King's Road and Wimbledon – places that tend to be the haunt of younger shoppers more obsessed by price.

It has emerged with a more focused sense of its place in the world she says. 'We have very few in city centres now. We're in market towns and regional centres – where customers tend to be local shoppers that go there a lot.'

It will now sharpen that strategy even further with stores in Brighton Market Harborough in Leicestershire St Albans in Hertfordshire which she describes as a place 'we came out of but should be there' and the Surrey towns Reigate and Cobham plus somewhere in Manchester or the North West to appeal to the 'Cheshire set'.

Her 'heartland customer' is aged over 50 she points out. Many are younger but she cites her 19-yearold daughter as someone for whom Jigsaw may not be an affordable option.

The Celestial Bouquet Tea Dress will set you back £175 while £120 is needed for a pair of casual platform trainers – now the uniform of 'Chiswick mums' that she sees near her West London home aged 'from 60 down to 35' taking a break from the home or office to pick children up from school.

Clearly regarding these as potential customers she says: 'It's a comfort thing. People have got used to wearing comfortable shoes.'

Butterwick who has run retailers such as Bonmarche and Karen Millen says her job is to know the customer in 'intimate detail'. That very obviously means a well-to-do middle-aged shopper rather than chasing 20-somethings obsessed by Instagram sweeping through shopping centres or online retailers looking for the best bargains.

Her customers live by the motto 'buy less buy better' she says. 'Fit and fabric is important – cashmere silk and linen.

'They invest in classic pieces that tend to last for years then build out their wardrobe from there.'

Her shoppers are 'stylish and confident modern and relevant' but as likely to find style tips in magazines and 'talking to friends' as they are on Instagram.

'They're not slavish to social media' she adds.

Recent figures suggest the revival is gaining traction. Jigsaw reversed a £21million loss in 2020 to a £1.2million profit last year.

The recent sunshine brought with it a 'feelgood factor' helping to defy warnings of a consumer squeeze.

She says: 'People are still catching up on the going out thing. There is such a backlog of weddings festivals and parties – all these wonderful summer events that we British so thoroughly enjoy.

'I've been to Ascot and Henley recently and it's been incredible.'

The end of summer may see the beginning of a 'bounceback' for smarter office attire as the drift back to the office continues – a further step away from the preferred pandemic jogging pants and even the 'Chiswick Mum' uniform.

She adds: 'I can't say that people will come back from school holidays in September and it's all going to switch back to normal. But we can see searches for more formal shoes growing.

'I think from September and into October there will be more of a normalisation.

'When I speak to people at more corporate businesses accountancy firms for example their teams are now slowly going back into the office' she says. From her own perspective the shift has already paid off.

'There's only so much you can get done on [Microsoft] Teams. You get more done in an office.

'It's really difficult for new starters to get the feel for the culture of a business – and get the mentorship you can give them – if they are working remotely.'

During Covid design samples had to be biked across London to the houses of Jigsaw staff for approval. It slowed the design process she says. 'We craft product in here' she says sitting in the Kew office in West London.

'We make decisions more quickly if we're all here in the same place looking at the same thing together than if we're passing samples through the post or on Teams calls.'

Butterwick says the fallout from high street chains going bust has left room for the remainder to grow. 'Some massive businesses have gone so I think make hay while the sun shines.' She estimates there are more than three million consumers that fit the Jigsaw customer profile but not yet shopping there.

She also wants to relaunch its overseas operation which embraces Scandinavia Northern Europe America and Australia.

This week it will begin a partnership with luxury rental and re-sale website My Wardbrobe HQ styled as 'Jigsaw Forever'.

It will mean customers can rent or subscribe to its collections and re-sell their old 'pre-loved' Jigsaw clothes burnishing its credentials as a brand for the long-term.

Is Jigsaw in good shape to weather a consumer squeeze this autumn as interest rates and household bills rise?

'I saw some research recently that suggested the most popular search terms online have gone in the last four months from being 'best' to 'cheap'' she says.

'It will be interesting to see what happens in October when energy prices go up again.'

'But when I go back to what our core customers want: less is more quality over quantity. A few nice pieces with multiple uses [for different occasions and outfits].'

'If that's the sentiment at the moment that actually stands us in good stead for the future. Our work in hand is to tell more people about what we stand for.'"

In addition to an extra LNG-powered Oasis-class vessel in 2024 the company will get a new three-ship class starting in 2023.

Here’s the complete list of ships currently on order for Royal Caribbean International:

Ship: Icon of the Seas

Debut Date: Fall 2023

Capacity: 5600 guests

Tonnage: 200000

Status: Under construction in Finland

As the first vessel in a brand-new class the Icon of the Seas is currently under construction at the Meyer Turk shipyard in Finland. Set to become one of the biggest of the fleet the 5600-guest cruise ship will debut in late 2023.

While further details about the LNG-powered cruise ship and its deployment are yet to be announced Royal Caribbean revealed in April that the Icon is poised to debut in the Caribbean.

Ship: Utopia of the Seas

Debut Date: Q2 2024

Capacity: 5714 guests

Tonnage: 231000

Status: Under construction in France

Currently being built at the Chantiers de l’Atlantique shipyard in France the Utopia of the Seas is set to enter service in 2024.

Following the Wonder of the Seas the 5714-guest vessel will become the sixth in a series of ships known as the Oasis Class. Powered by LNG the Utopia is also expected to assume the title of world’s largest cruise ship.

Ship: Icon Class II

Debut Date: Q2 2025

Capacity: 5600

Tonnage: 200000

Royal Caribbean’s orderbook also includes a sister to the Icon of the Seas. To be built at the Meyer Turku shipyard the LNG-powered vessel is poised to enter service in Q2 2025.

Ship: Icon Class III

Debut Date: Spring 2026

Capacity: 5600

Tonnage: 200000

Status: Planned

In 2019 Royal Caribbean firmed an order for a third vessel in the Icon series. Also being built at the Meyer Turku shipyard the 5600-guest ship will welcome its first guests during 2026’s spring.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNydXplbHkuY29tL2NydWlzZS1zaGlwLWNvdmlkLXN0YXR1cy10cmFja2VyLWRhaWx5LXVwZGF0ZS1jaGFydC1uZXdzLWFuZC1wb3NzaWJsZS1jYXNlcy_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Cruise Ship COVID Status Tracker (July 16): Daily Update Chart & News,"Note: As of July 18 the CDC is no longer operating its voluntary Covid-19 program for cruise ships. This includes no longer updating the daily color status of ships. As such we are no longer able to update this page. If you have questions regarding cases on a ship you are sailing the CDC website says passengers “have the option of contacting their cruise line directly regarding outbreaks occurring on board their ship.”

As cruising returns it does so under dramatically different protocols than when trips were suspended back in March 2020. These new procedures are all designed to limit the number of cases on ships.

For cruise passengers that can create a number of questions. Is it safe to cruise? What are cruise ships doing to keep passengers healthy? Is there a way to track COVID cases on cruise ships?

Currently the Centers for Disease Control offers a voluntary program to follow for ships sailing in the United States (every major cruise ship is opted in). This includes everything from policies for testing crew members to what to do if there are cases on a ship to recommendations surrounding masking and distancing.

In addition the health agency publishes regular updates about the status of cases on cruise ships using a color-coded system. While it doesn’t provide actual case numbers it does tell the public which ships have possibly had bouts of the virus. This gives insight into what’s happening on all the ships either sailing or planning to sail from the United States.

Current Color Status of Ships

Below is the current status of all ships tracked by the CDC. While the CDC only provides the latest day’s update on its website we’ve included past days so that you can see how the status of each vessel changes. We continue to update this table regularly to track each ship’s status over time. The CDC releases new data each weekday.

Data from July 15 (posted July 16) shows 95 of 95 ships the CDC tracks have “non-green” status indicating the possibility of COVID cases during the past seven days. Keep in mind that the status changes from green with as little as one case.

Note: A status other than green does not definitively mean cases were found on the ship though it is most likely. “HV” stands for highly vaccinated cruise ship. More discussion of colors and vaccination status is covered in “What the Color-Coded Status Means” below.

Recent Updates and Commentary

Today 95 ships (100% of ships currently tracked) have “non-green” status. This figure has risen steadily in recent months. Currently cruising is seeing the lowest number of “green” ships since we began tracking — including during the Omicron spike.

Zero ships are green as of the latest update. Zero ships are yellow. Ninety-five have orange status:

– During the course of the CDC’s tracking the status of ships typically follows cases on land. The number of green ships bottomed and then rebounded sharply following the Omicron wave. However there has been a downturn in the number of green ships in recent months. From a recent peak of 58 green ships in mid-March the figure has fallen to zero vessels.

– The current count of zero green ships is lower than the previous low of nine ships during the peak of the Omicron wave. That doesn’t mean there are necessarily more total cases on cruise ships (case counts aren’t released) however more ships are being impacted.

Still at the moment 100% of cruise ships are orange meaning that all cruise ships tracked have possible Covid cases. We have not seen a green-status ship since late June.

– With the fall in the number of green ships Cruzely offered some commentary on what passengers should know surrounding cruises and Covid. For example case numbers could be higher than earlier in the pandemic however specific case numbers are not released. Meanwhile cases do appear relatively mild according to comments from cruise lines and health departments.

– Even with all ships having orange status we recently explained that protocols in travel — including on cruises — have trended toward being less restrictive. And while there is no definitive sign of it happening soon we did discuss if a relaxing of the testing requirement to sail might be on the horizon.

What the Color-Coded Status Means

The table above tracks roughly 90 cruise ships across more than a dozen cruise lines. Each day cruise ships can voluntarily submit the “Enhanced Data Collection (EDC) During COVID-19 Pandemic Form” to the CDC. This gives the agency insight into COVID or COVID-like illness on the vessel.

The agency then assigns one of four colors — green yellow orange and red — to each ship depending on the daily reports. The table is updated several times a week providing a simple color-coded way to see where there might be issues.

Updates to the Color Status

Previously the CDC’s color status varied from green to orange yellow then red. Starting in mid-February the new order is green yellow orange then red. The agency said the orange and yellow colors were switched “to go in a more logical color order.”

As well status now depends on the number of possible cases based on both passengers and crew. Previously cases among either passengers or crew could lead to a different color status depending on who was sick.

Now if there are cases but they are under 0.3% of combined passengers and crew on the ship then yellow status is given. Cases above 0.3% of those onboard (3 cases out of 1000 people onboard) earns orange status. Red is still available for higher spread.

Colors are assigned based on the number of possible cases and the ship’s current sailing status (sailing with passengers or crew only).

Green: No reports of COVID or COVID-like illness for seven days and on-time daily submission of EDC forms for the past week.

Yellow: COVID of COVID-like illness reported in the last seven days. If sailing with passengers the level reported is less than 0.3% of passengers and crew. If sailing with crew only then cases are less than 1% of all crew.

Orange: Cases for more than 0.3% of passengers and crew if sailing with passengers. If sailing crew only then cases reported in more than 1% of crew. Failing to submit a daily EDC report on-time also gives orange status.

Red: Sustained transmission of illness or the potential for cases to overwhelm medical resources on the ship. Failing to submit a daily EDC report also gives red status.

Gray: Indicates no data for the ship due to it choosing not to comply with the CDC’s voluntary program.

White (N/A): Ships that either have recently left sailing from the U.S. or have just arrived to sail from the U.S. We have marked the days before or after CDC tracking as “N/A” since there is no data. We remove the ship from the table 10 days after it is no longer tracked. This status is not an official color designation by the CDC but we use it to show which ships have recently arrived or left.

Vaccination Status for Ships

In addition to changing the color status the CDC also introduced different vaccination levels for ships to give the public more insight:

Not Highly Vaccinated (NHV): These are ships sailing with less than 90% of passengers and 95% of crew fully vaccinated.

Highly Vaccinated (HV): Ships with at least 90% of passengers and 95% of crew fully vaccinated but less than than those amounts considered “up to date” with their vaccines. “Up to date” means having a booster dose of the vaccine if eligible.

Vaccination Standard of Excellence (VSE): This new category encompasses ships that have at least 90% of passengers and 95% of crew “up to date” with their COVID vaccines meaning eligible passengers have a booster shot.

What Cruise Ships Are Doing to Keep Passengers & Crew Healthy

While cruise ships are linked to the early days of the pandemic they have taken extraordinary steps to limit the number of cases on board. In fact while cases have been reported regularly on ships the total numbers and spread appear to be small. Omicron did increase cases however.

To keep passengers healthy cruise lines are using vaccines and testing as the cornerstones of their plans. Ships sailing require vaccination for nearly all passengers who are eligible.

In addition to vaccines cruise lines require tests for all passengers before boarding in the United States even if they have the shot.

While some lines are allowing a small number of unvaccinated passengers sail more restrictions are usually placed on these guests. For instance multiple tests are required before and during sailing. Travel insurance is required in many instances. Some areas of the ship may be off-limits if a passenger doesn’t have the shot.

Already we’ve seen the protocols change to adapt to variants. There will be more changes in store depending on the direction of virus cases on land.

Is it Safe to Take a Cruise?

There is little doubt that unabated illness can spread in the close confines of a cruise ship. That said the measures taken by cruise lines and the CDC have helped to limit cases.

Royal Caribbean Group for example said toward the start of 2022 they had seen about 1.3 million passengers sail and reported 2500 cases among them (crew cases were not disclosed). That comes out to about 0.2%.

Still during the Omicron spike cases did rise on ships. Between December 15 and December 29 there were more than 5000 cases on ships tracked by the CDC according to The Washington Post citing CDC data. (The CDC typically doesn’t release case numbers.) We’ve also seen the number of ships with possible cases rise since March.

The protocols in place still seem to keep cases lower than what may be seen on land but all cruise ships right now appear to have cases onboard. Cases do seem to be more mild than with past variants. Still there has been a rise in the number of orange ships that is worth noting for people who are risk-averse.

There’s little argument that if there are cases on land — of which there are plenty — then there can be cases on ships. The good news is that with the mitigation efforts put in place by cruise lines these cases are also more likely to be found and contained especially compared to other places like sports stadiums airports or land-based resorts.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiW2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoaXNkYXlsaXZlLmNvbS9pbmRleC5waHAvMjAyMi8wNy8xNi93b25kZXItb2YtdGhlLXNlYXMtZmFtaWx5LWNydWlzZS1pbi1hdWd1c3TSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Wonder of the Seas Family Cruise in August,"The Silverbird Group sponsored cruise ship travel for July and August taking off from Barcelona Spain is about to go on sail. Group President Guy Murray-Bruce was in Barcelona to ensure all plans were on course. Nduka Nwosu who has been following the progress report since inception reports.

Excerpts:

The President of the Silverbird Group Guy Murray-Bruce flew into Barcelona recently to see things for himself on plans on ground to welcome cruise participants on the platform of the Silverbird Group.

Murray-Bruce joined other international executives and partners who were invited for a grand tour of the vessel-Wonder of the Seas and reports coming from Barcelona disclosed they were hosted to fine dining and dock at two islands during the weekend of May.

The tour allowed representatives of those who are confirmed for the holiday of July 24 and August 15th cruise a sneak preview of what to expect this summer. “If you have not made up your mind about the cruise perhaps this should convince you” adds Senator Murray-Bruice Chairman Silverbird Group.

According to the organisers on this exclusive sailing you will be among the first in Europe to experience the combination of all-new adventures and returning favourites designed to inspire wonder and awe in holidaymakers of all ages.

You will have access to a variety of experiences across Wonder’s eight unique neighbourhoods – a Royal Caribbean first.

Adds the team: “We are quietly tantalised by a thrill of entertainment: dining nightlife and more. There is the Mason Jar Southern Restaurant & Bar where Southern comfort food meets Royal Caribbean’s hospitality and creativity the new dining venue is the latest addition to the array of 40-plus restaurants bars and lounges on board.”

There is also the Wonder Playscape – the underwater-themed play area which is a whole new outdoor adventure for families with kids. slides climbing walls games interactive activities that come alive by touch imaginative puzzles and light shows that engage young travelers in more ways than one. Plus nearby is Royal Caribbean’s signature mini golf course Wonder Dunes with a new look and features.

There is Suite Neighborhood the new eighth neighbourhood which welcomes Royal Suite Class guests to a private Suite Sun Deck “which features a plunge pool and bar in addition to favourites such as an exclusive restaurant christened Coastal Kitchen the Suite Lounge and the grandest Ultimate Family Suite for a family of 10.

Showstopping entertainment includes “original productions and multimedia content which are front and centre on the four “stages” aboard Wonder – air ice water and theatre. “From Olympic-level high divers and slackliners to champion ice skaters and live musicians hundred performers technicians and cutting-edge technology come together to light up unparalleled venues like the open-air Aqua Theater and the Studio B ice-skating rink as well as hotspots perfect for live music performances such as Music Hall and the Cask & Clipper pub.”

Grand and heavenly designs expected of a cruise ship described as no other like it.

Murray-Bruce’s description of what to expect continues: “It is like you have concerts on steroids. You have entertainment for children; it is out of this world. You have a combination of everything you can imagine water parks theme parks the best food the best drinks; there are doctors and a clinic everything you can imagine. You are near to the port; you are going around the ocean stopping at different ports and countries every day. The take-off date is July 24 in Barcelona; it is for the world. However the next one would be solely African.

The July cruise is fully booked and take off date is 24th August looks good to accommodate more participants who are excited about the whole idea of a sea cruise down the Mediterranean and a few ports lying in idyllic cities and towns off the coast of Barcelona. The Wonder of the Seas cruise ship is an experience of a lifetime.

As Senator Murray-Bruce would say this is one opportunity you must not miss. “If you have never been on a cruise you are the one I am talking to it is an experience. Africans how do we relax? We work until we die whether as Africans or Nigerians. We do not have any kind of pleasure; we do not spend time with the kids; we do not spend time with our loved ones. I am saying seven days in an entire year in 365 days take some time off and spend quality time with your family and a cruise ship has every facility on planet earth.“

However the next one would be solely African in the sense that all the entertainment in the ship would be exclusively African music. This one would be a mix. The next one will be an all-African cruise but we are not sailing from Nigeria until we have a critical mass in terms of patronage or participation. This ship cost a few billion dollars to build. We are not going to bring a multibillion-dollar ship here and you cannot guarantee three to five thousand passengers.

You are not going to bring the most expensive ship in the world and you cannot guarantee a deal whose economics makes sense. So we are conducting a test from the Barcelona cruise to get as many Africans as possible. We will help you to process your Schengen visa. We will help you with the airline tickets to get to Barcelona. We are going to release the programme very quickly. You will come in there catch your flight and from the airport to the seaport. From there you get into the Wonder of the Seas to Barcelona and back to Barcelona. It will be seamless with no stress on your part. You are advised to apply early so that your travel plans and documents can be sorted out early enough. Adds Murray-Bruce: “You cannot apply one week before the cruise because it would be stressful. If you need to be assisted with a visa you have to apply right now.”

The stops and towns to look around and admire their historic beauty include:

Naples

Cruise participants would be opportune to visit Naples lying on the Bay of Naples close to Mount Vesuvius to see the wonderful art and architecture it hosts its cathedral the Duomo di San Gennaro adorned with frescoes the Royal Palace and Castel Nuovo built in the 13th century.

Marseille

At the port city of Marseille which lies in Southern France is Marseille a port city and home to Basilique Notre-Dame-de-la-Garde a Romanesque-Byzantine church. It is also home to the Swiss turned French citizen a father of modern architecture designer urban planner great painter and writer Charles Eduarde Jeanneret later known as Le Corbusier. His tourist attraction Cité Radieuse complex and Zaha Hadid’s CMA CGM Tower are must visits for many sightseeing tourists.

Palma

Palma a resort city lying in the capital of the Spanish island of Mallorca with its famous Santa María Cathedral whose architectural landmark is that of the medieval Gothic captures the interest of cruise travellers. There is also the fortress like architectural design called the Almudaina built in the style of a Morrish Arab fortress and now a royal castle which complements the beauty of ancient architecture such as the Beliver Castle.

Civitavecchia

Add this to Civitavecchia the coastal town in the northwest of Rome the artistic works of the great Michelangelo and the National Archaeological Museum and the tourist on a Wonder of the Seas ship cruise has so much to expect in this fun filled expedition.

As Senator Murray-Bruce would put it cruises are all over the world but the Wonder of the Seas offers you the ultimate in a sea cruise. “The one I sailed on was from Los Angeles to Mexico. I sailed with my mum and some of my siblings from Los Angeles to Mexico and back. So yes there are cruises everywhere but this one is special. It is the most expensive and the most luxurious cruise ever. I am not placing a target on numbers for now. I am looking at the experience. We want people to come back and tell us their story. That to me is more important.

“Come and tell us your story then next year we will put together a different kind of cruise. We will brand it differently every time we do it but do not forget the objective to get Africans back to the big ship. U told you story about my dad sailing from on

Kennedy Jr.'s claim that a worm ate his brain is most likely not accurate a parasite expert told BI. Mario Tama/Getty Images

Did a worm eat Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s brain?

The third-party presidential candidate said in a 2012 deposition that a doctor suggested a parasite hurt him.

We spoke to an expert who said a brain-eating tapeworm larvae would be impossible.

Brain-eating worms? Not likely.

A shocking report in The New York Times on Wednesday revealed that independent presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr. suggested in a 2012 deposition that doctors had found a dead worm in his brain.

In the court proceeding — part of his divorce from his second wife — Kennedy said that he had short-term and long-term memory loss according to The Times.

Kennedy said he had visited doctors in 2010 who thought he had a brain tumor but another doctor suggested that a dark spot on Kennedy's brain scan was ""caused by a worm that got into my brain and ate a portion of it and then died"" The Times reported.

Kennedy argued in the deposition that he couldn't make as much money due to his health and also revealed that he had mercury poisoning around the same time.

Kennedy has portrayed himself as the younger more healthy alternative to the other two men running for president Joe Biden and Donald Trump.

His campaign's press secretary confirmed that Kennedy was infected with a parasite 10 years ago and said it was resolved. His campaign told Business Insider that Kennedy is in ""robust physical and mental health"" and said questioning his fitness is a ""hilarious suggestion given his competition.""

But could a parasitic worm even cause that kind of damage? One medical expert told Business Insider that Kennedy's version of events doesn't quite add up.

Dr. Janina Caira a University of Connecticut professor and tapeworm specialist told BI that Kennedy's parasite sounds more like the larvae of a pork tapeworm.

That would be rare Caira said in an email. Humans can be infected with the adult worm by eating undercooked pork but can only be infected with the larvae after eating food or drinking water contaminated by the feces of someone with an adult tapeworm infection.

""This typically happens in areas with poor sanitation"" Caira said. ""So it is possible that he could have contracted the infection in South Asia if he came into contact with food or water contaminated with eggs of the tapeworm.""

But there's no way the larvae could have consumed Kennedy's brain tissue.







""Absolutely not"" Caira wrote.

She said the larvae don't have mouths or digestive systems. Instead they absorb nutrients through the surface of their bodies. While Caira said it is possible that a worm could do some ""mechanical damage"" to nearby brain tissue the larvae are very small and a single one ""would not cause much damage.""

That lines up with what experts who were skeptical of the details told The New York Times.

However Dr. Peter Hotez a pediatrician and global health advocate who is a professor of pediatrics and molecular virology & microbiology at Baylor College of Medicine wrote on X that ""neuroparasitic diseases"" and ""parasitic worms have a huge impact on the human brain.""

Hotez said the diseases are seen in poor populations with a ""surprising amount of illness"" in southern states and Texas. He said his team at the National School of Tropical Medicine is working on low-cost vaccines to prevent the conditions.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm55dGltZXMuY29tLzIwMjQvMDUvMDkvYXJ0cy90ZWxldmlzaW9uL2xhdGUtbmlnaHQtcmZrLWpyLXdvcm0uaHRtbNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Late Night Reacts to the Worm in R.F.K.

Food for Thought

“This explains everything and nothing” Stephen Colbert said on Wednesday.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWRhaWx5YmVhc3QuY29tL3N0ZXBoZW4tY29sYmVydC1tYXJ2ZWxzLWF0LXJvYmVydC1mLWtlbm5lZHktanJzLWJyYWluLXdvcm0tZGlhZ25vc2lz0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Stephen Colbert Marvels at RFK Jr.'s 'Brain Worm' Diagnosis,"“Let’s dig in” said The Late Show host Stephen Colbert at the start of his monologue “just like that worm did to RFK Jr.’s delicious frontal lobe.”

Colbert was responding to the news on Wednesday that Robert F. Kennedy Jr. once had a parasitic worm squirming around in his brain.

“Today The New York Times published some newly discovered health records for the independent presidential candidate” Colbert explained. “Turns out back in 2010 RFK Jr. went to a doctor because he was experiencing some cognitive symptoms like ‘memory loss and mental fogginess’ as well as a tiny voice in his head going ‘Let’s see what wine pairs best with cerebellum?”

For his impression of the worm Colbert chose the voice of Lowly from the ’90s cartoon The Busy World of Richard Scarry which received cheers of recognition from the audience.

It was a fitting reference given how the monologue was preceded by a cartoon clip called “The Amazing Adventures of Worm in Brain-Man” which parodied the Spider-Man theme song. “He’s got a worm in brain” the song goes “Insanity now explained!”

Colbert’s jokes at RFK Jr’s expense come after multiple monologues throughout the past year where he’s warned viewers not to trust (or vote for) the candidate. Colbert has criticized RFK Jr. for being a vaccine conspiracy theorist and for not even having the support of his own family.

Colbert summarized more of the Times’ reporting on the story explaining how “Bobby Jr. got a brain scan which showed an abnormality” which turned out to be the result of “a worm that got into RFK Jr.’s brain and ate a portion of it and then died.”

Colbert concluded “Cause of death? Starvation.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiY2h0dHBzOi8vdGhlaGlsbC5jb20vaG9tZW5ld3MvaG91c2UvNDY1MjA1MS1nb3AtcmVwLW1pa2UtY29sbGlucy1wb3N0LXJmay1qci1rZW5uZWR5LWFzc2Fzc2luYXRpb25zL9IBZ2h0dHBzOi8vdGhlaGlsbC5jb20vaG9tZW5ld3MvaG91c2UvNDY1MjA1MS1nb3AtcmVwLW1pa2UtY29sbGlucy1wb3N0LXJmay1qci1rZW5uZWR5LWFzc2Fzc2luYXRpb25zL2FtcC8?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,GOP rep links RFK Jr.’s brain worm to Kennedy assassinations,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 429 Client Error: Unknown Error for url: https://thehill.com/homenews/house/4652051-gop-rep-mike-collins-post-rfk-jr-kennedy-assassinations/ on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiY2h0dHBzOi8vdGhlaGlsbC5jb20vaG9tZW5ld3MvaG91c2UvNDY1MjA1MS1nb3AtcmVwLW1pa2UtY29sbGlucy1wb3N0LXJmay1qci1rZW5uZWR5LWFzc2Fzc2luYXRpb25zL9IBZ2h0dHBzOi8vdGhlaGlsbC5jb20vaG9tZW5ld3MvaG91c2UvNDY1MjA1MS1nb3AtcmVwLW1pa2UtY29sbGlucy1wb3N0LXJmay1qci1rZW5uZWR5LWFzc2Fzc2luYXRpb25zL2FtcC8?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMia2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnVzbmV3cy5jb20vbmV3cy9uYXRpb25hbC1uZXdzL2FydGljbGVzLzIwMjQtMDUtMDgvanVzdC1ob3ctY29tbW9uLWFyZS1icmFpbi13b3Jtcy1saWtlLXJmay1qci1z0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Just How Common Are Brain Worms Like RFK Jr.'s? | National News | U.S. News,"Back in 2010 years before he announced his current presidential campaign  Robert F. Kennedy Jr. was told the memory loss and mental fogginess he was experiencing might have been the result of a brain tumor according to a report by the New York Times.

The author and trial lawyer had consulted neurologists who found a dark spot in his brain scans. Ultimately a doctor from New York-Presbyterian Hospital suggested his condition “was caused by a worm that got into my brain and ate a portion of it and then died” Kennedy said in a 2012 deposition reviewed by the Times.

Kennedy 70 has marketed himself as a younger fitter choice for president  as he runs against President Joe Biden 81 and former President Donald Trump 77. Tweets of Kennedy doing push-ups shirtless in jeans went viral last summer.



The Kennedy campaign confirmed to U.S. News Wednesday that Kennedy did have a parasite but said it no longer impacts his health. “The issue was resolved more than 10 years ago and he is in robust physical and mental health” says press secretary Stefanie Spear. “Questioning Mr. Kennedy’s health is a hilarious suggestion given his competition.”

U.S. News caught up with Dr. Peter Hotez  professor of pediatrics and molecular virology and microbiology at Baylor College of Medicine to learn more about brain parasites including how they get into their human hosts and the symptoms they cause.

While Kennedy’s press secretary suggested the presidential candidate picked up the worm during his travels outside the United States Hotez who is also dean of the National School of Tropical Medicine at Baylor says there are two brain parasites that are “quite common” in America as well. “These diseases are not rare” he tells U.S. News.

The following interview has been edited for length and clarity:

How does someone end up with a parasite or worm in their brain?

One of the two diseases is called toxocariasis and the other one is called neurocysticercosis and they're transmitted slightly differently.



The Week in Cartoons May 6-10 View All 12 Images

In the case of toxocariasis these are diseases contracted ultimately from stray dogs and cats. What happens is those stray dogs and cats are infected with an intestinal roundworm called toxocara and that roundworm is producing thousands and thousands of eggs that contaminate the soil. The eggs are ubiquitous in the soil and around sandboxes or playgrounds or just in the dirt and kids – or adults – get contaminated with the dirt containing eggs swallow those eggs. And then the eggs hatch in the gut and they give rise to larvae worm larvae that migrate through the lungs. They can cause wheezing and asthma and they migrate through the brain to cause cognitive disturbances developmental delays and seizures. And it’s actually quite common in the United States and people don’t know about it.

Now the other one is called neurocysticercosis. It's typically a household member who's got a tapeworm that is in the gastrointestinal tract and segments of the worm are dropping off that contain the eggs and then the eggs are released into the environment. Then the eggs get dispersed you swallow the eggs and the same kind of thing happens.

Once that larval tapeworm is in the brain while it's alive it's actually almost not even recognized by our immune system or inflammatory system. It's living but it's silent. And it's not really feeding on brain tissue … but it's living there. And as that worm exceeds this natural lifespan in the brain then it dies and as it’s dying it loses its ability to camouflage itself from the host immune system. And you start seeing inflammation around it. And that's what triggers the seizures. So neurocysticercosis basically produces a seizure disorder.

How do parasites migrate to the brain?

The [toxocara] larvae that hatch out of the eggs in the gastrointestinal tract penetrate the intestinal lining and eventually get swept through the blood circulation and probably get carried to the brain through the blood. And the larvae are just a few millimeters in length but they can cause mechanical damage and they also elicit inflammation. And that's been shown to lead to kids’ developmental delays and seizures as well as in adults can cause cognitive disturbances.



The [tapeworm] larvae again can go through the gut lining and then make their way through the blood circulation to the brain.

What are the symptoms of having a parasite in your brain?

Neurocysticercosis can be clinically silent for years. And then oftentimes the first presentation is having a seizure. With toxocara it's oftentimes more subtle: developmental delays cognitive disturbances sometimes seizures. And there you have to have a high index of suspicion to think about doing the blood test for it.

Can you take steps to avoid these two parasites?

One is to be cognizant of your surroundings and know if you're living in an area that's known to be endemic. Clearly handwashing is going to be very important as a preventative step. In the case of toxocariasis it's controlling the stray dog and cat problem and/or deworming stray dogs and cats.

What areas are endemic?

(For toxocara) Brazil is a big big-time problem. It’s more in the Southern United States. Although we even found it in the Bronx as well.



Neurocysticercosis we see it in the Southern United States and Texas Southern California even. And typically it's (tied to) having another person in the home with this adult tapeworm.

What is the treatment for brain parasites?

Toxocariasis is treated through several days of a specific drug that kills the worm called albendazole. For just neurocysticercosis you need a much longer course of albendazole.

(With neurocysticercosis) eventually that worm dies and it becomes calcified. But the problem is it can still continue to trigger seizures. So oftentimes people who have neurocysticercosis have to not only go on anticonvulsants but they sometimes require going on treatment for anticonvulsants for years afterwards even though it's a dead worm.

Can these infections impair cognitive function?

Both toxocariasis and neurocysticercosis cause cognitive impairments. The evidence for neurocysticercosis is not as clear-cut.

And how long would cognitive impairment last?

You know it's not as well-studied. There's so much focus on the seizures that people only started recently looking at cognitive impairment with neurocysticercosis. (With toxocariasis) it could be for years. And then the next question is could it produce permanent deficits? And the answer is potentially.

But net zero -- which calls for a neutral carbon impact through the removal of the same amount of emissions from the atmosphere that an entity releases -- has drawn backlash from activists and some experts. The approach allows companies to continue releasing significant amounts of carbon while pursuing emissions offsets which are difficult to verify and sometimes rely on technology that has yet to be developed environmental advocates told ABC News.

Many advocates have called for companies to instead pursue a goal of ""real-zero"" emissions which calls for the outright elimination of carbon emissions. The more ambitious goal would ensure that companies dramatically reduce carbon emissions and would remove the challenge of developing and vetting carbon offsets advocates told ABC News.

But the paradigm shift toward real-zero emissions goals remains in its infancy and could bring some economic disruption dramatically altering or eliminating industries that rely on fossil fuels such as oil and gas the advocates said.

Katie Tubb research fellow on energy and environment issues at the conservative think tank Heritage Foundation took such concerns further saying a transition toward real zero would be infeasible for many companies deliver only a fraction of the carbon emission cuts needed worldwide and potentially increase costs for companies and consumers.

Advocates however said the urgent need for carbon emissions reduction requires an ambitious approach like real zero.

""Companies use the mantra net zero as a fig leaf for continuing whatever they're doing"" David Klein a mathematics professor at California State University Northridge where he participates in the Climate Science Program told ABC News.

""Think of it as a pot of water being heated by a flame underneath it"" he added. ""As long as that flame is on as long as energy goes into the system the temperature will continue to increase. Instead of net zero we need to decrease the concentration of greenhouse gasses in the atmosphere by radically decreasing emissions.""

A U.N. climate report released in April sounded an urgent alarm that the world is on pace to far exceed an increase of 1.5 degrees celsius above pre-industrial temperatures -- a level beyond which many scientists say climate change will wreak damaging effects. At the Paris Climate Accords in 2015 196 parties committed to set a goal of well below 2 degrees celsius of warming preferably below 1.5 degrees celsius of warming.

""It's now or never if we want to limit warming to 1.5 degrees celsius"" Jim Skea a professor of sustainable energy at Imperial College London said in a statement upon the release of the April U.N. climate report. ""Without immediate and deep emissions reductions across all sectors it will be impossible.""

The U.N. which said it supports an eventual net-zero economy worldwide acknowledged the importance of verifying commitments to net zero. The U.N. says on its website that net-zero commitments ""must be backed by credible action."" In March U.N. Secretary-General António Guterres established a group of experts who will recommend standards for net-zero emissions pledges.

But assessment of an entity's fulfillment of a net-zero goal poses a significant potentially insurmountable challenge that detracts from the global effort to reduce carbon emissions said Tyson Slocum director of the energy program at the consumer advocacy group Public Citizen.

""The ability to effectively oversee and verify these programs is very difficult"" he said noting the challenge of not only estimating a company's emissions but also the carbon savings delivered by its offsets. ""Even if we had better protocols there are concerns about how that's going to work effectively.""

""A lot of the push around net zero and its reliance on offsets is actually a distraction from meaningful action to address the climate crisis"" he added.

The rapid development of renewable energy sources has equipped industry with the necessary resources to embark on the shift to real zero environmental advocates said. Last year renewable energy sources accounted for about 12.2% of total U.S. energy consumption and about 20.1% of electricity generation the IEA said. Worldwide the share of renewable energy in electricity generation stood at 29% in 2020 the group said.

Still few companies have taken up the goal of real zero. One such company NextEra Energy is a holding company that oversees Florida Power & Light a utility company that serves more than 12 million people in the state and aims to achieve real-zero emissions by 2045.

The company believes it can preserve the reliability and competitive price of its electricity while eliminating emissions Chris McGrath the communication leader at Florida Power & Light told ABC News.

""Real zero for us is not a goal that relies on offsets"" McGrath said. ""We're pursuing real zero because we think it's achievable. We think the technology exists now that we'll be able to eliminate emissions and keep the lights on 24/7.""

The company plans to achieve real zero by expanding the share of energy it derives from solar improving battery storage that holds solar energy through dark periods overnight or when it's cloudy continuing its nuclear energy operations and developing green hydrogen technology McGrath said.

Green hydrogen technology would use renewable energy to power a process that extracts hydrogen from water allowing the hydrogen to be used for tasks like powering vehicles or generating electricity. But the technology has not yet been developed leaving the real-zero goal of Florida Power & Light open to criticism that it relies on technology that doesn't currently exist just as some net-zero goals do.

In response McGrath said the technology doesn't represent a major leap in development.

""Burning hydrogen is not a new technology"" McGrath said. ""What's unique for us is using solar power to power the process.""

""We don't pretend there aren't going to be challenges associated with achieving this goal but we've been on this journey for more than two decades"" he added.

Environmental advocates said rapid progress in renewable energy technology has brought real-zero carbon emissions goals within reach but they acknowledged that the shift would disrupt the economy and dramatically impact industries that rely on fossil fuels.

""There are some industries like an airline or a big oil company where that's going to be a bit of a challenge"" said Slocum the director of the energy program at Public Citizen. ""They can't really effectively get to real zero.""

The availability and affordability of renewable energy will ease the transition for many companies he added.

""There are all sorts of readily available technologies employable and affordable that companies and other entities can incorporate into their systems"" he said.

Tubb the research fellow on energy and environment issues at the conservative think tank Heritage Foundation rejected such a rosy outlook. Real-zero emissions cuts from the narrow set of U.S. companies that could access large-scale renewables in the short term would only make up a fraction of the emission cuts needed worldwide she said. Plus the significant shift in operations will impose costs on companies and consumers she added.

""This is a lot of expense for a company to take on with dubious environmental benefits on the global warming side of things"" she said.

Rolf Skar the campaign director for environmental advocacy group Greenpeace USA said the call for wide scale commitment to real zero is realistic rather than radical considering the current pace of carbon emissions and the threat posed by climate change.

""If it's radical it's radical because of the necessity of the crisis we're in now"" he said.",,,,,,

A new climate protest group damaged three University of Cambridge research centres last week blaming “the failure of governments and companies to make change”.

The new group called This Is Not A Drill broke glass windows and doors and threw black paint at three university owned research buildings.

Vandals shattered ten windows at the Cambridge Arctic Shelf Programme. The group say the facility is “funded by 11 global oil companies whose purpose is to locate new fossil fuel deposits for them so they can make even more money”.

They also threw black paint on the entrance to Aveva on University land in West Cambridge a software company that “enables 19 of the top 20 petroleum companies”.

This Is Not A Drill also broke the glass entrance of the BP Institute in Cambridge and spray painted messages on the three sites including “Cam Uni: Drop BP”.

A spokesperson for the group said that they had gone beyond the tactics of general disruption because “fossil fuel companies are killing us” and “[the University of Cambridge] works hand in glove with these companies while they pretend to be following the climate science and taking action.”

The spokesperson continued: “It is not hyperbole to call these companies murderers… we’ve been pushed to this point by inaction - the failure of governments and companies to make change following protests from groups like Extinction Rebellion shows that we have to take matters into our own hands.”

This Is Not A Drill says it will focus on Cambridge as it accuses the University of misusing its global reputation of a green image by having public relationships with oil companies like Schlumberger Shell and BP.

The group’s website says that “fossil fuel companies won’t be tolerated” and that these protests are their first but “probably won’t be their last”.

Most people who want a swimming pool but don’t have a big enough yard to fit one either join a YMCA or befriend a neighbor who does have one. But Ashley Clark’s Newport Beach California–based clients had a different idea: They bought the single-story house next door plopped in a pool and created a streamlined pathway lined with plants connecting the two properties. “There are a lot of reasons why we kept it two separate parcels with two separate addresses” says Clark the founder of local design studio Skout. The biggest one was for resale: If ever the family of five were to leave the area they could sell each of the places separately a lot more easily than they could as one big compound. Down the road all they’d have to do is put the fence back up and—voilà—ready to list.

Still Clark’s job was to make the adjacent homes (the smaller of the two now a guest-slash-pool house) look cohesive from the outside and inside. At the beginning of the two-year-long project Clark along with an architect and contractor tackled the kids’ bedrooms and bathrooms in the main house while simultaneously renovating the 1975-square-foot home next door (Garden Studio Design was responsible for the landscaping). Once the guesthouse was finished the couple and their three young boys moved in there while the formerly dark kitchen and main bathroom underwent a transformation. Ahead the designer walks us through the double-duty remodel.

Round the Bend

The kitchen before.

While Clark ripped out the preexisting appliances cabinets and countertops in the kitchen everything ultimately stayed in their original location. The biggest upgrades were leveling the once-tiered island structure and nixing the bulky upper cabinets. “Because it’s not a giant kitchen and with three boys in and out of there all day we wanted it to feel much larger than it actually is” shares the designer.

Painting the cabinets and grooved accent walls in the kitchen an earthy hue (Portola Paints’s Piano Room color-matched by Dunn-Edwards) helped make the new durable white porcelain counters feel less cold. Clark continued this strategy by using the color throughout the house on all the baseboards many of the interior doors and in the couple’s bedroom where it lends a calming touch to the angular space.

Spotlight Tight Corners

As a self-proclaimed “symmetrical person” the kitchen’s awkward angles stumped Clark at first. “I like really clean right angles and rectangles and squares” she says. But with a slight change in perspective she began to view the odd corners as focal points and decided to make the most of them with statement lighting. The slanted sink area is now highlighted by a Kelly Wearstler–designed pendant lamp for Visual Comfort.

Go Back to Gym Class

The kids’ bathroom before.

Since she wanted to keep the two eldest boys’ shared bathroom kid-friendly without going too theme-y with dinosaurs and race cars Clark took the space in an elevated locker room direction. Where there was once a former reach-in closet there is now a recessed wall of army green storage lockers. “They provide a lot of space for their swim trunks towels toilet paper whatever’s needed” she points out. The vanity is painted in Sherwin-Williams’s Oak Moss to match while the striped tiles from Alyse Edwards in Whipped Cream and Too Burnt that extend from the floor up the shower wall add a nautical touch.

Soak in Charm

The primary bathroom before.

Vintage-inspired Arto Brick tiles cover the primary bathroom floor keeping the space from feeling like a “smooth shiny spa” says Clark. She cleaned up the old vanity by reducing the size of the cabinetry replacing the sinks with under-mount versions and tiling the whole wall in zellige squares. They said goodbye to the built-in Jacuzzi tub and swiftly replaced it with a freestanding one from Hydro Systems.

“The wife takes a bath every single night so it was important to her to have this lovely spot that was functional but also has things she can look at” the designer says of wrapping the alcove in artwork.

Bring on the Block Party

The pool house is primed for entertaining with a spacious dining area with a floating bench so that they can easily cram six or eight kids in there—no fussy chair maneuvering required. Clark filled the rest of the space with vintage and flea market finds to make it feel as equally personal as the main house. Large sliding glass doors are easily opened so friends can pop over to the kitchen across the way or jump back into the pool—and there’s no stressing over being too rowdy when your neighbor is you.",,,,,,,,,,,,

Two people were injured.

""It appears that he had a rifle with several magazines of ammunition entered the food court and began shooting"" Ison said.

The ""good Samaritan"" who shot the man with the rifle was a 22-year-old man from Bartholomew County Indiana Ison said.

Greenwood Park Mall shootingWhat we know about the mall shooting in Greenwood Indiana

""The real hero of the day is the citizen that was lawfully carrying a firearm in that food court and was able to stop the shooter almost as soon as he began"" he said.

One of the wounded was a 12-year-old girl with a minor injury.

The other victims ranged in age from early 20s to 30.

The Johnson County Coroner's Office said early Monday four people were fatally shot including one woman and three men. The assailant was among the dead. The woman was pronounced deceased at Eskenazi Hospital one man died at St. Francis Hospital and two men were pronounced deceased at Greenwood Mall. Autopsies are pending.

The shooting happened around the mall's 6 p.m. closing time; the first emergency calls were received at 6:05 p.m.

A bomb squad was called because an unattended backpack - later ""cleared"" by authorities - was found in the bathroom near the food court. The FBI ATF Department of Homeland Security and Indianapolis Metropolitan Police Department are assisting in the investigation.

“You are seeing the best that public safety has to offer right now behind us"" Chris Bailey IMPD assistant chief said at the scene. ""We are sickened by yet another type of incident like this in our country in our city.”

Chris Roy assistant manager of the mall's Van’s shoe store was working Sunday when he saw people running through the hallway away from the food court just before closing.

“So I jumped over the counter locked the door gathered my associates and other managers at the back door” said Roy 30.

They hadn’t heard gunshots but Roy said they saw enough people running to not ask questions. Through the back door they huddled in an interior hallway with about 40 or 50 other people – mostly customers from other stores Roy said. That hallway didn’t have an exterior exit so they waited for police to come clear them he said. Roy and another man tried to keep everyone calm but occasional footsteps on the other side of one of the connecting doors sent panic through the group.

“We just instructed everybody to keep quiet” he said.

After 10 or 15 minutes police cleared them from the hallway and escorted them out of the mall.

Roy said he hadn’t called anyone while he was waiting in the hallway but he did once he was out and safe.

“I called my mom.”

Greenwood Mayor Mark W. Myers issued a statement Sunday night: ""This tragedy hits at the core of our community. Please offer your prayers to the victims and our first responders.""

Greenwood is a city of about 60000 just south of Indianapolis in Johnson County.

U.S. Sen. Todd Young an Indiana Republican tweeted this response to the shooting: ""Terrible news tonight in my home county. Praying for the victims of a shooting at the Greenwood Park Mall.""

The Greenwood Park Mall is one of nine Simon Property Group malls in Indiana. Located at the intersection of U.S. 31 North and County Line Road it has more than 130 indoor and outdoor restaurants and shops. IndyStar has reached out to the company for comment.

Greenwood Police have identified Jonathan Douglas Sapirman 20 of Greenwood as the shooting suspect in the Greenwood Park Mall shooting that took place Sunday evening. He is a graduate of Greenwood High School and lived alone at Polo Run Apartments prior to the shooting.

Police say Sapirman likely entered the mall with his Sig Saur long rifle broken into pieces and stored in a bag that was left behind at the mall bathroom.

Sapirman entered the bathroom directly after entering the mall and stayed in the bathroom for one hour and two minutes. It is likely he was preparing for the shooting said Jim Ison Greenwood Police chief.

Three guns were found at the scene but only the SigSaur was used in the shooting.

Ison said Sapirman shot 24 rounds and killed three people and wounded two others.

The victims are all Indianapolis residents: Victor Gomez 30 and husband and wife Pedro Pineda 56 and Rosa Mirian Rivera de Pineda 37.

Sapirman was shot by Elisjsha Dicken 22 of Seymour. Ison said Dicken was lawfully carrying a gun though the mall had a policy against carrying.

Dicken shot 10 rounds at Sapirman and police say that saved lives.

This story will be updated again shortly.

12:13 p.m. Monday update

Simon Property Group has closed the mall today. In a statement posted to the mall’s Facebook page Monday morning mall officials said they were grieving for the victims and that violence has no place in this or any other community.

“We grieve for the victims of yesterday’s horrific tragedy at the Greenwood Park Mall. Violence has no place in this or any other community. We are grateful for the strong response of the first responders including the heroic actions of the good Samaritan who stopped the suspect” officials said.

The statement did not reference the mall’s policy against having guns on the property. Per Simon’s stated online policy neither the gunman nor the “good Samaritan” should have had a gun at the mall.

10:34 a.m. Monday update

A Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) spokesperson said Monday morning that the agency assisted the Greenwood Police in executing a search warrant at Polo Run Apartments 800 Kings Mill Road Greenwood. The FBI is also assisting with the shooting investigation at the mall.

The FBI spokesperson did not say if the warrant was connected to the shooting. The Daily Journal reached out to Greenwood police on more information on the warrant along with whether or not it’s connected to the shooting and has not yet heard back from officials.

The FBI is continuing to offer assistance and resources as needed to Greenwood Police an FBI spokesperson said.

The names of the deceased individuals will be released at a 2 p.m. at a press conference to be held at Greenwood City Center.

Simon Property Group has closed the mall today. The Daily Journal reached out to Simon officials for an additional comment but has not heard back.

Sunday 10:20 p.m. update

Four people including the shooter are dead and two people are in the hospital following a mass shooting at the Greenwood Park Mall Sunday evening.

First responders from numerous Johnson and Marion county agencies responded to a report of a shooting at Greenwood Park Mall on U.S. 31 in Greenwood shortly around 6 p.m. Sunday.

Five people were shot during the shooting three of which are deceased. The two remaining people were taken to Sidney and Lois Eskenazi Hospital in Indianapolis and are in stable condition Greenwood Police Chief James Ison said Sunday.

Four of the victims shot were females and one was male with ages ranging between the early 20s to 30s. One juvenile was injured he said.

The shooter was shot and killed by a 22-year-old Bartholomew County man police who police are calling a good Samaritan. Police say the shooter an adult male had a long rifle with several magazines Ison said.

The shooter’s identity has not been released and his motive is unknown police said.

It is believed the shooter entered the food court and started firing. Police are calling the good Samaritan a hero for intervening. If had not been for his quick action there could have been more lives lost Ison said.

“The real hero of the day is the citizen who was lawfully carrying a firearm in the food court and was able to stop the shooter almost as soon as he began” he said.

The mass shooting has shaken city officials to their cores Ison said.

“This isn’t something that we have seen here in Greenwood before. It was absolutely horrendous. Our thoughts and prayers are with with those loved ones hurting” he said.

Officers from the Indianapolis Metropolitan Police Department SWAT team along with teams from the Indiana State Police and Greenwood police finished a sweep of the entire mall by 9:40 p.m. Sunday. The teams had gone methodically through the mall Sunday evening to clear it Ison and IMPD assistant chief Christopher Bailey said Sunday.

“We are sickened by yet another type of incident like this in our country in our city” Bailey said.

Police could not yet say how many guns were at the scene or how many shots were fired. A backpack was left behind and was later cleared and determined it did not contain an explosive Ison said.

Evidence collection was just beginning at the time of GPD’s update around 9:41 p.m. Ison said.

“I expect we will be here until the early morning hours tonight” he said Sunday night.

The investigation is ongoing and an additional press briefing is scheduled for 2 p.m. today.

The mall was completely evacuated after the shooting and it remained unclear Sunday night if the mall will be open today Ison said. The decision to open rests with Simon Property Group which owns the mall.

Greenwood Mayor Mark Myers said in a statement issued Sunday evening that the shooting was a tragedy that hit at “the core of our community.”

“Please offer your prayers to the victims and our first responders” Myers said.

In a second statement issued later on Sunday Myers praised the good Samaritan saying he was able to save lives.

“On behalf of the City of Greenwood I am grateful for his quick action and heroism in this situation” Myers said.

In the immediate aftermath of the shooting hundreds of witnesses law enforcement and EMS are gathered outside of the mall on U.S. 31 in Greenwood following the reports of an active shooter in the building.

Witnesses standing outside the mall told the Daily Journal they heard several gunshots inside and ran out. One witness said they were ushered to the back of a store.

“I heard at least five shots from where I was … I was around the corner from where they started shooting” Mark Tillbrey a 16-year-old witness at the mall said. “Everyone started running and I started helping kids out.”

Greenwood police have trained for mass shooting situations before and a few years ago the department took part in a coordinated training with the FBI and other law enforcement agencies from across the Indianapolis area for this type of situation Ison said.

“Our officers responded the way they should have very quickly” he said. “I’m extremely proud of the law enforcement response not only from the Greenwood Police Department but … the multi-jurisdictional cooperation.”

Ison wants Greenwood residents to know that the city’s officers are doing the best they can. Residents should feel safe in the city he said.

“We strive on having a very safe city and low violent crime rate” Ison said. “This is just something that shocked us to our core tonight.”

Initial reports of an active shooter came in just after 6 p.m. Arriving officers secured the scene and located the victims which included four females and one male.

According to the Johnson County Coroner two males — the suspected shooter and a victim — were pronounced dead at the scene. Another male and a female were pronounced dead at Franciscan Health Indianapolis and Eskenazi Hospital.

Sources told WRTV the bodies of the suspect and one of the victims were removed from the mall about 2 a.m. Monday.

Police say one of the survivors – a juvenile girl – suffered only minor injuries and was transported to the hospital separately. A second person was taken to the hospital from the scene. Their condition wasn't immediately known.

Officials say the shooter has been positively identified but officials haven't disclosed the identities of anyone killed in the shooting.

In a briefing Sunday evening just before 8 p.m. police said the shooter was killed by an armed civilian inside the Greenwood Park Mall food court. The civilian is cooperating with officials.

The armed civilian has been identified as a 22-year-old man from Bartholomew County. Authorities have not revealed any other information about that person.

The Johnson County bomb squad was called to the mall after an abandoned backpack was located inside the mall. Police later said the bag was cleared and deemed not to be a threat.

On Monday an FBI spokesperson confirmed to WRTV that its teams assisted local police in the shooting investigation and with serving a search warrant afterward at Polo Run Apartments which is located near the mall across U.S. 31.

WRTV/Eldon Wheeler An FBI spokesperson said its teams assisted local police in serving a search warrant related to the Greenwood Park Mall shooting overnight at Polo Run Apartments at 800 Kings Mill Rd. in Greenwood.

WRTV has reached out to Greenwood police officials for more information.

Greenwood Mayor Mark W. Myers issued a statement Sunday evening thanking the armed civilian for his “quick action and heroism” during the shooting.

“As of now we do not know the shooter’s identity or motive. We do know that someone we are calling the “Good Samaritan” was able to shoot the assailant and stop further bloodshed. This person saved lives tonight. On behalf of the City of Greenwood I am grateful for his quick action and heroism in this situation.”

The Marion County Coroner will work in conjunction with the Johnson County Coroner to identify the victims of the shooting and the suspected shooter. The Johnson County Coroner's Office said it will work on identifying the shooter and one victim.

As of Sunday evening officials had not disclosed any identities of those who died.

A spokeswoman representing Simon Property Group the Greenwood Park Mall's parent company confirmed the mall will be closed Monday. A reopening date will be announced later.

The following statement was shared on the company's behalf:

""We grieve for the victims of yesterday’s horrific tragedy in Greenwood. Violence has no place in this or any other community. We are grateful for the strong response of the first responders including the heroic actions of the Good Samaritan who stopped the suspect.""

> select (iOS) or (Android). Save the photo or video to your Snapchat Memories send it to a friend or post it as a Snapchat story.

This article explains how to share photos and videos on Snapchat on iOS and Android devices.

How to Access Snapchat Memories

Snapchat Memories allows you to both save snaps you take through the Snapchat app and upload existing photos/videos from your device. Here's how to easily access the Memories feature in Snapchat:

Open the Snapchat app and navigate to the camera tab (if you're not on it already) by swiping left or right through the tabs. Tap the small double image icon displayed directly beneath the Camera button.

A new tab labeled Memories will slide up from the bottom of the screen showing a grid of snaps if you saved any. If you didn't save any yet this tab will be blank.

How to Start Uploading Your Photos and Videos

To upload something from your device you have to use the Memories feature. You can make edits to images in the SnapChat app. If you're sending a video you can trim it within Snapchat disable sound add text and draw over it before you send it.

1:06

In Memories you should see three tab: Snaps Camera Roll and My Eyes Only. (If you haven't set it up you won't see My Eyes Only.) Tap Camera Roll to switch to the correct tab. Items in Camera Roll are the images and videos that are on your phone. To back up items to Snapchat set up My Eyes Only. Select the snaps you want to make private tap the lock icon at the bottom of the screen and follow the onscreen prompts. You might have to allow Snapchat to access your device's photos first. If you haven't done this yet a popup should appear asking for your permission. Tap OK to proceed. Select a photo or video to send as a message to friends or post as a story. Tap the menu in the upper right corner represented by three dots. Choose Edit Photo (iOS) or Edit Snap (Android). Make optional edits to your photo or video using the tools that appear for text emoji drawings filters or cut-and-paste edits. You won't be able to apply filters with Bitmoji or animations since the photo or video was taken outside of the Snapchat app. You should however be able to at least use one of the many tinted filters. When you're finished making edits tap Done and then optionally save the image using the prompts that appear. You don't have to save the edited image to send it. If you want to send without saving tap the send button to send your uploaded snap to friends as a message or to post it as a story.

Snapchat's Formatting of Uploaded Photos and Videos

You might notice that some of the photos and videos you decide to upload to Snapchat look different than the ones you take directly through the app. For example some may appear cropped with black edges all around them while others might be zoomed in with the outer edges cut off. Snapchat will do its best to make your photo or video look good enough to send but because it wasn't taken directly through the app it won't necessarily look perfect.

Third-Party Workaround Apps Blocked

Before the Memories feature was introduced there used to be several apps available from third-party developers that claimed to help Snapchat users upload photos or videos to Snapchat. Snapchat has since banned third-party apps stating that it's a violation of Snapchat's Terms of Use.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiMWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxpZmV3aXJlLmNvbS9zbmFwY2hhdC1zdHJlYWtzLTQxNjI5ODPSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,What Streaks Are on Snapchat (and What to Know About Them),"Streaks make Snapchat a lot more fun to use.

A streak or a ""snapstreak"" is a representation of how many days in a row you've managed to send photo or video snaps back and forth with a specific friend. For example if you sent snaps to a friend every day for five days and they also replied to you with snaps each one of those five days your snapstreak would be at a count of five.

How to See Your Snapstreaks

Snapstreaks appear directly beside a friend's name in your conversations tab. The snapstreak is represented by the flame emoji which may or may not be accompanied by additional Snapchat emojis that represent other meanings about your friendship.

As your snapstreaks grow you'll also see a number appear beside the flame emoji representing the number of days you've kept your snapstreak going. If you keep a snapstreak going for 100 days the red hundred points emoji will appear beside the flame emoji.

How to Make Sure You Keep up With Your Snapstreaks

To avoid losing your snapstreak you and the friend you're snapping must send photo or video snaps to each other within a 24-hour window. It's a team effort–so if you keep your snapping up within that 24-hour window but your friend doesn't your snapstreak will disappear and you'll have to start all over again!

You don't necessarily need to know exactly when your 24-hour window ends. Snapchat will remind you that you need to snap each other soon by putting an hourglass emoji beside your friend's name on the conversation tab when your time is almost up.

Interactions That Don't Count Toward Your Snapstreaks

There are lots of different ways to interact with friends on Snapchat but most of them won't contribute to any snapstreaks that you have going. These include:

Chatting: On Snapchat you can tap any friend's name to open a chat with them which may be very convenient but unfortunately won't contribute to your snapstreaks.

Posting Stories: If you post a story and friends view it it will not affect any snapstreaks you have with any of those particular friends who viewed your story.

If you post a story and friends view it it will not affect any snapstreaks you have with any of those particular friends who viewed your story. Sending Snaps to a Group: You'd think that photo and video snaps sent to a group of friends would count toward snapstreaks that you have going with friends who are a part of that group but nope! Sorry. To keep your snapstreaks going you'll have to send snaps to those friends on an individual basis.

To keep your snapstreaks going you'll have to send snaps to those friends on an individual basis. Sending Snaps from Memories: Photo and video snaps that have been taken previously and saved in Memories (or uploaded from your device) won't do anything for your snapstreaks if you send them within your 24-hour snapstreak window most likely because they've been snapped/saved from a different time.

Photo and video snaps that have been taken previously and saved in Memories (or uploaded from your device) won't do anything for your snapstreaks if you send them within your 24-hour snapstreak window most likely because they've been snapped/saved from a different time. Sharing Content Through Snapchat Spectacles: Got a pair of Snapchat Spectacles? They might make you feel like a super Snapchatter but again the video footage you record and share through them will not count toward any of your snapstreaks.

The Only Two Interactions That Count Toward Your Snapstreaks

There are just two things you need to do to keep your snapstreaks going for as long as possible. These include:

Sending photo snaps to any individual friend. Sending video snaps to any individual friend.

​That's it. If you can remember to send a photo or video snap to a friend–not in a group snap and within that 24-hour window of your last snap interaction–then you should have no problem keeping up with your snapstreaks!

How to Share Your Snapstreaks With Your Friends Using Filters and Stickers

Snapchat has a couple of fun features to help you remind and encourage your friends to reply promptly with a photo or video snap so you keep your snapstreaks going. They include:

Snapstreak filters: Double-tap on a friend's name in your conversations tab take a photo or video snap and then start swiping left or right through the available filters. If you have a snapstreak filter going with that particular friend you'll see a filter featuring your snapstreak in large white numbers alongside the flame emoji.

If you have a snapstreak filter going with that particular friend you'll see a filter featuring your snapstreak in large white numbers alongside the flame emoji. Snapstreak Bitmoji stickers: If you've connected Snapchat to your Bitmoji account you can double-tap on a friend's name in your conversation's tab and then tap the sticker icon to see snapstreak stickers featuring your Bitmoji and your friend's if they have one. If snapstreak stickers don't appear at the top simply type ""streak"" or ""snapstreak"" into the search field at the top to see all that are available. Tap any one of them to apply it to your snap.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMidWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lmdlby50di9sYXRlc3QvNDI4MTE3LXZpY3RvcmlhLWJlY2toYW0tZW5qb3lzLWhvbGlkYXktaW4tY3JvYXRpYS1wb3N0cy1zd2VldC1zbmFwLW9mLWRhdmlkLWhhcnBlci1vbi15YWNodNIBcmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lmdlby50di9hbXAvNDI4MTE3LXZpY3RvcmlhLWJlY2toYW0tZW5qb3lzLWhvbGlkYXktaW4tY3JvYXRpYS1wb3N0cy1zd2VldC1zbmFwLW9mLWRhdmlkLWhhcnBlci1vbi15YWNodA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Victoria Beckham enjoys holiday in Croatia posts sweet snap of David Harper on yacht,"Victoria Beckham enjoys holiday in Croatia posts sweet snap of David Harper on yacht

Prior to introducing Agruma on social media she let slip in a previous chat with PEOPLE that her heart’s been taken without naming names. “I think going through the process of finding more self-worth I think that what you want in a partner is elevated.

Rosa Linn hits Top 100 in Germany U.K. and Italy as TikTok continues to buoy popularity,"Reese Witherspoon recently used Rosa Linn‘s song “SNAP” in an Instagram Reel asking people to define “crawdad.” But evidently the Hollywood A-lister isn’t the only one loving Armenia’s Eurovision 2022 entry. In recent days “SNAP” has hit the Top 100 in the charts in Germany the United Kingdom and Italy — an impressive feat that suggests Rosa Linn has the Eurovision song of the summer.

In the weeks after the contest the Top 3 finishers — Kalush Orchestra Sam Ryder and Chanel — were among the Eurovision 2022 acts experiencing the most success. But two months later — and buoyed by her success on TikTok — Rosa Linn has watched “SNAP” prove it has staying power.

View this post on Instagram A post shared by wiwibloggs (@wiwibloggs)

The song is currently the only Eurovision 2022 entry in the Top 40 in Germany coming in at #32.

In the U.K. only two songs from Eurovision 2022 can be found on the charts: Sam Ryder’s “SPACE MAN” at #56 and Rosa Linn’s “SNAP” at #67.

It’s a similar story in Italy where the country’s own Eurovision entry remains in play. Mahmood & Blanco’s “Brividi” sits at #30. Just one other ESC 2022 song is on the list — Rosa Linn’s “SNAP” at # 83.

As our friends at EuroFestival News report “SNAP” is only the seventh non-Italian Eurovision song to crack the charts there. Five of these won the song contest (with Conchita reaching #25 and Loreen hitting #27).

Besides Rosa Linn’s “Snap” the only other non-winner to crack the Top 100 was The Ark’s “The Worrying Kind” which hit #34 after placing 18th at Eurovision. Below you can see their peak position and how many weeks they lasted in the charts.

Whether you win Eurovision or place 20th like Rosa Linn did the song contest is a platform to help get your music out there.

We’d call “SNAP” a sleeper hit but Miss Rosa Linn is now wide awake!

Much of “SNAP”‘s success comes down to its use on TikTok where it’s being used on clips about travel pets and family. Its warmth and sense of nostalgia creates the perfect mood to reminisce over recent trips to waterfalls or gondola rides through Venice with your puppy.

At the time of writing the “SNAP – High and Fast” sound had been used on 233200 videos while the original “SNAP” sound has been used 37200 times.

Spotify recently added “SNAP” to its Today’s Top Hits playlist — the most-liked playlist across the entire platform. She joined the likes of Glass Animals with “Heat Wave” and Lady Gaga with “Hold My Hand.”"

Brackish is a Charleston-based fashion company that started with a pair of friends making feather bowties in a garage. Now Brackish is sold at every Saks Fifth Avenue and Neiman Marcus around the country worn by celebrities and backyard wedding guests alike. One never-been-done-before idea turned into a full-blown fashion movement fueled by friendship gumption and unmistakably Southern roots. We got to chat with co-founders Ben Ross and Jeff Plotner to learn how Brackish became one of the coolest Southern accessory brands around.

It started with a friendship and a unique groomsman gift.

In 1997 Ben Ross and Jeff Plotner matriculated at Wofford College to play sports and became fast friends. They celebrate their company’s ten-year anniversary and 25 years of friendship this year. When it came time for Ben to walk down the aisle he didn’t want to give the run-of-the-mill monogrammed gift. “I wanted to give my groomsmen and my family something they couldn’t just go out and buy” Ben says. “A gift from my heart that showed them how much they meant to me. Being an outdoorsman I’ve always tied my own flies and fletched my own arrows. So I’ve always gravitated towards feathers and art and usage” Ben says.

One day Ben happened to lay a turkey feather body flat on a table and noticed its triangular shape. “The natural shape conformation and tapering of that feather fit a bow tie perfectly” Ben says. “That was the lightbulb moment. My wife didn’t believe that it was going to go over too well so she made me wear it to a game and garden event. After the response there was pretty positive she okayed it as the wedding gift.”

It dawned on Jeff (who was uninspired in law school at the time) that this could be something special. “A successful business starts with an original and authentic idea” Jeff says. “And Ben came up with it. It’s really difficult in these times to find something that nobody else has ever done before. And Ben did that.” Jeff had the vision and foresight to take what Ben gave the groomsmen and turn it into something bigger than anyone’s imagination.

Jeff called Ben and said “I think we’ve got something here with this feather bowtie. Do you want to partner up!?” And Ben admits it’s really Jeff’s drive determination and vision that have carried Brackish to where it is today. “He always saw Brackish as more than what it currently was” Ben adds. The 100 bowties a year that Ben was making for Father’s Day or Christmas presents has turned into the rapidly growing company it is today.

In 2019 they welcomed women’s accessories to the lineup

The team always had its sights set on including the women in their line but they spent three years in research and development before launching this arm in 2019. “The level of craftsmanship of the bowties has been elevated to such a stature that we wanted to make sure the women’s line release was on par with that and up to expectations” Ben says.

“We went back to the drawing boards to get all the correct components — sourcing the material making sure the weight was right the feather layout was right” Ben says. In the most serendipitous way imaginable Brackish launched the women’s line right as weddings and events came to a screeching halt. Thankfully women kept shopping and this new line carried them through the pandemic. “There was a guiding hand at play there” Ben adds. “It was surreal.”

A few “oh wow” moments have put Brackish’s success into perspective.

For Jeff it was seeing Bill Murray wearing a Brackish bowtie on the red carpet at the 2014 Oscars. Ben is proud of the team for the efforts that brought multiple invitations to the White House — once for the Made in America series and second when they implemented a massive mask manufacturing business for frontline workers during the pandemic.

Winning the Garden & Gun style category for our women’s fashion accessories was another proud moment for Ben. “Never in a million years did I think I’d be in women’s accessories” Ben says. “To see where the cuff [bracelet] started and where the cuff ended and where the fan earrings started and where they ended — it’s been something magical to behold. It’s such an honor to get to wake up and work with such talented individuals every day.”

Ben and Jeff debunk some common misconceptions about Brackish.

A hopeful Jeff used to walk into some would-be retailers at the beginning and people would say “Son we still tie our own bowties around here.” It took some time but Jeff has debunked the myth that you have to tie a bowtie for it to be an acceptable formal appendage. Brackish bowties are stylish and effortless.

For Ben it’s important for people to understand that birds are never harmed to obtain feathers. Brackish sources feathers in two different eco-friendly ways: One is through the farm-to-table movement. “Your pheasant farmers quail farmers and chucker farmers raise birds to go to market” Ben explains.

“We’ve developed relationships with these farmers to take steps after they harvest the birds to strategically take feathers we want to incorporate into our designs. The farmer recognizes a revenue stream from something he used to throw in the trash and it improves the feed and living conditions for the birds because we only take feathers in the best of conditions. It’s a win-win” Ben says.

The second way they source is through the process of exotic molt. “Exotic birds molt twice a year” Ben explains. “So your peacocks your Lady Amhersts your guineas — all those types of feathers are molted. Those birds are not killed and if they’re in tight cages the feathers get ruffled and rubbed and they’re no good to us. So they’re free-range birds living an incredible life and fed the best foods to get those vibrant colors.”

What’s on the Brackish horizon?

“We’ve got some belts coming out this fall that we’ve been working on for a while” Jeff says. “Another brainchild of Ben. “We’re really excited to get those out.”

A $1.6 million lawsuit is the latest development in the ongoing garbage contract dispute in Jackson Mississippi.

WAPT-TV reported on Friday that Richard’s Disposal filed a lawsuit in U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Mississippi on Wednesday and is seeking more than $1.6 million in restitution. The New Orleans-based company has been collecting trash in Jackson since April 1 but has yet to be paid because the Jackson City Council said the company does not have an approved contract.

Earlier this week a judge ruled that the mayor of Mississippi’s capital city did not have the power veto a contract that the city council had not approved. Judge Larry Roberts issued his ruling Friday in a dispute among Jackson officials over who will be paid to collect garbage news outlets reported.

“There’s nothing there to veto. The council didn’t pass affirmatively the matter. It rejected it” said Roberts a retired Mississippi Court of Appeals judge who was appointed to hear the case in Hinds County Chancery Court.

The Jackson City Council sued after Mayor Chokwe Antar Lumumba issued an emergency order to award a garbage collection contract to a Richard’s Disposal.

Blue Heron

This newly built cliff-side mansion overlooking the Pacific Ocean in Southern California comes with an ambitious $32.5 million asking price. It's one of the most expensive homes for sale in San Diego County and that price tag puts it in the running to break a local record in the picturesque beach-side community of La Jolla.

Perhaps more interesting than its potentially record-breaking price is the fact that the home was designed and constructed by Las Vegas-based builder Blue Heron which almost exclusively designs and builds luxury mansions in the Mojave desert.

""I would consider us the authority and the experts in luxury real estate in all of Las Vegas without a doubt"" said Blue Heron's founder Tyler Jones a fourth-generation Vegas native. Building on the ocean is more similar to building in the desert than you'd imagine according to Jones. In both environments Blue Heron's design is focused on blurring the lines between indoor and outdoor living. ""The Mojave Desert is a great place to do that"" he said. ""But arguably you know La Jolla San Diego is actually a much better place to do that."" Over the past 18 years Blue Heron has built several hundred homes — every one of them (except for two in La Jolla) in the Las Vegas area according to the CEO. Today the starting price for one of the firm's more affordable desert homes is about a million bucks but the average sale price for one of the company's newly constructed desert mansions is about $8 million. Just last year Blue Heron made headlines when one of its Sin City spec mansions broke a record when it sold for $25 million to billionaire LoanDepot founder Anthony Hsieh.

About 300 miles away from its core business in Vegas Blue Heron's new coastal spec mansion spans four levels with an expansive deck and infinity pool out back on the edge of the Pacific.

The mansion known as the Ora House is the second residence Blue Heron has built outside of Vegas. The first one also a spec house located in La Jolla was on the market for about nine months before selling last year for $20 million. The median price of a single family home in La Jolla was $3.6 million in the second quarter this year according to data provided by real estate brokerage firm Compass. So why has a builder who's been betting big on luxury real estate in Vegas turned his attention to shattering a local record on the edge of the Pacific?

Blue Heron's Ora House perched on a cliff overlooking the ocean. Blue Heron

Jones said he has a soft spot for La Jolla and it's filled with childhood memories of vacationing in the beachfront town with his family. That's just one of the reasons he had his eye on the area in 2016 when he bought the $4.7 million oceanfront home at 5228 Chelsea Street. It was what developers call a ""teardown."" Blue Heron was more interested in the site than the existing home that sat on it. The company tore down the old home and over six years developed a new $32.5 million spec house in its place. That price puts the home at the very top of La Jolla's ultra high-end market. Since 2018 the community has recorded 11 sales at $20 million or more according to title records. One of the most publicized was back in 2018 when singer-songwriter Alicia Keys and her record-producing husband Swizz Beatz spent $20.8 million on the waterfront residence known as The Razor House.

But La Jolla's top sale price was achieved in 2019 when the oceanfront mansion located at 8466 El Paseo Grande sold for $24.7 million according to public records. And while Blue Heron's Ora House is the most expensive home for sale in La Jolla at $3660 price per square feet it's actually a relative bargain compared to the over $4000 per square foot price achieved on the El Paseo Grande sale. ""People love the San Diego lifestyle"" said real estate broker Brett Dickinson of Compass who was involved in six of the neighborhood's transactions of $20 million and more. Dickinson is co-listing agent on Ora House with Deborah Greenspan of Sotheby's. Dickinson told CNBC the attraction to the area is fueled by a tech boom that's migrating from the northern part of the state southward.

Jones told CNBC Ora House's jumbo-sized price tag is partially a function of the cost of developing on the California coastline which requires more time more effort and a lot more money because development is complicated by heavy regulation. ""It's not worth it for a smaller dollar project"" he said.

But a lot has changed since Blue Heron bought the site in 2016 and the company's beachfront spec home is now facing a trifecta of headwinds: rising interest rates diving equity markets and sky-rocketing inflation. Dickinson told CNBC those are serious factors but they are mitigated by La Jolla's limited housing inventory. According to the broker typically the number of homes available for sale in the neighborhood hovers around 150 to 200 units but this month there are just 89 homes listed. The market is even tighter when you focus on the higher-end oceanfront inventory.

Charlene Carter worked as a Southwest Airlines flight attendant for more than 20 years from 1996 until 2017. Carter was fired from the airline in March 2017 on the basis of violating the company’s policies on bullying and the use of social media.

This issue arose over Carter’s disagreement with the Transportation Workers Union of America (TWU) Local 556 which is the union she paid dues to. She had long had disagreements with the union and in 2013 she even “resigned” from the union after realizing her beliefs didn’t align with those of the union. She was still required to continue paying dues as a condition of her employment though.

Fast forward to early 2017:

Carter complained to the union president about flight attendants going to a march in Washington DC where more than half a million people protested former President Trump’s position on abortion and other issues

Carter wasn’t happy that union dues were being used to attend an anti-abortion rally and wasn’t happy that flight attendants who wanted to attend were being granted schedule adjustments

Carter sent Facebook messages including some with videos of alleged aborted fetuses to Audrey Stone who was the union president at the time

Carter called Stone “despicable” and said she would be voted out of office

Stone reported Carter to the company and Southwest Airlines ended up firing Carter for violating the company’s policies on bullying and the use of social media. Southwest said her Facebook posts (in which she could be identified as a Southwest employee) were “highly offensive” and that her private messages were harassing.

Carter thought that wasn’t fair and has been pursuing legal action against the airline and union for the past five years.

Jury sides with flight attendant

A federal jury in Texas has sided with the former Southwest flight attendant arguing that she was unlawfully discriminated against for her sincerely held religious beliefs. Furthermore the jury found that the union did not fairly represent her and retaliated against her for expressing her views.

If this stands Carter will be awarded $5.3 million including $4.15 million from Southwest Airlines and $1.15 million from Transportation Workers Union of America (TWU) Local 556. This consists primarily of punitive damages but also consists of some back pay from the airline.

Both the airline and union plan to appeal this decision. Southwest said in a statement that the airline “has a demonstrated history of supporting employees’ rights to express their opinions when done in a respectful manner” while a lawyer for the union argued that the “factual evidence indicates an outcome different from the recent decision of the jury which may have misunderstood the court’s charge.”

Meanwhile Carter said the following in a statement:

“Today is a victory for freedom of speech and religious beliefs. Flight attendants should have a voice and nobody should be able to retaliate against a flight attendant for engaging in protected speech against her union. I am so humbled and thankful for today’s decision and for everyone who’s supported me these past five years including the National Right to Work Foundation.”

Bottom line

After a roughly five year legal battle a former Southwest flight attendant has been awarded damages over being fired from the airline. Southwest claims that the flight attendant violated the company’s social media policy with her public and offensive anti-abortion posts and she was also accused of harassing the union president after union dues were used to attend a rally in Washington DC.

Obviously abortion has become an even hotter topic following the Supreme Court’s recent ruling so I don’t want to go down that rabbit hole in this context or the concept of “sincerely held religious beliefs.”

I guess the one thing I’m curious about is if you voluntarily leave the union (even though you continue to have to pay dues) does the union have to continue representing you? If the union does then what are the practical implications of leaving the union?

I’m curious to see if an appeal is successful here or if this person and her lawyers are really going to walk away with $5+ million.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMijQFodHRwczovL2pvdXJuYWxzdGFyLmNvbS9zb3V0aHdlc3QtaGl0cy13b3JrZXItbWlsZXN0b25lLWJlZm9yZS1hbGwtdGhlLW90aGVyLW1ham9yLWFpcmxpbmVzL2FydGljbGVfOWEyYjgzODAtMzc3Yi01NTgzLTgxOWEtMWU4YzZiZWRkNzlkLmh0bWzSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Southwest hits worker milestone before all the other major airlines,"Dallas-based Southwest Airlines has hired 10000 employees since January bringing it back to pre-COVID staffing levels faster than the other major carriers.

Southwest’s 62040 employees in May 2022 is slightly more than the number of workers the company had during the same month in 2019 according to government airline employment figures. Southwest still remains 400 workers below the peak workforce total it hit in March 2020 the same month a worldwide pandemic was declared and airlines stopped hiring workers because air travel demand was faltering.

At the pandemic peak Southwest had trimmed nearly 8000 workers from its payrolls through a series of buyouts early retirements attrition and halts on hiring. The U.S. airline industry as a whole had shed more than 80000 jobs between February and October of 2020. And while those numbers have rebounded above pre-pandemic numbers most of the growth has been at shipping firms such as FedEx and ultra-low-cost carriers like Spirit.

Most major airlines have cited hiring and workforce troubles heading into this summer of unanticipated strong consumer demand for flying. Several including Southwest Airlines and Delta had hoped to get back to the flying levels from 2019. But staffing issues and an industrywide shortage of pilots forced carriers to severely cut back summer schedules.

“Staffing is a clear constraint for revenue growth at airlines” said Third Bridge senior sector analyst Christopher Raite. “Retention remains a problem and airlines are spending more on their biggest costs which is people.”

Southwest and other airlines face another major problem as they try to rebound from the pandemic analysts say. Even though airline job numbers are close to what they were in 2019 delay and cancellation rates are higher even with 10% to 20% fewer flights.

Southwest has 2400 fewer flights scheduled for this summer than it did in 2019 while the four major U.S. carriers have about 316000 fewer flights than three years ago according to flight-tracking service Diio by Cirium. That doesn’t even include regional carriers which have been hardest hit by the shortage of pilots.

Southwest’s new CEO Bob Jordan has targeted hiring as top priority since officially taking the job over in February pushing for new workers in jobs from customer service agents who take phone calls to pilots who fly planes. But he’s also cited the strong competition for new employees from other labor-desperate industries.

“Our recent hiring milestones represent incredible progress with aligning staffing to support our flight schedule customers and employees” Southwest Airlines vice president of people Elizabeth Bryant said in a statement. “We’re proud of the 10000 new Southwest employees that we’ve welcomed since January and hiring and training will remain a focus throughout 2022.”

Fort Worth-based American Airlines is about 4600 employees below May 2019 levels although the company cut nearly 5000 management and support staff workers in 2020 with plans to make those reductions permanent. American has been more successful in bringing back employees at its regional carriers which have fewer employees but have still struggled with the pilot shortage across the industry.

Chicago-based United Airlines has 5800 fewer employees than the 905000 workers it had in the same month from 2019 and Atlanta-based Delta Air Lines has 89200 workers about 1200 workers less than three years ago.

“The chief issue we’re working through is not hiring but a training and experience bubble” Delta CEO Ed Bastian said Wednesday. “Coupling this with the lingering effects of COVID and we’ve seen a reduction in crew availability and higher overtime.”

Even with 1200 fewer employees than in 2019 and buyouts and early retirements that reduced salaries Delta’s salary and wage costs for the second quarter were still 4% higher than during the same stretch of 2019.

American Airlines has also cited hiccups in training including a shortage of check airmen to provide simulator training to new and experienced pilots. There is also a lack of captains at regional airlines that is creating a bottleneck in training junior pilots.

Low-cost carriers such as JetBlue and Alaska reached pre-pandemic levels months ago along with budget carriers Spirit Allegiant and Frontier.

But even though masking mandates have dropped along with other COVID-19 restrictions air carriers are still reeling from the effects of COVID-19 said CFRA analyst Colin Scarola.

“There is a lag between when you get people in the door and in the door and working gates or doing maintenance not to mention how long it takes them to be fully trained to do their jobs” Scarola. “But the biggest issue is COVID absenteeism. A lot of people think we are out of COVID or out of the pandemic but people won’t work through an illness like they did before the pandemic nor should they.”

Even with a nationwide unemployment rate of 3.6% the labor participation rate is still about 1% lower than it was before the pandemic according to the U.S. Federal Reserve in St. Louis. The labor market could remain tight for a while but won’t it will be softer than it has been in recent months he said.

“You hear the whole adage that the best cure for high prices is high prices” Scarola said. “With so much inflation that’s drawing people back to work.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiT2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnlhaG9vLmNvbS9uZXdzL2Zvcm1lci1zb3V0aHdlc3QtZmxpZ2h0LWF0dGVuZGFudC13b24tMTkwOTA3OTg2Lmh0bWzSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,A former Southwest flight attendant won a $5.1 million verdict against airline and her union after clashes around ...,"Southwest Airlines

A former Southwest flight attendant sent harassing messages to her union president over abortion the airline said.

Charlene Carter sued the airline and her union after she was fired.

On Friday she won a $5.1 million jury verdict against the airline and her union.

A Southwest flight attendant who said she was fired for her views on abortion won a $5.1 million jury verdict against the airline and her union several outlets reported.

The Associated Press reported Charlene Carter could get $4.15 million from Southwest and another $950000 from Local 556 of the Transport Workers Union.

""Today is a victory for freedom of speech and religious beliefs. Flight attendants should have a voice and nobody should be able to retaliate against a flight attendant for engaging in protected speech against her union"" Carter told FOX Business in a statement. ""I am so humbled and thankful for today's decision and for everyone who's supported me these past five years including the National Right to Work Foundation.""

Carter said she was fired in March 2017 after complaining that flight attendants were going to march in Washington D.C. against former President Donald Trump's abortion views the Dallas Morning News reported.

She had complained to then-union president Audrey Stone and sent her Facebook messages calling her ""despicable"" and saying she'd be removed from her position. Carter also sent videos that supposedly showed aborted fetuses CBS reported.

Fox Business reported that Southwest met with Carter over her Facebook posts and harassing messages. She was fired a week after the meeting.

Southwest said in court documents that it fired Carter because she made ""highly offensive"" posts on her Facebook where she was identifiable as an airline employee and for the harassing messages to Stone.

In a statement to Insider the airline said: ""Southwest Airlines has a demonstrated history of supporting our Employees' rights to express their opinions when done in a respectful manner. We are disappointed with this verdict and plan to appeal to the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals.""

So far this year 23% of all domestic and internationals flight in the U.S. have been delayed or disrupted according to flight tracking website FlightAware. On the Friday before July 4 that number rose to nearly 30%.

That means more paying customers than available seats on planes — and passengers are cashing in by giving up their seats on overbooked planes to the tune of thousands of dollars apiece. But airlines won't simply offer you that much money off the bat says Willis Orlando a senior flight expert at Scott's Cheap Flights. Rather he says you'll need to negotiate — and he has a few tips for any enterprising passenger willing to sacrifice their travel itinerary for a maximized amount of cash.

The airline's offer will typically start with a voice over an intercom. If you haven't boarded the plane yet you'll hear a gate agent offering some amount of money to give up your seat. If you're already on the plane it'll be a flight attendant looking for volunteers to get up and walk back into the airport.

Orlando's first tip: Quickly express interest but never take the airline's starting price.

""If you are flexible and you want to get that extra cash in your pocket ... run to the front and ask them for whatever the last person gets"" Orlando says. ""It's always the sweetest offer.""

You can sweeten other parts of your rebooked experience too. Orlando says airlines are often willing to let you into their exclusive lounges or let you select a high-value seat near the front of the plane on your rebooked flight. All you have to do is ask.

""They want to have guaranteed numbers ... almost no matter what"" Orlando says. ""Volunteering to get off puts the negotiation ball in your court.""

Orlando says airports in big cities like Chicago Washington D.C. and Los Angeles are more likely to experience flight disruptions than others since they're frequent hubs for layovers. The airlines that most frequently bump involuntary passengers are Frontier Southwest and American Airlines he adds.

The above-average dollar figures are likely for two reasons Orlando says: to ensure the plane takes off on time and to preserve the airline's reputation. If not enough passengers volunteer to get off a flight airlines have to forcibly ""bump"" passengers often resulting in a customer service nightmare.

""If a plane is delayed by two hours because of an issue of getting folks off an aircraft there are not enough crews and pilots to ensure that it doesn't ripple through their entire network"" Orlando says. ""Before the pandemic they weren't risking their entire network falling apart with one or two flights going haywire.""

If you do get forcibly bumped you'll at least be compensated for it: Federal law requires the airline to pay you up to four times your fare up to $1550 depending on when your rebooked flight departs.

Planes are typically overbooked due to airline optimism Orlando says. That's especially true this year: When spring hit airlines scheduled large numbers of flights in anticipation of high demand for summer travel.

That demand prediction came true Orlando says but the airlines didn't forecast a different problem: a lack of available employees to staff those flights. Some crew members furloughed or fired during the height of the pandemic didn't return and others are missing flights due to Covid-19 infections during the country's extended omicron wave.

The workers are accusing the coffee giant of union busting and questioning the company's motives for the recent announcement that it's closing five Seattle-area stores.

They also claim that Starbucks corporate is not willing to bargain with them even though the location at the corner of E Pike St and Minor Ave recently unionized.

So on Sunday the workers held a picket line in an effort to get the company to meet them at the bargaining table.

The employees laid out their list of demands for Starbucks which includes higher wages to meet inflation and better working conditions.

They're claiming this popular location is understaffed yet welcomes tour buses and also offers alcoholic drinks and a bakery.

(NBC Los Angeles)

RAFU STAFF REPORT

The Seattle-based Starbucks Corporation has announced plans to close two of its three locations in Little Tokyo citing safety concerns.

The closures are among six in Southern California and 16 across the U.S.

Starbucks stores at First and Los Angeles streets inside the DoubleTree Hotel and at Second and San Pedro streets in the Wakaba Apartments building will be closing as of July 31 according to a letter sent to employees on July 11 from company Vice Presidents Debbie Stroud and Denise Nelson.

The Starbucks at 138 S. Central Ave. (near Second Street) which in 2001 became Little Tokyo’s first Starbucks will remain open. Last May employees voted to unionize at that location becoming the first to do so in California. A Starbucks spokesperson said unionization did not factor into the decision to continue to operate there.

“We have yet to fully understand the impacts of these planned closures. What if anything could have been done to improve safety for their employees and customers and possibly prevent the closures?” said David Ikegami president of the Little Tokyo Business Association (LTBA).

“We need our government agencies Starbucks Corporation and Little Tokyo merchants to come together to address safety concerns proactively toward finding solutions.”

The corporation cited crime in the neighborhood as a factor in the decision to close the Little Tokyo locations.

For the Second and San Pedro location the incidents were often serious enough to require law enforcement intervention. In one instance an employee was accidentally stabbed by a used hypodermic needle while emptying the trash. On a different day an unhoused person was found in the restroom suffering from a heroin overdose.

Observers report that since the Starbucks restrooms are the only public toilet facilities available to non-customers the line for the bathroom is often longer than the line for coffee.

A Starbucks spokesperson told Rafu Shimpo “The company has been having conversations with our partners (staff) for several months including L.A. especially since Howard Schultz returned as CEO. Those partners expressed that they were challenged in their ability to effectively provide that welcoming experience that folks have come to expect from Starbucks both from partners and for customers.”

Steps according to the spokesperson include everything from limiting store hours to increasing staffing to changing store layouts to improve line-of-sight visibility. Hours of training including safety training de-escalation and mental health first-aid will be increased for new partners as well as existing partners.

“We reiterated (on Monday) to local leaders and store managers at the Second and San Pedro Street location that (they) have the discretion to reduce use of the restrooms to customers only” the spokesperson added.

“In L.A. we also have the outreach worker program that’s conducted in partnership with PATH a local nonprofit that partners with public institutions businesses grassroots group to address health challenges particularly those affecting the unhoused.”

All three locations in Little Tokyo have been receiving services from PATH.

Other locations in Hollywood West Hollywood and Santa Monica will be shuttered along with stores in Portland Seattle Philadelphia and Washington D.C.

Employees at the affected stores will be able to transfer to other locations."

Hjerpe a Capay Calif. native was named the National Pitcher of the Year by multiple organizations in 2022. He finished the season with an 11-2 record and 2.53 earned run average. He struck out a school-record 161 batters which led the nation in just 103 1/3 innings of work.

He was selected as a First-Team All-American seven times becoming just the second Oregon State pitcher – following Jake Thompson in 2017 – to be named a unanimous First-Team All-American.

Hjerpe was also a finalist for the Golden Spikes Award and Dick Howser Trophy which are both given annually to the nation's player of the year.

Hjerpe has pitched in 41 games for the Beavers over three seasons making 33 starts. He is 15-9 with a 3.37 ERA striking out 275 in 192 1/3 innings. Opponents have managed only a .197 batting average against him including a .180 mark in 2022.

He is the 13th Oregon State player to be selected in the first round and the first pitcher since Drew Rasmussen in 2017.

Hjerpe is the 11th Beaver to be selected by St. Louis and the first since Dylan Pearce in 2019.

Wade.

The event organized by UnRestrict Minnesota and other groups had thousands of attendees. In a press release organizers said more than 10000 people came to the rally while the State Patrol on Twitter estimated a crowd closer to 5000.

“This is just a very important issue for so many people and so many uterus-havers across the country” said 26-year-old Ela Engen who came out with friends from the Twin Cities.

While abortion will remain legal in Minnesota due to the 1995 state Supreme Court decision Doe v. Gomez — and many restrictions around the practice were recently ruled unconstitutional — the state is expected to see an influx of patients coming from other states to seek care.

That’s concerning for some health care workers including nurse April Brigham who said after experiencing the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic many workers are burned out.

“It’s a little scary just because we want to make sure we have access for everybody to have that care” Brigham said. “We’re already taxed to the max for health care right now.”

Marching from Saint Paul College to the state Capitol demonstrators shouted “my body my choice” and carried signs that read “we won’t go back.”

Once at the Capitol several speakers impressed upon the crowd that while the right to have an abortion remains in Minnesota the fight is not over yet.

“We are lucky abortion remains legal in Minnesota. In fact we are surrounded by states where abortion is now illegal or will be soon” said U.S. Rep. Ilhan Omar D-Minn. “Let me be clear just like in Congress they can go away in the blink of an eye.”

“So if you don't want to go back to a time when old ultra-conservative white men decide what you do with your body. You have to fight back with us” she continued.

Omar also went on to link the fight for abortion with access to birth control and LGBTQ rights particularly trans rights and the right to marry.

Other speakers at the event included Gov. Tim Walz Lt. Gov. Peggy Flanagan and Attorney General Keith Ellison as well as members of the state’s congressional Reproductive Freedom Caucus.

In a statement ahead of the rally Scott Fischbach executive director of the anti-abortion group Minnesota Citizens Concerned for Life alleged that the organizers of the rally “oppose even the most reasonable and modest abortion policies” including those recently struck down as unconstitutional and said the state can “do better to support and empower women and to value and protect children.”

Additionally advocates also announced a new campaign Sunday to push the city of Minneapolis to provide direct funding for abortion access. According to a press release groups Our Justice and Pro-Choice Minnesota as well as some city council members are calling on Mayor Jacob Frey to directly invest “in community networks providing abortion funding and practical support in his upcoming proposed budget.”

“The Mayor’s office is currently working with local jurisdictions like Hennepin County and partner organizations like Planned Parenthood to identify the best ways to maximize our impact — both through policy and investment — and ensure that Minneapolis continues to be a safe haven for those seeking an abortion” said Katie Lauer press secretary with the Mayor’s office in a statement. “If Council Members would like to be part of this work we would welcome their assistance.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiV2h0dHBzOi8vbnlwb3N0LmNvbS8yMDIyLzA3LzE2L2NocmlzLW11bGxpbi10YWxrcy1rbmlja3Mtb3V0bG9vay1zdC1qb2hucy1jb2xsZWdlLWhvb3BzL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Chris Mullin talks Knicks' outlook St. John's college hoops,"St. John’s legend and Hall of Famer Chris Mullin swished a Q&A with Post columnist Steve Serby at the grand opening of the the New York Roadshow — a new sports card and memorabilia store in Bronxville (www.roadshowcards.com).

Q: If you were the Knicks would you sacrifice RJ Barrett in a trade for Donovan Mitchell?

A: Look if you’re gonna get a player like that you’re gonna give something up you don’t want to give up. I think ideally they’d all be together and grow together. [Jazz exec] Danny Ainge looks like he wants picks.

Q: What if he insisted on Barrett would you do that deal to get Mitchell?

A: I probably would.

Q: Why would you sacrifice RJ?

A: This guy’s [Mitchell] a star. And you clearly feel like you need to change the landscape of your team. I’ve watched RJ from a distance. … To me look the talent’s there you see it but is that the guy you want to go forward with exclusively or is that a guy that Donovan Mitchell can do some of the things he does and you get something from someone else and fill in the gap. That’s when those deals become tough. To me it’s more the specifics and the inner details. OK RJ Barrett’s 6-7 he’s a young player — that everyone knows. It’s the other parts of him that become more important to me when you’re doing those deals ’cause is he really like an integral part of your team building moving forward. Look the Knicks have had talent. They haven’t been able to put a nice team together with chemistry and offensive flow and defensive coordination and symmetry.

Q: How would Mitchell fare in New York?

A: I love his playmaking ability. I just think he’s one of those guys that would welcome the big stage. Kind of a local kid. When I threw out the first pitch at Citi Field [2015] I met his dad [Donovan Sr. Mets senior director for DEI and player relations] there. Donovan had just gone to Louisville. He knows New York and … I think he’d be a good fit.

Q: Barrett?

A: Love RJ. Got to improve his consistency from the perimeter. Everything else is in place for him to be a big-time player. I know of him I know he’s a hard worker he’s a team guy — guys like that will improve.

Q: What are your thoughts on a potential Mitchell-Jalen Brunson backcourt?

A: Very exciting. Really good offensively. Donovan Mitchell’s one of those guys when you watch him you think he’s 6-4 6-5 — he plays so big and he’s so explosive. Sometimes he looks like a small forward almost. The biggest concern defensively now is obviously guarding the 3-point line but maybe more importantly is containing guys off the dribble. A lot of that’s physical like quickness and length and all but also what those two guys have they’re both very smart players. So there’s a way to make up for lack of athleticism and speed and quickness and that’s with your brain. That’s probably the main concern especially with a Tom Thibodeau team is containing at the point of attack so you’re not just getting blown by and all of a sudden now you got your bigs coming to help and now you’re in full rotations and you’re just chasing the ball for that possession. That’s probably the main concern — offense I think they’ll be dynamic they’ll be great. … I wouldn’t be overly concerned about that.

Q: Brunson?

A: Love Jalen. He’s a winner. Obviously he comes from Villanova under Jay Wright — incredibly fundamentally sound plays the right way. Old-school player. He doesn’t bomb 3s he can make an open 3 he’ll get to his mid-range he’s never out of control. I think he’ll bring a winning attitude to the Knicks.

Q: How much of a difference can he make?

A: I think on paper talent-wise he’s not a guy that sticks out as lifting the franchise but I think on a daily basis his seriousness his approach to the game will rub off on other players in a positive way.

Q: Thibodeau?

A: Incredible defensive intense basketball lifer. This is what he’s born to do. This is what he loves to do. I don’t think there’s much else in his life — 100 percent focus. And I think a little misread … he’s actually a really nice funny guy.

Q: What was your best St. John’s coaching moment?

A: Beating Duke at the Garden [2018].

Q: Were your four years as coach not as much fun as you thought it would be?

A: The only job I had that was fun was playing. … I never expected [coaching] to be fun. Four years was perfect. I’m glad I did it. But four years was enough.

Q: How do you want St. John’s fans to remember you as a coach?

A: Left it better than I found it.

Q: What did you learn as the St. John’s coach about the pressures and great expectations of the fan base for Chris Mullin the legendary hometown hero?

A: I felt a great sense of responsibility and accountability. I don’t know about so much pressure. I felt like I always put great expectations on everything I do. … I felt a lot of support a lot of love. With that comes responsibility. What I was trying to do was what Coach [Lou Carnesecca] did for me: coach the game of basketball of course. But then guide those young men through their college careers. There probably wasn’t a day that went by that I didn’t use something that Coach either taught me said to me … almost every day something popped up with one of my players that I kind of felt Coach’s guidance.

Q: It was almost like you were in a no-win situation when you started?

A: The fact of the matter was we inherited I think the least amount of minutes and points per game in the history of the game of basketball. It was starting from scratch and I understood that. So for me to go from eight to 14 to 16 to 21 [wins] … that’s a job well done. I’m really proud of my staff — six of the guys that worked for me one woman are on NBA staffs now. So I’m really proud of that. Everything was done aboveboard and I’m proud of that. Criticism always comes. I’m not on social media … that does not affect my move like one iota — never has by the way.

Q: Was there an added burden in your hometown on your family?

A: I don’t think so. My wife and daughter went back to California after my first year. My boys were in college already. My daughter [Kiera] went back to school she was homesick. She started high school in Queens and then didn’t make that transition. So there was no burden there. The burden was on me sitting in the house by myself (laugh). Me and my dog.

Q: What kind of dog?

A: Akita.

Q: Still alive?

A: Lost him we got another one. That was Kuma Japanese for bear now we have Kona.

Q: Did your brother Roddy have something to do with you stopping?

A: When I came back in 2015 he got diagnosed [with cancer]. So pretty much my whole four years he was coming to every game. So it was a great re-bonding with us. It wasn’t why I was doing it but it really was good for both of us. When he passed away not just the coaching part just life in general. He was three years older than me. Not that I needed someone to put my life in perspective but all of a sudden you kind of cherish that freedom that time of being back with doing what you want to do on your own time on your own schedule. He loved coming to the games he loved calling me after the games and talking about the players — I’m like it’s keeping him alive but it’s killing me (laugh). Especially the losses but … it definitely put me in a mind frame of I need to take a step back kind of just do my own thing. It was the right time. That wasn’t the only reason but it definitely was a wake-up call to me.

Q: Roddy lost his cancer battle at 58 before you took the Red Storm back to the NCAA Tournament in 2019.

A: He’d sit right behind me too. So I just saw the deterioration much like my dad [who succumbed to cancer in 1990]. But the blessing was we had four great years together. It’s amazing. He came on a bunch of road trips with us. It was good.

Q: When you made up your mind was that a painful conversation with Lou?

A: No not really. Not at all. Because I was very sure what I was doing. He said he was happy. It was an easy conversation. Very direct. He said “You did a good job and move on to the next thing you want to do.”

Q: What are your thoughts on the state of the St. John’s program and coach Mike Anderson?

A: Mike Anderson is a proven winning coach. I think they are set up for success this coming season.

Q: What do you think about Kevin Durant and Kyrie Irving situations with the Nets?

A: I think we all have to stay tuned. I don’t think it’s gonna be a quick transaction. And it may change. Who knows? Maybe they wind up staying I don’t know. I can see that happening. … Look they’re two of the greatest talented players we have in the game right now. So if they’re looking to win … they could stay together [in Brooklyn] and do that.

Q: Ben Simmons?

A: I really want to see him succeed. I’m anxious to see if he’s been working on his game a little bit. ’Cause he’s got a lot of God-given ability that could make him successful. And he obviously had the shooting free throw offensive liabilities that can be fixed in my mind. But his defense his speed his quickness the way he pushes the ball up the floor really a perfect complement to KD and Kyrie.

Q: Do you think Jay Wright would be a good NBA coach?

A: His demeanor his preparation. I think he might be a better NBA coach than he was a college coach. He’s just got that personality easygoing yet intense. I don’t know if he’s gonna do it. But I’d almost guarantee he’d be great at it.

Q: Describe former Duke star and Orlando top-overall pick Paolo Banchero.

A: Love him. Carmelo [Anthony] type a little bigger that type of game all-around game — post-game mid-game out to the 3. This day and age could probably play five positions. He could probably play center right now the way the game is.

Q: Chet Holmgren the second-overall pick by the Thunder out of Gonzaga?

A: It’s gonna be a big transition for him. At 7-1 you see the length he’s got great timing on defense blocking shots good awareness and awareness defensively. Offensively he can shoot the 3 he needs just a little bit of a Dirk [Nowitzki] type of mid-post just get it and shoot over people. So I think what they’re gonna do they’re gonna play smaller. If he hangs on the perimeter he’s basically small. So to me they’re gonna play a 3-man on him they’re not gonna play a center on him. Why would you? Everything I hear loves the game big-time competitor wants to succeed. To me he’s more like [Kristaps] Porzingis body type than he is KD.

Q: No. 3-overall pick by Houston Jabari Smith out of Auburn?

A: Of those three as talented but maybe has a little more seasoning to do. Pretty big-time shooter incredible athlete.

Q: What do you think of the transfer portal?

A: Kind of a disaster. It’s kind of like the opposite of what you would do if you were trying to build a team.

Q: As a player you would like it right?

A: Yeah I mean I transferred high schools who am I to talk about it?

9 Chris Mullin Sports Illustrated

Q: You think it hurts the game?

A: I don’t think it helps. I’m getting back to the team building — you just flip around. It’s got that kind of bailout mentality to it. The players have the right to do what they want to do now they have it but just ’cause you have it you need to use it properly and have people help you with your decisions. You got guys going to transfer portal who get 35 minutes a game. It seems like they’re in a really good situation and they’re going somewhere else for … which gets into the NIL.

Q: How would you have done with NIL?

A: As a player? I think pretty damn good (laugh).

Q: What kind of endorsements do you think you might have had?

A: Back then I woulda had a lot of endorsements. I’m sure a few of the local pubs on Flatbush Avenue would have funded me. ’Cause I was funding them!

Q: What is your opinion of NIL?

A: Some schools have it all figured out and locked in it seems like. And some don’t.

Q: What do you remember about Duke coach Mike Krzyzewski’s recruitment of you?

A: A lot. I got some on my phone here some of his letters … I got stacks of handwritten letters from him.

Q: How often did he write?

A: A lot. He wrote to me he wrote to my mom he wrote to my dad he wrote to all three of us. We got really close during that process.

Q: When did he start writing those letters?

A: My junior year. I think when I went over to Xaverian from Power. That was his first year at Duke. And then the following year was his first recruiting year. Put it this way: Coach Carnesecca was the first one to come into my house. And he said “I’m not gonna bother you at all.” I knew Coach since I was 10. Did the meeting laid everything out — “I’m not gonna bother you.” About midway through my senior year he goes “I need to come in again.” (laugh)

Q: Did your mom serve him pasta?

A: My mother made a great lasagna but she’s Irish. I don’t know what Coach would say about that (chuckle). I’m sure Coach said it was great.

Q: He faked his way through it?

A: Exactly. He was recruiting me! (Laugh).

Q: At that time you just wanted to stay home?

A: When I went on those recruiting trips — I went to Virginia Duke Louisville — the weekends were great. By Wednesday I had forgot about it.

Q: How do you think Jon Scheyer will do replacing Coach K?

A: I think really well. I think the fact that he’s been around Coach K for so many years he played there he knows the dynamic of Duke. I know he’s already got some recruits in place seems like a very composed poised young man. And Coach K will help when needed.

Q: What did you think of Coach K’s swan song?

A: I thought his last year was amazing. I thought for him he handled it beautifully. I was just impressed with the way the young players handled that barrage of every day … of their John Wooden.

Q: What do you think of new Seton Hall coach Shaheen Holloway?

A: Love Shaheen. He was assistant at Seton Hall the years I was coaching at St. John’s. I knew him a bit as a player. He’s your typical New York … basketball junkie. He loves it he lives it he teaches it. He can relate to the kids. He’s been through everything as a player and coach. Beautiful that he got back to Seton Hall. Incredible run.

Q: What did you think of his Saint Peter’s team?

A: It was amazing. It was like watching a Riverside Church team or something get together and all of a sudden get hot. No one knows what the hell’s going on as they’re blowing these big programs out.

Q: So what would you tell the Big East about Seton Hall now?

A: Well Seton Hall’s been pretty damn good for a number of years now under Kevin Willard. Look college it’s like anything: If they get players they’re gonna do fine. If they don’t they’re gonna struggle.

Q: Tim Hardaway once said that you played the game like you were black.

A: (Laugh) I take that as a compliment. Part of my upbringing when I went to Power Memorial High School — midtown Manhattan 61st and Amsterdam — that’s when I started going uptown to Riverside Church up to Harlem up to The Bronx. That’s where I learned a big part of my game was playing in the parks with everybody with all different types of players with all different types of backgrounds. And to me the basketball part became obvious. But maybe one of the biggest educational parts of my life was traveling the city on the trains going to different neighborhoods meeting kids that didn’t have two parents like I did. Didn’t have someone home when they came home from school. It opened up my eyes a lot to real life.

Q: Do you remember the very first time you went to one of those playgrounds?

A: It was intimidating. Felt pressure to perform. The funny thing about that too though was you feel relieved when you have a good game. But then the next time up you gotta do it again. Even if it was the day later it didn’t matter.

Q: Did Mario Elie go with you at that time?

A: Mario Ed Pinckney. Eddie used to walk me to the train station a lot. That was my guy. That was my bodyguard.

Q: Lou once said: “I watch him and I see Joe DiMaggio in center field.”

A: That’s probably the hugest compliment Coach can give ’cause Coach always referenced Joe DiMaggio. I remember distinctly him telling me Joe DiMaggio never had to get his uniform dirty. Because at the sound of the bat he knows where the ball’s going. He never had to dive for the ball. So anticipation and awareness … feel for the game.

Q: Game on the line the world is about to end one person to take a last-second shot: You or Steph Curry?

A: Steph Curry.

Q: Is he the best shooter you’ve ever seen?

A: He is because of his variety and the fact that he can get his shot off off the dribble and off screens. So he’s just so dynamic with and without the basketball.

Q: You’d be No. 2 then?

A: I’ll be in the top 10 (laugh).

Q: When you watched him at Davidson did you think he would amount to what he is?

A: I went to the game in the Garden when he played West Virginia. No preconceived … just to go watch. I couldn’t take my eyes off him. I don’t really know why I think it was his activity with and without the basketball. He didn’t have a great game he had a good game made big shots at the end. I saw an All-Star. I didn’t see a two-time unanimous MVP four-time champ game-changer. But he had something that was different. Everyone was talking about his body that never bothered me whatsoever. But I just didn’t think he’d be this good.

Q: Who are players you like to watch other than Steph?

A: I love Klay [Thompson]. … I love the kid Ja Morant. Just his relentlessness his ability to finish in the paint. Not only over bigger players around ’em. Unique skill set for a smaller guard. I think he led the league in points in the paint. I love his tenaciousness his energy. I love [Nikola] Jokic. He’s a throwback guy too like a [Larry] Bird type or Magic [Johnson] almost. There’s so many great young players.

Q: Zion Williamson?

A: He’s gotta stay healthy. He looks like he’s healthy now. I think he’s gonna be dynamic. He’s like a Charles Barkley. He has his own little category. He’s not a 5 he’s not a 4. But he scores big he shoots incredibly high from the field he’s a good passer. He’s just gotta stay healthy.

Q: Is there anyone in today’s game who reminds you of you?

A: Joe Ingles a little bit.

Q: If you could go one-on-one against anybody in NBA history who would it be?

A: Walt Frazier. He was my idol I loved everything about him his style. He was I think an underrated player overall. His skill — his ballhandling his jump shot he had a post game — he did everything. He was the guy I watched all the time.

Q: How would your wardrobe game compare to his?

A: (Looks down at T-shirt and laughs) I got khakis and a blue T-shirt on. Totally different league.

Q: If you could pick the brain of any player in NBA history who would it be?

A: I sat down once with him but didn’t pick his brain: John Havlicek. … It was more of a social gathering.

Q: What could you have asked him?

A: I met him during the ’84 Olympics. Bobby [Knight] was our coach he was Bobby’s teammate. Had dinner with him. … But just his relentless … kind of like Steph and Klay. Moving without the basketball. His commitment to fitness. And then being able to be so successful as a sixth man for many years and then becoming the face of that franchise. His humility his ability to just blend in but yet most people don’t know he’s still the leading scorer in Celtics history. I think that’s the way he lived his life — very humble didn’t make too much that he was the star basketball player. Just was John Havlicek.

Q: Kind of like the way you were.

A: Again Walt Frazier I saw more. But I was told to always watch John Havlicek.

Q: What adjectives would you use to describe Chris Mullin the basketball player?

A: Fundamentally sound … my game revolved around my shooting that opened up the rest of my game opened up my passing opened up my ability to get by much more athletic much quicker players … good court awareness … team defender (laugh).

Q: I would think of “crafty” “savvy” or “moxie.”

A: I would say feel for the game. I learned the game from playing one-on-one two-on-two three-on-three and all those games are different. There’s different angles there’s different shots that are available you have to get open different ways. That’s the way I was taught — one-on-one two-on-two three-on-three four-on-four to build up to five-on-five. But along the way you’re learning all different skills.

Q: What are you most proud of about your Hall of Fame basketball career?

A: Consistency. Being able to succeed at high school college NBA Olympics. Each level I was able to adjust to and then get to a good level at every stage of my career. And then being able to get knocked down and get back up.

Q: What are you most proud of in life?

A: Being sober. No question. That’s my greatest life achievement. One that keeps me on my toes each and every day every minute of the day. But it has brought me so many blessings. It helped my basketball career obviously at that time but more importantly it’s really helped me in life way beyond sports work … just life — being a father being a husband all the things that I’ve been able to evolve into from that. It’s the greatest blessing in my life.

Q: Regrets in both?

A: In basketball nothing keeps me up at night but [the 1985] Final Four loss to Georgetown. Looking back that’s always something that you know you’re one game away right? But we lost to a pretty damn good team (laugh).

9 Chris Mullin poses with his family. MediaNews Group via Getty Images

Q: How do you think you would have done against Villanova?

A: Oh we definitely woulda beat them. It was one of those matchup things. Regret yeah but not anything that keeps me up at night. And then same thing with the NBA. We got real close with the Pacers good run. … In life … that’s a tough one man. Because most of my regrets … maybe early on when I was a youngster carrying on before I got sober — but that led me to getting sober. Both of them are to me part of this journey that got me here.

Q: You’re a Mets fan. How would you like a Subway World Series?

A: That’s what the city needs.

Q: Favorite NYC pizza?

A: John’s of Bleecker.

Q: Describe your oldest child Sean 30.

A: He works in medical device sales. He lives in Boston. Sean is incredibly intelligent — not like me — very outdoorsy very independent incredible athlete great lacrosse player. Second is my son Chris [28] lives in San Francisco works for a sports marketing company. Chrissy’s a mama’s boy (laugh). Liam is 25 lives here in New York. He’s a throwback to like one of my father’s brothers. He’s an old soul. He reminds me of one of my uncles. He’s a Brooklyn kid. He’s investigating and working in the CBD industry. My daughter Kiera is 21. She’ll be a senior at the University of San Diego. She lives in the Bay Area goes home school in San Diego and summers in the Hamptons — she’s the smartest of all of us. Very easygoing sweet. … I’d say she’s like her two grandmothers combined.

Q: Your wife Liz?

A: She’s been my best friend for over 35 years now. We’ve been through ups and downs sideways everything together. We just celebrated our 30th wedding anniversary. And … life is good. We keep moving we keep going on the journey together. We’re having a blast. And now she’s an insane pickleball maniac.

Q: What’s it like being Chris Mullin today?

A: I got a great life right now. I do the Warriors pre- and postgame. I get to watch an incredible team incredible players I don’t travel I just stay home. The only traveling I did was to The Finals. So I love it.

Q: How would you describe your life now?

A: Calm … peaceful … and mellow. No turbulence. No drama.

Q: If there was a movie about your life what would the title be?

A: “A Kid From Flatbush.” (smile)",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiggFodHRwczovL3d3dy5sb2JzZXJ2YXRldXIuY29tLzIwMjIvMDcvMTYvc3Qtam9obi1wYXJpc2gtc2Nob29scy1hbm5vdW5jZS1wcm9tb3Rpb25zLW5ldy1wcmluY2lwYWwtYXNzaXN0YW50LXByaW5jaXBhbC1uYW1lZC1hdC13c2ov0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,St. John Parish Schools announce promotions; New principal assistant principal named at WSJ - L'Observateur,"St. John Parish Schools announce promotions; New principal assistant principal named at WSJ Published 12:03 am Saturday July 16 2022

The company said that the PDR was part of a technical process to ensure that its design can realize a precise low-cost speed-of-light technology for military operations.

In March 2021 the US Department of Defense (DoD) awarded Northrop Grumman a $72 million contract under the High Energy Laser Scaling Initiative (HELSI) to demonstrate a HEL prototype using Northrop Grumman’s coherent beam combining technology.

The HELSI is a Pentagon initiative to develop a new 300-kilowatt-class laser weapon prototype for technology demonstration.

“This is an important step in combining high-power laser beams into a single beam that can be scaled for maximum power” said Robert Fleming vice president and general manager strategic space systems Northrop Grumman.

“We’re on track to demonstrate the technology leveraging our decades of experience in the field.”

According to the company the prototype can be scaled up to more than a megawatt. It will be tested at progressively higher powers later this year to prove the coherent beam combining (CBC) design.

Beam combining involves combining the outputs of multiple laser sources to obtain a single high-energy output beam. In contrast ‘Coherent’ beam incorporation would involve the merger of coherent waves – waves with a constant phase difference.

Another method to fuse two laser beams is ‘Spectral’ beam combining (SBC) also known as wavelength beam combining which involves superimposing the outputs of several laser emitters at specific wavelengths in an area to form a single beam.

The SBC technology was used by Lockheed Martin and its subsidiary Aculight Corporation to demonstrate a series of laser weapon prototypes: first the 30 kilowatts then 60 kilowatts and ultimately 100 kilowatts in October 2019 which then also won them a HELSI contract to demonstrate a 300 kilowatts class laser in 2022.

Lockheed Martin is only one of the three companies participating in the HELSI initiative led by the Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD) and the US Army promotes it. Other companies are Nutronics Inc. sponsored by the Navy and General Atomics sponsored by the US Air Force (USAF).

In May 2020 Dynetics also announced that it would work to increase the power of a 100 kW-class system to the 300kW-class system for the US Army and demonstrate a prototype in 2022.

High-Energy Lasers US Military’s Top Priority

The incorporation of laser weapons technology is currently one of the high-priority targets of the US military especially after the US lawmakers asked the armed services to speed up efforts toward developing Directed Energy Weapons (DEWs) in early July.

The US Army plans to have two types of laser weapons systems for air defense by 2022 which include the 50 kilowatts class weapons and 300 kilowatts class weapons fitted on Stryker armored vehicles manufactured by General Dynamics.

The 50-kilowatt laser weapon is designated as the DE-MSHORAD (Directed Energy – Maneuver Short-Range Air Defense) which will be used to shoot short-range rockets artillery and drones. In contrast the 300 kilowatts beams will be used against cruise missiles.

Initially Northrop Grumman and Raytheon competed for the 50-kilowatt laser weapon system. Still Northrop Grumman dropped out of the program while Raytheon recently demonstrated its prototype in May against 60-millimeter mortars and several small medium and large drones.

Meanwhile the US Air Force received its first high-energy laser weapon on July 12 called LANCE (or Laser Advancements for Next-generation Compact Environments) from Lockheed Martin.

LANCE is a pod weapon that can be fitted on an aircraft with the primary laser weapon supplied by Lockheed Martin and the pod carrying LANCE made by Boeing. Also the beam control system that trains the laser on its target is provided by Northrop Grumman.

It is unclear how much power this new laser weapon will produce but reports indicate it will probably not exceed 100 kilowatts.

It is also unknown which aircraft this podded laser weapon will ultimately be tested on or deployed. However Lockheed Martin had previously shown the pod carried by an F-16 fighter jet in its concept art. At the same time Boeing had tested a pre-prototype pod shape on a USAF F-15 fighter.",,,,,,,,,,,,

Commissioners recommended approving plans for a warehouse and distribution center at 1010 Harvard Ave and a warehouse and water bottle manufacturing facility at 2680 Commerce Center Boulevard. Neither plan received substantial revisions.

Here is a look at the projects:

1010 Harvard Ave.

The 53700 warehouse at 1010 Harvard Ave. will be constructed on a 5.73-acre-lot adjacent to UGI Energy Services and will include eight loading docks two ramps and 63 parking spaces. Two two-way driveways will allow vehicles to enter and exit from Harvard Avenue and Hellertown Road.

Andrew Bohl project manager at Hanover Engineering Associates representing the developer Triple New Investments LX LLC said trucks will only be allowed to make right-hand turns onto Harvard Avenue and Route 412 which was a concern raised by the city’s planning and zoning director Darlene Heller.

Bohl said the developer met Monday with the Pennsylvania Department of Transportation to discuss plans to modify an existing driveway that opens to Route 412. He said several options are being considered in the plans including widening the driveway’s mouth. The developer is waiting on further communication from PennDOT he said.

The commission also asked for the developer to continue to keep LANTA updated on any plans that may interfere with a bus stop located along a portion of the lot facing Route 412.

The commission approved the plans unanimously under the condition that the developer follow all of PennDOT’s requirements and share plans with the city about a proposed retaining wall.

The commission pulled a motion at the last minute that would have required the developer to also include signs indicating “No Through Traffic” at the driveway entrances.

2680 Commerce Center Blvd.

Bohl represented Push Holding Inc. the developer of a 136000-square-foot manufacturing site and warehouse at 2680 Commerce Center Blvd. Bohl said the client was water bottle manufacturer and packaging company Axium.

Eight loading docks 98 parking spaces for passenger vehicles two driveways along Commerce Center Boulevard a loading door and use of the existing railway are proposed for the site. The manufacturer plans to use the direct rail access to transport bulk materials like plastic pellets from the Lehigh Valley Rail yard to the proposed site he said:

“(The rail line) was one of the things that drew our client to the property because they have property they’re leasing in LVIP VII and they actually have to truck bulk materials from the Lehigh Valley Rail yard over to their facility. This will alleviate some congestion for the city as well.”

The developer’s plans included minor adjustments to the rail line.

The property at 2680 Commerce Center is one of the last remaining vacant lots within Lehigh Valley Industrial Park VII.

Both projects are awaiting further approval from the local conservation districts for permit amendments Bohl said.

Second Avenue Vacation

In other business the planning commission approved vacating 89 feet of Second Avenue. George Mowers and Charlene Donchez Mowers said vacating the land will save the city the expense of maintaining the property. The lot is a remnant from the Peron Armory project.

NextPit has thought long and hard about this matter on your behalf and come up with this complete comparison so that you can dive deep into what an MVNO is the difference between an MVNO and a classic operator the primary MVNO players and the pros and cons of an MVNO.

Jump to:

MVNO: What is it?

What is an MVNO?

MVNO stands for Mobile Virtual Network Operator. An MVNO is a telephone operator that does not own a mobile network or its very own infrastructure. It is therefore an operator who has agreed to use the existing infrastructure of a traditional mobile operator such as AT&T Verizon T-Mobile and US Cellular (who happen to be the MNO or Mobile Network Operator) to operate its network.

For the record MVNOs first began to operate in the US in 2011. The United States sports four major carriers and all of them are the backbone for the 139 MVNOs serving up to 36 million active subscribers as of April 2019 based on a GSMA report. in fact major States in the USA have also collaborated with a few MVNOs in order to deliver highly accessible mobile and broadband services due to the highly subsidized rate.

MVNOs proved to be very attractive because they offer particularly competitive rates. Over in Europe Virgin Mobile actually made waves in 2007 by offering an initial SMS offer for just €1. MVNOs are not just a local phenomenon but a worldwide one. There is a digital transformation happening Stateside where it is within expectations that MVNOs would target IoT and machine-to-machine (M2M) and connectivity. These providers will then be able to further push the boundaries of out-of-the-box connectivity that are bundled alongside devices and other services within the connected world.

This degree of connectivity is not limited to vehicles medical devices wearables and industrial equipment and there does not look as though there is any stopping it. MVNOs happen to be well positioned to cater to this industry due to their interesting business model and the future looks bright for MVNOs.

How does an MVNO work?

On the one hand there are the traditional operators the MNOs such as Verizon T-Mobile AT&T and US Cellular. MVNOs piggyback on the network of these MNOs. This relationship can be direct but also through intermediaries the MVNE and MVNA.

MVNE or Mobile Virtual Network Enablers are companies that help MVNOs in their network operation. They facilitate relations with MNOs provide administrative logistical and sometimes even accounting support.

MVNAs or Mobile Virtual Network Aggregators are intermediaries who buy network consumption units in bulk from MNOs and then resell them to MVNOs.

Regarding network quality MVNOs are expected to offer the same quality as the operator whose infrastructure they are using. However the reality is that speeds sometimes differ although there is no evidence that this is a deliberate limitation by the MVNO.

Customers generally choose an MVNO because of its lower prices than those of traditional operators. This kind of lower pricing is made possible mainly due to the fact that MVNOs do not spend money to maintain the network and also due to their subscription mode and the degree of customer service offered.

Indeed unlike traditional operators MVNOs do not have stores or at least physical locations where customers can go. Therefore the only way to subscribe to their offers is through their website. After signing up for a subscription you will receive a SIM card in due time of which you can insert into your smartphone and start reaping the chosen package's benefits.

As with traditional operators you will also have the possibility to pick up a smartphone with your subscription but the prices are also generally higher than with traditional operators.

When it comes to customer service you normally have to go through the website or communicate by email. Some MVNOs have the advantage of offering a telephone customer service but that is few and far in between.

The different types of MVNO

There are several categories of MVNO. For this article we have listed for you the main types of MVNO with examples for each of them. We find on the market MVNO general public and those who target professionals.

Low-cost MVNO or consumer MVNO: While an MVNO is by definition supposed to be already more affordable than a traditional operator low-cost MVNOs go even further and offer very low prices thanks to their control of operating costs. Example: Boom! Mobile.

Boom! Mobile. Ethnic MVNOs: These MVNOs with a rather strange name is an old category that offers packages or prepaid SIM cards to their customers depending on their nationality or residence. Basically the idea is to target expatriates tourists or migrant workers by offering very attractive prices for calls abroad. Example: Lycamobile.

Basically the idea is to target expatriates tourists or migrant workers by offering very attractive prices for calls abroad. Lycamobile. MVNOs for professionals: These MVNOs offer mobile plans that are dedicated to companies and sometimes provide specific services to companies. Example: DataXoom.

These MVNOs offer mobile plans that are dedicated to companies and sometimes provide specific services to companies. DataXoom. Brand licenses: These MVNOs target a well-defined clientele by relying on a well-known brand. Example: Google Fi.

These MVNOs target a well-defined clientele by relying on a well-known brand. Google Fi. The ""full"" MVNO: This type of MVNO has all the features of a classic mobile operator (voice mail platform mobile switching center and interactive voice server) except for the network coverage. Example: Boost Mobile.

Classic operator vs MVNO: what is the difference?

In the US there are four major telephone operators: AT&T T-Mobile US Cellular and Verizon. AT&T is the leading operator in terms of number of subscribers and T-Mobile is the leader in terms of 5G coverage across the vast country.

The so-called ""classic"" operators are those who handle all stages of the provision of their services. In addition to providing network access they also handle marketing sales billing and customer support.

What really distinguishes traditional operators from MVNOs is that they have their own infrastructure with network antennas cabling and all the required equipment. As mentioned above it is the lack of maintenance and development costs for these infrastructures that allows MVNOs to be so competitive on their rates. They do not have the same kind of expenses as traditional operators.

Apart from the fact that MVNOs do not have their own network and therefore use those of traditional operators there are other subtle differences to look out for between these two types of operators.

The offers from most MVNOs tend to have very little or no commitment at all and just a few of them offer additional services with their packages whereas traditional operators offer free or paid options such as Multi-SIM or an International Pass.

However MVNO offers are not synonymous with poor network quality as MVNOs are supposed to offer the same coverage quality as the traditional operator whose network they piggyback on. This is ensured by the fact that the operators providing the network to MVNOs have a legal obligation to provide the same network performance to the MVNO's customers as they do to their own customers. Compliance with these obligations is monitored by the authorities.

So whether you take your package with Good2Go Mobile or FreeUP Mobile on the AT&T network or with Google Fi on the T-Mobile or US Cellular network for example you will benefit from the same network quality and same speed in principle.

The main MVNOs available in US

There are over a hundred MVNOs available to the masses in the US. To go through all of them is not recommended which is why we have decided to whittle down the very best from the respective MNOs in the table below.

To find the complete list of all MVNOs operating in the US you may check it out here.

Pros and cons of MVNOs

In order to better guide your choice it is important to know the advantages and disadvantages of MVNOs. Do the savings you make on the subscription price require sacrifices that you are willing to make?

The pros of choosing an MVNO over a traditional operator

The main advantage of MVNOs is that they offer more competitive prices. Their offers are also more flexible compared to those from traditional operators. By choosing an MVNO you will not have to worry about cancellation fees as most of the packages do not come with a contract. In addition signing up is a fast and simple process.

The fast activation of your package is also an advantage. Whether it's a question of subscription or customer service everything goes through the MVNO's website. You will keep the freedom to change your offer at your convenience so that you always have the package that has your best interests all the time.

The MVNO offer is highly customizable to meet other requirements whether you require a package with very little data just to be able to make calls or whether you consume a whole lot of data. For instance you will be able to benefit from targeted packages that favor international communications.

Moreover these offers are renewed very frequently and there are often interesting promotions on the prices of the packages.

The disadvantages of choosing an MVNO over a traditional operator

The promotional offers of MVNOs are too limited in time and force consumers to keep up to date in order not to miss anything. Doing so can be a time-consuming exercise. Also customer service can sometimes leave a sour taste in the mouth and is something to be desired which leads some of their customers to be dissatisfied and voice their concerns on social media.

MVNOs are also suspected of throttling data as you most probably have heard of such things by now. Even if legally this is not supposed to happen there are many customer feedbacks that complain about it. Given that MVNOs purchase the amount of calls in bulk to provide their customers with such service it would seem logical if they were to pay by the amount of calls provided. If MVNOs are paying for the amount of traffic they provide to their customers it would seem logical that they would be tempted to throttle speeds especially in high-traffic areas such as large cities.

It is impossible to choose the network that the MVNO will operate on. Of course there are MVNOs with exclusive contracts but some operate across several different networks. With these MVNOs the allocation of the network is performed randomly. It can be frustrating to be on the AT&T network when you want to be on the US Cellular network and vice versa.

On the other hand just a few MVNOs offer 5G at the moment. It is only available as an option for a fee such as Pulse Cellular or is reserved for the most expensive plan.

That's it for now in this comparison of MVNO and traditional operators. Now the choice is yours to select what suits you best according to your needs. Are you currently with an operator or an MVNO? Why or why not? Would you be willing to change your plan and sign up with an MVNO?",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMijAFodHRwczovL2lvdGJ1c2luZXNzbmV3cy5jb20vMjAyMi8wNy8xNi8zNTUzMy1iZXJnLWluc2lnaHQtc2F5cy1nbG9iYWwtY2VsbHVsYXItaW90LWNvbm5lY3Rpb25zLWdyZXctMjItcGVyY2VudC10by1yZWFjaC0yLTEtYmlsbGlvbi1pbi0yMDIxL9IBkAFodHRwczovL2lvdGJ1c2luZXNzbmV3cy5jb20vMjAyMi8wNy8xNi8zNTUzMy1iZXJnLWluc2lnaHQtc2F5cy1nbG9iYWwtY2VsbHVsYXItaW90LWNvbm5lY3Rpb25zLWdyZXctMjItcGVyY2VudC10by1yZWFjaC0yLTEtYmlsbGlvbi1pbi0yMDIxL2FtcC8?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Berg Insight says global cellular IoT connections grew 22 percent to reach 2.1 billion in 2021,"A new report from the IoT market research firm Berg Insight says that the global number of cellular IoT subscribers increased by 22 percent during 2021 to reach 2.1 billion.

The major regional markets China Western Europe and North America grew similarly during the year as the world recovered from the COVID-19 pandemic. By 2026 Berg Insight now projects that there will be 4.3 billion IoT devices connected to cellular networks worldwide.

The top ten mobile operators reported a combined active base of 1.8 billion cellular IoT connections at the end of 2021 accounting for 86 percent of total connections. China Mobile is the world’s largest provider of cellular IoT connectivity services with an estimated 801 million cellular IoT connections. China Unicom and China Telecom ranked second and third with 300 million and 297 million connections respectively.

Vodafone ranked first among the Western operators and fourth overall with 142 million connections followed by AT&T with 95 million in fifth place. Deutsche Telekom and Verizon had in the range of 45–55 million cellular IoT connections each when counting T-Mobile USA’s customers as part of DT’s IoT subscriber base. Telefónica KDDI and Orange were the last players in the top ten with about 31 million 23 million and 20 million connections respectively. The year-on-year growth rates for the largest operators were in the span of 0–41 percent.

IoT connectivity services account for around 1 percent of total revenues for most operator groups. Berg Insight’s analysis of the IoT business KPIs released by mobile operators in different parts of the world suggests that global IoT connectivity revenues increased by around 15 percent during 2020 while the monthly APRU dropped by 2 percent to € 0.38.

The shift to embedded SIMs or eSIMs is currently one of the strongest trends within the IoT connectivity market. Automotive OEMs stand out as early adopters of the technology which is now experiencing broad uptake across a range of vertical markets. Leveraging the benefits of the two existing eSIM specifications – M2M and Consumer – GSMA’s new IoT specification is set to further accelerate uptake of the technology as it will eliminate the need for integrations between mobile operators and provide greater flexibility for IoT solution providers.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiO2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFuZHJvaWRhdXRob3JpdHkuY29tL3doYXQtaXMtYy1iYW5kLTVnLTMwOTQzMTUv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,C-Band 5G: What is it and where is it available?,"Luke Pollack / Android Authority

5G nomenclature is already a rather complex and winding topic and it’s received yet another layer of convolution with the introduction of C-Band 5G. The term made headlines in early 2022 when AT&T and Verizon added support for C-Band 5G to their networks. But don’t fret it’s thankfully not a whole other standard to get familiar with. Instead this latest term simply refers to the introduction of more frequency bands into the already broad spectrum landscape.

Put simply C-Band 5G allows carriers to increase their spectrum diversity through the use of mid-band frequencies. This allows them to deliver faster speeds and better coverage to their customers or at least those that own compatible smartphones. The term covers an important piece of spectrum for carriers aiming to provide median 5G speeds in excess of 100Mbps rather than just peak speeds. Read more: What is 5G and what can we expect from it?

If you’re eager to learn a little bit more about what is C-Band 5G and where is it available then read on for Android Authority’s complete guide on the topic.

C-Band 5G: Everything you need to know

You may already be familiar with 5G spectrum terms like mmWave and sub-6GHz which define a range of network frequencies and bands used by carriers to send and receive 5G data. C-Band is another one of those terms although it’s most typically associated with US network deployments.

More specifically C-Band refers to radio frequency bands between 4 and 8GHz according to the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) — although in the case of the US the FCC designates the range as between 3.7 and 4.2GHz. Technically that’s already classed as a sub-6GHz spectrum and the International Telecommunication Union (ITU) has divided up C-band into the n77 (3.7GHz) n78 (3.5GHz) and n79 (4.7GHz) bands you’ll find in use around the world right now. So you could already be reading this on a C-Band 5G connection.

C-Band occupies a frequency sweet spot in terms of broad coverage and fast speeds.

The term has a slightly different connotation in the US where the spectrum was previously allocated for satellite TV back in the 1970s. In 2020 the FCC announced that it would reallocate much of this spectrum for 5G use. The subsequent auctions around the 3.7GHz band ended in February 2021 and raised $81 billion with the majority of band licenses grabbed by AT&T and Verizon.

C-Band 5G is so popular because it occupies a frequency sweet spot in terms of wide coverage and fast speeds. You may have noticed that the FFC’s definition falls right between the popular 2.4 and 5GHz Wi-Fi bands. If you’ve been following sub-6GHz deployment you’ll know that these frequencies form the backbone of 5G coverage as they offer many benefits (including better range) compared to mmWave making them well suited for rural as well as urban coverage.

The similar benefits of C-Band explain why AT&T and Verizon — two carriers that previously focused heavily on mmWave deployment — are now particularly interested in these bands. Data from the speed test behemoth Ookla highlights that T-Mobile is way ahead in median 5G network speeds owing to its superior sub-6GHz coverage.

Where is C-Band 5G available?

Edgar Cervantes / Android Authority

As previously mentioned the global 5G spectrum that could be classed as C-Band is already widely in use around the world. Specifically bands n77 n78 and n79 are up and running across Australia China the European Union (including the United Kingdom) Hong Kong Isreal Japan New Zealand the Philippines Singapore South Korea and more.

By comparison the US situation is in the much earlier stages owing to delayed licensing and aviation disputes which we’ll get to in a minute. Verizon flipped on its C-Band 5G switch on January 19 2022. The carrier has yet to provide a coverage map for these latest frequencies but wants to bring its 5G Ultra Wideband service to 1700 cities by the end of January. Customers will see a “5G UW” or “5G UWB” icon when connected to this part of its network.

AT&T also activated its C-Band service on the same date with Austin Dallas-Fort Worth Houston Chicago Detroit Jacksonville Orlando and South Florida covered in the initial rollout. AT&T devices will display a 5G+ indicator when connected.

It’s worth noting that AT&T and Verizon have voluntarily agreed to limit C-Band 5G deployment in the vicinity of airports until July 2023 owing to an ongoing dispute over whether the technology interferes with aircraft radio altimeters. The FCC is testing and certifying flight altimeters to check for C-Band interference and has a 220MHz “guard band” already in effect. The airport argument appears to be easing off but time will tell if these efforts are enough to appease the airlines. Other countries have similar restrictions on C-Band use near airports. Fortunately other 5G frequencies can still be used in and around airports so your coverage shouldn’t drop out.

Although AT&T and Verizon may have pinched the most recent headlines they’re not the only US carriers with C-Band and similar sub-6GHz frequencies at their disposal. T-Mobile purchased an average of 40MHz of C-Band which it plans to deploy to over 225 million people. Not forgetting it already snapped up Sprint’s 2.5GHz (n41) mid-band spectrum in the merger which serves a similar widespread coverage purpose to C-Band. Minor carriers that piggyback on AT&T and Verizon networks such as Visible will also benefit from C-Band coverage. See also: 5G plans in the US — What are your options?

Does my phone support C-Band 5G?

Dhruv Bhutani / Android Authority

As C-Band 5G already falls under well-defined sub-6GHz bands many existing 5G phones already support the required technologies. Below is by no means a complete list of popular phones that feature the necessary bands and do note that some carrier requirements may vary especially when bringing your own handset.

“you just sent a payment” Scam

Not to be outdone other scammers have been sending out their own phishing SMS text messages — although they’re not terribly original. It’s the classic fake alert in which the would-be victim has supposedly sent a payment to someone and must now follow the phishing link in order to dispute the transaction. The only problem is that once you fall for it and provide your credentials you’ll lose much more than the original (and fake) amount.

Yet I walked away with a copy of Grand Theft Auto V on the PlayStation 5. As someone who had purchased the game on the PlayStation 3 shortly after its launch I returned it because it didn’t conform to my gaming preferences at the time. Therefore why did I decide then was the day to nab myself a copy? The answer will likely elude me forever. Even though I have yet to make much progress through the main campaign and probably should would things ever quieten down I found myself drawn to Grand Theft Auto Online – especially during the last few weeks where I have been unwell and confined to the couch and television. With GTA Online content being a simple enjoyable binge on Youtube for many years how did it fare for someone like myself who has no experience in either first-person shooter (FPS) or third-person shooter (TPS) games?

The New User Experience

The PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X|S versions of Grand Theft Auto Online have an alternate ‘New User Experience’ for the first character created on your account granting access to a four million dollar boost to your account and a choice of four career options that you are required to pledge a majority of those funds towards – Executive Gunrunner Nightclub Owner and Biker. The idea of a chic suit appealed to me so choosing Executive I was taken through a series of prompts going through what office upgrades weapons and vehicles you would like to start with. A huge ask for someone who has never set foot in GTA Online before but I trudged through the menus before spending the mandatory $3 Million of my boon and setting foot into the world for the first time.

This is pretty much as far as the new user introduction experience goes. If this is your first time in San Andreas you should go in expecting a bit of confusion. You are given a few missions about collecting your gear arriving at your chosen business’s destination and then doing a set-up mission to set it up. From then you are let loose to take your character in the way you wish or take a few steps out of the door to get pummelled by an experienced player griefing. The best way to resolve this is time trying new things and also reading guides as Sam from a month ago was left confused until deep diving into the GTAOnline subreddit for advice on what different interactions did and how to best unlock new content.

My Experience – Gradual Improvement

I typically don’t play any sort of cooperative shooter games purely because my skills suck and I envision myself as more a logical careful planner than someone who can rely on muscle memory to take down opponents with a sniper rifle (or any rifle) in a matter of seconds. Although I could attribute this to either my being put on servers with other unskilled players or the game’s rather generous aim assist but provided I was not swarmed by enemies I found myself gradually doing better and better until I would say I was at the same level or better than the average of other players I met. The variety between tactical and pure combat missions was welcome as it balanced the combat with the logical side of my brain well but I felt that even without an in-depth tutorial or practice mode I could pick up most fundamentals through standard play.

You Gotta Spend Money (In-Game or IRL) to Make Money

Some of the basics are given to you fortunately including some adequate vehicles on-demand and a high-end apartment where you can just hang out or dabble in some entry-level heists (if you can get another three players along for the ride… which I was never able to do). So essentially about an hour in you should have access to most of the basics of GTA Online and the foundations of one of the meatier businesses that have been the focus of DLC releases post-launch.

As the saying goes “variety is the spice of life”. Depending on whether you are willing to part with some IRL money you may need to invest quite a bit of time into progressively unlocking new content – with each new property or expensive vehicle typically providing a new set of missions whole sets of new content or brand new money making activities to enjoy. With most properties going into the millions of in-game dollars to purchase and potentially more for upgrades the big challenges of the game are to:

a) Resist the urge to spend your money until you save up for what you want

b) Resist the urge to spend your money on frivolous aesthetic upgrades (interior designs visual features even sports cars) until you are rolling in the cash

c) Finding a way of making more money to unlock the new content and

d) How to maximise your passive income accrual so you can diversify the opportunities you have access to.

Following the advice from others the generally accepted route is to first undertake money-making opportunities to purchase the Submarine or Arcade which allows you to run arguably two of the game’s best heists – Cayo Perico and Diamond Casino – especially the former which is a solo heist that can net you $1.5 Million or more with the investment of an hour or two. The heists themselves are a lot of fun and are obviously the newest creations from Rockstar with favour exploration and careful engagement with potentially big rewards. Technically you can join in the heist missions of other players but virtually everyone runs Cayo Perico solo whilst you are looking at a meagre cut of the 2-4 person Diamond Casino heist. But the time dedicated to them is worth it as both can be tackled in a multitude of different ways depending on what preparation missions you take. Are they hard… depending on the route you go down they can range from a cakewalk to expert tier but none could be seen as impossible. Sadly to unlock everything at a quick pace expect a lot of grinding of the same 1-2 optimal routes.

Once you have a few businesses under your belt provided you don’t want to keep up the grind train going in heists you should have enough to keep your gameplay loop feeling fresh enough. Some properties such as the MC Clubhouse and the expensive Facility you will find yourself irregularly using but the Agency Office Nightclub Auto Shop and Bunker in particular are hubs that provide lots of opportunities – from different mission contracts (The Agency being home to a collaboration questline with Dr. Dre and a new type of mission due in the coming weeks) to money making opportunities to unique unlockable vehicles and services. The only problem is that with half-yearly major updates in recent years new content can take some time to roll out which is a bit too infrequent as a month in I am already finding myself struggling to find new things to do given my more solo lone wolf playstyle. Granted more resources are purportedly being put onto the long-awaited GTA VI but still quarterly updates would probably keep the experience fresher.

Heading Online or “Online”

While the console versions of GTA Online do not suffer the same levels of hacking as the PC version does there is still a consistent level of griefing that may see players wanting to throw in the towel due to how unfair some of the situations can be. For example I as a lowly Level 10 player doing a bunker transport mission came face-to-face with a Level 400 on a flying motorbike with homing missiles known as the Oppressor Mk II – which I had virtually no means of avoiding. This prematurely ended an hour or two worth of progress and rewarded it with a negative monetary intake. I found it fostered a feeling that if you encountered another player in the game you should either do your darndest to hide from them or take them out in case they took you out. Even when you get to the triple-digit levels and are capable of more solidly defending yourself those foundations of concern can stubbornly remain – or otherwise encourage you to take on the griefer role. It is a hard one because GTA Online openly encourages players to do this but just because you can do it doesn’t mean you should.

GTA Online has voice chat built in although in 90% of cases everyone was muted a further 7-8% unmuted themselves to shout profanities and the other 2-3% were interested in talking or helping progress the instanced mission we were in. From experience at least half of those on voice were clearly under the age of 18 despite is the Australian classification age of Grand Theft Auto V (R18+) and I overheard one kid admitting they were eight years old. While I have had my concerns with classification board ratings in the past tweens (or younger kids) playing GTA Online is probably not a good idea.

There are some things in GTA Online that need to be done in the online mode such as certain transport missions even if what requires online servers is haphazard. For other things however you can head into an ‘Invite Only’ instance which is just you and the NPCs which is honestly where I spent most of my time – especially with school holidays and weekends bringing more chaos and destruction to the streets of Los Santos. The next update expected to go live next week is set to relook at what missions need to be played online so hopefully it is possible to do pricey Nightclub Delivery missions without having a gang of players on your tail 50% of the time.

A Quality Game?

With GTA Online and Grand Theft Auto V both being introduced to gamers several console generations ago on the PlayStation 3 Xbox 360 and PC saying that the visual quality is next-gen level even with the ‘Enhanced and Exlanded’ features for the newest generation of consoles would be inaccurate. The game looks very pretty especially many of the building interiors and vehicle designs but without completely overhauling the assets of the game from the ground up the graphical fidelity is nowhere close to more modern AAA games – but still looks pretty good even by today’s standards. While I mentioned above that your first priority shouldn’t be aesthetic updates to your properties when you do get the chance you should look at decking out your venues. While not a clubber myself splurging on lighting rigs a dry ice machine and an alternate design scheme for my Nightclub was worth the investment just on the atmosphere alone.

With dozens of in-game radios the clever use of licensed and original music and engagement with those in the music and DJ scenes – Rockstar really nailed the music composition throughout GTA Online. So many times I would stand in my property or just take a longer route to my destination so I could jam to the beat on the radio – especially Roundabout by Yes and Steppin’ Out by Joe Jackson. The quality and diversity of music on offer is top-notch. The radio segments and in-game television segments are also amusingly memorable parodying many different matters in often a hilarious but shocking way.

Where GTA Online does not get much acclaim however is the prominence of bugs throughout play sessions. The number of times I faced loading times hang elements of a mission not loading in or falling through the ground were more than I would have expected from a game that has been around this long. While nothing game-breaking to the point of being unrecoverable having to redo a mission taking 20-30 minutes because something didn’t load at the end was frustrating to say the least.

Final Comments on my Month in GTA Online

With just shy of a decade of content updates behind it GTA Online is still an appealing option for newcomers to check out – supported by recent initiatives such as the game until recently being made available for free on PlayStation consoles. Just expect a gradual learning curve as for complete newcomers to the GTA series the handholding is kept to a minimum. Despite the griefing and bugs aplenty it was still a really fun and surprisingly addictive experience for me and even as I finished my playtesting I will still log in every couple of days to tackle a mission or two and work towards unlocking some of the game’s many unique vehicles. GTA Online has shown that older games can still retain their appeal well and truly after their release with ongoing development but with question marks about the fate of the game once GTA VI releases in the future… will it still receive the love and attention or complete overhaul it deserves should it wish to be relevant for another decade?

Recap the previous and following episodes.

Audrey is barely clinging to a piece of flotsam in the North Sea buffeted by rain. Luckily Mark Everly the naval commander with whom she shared a boat has also survived the explosion of a submerged munitions ship and managed to inflate a raft and to rescue her. Unluckily the raft has been punctured and is taking on water. They must swim to a nearby offshore wind turbine if they are to survive.

Audrey is horrified by the prospect of getting back in the water but she makes it to a boat anchored at the turbine with the help of Mark and a life vest. Only one member of the boat’s crew is left alive after the blast but the boat was also damaged and will eventually sink. Night is coming and bringing a storm with it and helicopters can’t brave the weather so Everly Audrey and the crewman must climb up to the turbine’s maintenance platform in the rain.

They’re not the only ones stranded in bad situations after the blast. Emergency communications are down due to a cyber attack and the hack has also spread to mobile phone networks leaving Fraser to decide to set up a courier system to ferry messages throughout the disaster zone by hand. He’s aided in that by Audrey’s brother Cary who comes to the disaster command center to be told in person by Fraser that Audrey is missing and presumed dead. The news is devastating but Cary can at least rustle up a crowd of scooter enthusiasts including himself to carry messages.

Plenty of other people are also missing and presumed dead including the area’s local Member of Parliament who was helping with the evacuations. The death count currently stands around 300 but is sure to rise—especially given the lack of communications technology which will lead to preventable deaths.

The Prime Minister is furious at the lapse in cyber security. His intelligence director Eleanor James can’t tell who’s behind the attack. Code seems to point to the Russians perhaps in retaliation for arresting a well-connected Russian woman who seems to be responsible for an assassination of an oligarch on British soil but that could also be misdirection. Robert demands a meeting with the Russian ambassador.

Robert is already on edge because the report into the killing of a photographer during the solar storm crisis is due to come out tomorrow. Anna too is raw: Eleanor has shared that Anna’s former lover Edin killed himself before being reached by his enemies. Anna knew he wouldn’t survive if he didn’t take a deal with Eleanor but he refused. She snaps at Robert when he tries to ask if she’s okay then later apologizes. He tells her she doesn’t need to; he already knows everything.

Eleanor wants Robert to release the prisoners suspected in the oligarch’s killing to hopefully end the cyber attack but he refuses and Anna agrees with his decision. His new Home Secretary Joseph Obasi disagrees; he would have never arrested them in the first place. But Joseph is on the ground in Kent a foil to Robert’s former Home Secretary and political rival Archie Glover-Morgan who is criticizing the government’s failure to prevent or address the hack on TV.

Archie visits Robert and tells him several things: he has hired Robert’s former press secretary Peter Mott as an aide; he can give Robert a bigger Parliamentary majority if Robert gives Archie’s group a powerful position; and Archie would like to be Foreign Secretary. Oh and Robert should fire Eleanor.

The Labour Party leader Chris Edwards knows that Joseph is a canny operator and wants Francine Bridge to rejoin Labour and be in the Party’s shadow Cabinet as an opposite to Joseph. Francine could be re-elected as a Member of Parliament to replace the Kent MP killed in the disaster. She also has a useful relationship with the radio host Hari Misra who is managing to scoop the government on various secrets including that the tremor that caused the ship to explode might be connected to drilling in the ocean by a Chinese firm contracted by the government. Robert has put the contract with the company on hold but is trying to prevent that action from being linked to the tremor in public.

Francine warns Hari to be careful and rightfully so: Robert wants to discover his source. Eleanor is thus watching and intrigued when Hari and Francine meet at a bar. But Hari continues to receive information like a flash drive with a video showing a man tied to a chair. Text declares him responsible for the explosion in Kent. An anonymous male voice tells Hari via phone call to destroy the drive when he’s done with it.

Robert is embarrassed when he meets with the Russian ambassador who denies any involvement in the cyber attack—and tells Robert the woman they have arrested is not the well-connected Klara Lechkova. Eleanor checks later and ascertains that the woman is indeed an impersonator with fake identification documents. Her accomplice Rodrigo Araya is just a “piece of work.”

Robert wants to launch a retaliatory cyber strike on Russia for all the misdirection. Eleanor begins preparing it as Anna advises Robert not to fire Eleanor.

As night and the cold deepens Everly decides to try to swim to shore—Audrey and the crewman will never survive the chill long enough for rescuers to reach them. Audrey tries to keep the crewman awake by talking to him of her late father—and finally as they shiver on the exposed turbine platform a helicopter arrives with Everly inside still recovering from his freezing long swim.

More good news is that the report into the photographer’s death clears Robert and his government—so it is leaked to the press. Even better is the restoration of communications. The malware is still out there but Eleanor’s team is playing whack-a-mole with it anywhere it pops up. Fraser and Joseph return to London to brief everyone on the relative success of the emergency response despite all the difficulties.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMigAFodHRwczovL3dyZXN0bGluZ25ld3MuY28vd3dlLW5ld3Mvd3dlLWdldHMtYS1uZXctdHJpYWwtZGF0ZS10by1maWdodC1jbGFpbXMtb3Zlci11c2luZy1yYW5keS1vcnRvbnMtdGF0dG9vLWRlc2lnbi1pbi1hMWlkZW8tZ2FtZdIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,WWE gets a new trial date to fight claims over using Randy Orton's tattoo design in a video game,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://wrestlingnews.co/wwe-news/wwe-gets-a-new-trial-date-to-fight-claims-over-using-randy-ortons-tattoo-design-in-a1ideo-game on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMigAFodHRwczovL3dyZXN0bGluZ25ld3MuY28vd3dlLW5ld3Mvd3dlLWdldHMtYS1uZXctdHJpYWwtZGF0ZS10by1maWdodC1jbGFpbXMtb3Zlci11c2luZy1yYW5keS1vcnRvbnMtdGF0dG9vLWRlc2lnbi1pbi1hMWlkZW8tZ2FtZdIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen

In the spartan offices of his small private investment firm Raj Rajaratnam  former inmate 62785-054 is searching for his next big trade.All is quiet inside the townhouse in Manhattan’s East 50s -- 200 miles and a world away from the federal prison where he served seven-and-a-half years for insider trading.It’s been three years since the former hedge-fund magnate was freed from FMC Devens the medical prison west of Boston where he did time with Ponzi schemer Nicholas Cosmo AKA the “mini-Madoff” among others.His new surroundings are undoubtedly a step up. But they’re surprisingly modest for the man known as Raj-Raj the high-rolling trader who became the Ivan Boesky of his time. Nothing about this unassuming building might suggest this is where Rajaratnam -- “Sunk by Greed” and “bound for brig” the New York Post trumpeted 11 years ago -- hopes to stage a comeback maybe in more ways than one.In his heyday at his multibillion-dollar Galleon Group LLC computer screens crowded his huge curved desk monitoring markets around the globe. Here at Synamon Global LLC Rajaratnam works at a utilitarian glass-topped table that looks as if it might’ve come from Ikea. A leather satchel is tossed on the blond-wood floor behind him. A beige tapestry hangs on one white wall a red fire extinguisher nearby. The fish tank in the adjoining sunroom-workspace could stand a cleaning.Rajaratnam 65 is less fleshy than he was in his days as tabloid fodder. His temples are graying. The neat mustache is gone as are the rimless glasses but the gap-toothed smile is the same as ever. He peers into his monitor and pecks at the keyboard. Barred for life from managing other people’s money and with Galleon long since shut Rajaratnam spends his days tending his considerable personal fortune in obscurity. With about 18 people working or consulting for his family-office firm -- the name “Synamon” echoes the spice most associated with his native Sri Lanka -- he’s trading stocks investing in real estate whatever catches his eye.As much as anything Rajaratnam is looking for a shot at redemption. He’s embarked on a long lonely quest to rehabilitate his reputation or at least indict the legal system that indicted him. Ever since federal agents showed up at his pricey Sutton Place apartment in 2009 he’s maintained his innocence. His case riveted Wall Street and with reason: He ended up being convicted on all 14 counts of securities fraud and conspiracy and sentenced to 11 years one of the the harshest penalties the US has ever levied for insider trading. It was the first major insider trading case in which the government used wiretaps a tactic often used against organized crime and drug traffickers.Today Rajaratnam insists he doesn’t want to relitigate his case. But he’s been doing that a lot lately in media interviews and in a book “Uneven Justice: The Plot to Sink Galleon’’ published in December. Like Michael Milken a symbol of the greed-is-good 1980s who has successfully refurbished his reputation and been re-embraced by the global business elite Rajaratnam is also using his wealth for various philanthropic efforts particularly in his native Sri Lanka.But make no mistake: Raj Rajaratnam is unrepentant. He says he was the “fall guy” for the feds’ failure to convict any prominent bankers following the 2008 financial crisis. “I was entrapped framed unlawfully wiretapped surveilled and then made to endure a brutal and very public media lynching” Rajaratnam writes in “Uneven Justice.” Federal agents and prosecutors crossed legal lines to convict him he says. Threatened with prison employees and business contacts testified against him to save themselves he says.At FMC Devens where he was sent because he has diabetes and kidney disease he did time with murders and sex offenders – he says he tried to avoid them – and befriended drug dealers and white-collar crooks. Some fellow inmates tried to extort money from him. “That was not going to happen with me” he says.“This is a huge infrastructure that has to change” Rajaratnam says of the criminal-justice system.That’s not quite the way federal prosecutors saw things. Government authorities called Rajaratnam “a billion-dollar force of deception and corruption on Wall Street.” Tapping a network of informants across swaths of corporate America he illegally used inside information to trade stocks such as Goldman Sachs Group Inc. Google Intel Corp. and Hilton Worldwide Holdings prosecutors said. His trading generated profits or avoided losses of $72 million not quite $10 million for each year he served in prison.The explosive case exposed the trafficking in illicit information at the highest echelons of American finance. Roughly a hundred other people were eventually ensnared by insider trading cases. Most pleaded guilty or like Rajaratnam were convicted by a jury. Among those who went to prison were Rajat Gupta former global head of McKinsey & Co. and former board member for Goldman Sachs who blamed Rajaratnam for his downfall. The two were later reunited at FMC Devens where Rajaratnam says they played bridge and Scrabble together. (Gupta ??was convicted of passing tips to Rajaratnam related to Goldman Sachs and was sentenced to 2 years; he has long maintained his innocence.)“Yeah we were civil to each other” Rajaratnam says of Gupta.Rajaratnam has been far less charitable toward Preet Bharara  the former US attorney who spearheaded the government’s sweeping crackdown. Some celebrated Bharara as the Sheriff of Wall Street for aggressively going after hedge fund managers. Others accused him of letting Wall Street off the hook for the financial crisis. To hear Rajaratnam tell it Bharara used the power of his office to win at all costs and advance his own career. He mentions Bharara 325 times in his 333-page book.Bharara today says he doesn’t care what Rajaratnam thinks. In an email the former prosecutor called the hedge funder he put away possibly “the least sympathetic defendant ever.”Says Bharara: “Raj Rajaratnam was a privileged billionaire who engaged in massive insider trading and there was an avalanche of evidence to prove it.” Bharara pointed to Rajaratnam’s failure to win over jurors and judges despite an aggressive and costly defense.“Whatever fairy tales he may now tell to rehabilitate his reputation or settle scores or peddle his book Raj Rajaratnam was and is guilty. Period” wrote Bharara who was fired by Donald Trump in 2017.Still like Milken Rajaratnam may have another act yet. Anita Raghavan a former Wall Street Journal reporter who wrote a book about Rajaratnam and Gupta says that in all likelihood Rajaratnam is still a billionaire. She calls his book a “selective retelling” of the Galleon affair and says there was ample evidence at trial to convict Rajaratnam. But wealth begets wealth and also influence. In the waning days of the Trump administration Milken received a presidential pardon.For his part Rajaratnam won’t say if he’s still a billionaire.“Yes I am in many currencies -- rupees lira pesos” he jokes.Back at Synamon Rajaratnam is working with his small staff to spot investment opportunities“We invest in real estate as well as in the stock market” he says. “And so I come to work every day. Rather than having hundreds of investors we have one investor.”Galleon specialized in technology and healthcare waters Rajaratnam is still plying today. Synamon’s investments include companies in medical technology cloud computing cybersecurity and clean energy including electric vehicles. Its real estate investment business is buying residential properties in New York and in 10 states across the South he says. His employees include recent college students who are working for him as analysts. The US staff is spread among New York Pittsburgh and San Francisco. A team in Sri Lanka covers e-commerce.Ean Renaud 23 has been working for Rajaratanam since a chance five-minute encounter with him last year while meeting with another trader. Renaud is a former competitive swimmer who says he dropped out of college to launch a clothing line then worked at a start-up and traded stocks for his own account. As a rookie analyst he’s thrilled to benefit from Rajaratnam’s years of experience in finance.“You can kind of tell he’s grinning and he enjoys thoroughly what he’s talking about” Renaud said. “He hopes to see the excitement return from the other person he’s teaching.”In an online meeting the two discuss a recent downturn in the shares of Chinese electric car makers.Rajaratnam seems delighted to hear from Renaud that one XPeng Inc. is developing a flying car. Another analyst briefed Rajaratnam on Procept BioRobotics Corp. which sells equipment for robotic surgery.After the call Rajaratnam’s office is quiet again. He takes a few M&M's from a bag. ""I really have no regrets about the decisions I made"" he said. ""I'm not looking back with bitterness.""Whether Rajaratnam can pick himself up after such a spectacular fall is anyone’s guess. But he still has the money to try. The year was arrested Forbes estimated he was worth $1.3 billion. He says legal fees and fines cost him $200 million. As for what he’s worth today? “Subtract that from whatever number you think I had” he says with a laugh.",,,,,,,,,,,,

Against this backdrop White & Case surveyed the SEC filings of 50 companies in the Fortune 100 to assess the latest trends in ESG disclosure.

Survey of ESG Disclosure—2020 to 2022

For its fourth annual survey of ESG disclosure in SEC filings the White & Case Public Company Advisory Group reviewed the annual meeting proxy statements and annual reports of 50 companies in the Fortune 100. In these 100 SEC filings we focused on 12 categories of ESG disclosure in annual reports and proxy statements filed with the SEC in 2020 2021 and 2022. The key trends and takeaways from our survey are discussed below.

Climate-Related Disclosure Takes the Spotlight in 2022

In the fall of 2021 ahead of Form 10-K filings the SEC issued a sample comment letter on climate disclosure and also issued bespoke comment letters to a number of companies questioning their materiality assessments with respect to climate disclosure. Climate-related disclosure significantly increased in both Form 10-K and proxy statement filings of the surveyed companies with many companies including such disclosure for the first time in 2022. Our survey focused on the ways climate disclosure changed year-over-year among the surveyed companies.

The Seven ESG Topics on the Rise in 2022

1. Environmental Matters

Overall for 2022 the largest increase in categories of ESG disclosure was with respect to environmental matters (up from third on the list in 2021) which covered a range of environmental topics including investments in sustainability recycling and renewable energy use. As shown in the chart below 89 of the 2022 filings surveyed increased their environmental disclosure compared to 35 of the 2021 filings and 29 of the 2020 filings.

Moreover every company surveyed (all 50 companies) included environmental disclosure in their 2022 filings. Of the 96 filings that included environmental disclosure in 2022:

Forty-eight companies (or 96%) included it in their Form 10-K (up from 37 in 2021 and 32 in 2020) and 48 companies (or 96%) in their proxy statement (the same number as in 2021 and up from 45 in 2020).

Thirty-seven filings (or 37%) included historical quantitative metrics (13 Form 10-Ks and 24 proxy statements) such as information on greenhouse gas (“GHG”) emissions reductions and renewable energy use.

Although the number of proxy statements that contained environmental disclosure has remained fairly constant environmental disclosures in Form 10-Ks have increased significantly over the past two years. The fact that every company surveyed included environmental disclosures either in their Form 10-K or in their proxy statement and that so many companies that already had robust environmental disclosure increased that disclosure in 2022 illustrates the significant focus on environmental issues in 2022.

Examples of new environmental disclosures included the following:

Investments in Environmental Sustainability for example: “Operate Sustainably. We have a long-standing and substantial commitment to sustainable business operations from the products and services we offer to our customers; to our store construction maintenance and operations; to our supply chain and packaging initiatives; to our ethical sourcing program. As we strive to operate sustainably we have focused on protecting the climate reducing our environmental impact and sourcing responsibly and we have set specific measurable goals to drive progress in these areas.” Renewable Energy for example: “The Climate Pledge is [the Company’s] commitment to be net-zero carbon by 2040 and we are on a path to powering our operations with 100% renewable energy by 2025. As the world’s largest corporate buyer of renewable energy [the Company] announced dozens of new renewable energy projects in 2021 and now has 274 projects globally. The Climate Pledge has been signed by [the Company] and over 300 other companies that commit to the same goals…Pledge signatories in total generate over $3.5 trillion in global annual revenues and have more than 8 million employees across 51 industries in 29 countries.” Climate Change Evaluation for example: “As part of our commitment to being good stewards of the environment we are working to understand quantify and reduce our impact on climate change. We understand that climate change poses risk and presents opportunities for our business to address such impacts in several ways. We recently undertook several actions to raise understanding about climate change and potential risks to our business including…[e]valuating potential enterprise risks associated with climate change [and] [d]isclosing our baseline scope 1 and scope 2 [GHG] emissions which we assessed in 2021 for calendar years 2019 and 2020. We are currently focused on calculating our scope 3 GHG emissions and in conjunction with our Value Creation Plan we are assessing energy usage and reduction opportunities and determining decarbonization goals.”

Spotlight on Climate-Related Disclosure

Overall 43 of the surveyed companies (or 86%) increased their climate-related disclosure in their 2022 Form 10-Ks and 35 companies (or 70%) increased this disclosure in their 2022 proxy statements. Seven companies (or 14%) addressed climate-related disclosure in their Form 10-K for the first time in 2022 and six companies (or 12%) addressed climate-related disclosure in their proxy statements for the first time in 2022.

Four of the surveyed companies received comments from the SEC in 2021 on climate-related disclosure. Two of the four companies agreed to additional risk factor and/or Management Discussion and Analysis (“MD&A”) disclosure. Many other surveyed companies included additional Form 10-K disclosure that appeared based on content to be directly influenced by the SEC’s sample comment letter.

Fifteen companies added entirely new risk factors devoted to climate-related impacts (including physical impacts of climate change transition risks to a low-carbon economy compliance costs related to new and disparate regulations and reputational risks) and 14 companies increased references to climate-related impacts in their existing risk factors.

For the surveyed companies references to climate-related impacts increased by seven mentions on average and five companies added new sections discussing ESG sustainability and climate change in their MD&A. Only two companies did not mention climate-related impacts in their 2022 Form 10-Ks and seven did not do so in their 2022 proxy statements.



The increase in climate-related risk factors is particularly notable. For example:

“Climate Change Could Have a Negative Impact on [the Company’s] Results of Operations and Financial Condition.… Climate change presents both immediate and long-term risks to [the Company] and [our] customers and clients with the risks expected to increase over time. Climate risks can arise from both physical risks (those risks related to the physical effects of climate change) and transition risks (risks related to regulatory and legal technological market and reputational changes from a transition to a low-carbon economy)…”

2. Human Capital Management (HCM)

In 2022 the second largest increase in ESG disclosures came in human capital management (“HCM”) down from first place in the prior three years.

As expected due to the SEC rule changes mandating human capital disclosure in the Form 10-K every company surveyed included some form of HCM disclosure in their Form 10-K and nearly all surveyed companies (96%) also included HCM disclosure in their annual meeting proxy statement. Eighty-six of the 2022 filings surveyed presented an increase in this type of disclosure from 2021 (up from 60 in 2021 and 35 in 2020) with 41 of these increases coming in the 10-K and 45 of these increases in the proxy statement. Increased disclosure included topics such as employee health and safety talent management and development employee engagement and pay equity.

Within HCM disclosures we also found a significant number of quantitative disclosures in both 2021 and 2022. In 2022 of the 98 filings that included disclosure on HCM 54 included current or historical quantitative metrics. These metrics included information on: (1) the percentage of employees who are women or people of color; (2) information on corporate initiatives to improve gender and ethnic diversity in their workforce; and (3) information on employee turnover and retention rates.

The below graphics represent the disclosure increases and the excerpts provide representative examples of the additional HCM disclosure:

Examples of new disclosures included the following:

On Employee Engagement for example: Associate engagement is the emotional commitment associates have to [the Company]. It is vital to our culture and to our success. We create an engaging workplace by continuously listening to and acting on associate feedback. We provide several pulse check surveys…that help us determine how emotionally connected those associates are to our customers the Company their jobs fellow associates and leaders. In addition our annual Voice of the Associate survey…serves as our primary means of gauging associates’ level of engagement within their roles. We use the feedback from these surveys to help improve the overall associate experience …We also maintain a digital associate engagement platform that links associates with common interests and fuels connections to co-workers and Company leaders.” On Talent Retention for example: “In 2021…our Employee Engagement Index an overall measure of employee satisfaction with the Corporation was 88%. Our turnover among employees was 12% in 2021 and 7% in 2020. Our pre-pandemic levels of turnover in 2019 and 2018 were 11% and 12%. Additionally [we] provide[] a variety of resources to help employees grow in their current roles and build new skills including resources to help employees find new opportunities re-skill and seek leadership positions…In 2021 more than 26000 employees found new roles within the Corporation.” On Pay Equity for example: Since 2019 we have achieved gender pay equity globally and we continue to maintain race/ethnicity pay equity in the US. We achieve pay equity by closing the gap in average pay between employees of different genders or race/ethnicity in the same or similar roles after accounting for legitimate business factors that can explain differences such as location time at grade level and tenure.” On Employee Wellness and Flexible Working for example: “Our offices and sites once again closed Company wide for one day in May 2021 to allow colleagues to recharge In 2021 in recognition of the new way of working we initiated [ Flex a hybrid model that empowers our office based employees to find the right productivity and balance of in person and remote work.”

Focus on Diversity Equity and Inclusion (“DEI”)

In 2022 all but one of the companies surveyed (49 out of 50) included disclosure on diversity or related initiatives at the company up from 43 in 2021 and 29 in 2020.

In 2022 most companies surveyed (44 out of 50) included this in both their Form 10-K and their proxy statement although the disclosures in the proxy statements were generally more robust and detailed.

On Employee Diversity Equity and Inclusion for example: Diversity Equity and Inclusion (DEI): Building a world where progress equitable outcomes diversity and inclusion can be realities is at the heart of what we do—from how we build our products to how we build our workforce. We have deepened our efforts to drive meaningful change but we know there is more to be done. We have a responsibility to continue scaling our DEI initiatives to ensure a workforce that is more representative of our users a workplace that creates a sense of belonging for everyone and to increase pathways to tech in the communities we call home…In 2020 we implemented a series of industry-leading principles and improvements that incorporated input from both employees and stockholders including the creation of a new DEI Advisory Council which comprises internal senior executives and external DEI experts. We have also heightened our focus on promoting racial equity including announcing in 2020 a series of racial equity commitments. We shared an update on our progress in 2021 and continue working to translate those efforts into lasting meaningful change.”

EEO-1 Data References. In 2022 36 companies (or 72%) included EEO-1 data or referenced the provision of such data in a separate report up from 16 (or 32%) in 2021. Thirty-two companies made this disclosure only in their proxy statement two only in their Form 10-K and six included the disclosure in both filings. The prevalence of this disclosure was largely the result of renewed investor pressure and focus on these disclosures. For example BlackRock called on companies to disclose their EEO-1 survey responses and starting in 2022 State Street adopted a policy to vote “against” the compensation committee chairs at companies that do not disclose their EEO-1 survey responses.

Representative examples of these disclosures include the following:

“We released our 2021 [DEI] Report in which we provide workforce diversity data (including our EEO-1 data) and explain how we are working to drive progress through our pillars of action: public policy workforce diversity community engagement and supplier diversity.” “As part of our Health for Humanity Report publication in June 2021 we publicly disclosed our U.S. Federal Employer Information Report EEO-1 and we annually publish the You Belong: Diversity Equity & Inclusion Impact Review (DEI Impact Review) which examines how the Company’s global DEI strategy has been a key driver of innovation and business outcomes since our founding over 130 years ago.”

3. E&S Goals and Targets

For the first time in White & Case’s annual survey E&S Goals and Targets made the top seven categories rising to the third spot with the largest increase in disclosure. This reflects the heightened focus by investors on companies setting specific targets with respect to environmental and social priorities.

Seventy-six of the filings surveyed (or 76%) increased their disclosure related to E&S goals and targets. In total all but one of the surveyed companies (49 out of 50) included some form of E&S goal or target. Of these 32 companies included the disclosure in their Form 10-K and 48 companies included it in their proxy statement. Of the 49 companies that included E&S goals and targets seven companies included them for the first time in their 2022 disclosures.

E&S goals and targets cover a range of topics including long term goals to reach net zero and shorter term goals to reduce GHG emissions by specified amounts.

Quantitative E&S Goals and Targets. Notably in addition to including qualitative goals and targets a significant number of companies included quantitative metrics in their E&S goals and targets. Forty-four companies (or 88%) included some form of quantitative metric in their E&S goals and targets disclosure—18 in their Form 10-K (up from 11 in 2021) and 42 in their proxy (up from 26 in 2021). This demonstrates a growing trend of companies that are disclosing quantifiable goals in their SEC filings and not just in sustainability reports or website disclosures which can be measured and tracked by investors.

Specifically:

GHG Emissions: Forty of the surveyed companies disclosed at least one specific goal relating to GHG emissions reduction on a given timeline. Twenty-three companies disclosed a specific net zero goal ten companies disclosed a carbon neutral goal 18 companies disclosed other specific emission reduction goals and one company disclosed a goal to be carbon negative. Several companies disclosed a combination of emissions goals.

Financial Commitment Towards ESG: Seventeen of the surveyed companies set forward-looking quantitative goals to commit a specified amount of funds over a specific timeline towards ESG initiatives such as diversity funds sustainable energy climate action and local community support.

Community Investment: Thirteen of the surveyed companies set goals to support local communities through a specific number of volunteer hours committed meals donated or people educated.

Renewable Energy: Nine of the surveyed companies set a quantitative goal to meet their energy needs with 100% renewable energy by a given timeline and four companies set a goal to source a specific percentage or amount of renewable energy by a given timeline. Four companies set other quantitative renewable energy or energy conservation goals such as achieving green certification for a certain percentage of their buildings or producing a certain amount of clean energy.

Examples of new disclosures included the following:

GHG Reductions Goals for example: “The Company’s environmental goals collectively called “Strive 35”—an ambitious plan to by 2035 reduce from a 2019 baseline absolute Scope 1 and 2 [GHG] emissions by 25 percent reduce absolute Scope 3 emissions by 25 percent reduce energy intensity by 15 percent reduce water intensity by 10 percent and achieve a 90 percent landfill diversion rate—are part of an aggressive plan to continue to reduce the [our] environmental footprint…In 2021 [we] added 5-year interim targets to ensure the Company stays on track to meet its 2035 goals. By 2025 the Company aims to reduce absolute GHG emissions by 1.5% reduce energy intensity and water intensity by 6% and 5% respectively and achieve 87% of its waste diverted from landfill.” Carbon Negative Goals for example: “In January 2020 we announced a bold commitment and detailed plan to be carbon negative by 2030 and to remove from the environment by 2050 all the carbon we have emitted since our founding in 1975.” Financial Commitments for example: “In April 2021 we committed $1 trillion to sustainable finance by 2030 which builds on the work we outlined in our updated Sustainable Progress Strategy. This commitment includes extending our prior five-year $250 billion environmental finance goal to $500 billion by 2030 through which we will finance and facilitate an array of climate solutions such as renewable energy energy efficiency sustainable transportation and circular economy and $500 billion in social finance including affordable housing diversity and equity economic inclusion food security and healthcare.” Employee Diversity Goals for example: “We set the following goals to change our workforce representation by 2030: (i) globally increase representation of women at the manager level and above to 48% (up from 40%); (ii) in the United States increase representation of African American and Black employees at the manager level and above to 11% (up from 5%); and (iii) in the United States increase representation of all other ethnically diverse groups at the manager level and above to 23% (up from 17%). To achieve these goals we will focus on attracting developing and retaining diverse talent from entry-level to senior leadership positions.”

4. Corporate Culture

Sixty-one of the 2022 filings surveyed increased their disclosure on corporate culture compared to 33 of the 2021 filings surveyed and 28 of the 2020 filings surveyed.

Overall 47 of the companies surveyed included disclosure on corporate culture in their 2022 filings compared to 44 companies in 2021 and 43 companies in 2020.

Examples of new disclosures included the following:

Core Values for example: “The [Company] has a strong commitment to ethics and integrity and we are a values- and culture-centric business. Our commitment to our core values drives our approach to human capital management. Our culture is based on our servant leadership philosophy represented by the inverted pyramid which puts primary importance on our customers and our associates by positioning them at the top with senior management at the base in a support role. We bring our culture to life through our core values which serve as the foundation of our business and the guiding principles behind the decisions we make every day.” Importance of Board in Shaping Culture for example: “Our Board and its committees play a key role in establishing and maintaining our culture setting the “tone at the top” and holding management accountable for its maintenance of high ethical standards and effective policies and practices to protect our reputation assets and business.”

5. Board Oversight of Environmental and Social Issues

Fifty-six of the filings surveyed increased their disclosure related to board oversight of E&S issues in 2022 compared to 27 filings in 2021 and 22 filings in 2020. Overall 47 companies included disclosure on board oversight of E&S issues in their 2022 filings.

Notably there has been an increasing trend of companies including this disclosure in their Form 10-Ks as well as their proxy statements. In 2022 16 companies included this disclosure in their Form 10-Ks up from eight in 2021 and one in 2020. Board oversight disclosures generally appeared in the business section of the surveyed companies’ Form 10-Ks.

Examples of new disclosures include the following:

ESG Committee or Function Reporting to the Board for example: “Our sustainability efforts are overseen by our Board of Directors in particular a dedicated Sustainability and Corporate Responsibility Committee and led by our Chief Sustainability Officer… The Sustainability and Corporate Responsibility Committee actively oversees our objectives goals strategies and activities relating to sustainability and corporate responsibility matters and assists the Board in ensuring that we operate as a sustainable organization and responsible corporate citizen in order to enhance shareholder value and protect [our] reputation.” Governance Committee Oversight of E&S for example: “The [NGC] is responsible for overseeing management of risks related to our environmental sustainability and corporate social responsibility practices including risks related to our operations and our supply chain.” Board Oversight of HCM in Form 10-K business section for example: “As we execute on the Company’s strategy in the coming years our focus on organizational performance and talent will remain front and center. We will continue to monitor various factors across our human capital priorities including as a part of our business operating reviews during the year and with oversight by our Board of Directors and the Board’s Management Development and Compensation Committee.” Specialized Board Committee Oversight of E&S Issues in Form 10-K business section for example: “Our Board of Directors and Board committees provide important oversight on certain human capital matters including items discussed at the Executive People Forum. The Compensation Talent and Culture Committee maintains responsibility to review discuss and set strategic direction for various people-related business strategies including: compensation and benefit programs; leadership succession planning; culture; [DEI]; and talent development programs. The Sustainability Innovation and Policy Committee is responsible for discussing and advising management on maintaining and improving sustainability strategies the implementation of which creates value consistent with the long-term preservation and enhancement of shareholder value and social wellbeing including human rights working conditions and responsible sourcing.”

Committee(s) with Oversight over ESG Matters.

Of the 50 surveyed companies:

Thirty companies (or 60%) disclosed that their Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee (“NGC”) oversaw some or all ESG Matters up from 12 in 2021 (a 150% increase). Of these 30 companies: three disclosed that ESG matters were solely or primarily overseen by the NGC while the other 27 companies disclosed that both the NCG and another committee had oversight over ESG matters.

Twenty-seven companies disclosed that their Compensation Committee (“CC”) oversaw some or all ESG Matters; of these 27 companies three disclosed that ESG matters were solely or primarily overseen by the CC while the other 24 companies disclosed that there was shared ESG oversight between both the CC and another committee.

Twenty-three companies disclosed that at least some ESG matters were overseen by a more specialized committee or committees such as a dedicated Sustainability Committee or a Public Responsibility Committee.

Fourteen companies disclosed that the audit committee had oversight over some ESG issues such as risks and exposures associated with civil and human rights and sustainability identifying ESG investment criteria and providing assurance of ESG disclosures. Additionally ten companies disclosed that the full board shared E&S oversight responsibilities with another committee.

It is interesting to note that 34 companies disclosed that they allocated responsibility for oversight of ESG issues to more than one committee (up from 21 in 2021) with six companies disclosing that they allocate responsibility to four committees and five companies disclosing allocation of ESG oversight to five committees. This increase in allocation of ESG oversight to more than one committee reflects the increasing role boards have in providing oversight of ESG issues and allows committees to narrow and deepen their focus on different facets of these issues. For example many companies disclosed that ESG issues were divided between committees that focused on human capital and social/public policy issues and those that focused on environmental and sustainability issues.

6. Social Impact and Community

The social impact and community category of ESG disclosure moved down from second to sixth on our list of increased ESG disclosure. Specifically 55 of the 2022 filings surveyed (or 55%) including 16 Form 10-Ks increased their disclosure related to social impact and community relations compared to 40 in 2021 (or 40%) and 21 in 2020 (or 21%).

Examples of new disclosures included the following:

Community Development and Engagement for example: “We are committed to creating value for our communities through economic development philanthropy volunteerism and advocacy and by operating our business in a socially and environmentally responsible way. The communities in which our assets are located and where our employees live are critical stakeholders. We consistently and regularly engage with our local communities and seek their feedback. Our refining operations have community advisory councils or panels that include both Company representatives and community members…Our pipeline business units have year-round community awareness education and listening panels to stay connected with those involved with and living near our extensive pipeline network.” Access to Technology for example: “Access to affordable and reliable internet service is critical for work learning and commerce—and for staying digitally connected to family friends news and information. Using our platform to address the digital divide is strategically important to [the Company] as it helps drive social change while expanding our network reach and deepening valuable collaboration with communities authorities and NGOs…In 2021 [the Company] announced a commitment to invest $2 billion over the next 3 years to help address the digital divide…As part of our $2 billion digital divide commitment we introduced [] Connected Learning a multi-year initiative led by our CSR organization to help stem the tide of learning loss further narrow the homework gap and empower today’s learners…Through the end of 2022 we’re launching more than 20 [] Connected Learning Centers in under-resourced neighborhoods facing barriers to connectivity—providing access to high-speed internet and computing devices as well as opportunities for tutoring and mentorship through our employee-driven [Company] volunteerism initiative.”

7. E&S Issues in Shareholder Engagements

Forty companies increased their disclosure related to ESG issues included in their shareholder engagements in their 2022 proxy statements up from 21 in both 2021 and 2020. Overall 48 companies disclosed that ESG issues were included in their shareholder engagements in their 2022 proxy statements up from 45 in 2021 and 40 in 2020.

Examples of new disclosures included the following:

Responsiveness to Shareholder Feedback (in 21 of the 45 filings). For example: “Our Board believes that solicitation and consideration of shareholder feedback is critical to driving long-term growth and creating shareholder value. Our shareholder engagement program is a robust year-round process encompassing meetings held throughout the year with shareholders during which we encourage ongoing meaningful dialogue about the issues they find most important…Our Board reviews our annual meeting results ongoing shareholder feedback and corporate governance and compensation trends to help drive and develop our shareholder engagement priorities…We respond to shareholder feedback by enhancing our policies practices and disclosures informed by ongoing dialogue with our shareholders and communicate important updates and enhancements made during the fiscal year in our proxy statement.” Mention of Specific E&S Issues Discussed for example: “Recent Board discussions have addressed shareholder feedback on a variety of topics including Board refreshment shareholder proposals executive compensation sustainability and human capital management and political advocacy often resulting in changes to our policies and practices as well as guiding the focus of future discussions in the boardroom…We also fulfilled our commitment to publish our first Sustainability Report and publicly disclosed our workplace diversity data including our consolidated EEO-1 report. Recognizing the continued importance of transparency on political advocacy we strengthened our website disclosures to provide additional detail regarding the Board and Governance & Public Policy Committee’s enhanced oversight role information on our direct lobbying activities and our political contributions guidelines and political action committee processes and oversight.”

Reporting Frameworks: SASB TCFD and Others

The 2022 SEC filings revealed a continuing trend of more companies disclosing the use of reporting frameworks. In 2022 38 of the surveyed companies disclosed in their SEC filings that their sustainability reports posted on their website follow or align with specific reporting frameworks a significant increase from 26 in 2021 11 in 2020 and just one company in 2019.

In general companies are trending towards disclosing the use of more than one framework. In 2022 five companies reported using only one framework whereas 33 companies reported using at least two or more frameworks (compared to 16 companies using two or more frameworks in 2021). In 2022 of the 38 surveyed companies that disclosed their use of frameworks:

Twenty-five surveyed companies disclosed that they align their sustainability reporting with both Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (“SASB”) standards and Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (“TCFD”) frameworks (compared to 13 in 2021).

Eight companies only referenced SASB standards or SASB plus another non-TCFD standard (compared to 5 in 2021) and four companies only referenced TCFD or TCFD plus another non-SASB standard (compared to eight in 2021).

Eighteen of the 38 companies in 2022 disclosed that they aligned with Global Reporting Initiative (“GRI”) standards (compared to six in 2021) with one company exclusively using the GRI standards.

Companies also disclosed that they use other reporting frameworks such as CDP (formerly known as The Climate Disclosure Project) (five companies) the UN Guiding Principles Reporting Framework (two companies) the UN Sustainable Development Goals (three companies) and the UN Global Compact (one company).

Companies continue to make these disclosures referencing the reporting frameworks that they use primarily in their proxy statements. In 2022 only one company disclosed its reporting frameworks solely in its Form 10-K whereas six companies made this disclosure in both their Form 10-K and proxy statements and 31 companies made this disclosure exclusively in their proxy statement.

The significant increase in disclosure regarding use of these reporting frameworks echoes the calls from the investor community including BlackRock which has asked the public companies it invests in to (i) “disclose the identification assessment management and oversight of sustainability-related risks in accordance with the four pillars of TCFD” and (ii) “publish investor-relevant industry-specific material metrics and rigorous targets aligned with SASB or comparable sustainability reporting standards.”

Examples of new disclosures included the following:

Disclosed following TCFD for example: “In our most recent Task Force for Climate Change-related Financial Disclosure (TCFD)-aligned report issued in October 2021 we described our GHG intensity targets for oil gas flaring and methane for 2028.” Disclosed following more than one standard for example: “[The Company] participates in the CDP’s climate forestry and water security questionnaires to benchmark and quantify our environmental practices to provide transparency on our progress and assist in the reduction of our contributions to climate change. We continue to align our sustainability reporting with the appropriate [SASB] standards for our industry the [GRI] and the UN Sustainable Development Goals (“SDGs”). We also published our first [TCFD] report in 2021 to assess our climate-related risks and opportunities and better understand the potential impacts on our value chain.” Disclosed following more than one standard for example: “We are committed to transparency around our carbon footprint and climate risk and use the framework developed by the TCFD to inform our disclosure on climate governance strategy risk management and metrics and targets…Our Corporate Responsibility Report also includes a mapping of our disclosure to the TCFD the [SASB] framework and our CDP Climate Change Survey all of which are available on our website.”

Three Key Take-Aways

Given these disclosure trends and influences when contemplating any ESG disclosure in connection with SEC filings public reporting companies should consider the following key takeaways:

1. ESG: What’s In and What’s Out of SEC Filings

Based on our survey the top ESG topics for 2022 SEC filings were:

Environmental disclosure with a focus on climate change which moved up from third to first in 2022;

Human capital management with a focus on diversity and inclusion; and

E&S targets and goals which made the top seven list for the first time since our survey began in 2019.

These top categories for increase reflect the key areas of corporate SEC and investor focus this year for the surveyed companies.

2. A Renewed Focus on ESG for Form 10-Ks

Even ahead of the SEC’s adoption of any new climate rules in-house teams should take note of the growing trend of providing ESG disclosure in annual reports on Form 10-Ks. The results of our survey demonstrate a re-focus and movement towards the Form 10-K for enhanced ESG disclosures. For example 15 of the surveyed companies added entirely new risk factors devoted to climate change impacts and more broadly environmental disclosures in Form 10-Ks have increased significantly over the past two years while remaining fairly constant in proxy statements.

This increase in Form 10-K disclosure particularly on the environment came on the heels of the September 2021 sample letter on climate disclosure. As a result of this growing trend companies should zero in on their (1) materiality assessments for climate change (2) their approach towards differentiating their Form 10-K from sustainability reports and (3) enhancing their controls on ESG disclosure. More specifically:

Confirm Your Materiality Assessments . In terms of the materiality assessments companies should continue to consider the SEC’s 2010 climate change disclosure guidance12 and the recent comment letters from Corp Fin on companies’ climate disclosure. SEC comments to date on climate disclosure initially asked questions focusing on a company’s materiality analysis and then requested additional details on the company’s determination that disclosure of climate change matters was not necessary because the climate change matters were not material. In some cases the follow-up comments requested that companies provide quantitative information to support their materiality determinations.

In some cases the follow-up comments requested that companies provide quantitative information to support their materiality determinations. Differentiate ESG for Your Form 10-K and Sustainability Report . With respect to sustainability reporting it is important to note the growing SEC scrutiny of the divide between the content of SEC filings and sustainability reports. One of the SEC sample comments asked companies to advise the SEC of “what consideration” a company “gave to providing the same type of climate-related disclosure in your SEC filings as you provided in your CSR report.” Although companies have largely continued to provide the vast majority of their ESG disclosure on corporate websites in sustainability reports as opposed to their Form 10-Ks the rationale for this divide is being called into question by both the SEC comments and proposed rule changes on climate.

Enhance Your Controls on ESG. Following from these two points it is crucial to confirm whether (a) any ESG disclosures (whether they be on website sustainability reports or communicated to investors underwriters or banks) may be material and therefore required to be included in a Form 10-K and (b) sufficient controls are in place to ensure their accuracy and enable the information to be covered by Sarbanes Oxley certifications signed by CEOs and CFOs and filed with the SEC.

3. Focus on Next Steps in Light of ESG Trends and Proposed SEC Disclosure Rules on Climate

As the deadline passes for comments on the SEC’s rule proposal on climate change disclosure the SEC will determine the fate of ESG disclosures in SEC filings particularly the Form 10-K. In the meantime companies will need to:

First prepare to update your company’s ESG disclosure on a holistic basis for future reports—across your sustainability report proxy statement and your Form 10-K—as if the new SEC rules will not yet be in effect next year. Companies should begin considering their ESG disclosure on particular topics (for example human capital and climate) on a holistic basis across all of their disclosure documents to ensure consistency appropriate vetting of the accuracy of the disclosures and consistent messaging to investors. Second carefully scrutinize any proposed expansion of your ESG disclosures at this time and make sure they undergo a comprehensive legal review. It is crucial that companies take a hard look at any new proposed ESG disclosures at this time and conduct a thorough legal assessment of the implications of making any such new disclosures. In particular a company should consider in detail how the proposed rules (if adopted as proposed) would impact any such new disclosure particularly as it relates to new E&S targets or goals and transition plans. Third take steps to prepare for the proposed SEC climate rules now as if they will be adopted substantially as proposed. Companies should establish a working group (including legal financial reporting sustainability IR and communications) and begin their assessment of what steps would need to be taken in order to comply with the new climate change disclosure requirements if the proposed rules are adopted substantially as proposed. This includes creating a plan to tackle those elements of the proposed rules that will be the most challenging for companies to comply with and require the most lead time to implement. Last but not least….remember the key word here: Controls controls and more effective controls. Regardless of whether companies include enhanced ESG disclosure in their next Form 10-Ks in light of the enhanced SEC scrutiny and trends on the horizon companies should treat this disclosure as if it were subject to their disclosure controls and procedures under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. This means establishing the same rigor of controls for such disclosure such as completing a sub-certification process and disclosure committee oversight to appropriately vet and confirm the accuracy of required disclosures.

Either way greenwashing is a harmful and deceitful way of advertising that a company is more sustainable than it actually is. Companies that make false claims should be held accountable. Here are 10 companies that have been caught greenwashing in various ways.

—

1. Volkswagen

A classic example of greenwashing is when Volkswagen admitted to cheating emissions tests by fitting various vehicles with a “defect” device with software that could detect when it was undergoing an emissions test and altering the performance to reduce the emissions level.

This was going on while to the public the company was touting the low-emissions and eco-friendly features of its vehicles in marketing campaigns. In actuality these engines were emitting up to 40 times the allowed limit for nitrogen oxide pollutants.

2. BP

Fossil fuel giant BP changed their name to Beyond Petroleum and publicly added solar panels on their gas stations. In December 2019 an environmental group called ClientEarth lodged a complaint against BP for misleading the public with its advertisements that focused on BP’s low-carbon energy products when more than 96% of its annual spend is on oil and gas.

3. ExxonMobil

Oil giant ExxonMobil has a long history of damaging the environment. In 1989 an Exxon oil tanker spilled 11 million gallons of crude oil into Alaska’s Prince William Sound in what was the worst oil spill in US history until the Deepwater Horizon oil spill in 2010. The Exxon oil spill covered 1300 miles of coastline and killed hundreds of thousands of seabirds otters seals and whales. More than 30 years later pockets of crude oil remain in some locations.

Recently ExxonMobil came under fire for advertising that suggested that its experimental algae biofuels could one day reduce transport emissions while it has no company-wide net zero target and its 2025 emission reduction targets do not include the vast majority of emissions resulting from its products.

4. Nestlé

In 2018 Nestlé released a statement saying that it had “ambitions” for its packaging to be 100% recyclable or reusable by 2025. However environmental groups and other critics pointed out that the company hadn’t released clear targets a timeline to accompany its ambitions or additional efforts to help facilitate recycling by consumers. Greenpeace reacted to this by releasing its own statement in which it said “Nestlé’s statement on plastic packaging includes more of the same greenwashing baby steps to tackle a crisis it helped to create. It will not actually move the needle toward the reduction of single-use plastics in a meaningful way and sets an incredibly low standard as the largest food and beverage company in the world.” In Break Free From Plastic’s 2020 annual report Nestlé along with Coca-Cola and PepsiCo were named the world’s top plastic polluters for the third year in a row.

5. Coca-Cola

In the annual report mentioned above by Break Free From Plastic Coca-Cola was ranked as the world’s number 1 plastic polluter it’s second consecutive year at the top. In 2020 the company came under fire when it announced that it would not abandon plastic bottles saying that they were popular with customers.

Despite this the company is adamant that it is making progress in tackling packaging waste. At the time a spokesperson said “Globally we have a commitment to get every bottle back by 2030 so that none of it ends up as litter or in the oceans and the plastic can be recycled into new bottles. Bottles with 100% recycled plastic are now available in 18 markets around the world and this is continually growing.”

Then in June 2021 environmental organisation Earth Island Institute filed a lawsuit against the beverage giant for falsely advertising that it is sustainable and eco-friendly despite being the largest plastic polluter in the world.

6. Starbucks

In 2018 Starbucks released a “straw-less lid” as part of its sustainability drive however this lid contained more plastic than the old lid and straw combination. The company didn’t dispute this but claimed that it is made from polypropylene a commonly-accepted recyclable plastic that “can be captured in recycling infrastructure.” Critics were quick to point out that only 9% of the world’s plastic is recycled so the company shouldn’t assume all the lids would be recycled. Further the US exports about one-third of its recycling to developing countries so it is simply passing its responsibility to poorer countries.

7. IKEA

IKEA was considered a beacon of a major corporation being sustainable before June 2020 when the furniture retailer was linked with illegal logging in Ukraine. In a report by NGO Earthsight the wood certification scheme IKEA uses Forest Stewardship Council was described as an organisation that greenwashes the timber industry. It was accused of failing to catch IKEA’s sourcing of conflict wood and act on it.

Further when IKEA built its “most sustainable store” yet in London in 2019 it did so on top of another sustainable store that was demolished after just 17 years of use.

8. Plastic Bottle Water Companies

A more subtle form of greenwashing can be seen in plastic water bottle companies like Poland Spring Evian and Deer Park that all have nature on their labels. This is laughably ironic considering that plastic water bottles are designed to be single-use and are contributing to the massive plastic waste crisis around the world.

9. Major Banks

The past several years have seen major financial institutions talking a big game about combating climate change yet these are more examples of companies exercising greenwashing strategies. JP Morgan Citibank and Bank of America have issued new “green investment” opportunities. However a report released last year by the Rainforest Action Network showed that big banks – the ones mentioned above but also including Wells Fargo Barclays Bank of China HSBC Goldman Sachs and Deutsche Bank – were still lending enormous sums to the industries that contribute the most to global warming like fossil fuels and deforestations while boasting that they’re the leaders of the green transition.

10. Fast Fashion Brands

H&M Zara and Uniqlo are among the companies that were caught greenwashing over the years. These fashion brands contribute to the massive amounts of textile waste caused by the clothing industry. According to the fashion nonprofit ReMake 80% of discarded textiles globally are incinerated or landfill-bound with just 20% being reused or recycled.

Fast fashion brands also have a habit of advertising its green initiatives widely despite it being a tiny part of its operations. For example in 2019 H&M launched its own line of “green” clothing titled “Conscious.” The company claims to use “organic” cotton and recycled polyester. However the line is nothing but a marketing tactic used to make themselves appear more environmentally friendly. When looking at H&M’s “Conscious” line its mission states: “Shop our selection of sustainable fashion pieces that make you both look and feel good.” However there is no single legal definition for marketing-friendly words such as “sustainable” “green” or “environmentally-friendly.” H&M was then criticised by the Norwegian Customer Authority for “misleading” marketing of their Conscious Collection because “the information given regarding sustainability was not sufficient especially given that the Conscious Collection is advertised as a collection with environmental benefits.”

What Can I Do?

1. On A Personal Level

Ways to approach climate action within our personal lives (hint – it evolves personal action but is not focused on small behavioural changes which whilst worthwhile will not get us there):

Joining a community can be one of the best ways to increase your impact.

First it can enable you to make hundreds of connections in one go.

Second a group of people working together can have more impact than individuals. If you are not already take action by becoming an EO Member to support our mission to encourage a billion climate activists .

If you’re a younger read ask your parents to take action by bringing your whole family on board as a Family Member.

Reflect on the concept of Effective Altruism  a project that aims to find the best ways to help others and put them into practice.

2. On A Professional Level

Ways to approach climate action within the workplace:

Maintain your career path but consider donating a portion of your income to organisations that are focused on achieving meaningful & impactful goals and call out your boss if the company or organisation you work for does not have clear policies that will result in reduced harm to the environment and a pathway to Net Zero.

Ask your boss to support EO by bringing the whole team onboard with EO company membership – and take action together.

Reconsider your career path with excellent advice here .

3. On A Political Level

Ways to approach climate action as a voter or political actor (even if you can’t vote):

Protest – make your feelings known – become a vocal and passionate advocate with friends and family (without being over pushy) of the need for climate action. We need a billion activists to turn this ship around.

Join organisations that are organising climate actions and protests locally whether in your city district or even at school.

Vote (if you can) for politicians who will champion effective climate action by governments.

Vote for parties or organisations that espouse self-reform and the adoption of ‘ Ministers of the Future ’ into government.

Honda senior management have come to terms with their decision to leave despite the exit coinciding with huge success for their technology – but that does not mean the company are done with Formula 1 forever. Far from it. Many inside the company are believed to be keen for a return.

Their chief reason for leaving was to focus on their goal of achieving carbon neutrality throughout the automotive company. They are pushing the Formula 1 resource which ran into the hundreds of millions of dollars into achieving that target.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiP2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZ0LmNvbS9jb250ZW50LzNhMzYzZWM5LWJmMmItNGZhMS1iNzU2LTUzMWJkMjlmYmJhN9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,UK aims to set the pace for corporate net zero plans,"Print this page

A host should set the tone for a gathering. And so as delegates descended on Glasgow for the COP26 summit last November the UK government announced that the country would become “the world’s first net zero-aligned financial centre”. Listed companies and big asset managers would be required to publish a plan for achieving net zero carbon emissions — or explain why they could not.

The UK’s status as a global financial hub meant that the announcement was of more than local interest — and the deadline is now less than a year away. By June 2023 UK-listed companies will have to publish net zero transition plans as will regulated investors who manage more than £50bn in assets or own more than £25bn. Smaller asset managers with at least £5bn under management have until June 2024 to follow suit.

What is less certain is precisely what the government will expect plans to comprise and how it will sanction companies whose plans fall short.

“There’s competition between financial centres to be leaders on this issue” says Alyssa Gilbert head of policy at Imperial College London’s Grantham Institute for Climate Change. “You can’t just be a leader by having some companies that are green unicorns. You need to raise the bar for everyone. Because of competition other countries will follow.”

The detailed requirements for transition plans are the remit of the recently formed Transition Plan Taskforce which includes policymakers members of the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) — the UK’s financial services regulator — and representatives from the finance industry. The TPT will build on the current international standards set out by the Taskforce on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) and publish its findings by the end of this year.

These will include how to treat Scope 3 carbon emissions which cover everything from the start of a company’s supply chain to the final use of its products and its employees’ commuting. That range makes them harder to measure and manage than Scope 1 emissions which are simply those directly from a company’s own operations and Scope 2 which arise from the energy it purchases.

“Scope 3 is notoriously difficult” says Michael Marks head of responsible investment integration at Legal and General Investment Management (LGIM). “I expect emphasis on Scope 3 but with understanding that it’s very difficult to measure.”

Companies that get on well with their suppliers will fare better predicts Gilbert. “If you’re talking to your supply chain and have a good relationship that makes it easier to talk to them about climate change.”

Small and mid-cap companies have furthest to go in catching up on Scope 3 according to Neville White at investment manager EdenTree. “Lots of Scope 3 will be assumptions and modelling rather than hard data” he says. “At the moment assumptions could be widely out.” He sees western European countries including France and the UK as leading on the issue and likely to set global standards.

Near-term goals are another area to watch. “If 2050 is the only bit of your transition plan you don’t have a transition plan” argues Gilbert at Imperial.

Marks agrees: “Where we are today is ‘do you have a target?’ Where we’re going next is ‘do you have a long-term target medium-term target and a short-term target?’’’

It is the latter that will keep the current cohort of senior managers on their toes according to White. “There’s no point setting a 2040 target because they won’t be there” he says.

The COP26 climate conference in Glasgow where the UK announced its ambition to become ‘the world’s first net zero-aligned financial centre’

Requiring every listed company and big asset manager to publish a transition plan reduces “first-move disadvantage” according to Nina Seega a research director at the University of Cambridge Institute for Sustainability Leadership. In the past companies that published their emissions data and transition plans first found themselves under extra scrutiny while their less sustainable peers were able to lurk in the shadows.

But all publishers of transition plans will be anxious to avoid accusations of overstating their sustainability credentials — so-called greenwashing — particularly after German police raided fund manager DWS in May on suspicion that it had done so.

Last month Richard Dudley global head of climate strategy at insurance broker Aon warned a conference on net zero convened by employer organisation the CBI that transition plans could give rise to litigation. Companies that “say [they] want to do something and then can’t” could be “open to class actions” he said. He added that such risks could mean that a transition plan “becomes a compliance exercise”.

Gilbert says changes to plans are inevitable since “some assumptions will be wrong eventually”. But rather than avoid committing to anything she suggests producing “if-then plans” which involve taking a certain action only if specified conditions are met.

Policymakers at the Treasury — to which the FCA and the TPT are answerable — must walk a fine line in setting transition plan standards. Too lenient and they undermine the aim of becoming the world leader in green finance; too strict and companies seeking light-touch regulation may be put off listing in London. Current indications are that levels of disclosure will be at least as high as those of the TCFD but with the laggards punished by market forces rather than regulators.

“The market will assess [companies’ transition plans] for credibility” says Marks at LGIM. “We certainly believe this will impact on their cost of capital.”

Indeed the market is already making such assessments. In 2018 for example LGIM divested from Japan Post Holdings on climate grounds. It only reinvested this year after the company published a net zero target for 2050 and an interim target for 2030.

Many companies are seeking to avert such setbacks by submitting their plans for external scrutiny — for example from the Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi) a project that assesses and validates corporate targets in terms of their impact on global warming. Among them is DWF a London-listed law firm which will publish its first SBTi-endorsed plan as part of its annual report in the next few months.

“We are genuinely committed to making the changes required” says Kirsty Rogers global head of environmental social and governance at DWF. “There is significant growth in legal action for organisations and individuals who make statements and commitments that are not genuine . . . Reputation will be the most critical factor for an organisation and increasingly all stakeholders are empowered to speak up.”

Seega at Cambridge points out that NGOs are “very good at exerting pressure” on laggard companies. “We need the market to move and the regulation to follow” she says. “It usually takes a bit more time for regulation to kick in.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiW2h0dHBzOi8vdGhlbWFsYXlzaWFucmVzZXJ2ZS5jb20vMjAyMi8wNy8xNi9ob3BlLW9mZmVycy1zb2x1dGlvbi1mb3ItYjQwLW00MC1ob21lLW93bmVyc2hpcC_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,HOPE offers solution for B40 M40 home ownership,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://themalaysianreserve.com/2022/07/16/hope-offers-solution-for-b40-m40-home-ownership/ on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiW2h0dHBzOi8vdGhlbWFsYXlzaWFucmVzZXJ2ZS5jb20vMjAyMi8wNy8xNi9ob3BlLW9mZmVycy1zb2x1dGlvbi1mb3ItYjQwLW00MC1ob21lLW93bmVyc2hpcC_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen

Elon Musk announced that Tesla is working on Steam integration and will probably demo it next month.

Tesla Arcade is about to get more interesting with Steam integration.

The automaker’s video game platform already offers a diverse collection of games like Bethesda’s Fallout Shelter and simulation RPG Stardew Valley by Eric “ConcernedApe” Barone.

Valve’s digital video game distribution service Steam will offer Tesla owners an even wider collection of games. Steam is available on platforms supporting Windows macOS Linux iOS and Android. It is unavailable on popular consoles like the PlayStation XBOX or Nintendo Switch.

We’re making progress with Steam integration. Demo probably next month. — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) July 15 2022

Steam integration would make Tesla Arcade a lot more exciting. Some popular games available through steam are Counter-Strike: Global Offensive Dota 2 PUGB: Battlegrounds and Apex Legends.

The Street believes that Steam might provide an additional revenue source for Tesla. It argues that “making the Steam library accessible from Tesla Arcade…will allow Tesla to offer a new service that the group could charge to its customers.”

Steam is free to download and use but many games must be purchased. Some games cost as low as $1 and a few are free-to-play. It would probably be a little weird for Tesla to charge for Steam when it is usually free to download and use.

However Tesla could release other products via the Tesla Shop for gaming. For instance Tesla might release another gaming controller for their vehicles. Last year Tesla a Tesla-branded game controller was revealed but no details have been released about it yet. The Steam integration demo next month might be a good time to unveil a Tesla-branded controller.

The ETFs managed by AXS Investments are the first of their kind to be approved by the Securities and Exchange Commission — though similar products have existed for years in Europe.

These new funds allow investors to short stocks like Tesla (TSLA) or make a levered long bet on a name like Nike (NKE) or Pfizer (PFE) with a regular brokerage account.

Another ""democratization"" of some of the riskier trades available to investment professionals.

SINGLE STOCK ETFs LAUNCH IN THE U.S.

Unlike many ETFs — which for some have become synonymous with index funds like the Vanguard 500 Index Fund (VOO) — these products are clearly intended for active traders and not passive investors. Reason being: leverage is commonly misunderstood and isn't for the faint of heart.

Leveraged products can cause substantial losses for investors while the underlying stock chops around and appears to ""do nothing.""

The goal of a 2x ETF for instance is to reflect two times the performance of the underlying stock or index each day. If performance is measured on a longer time period the results can drastically differ.

Consider the following hypothetical example of a stock and its 3x ETF which is trying to reflect the daily underlying performance of a given stock times three.

Both securities trading at $100 per share and experience seven volatile sessions where the stock trades up or down at least 10% over the period.

At the end of our hypothetical period the underlying stock is basically flat while the 3X ETF is down over 40%.

LEVERAGED ETFs PERFORM POORLY WHEN MARKETS ARE CHOPPY

Chopping around with volatility kills these products' returns which is the number one lesson investors need to remember.

Let's look at another example of this dynamic but one happening in the real world today.

The Nasdaq 100 (^NDX) has been under pressure all year and is currently down about 27%. The ProShares Short QQQ ETF (PSQ) attempts to return the inverse of a long position while the ProShares UltraPro Short QQQ ETF (SQQQ) aims to return three times the inverse of that product each day.

PSQ — the unlevered short — has returned that which the Nasdaq 100 lost — or 27%.

The 3X version is returning a healthy 74% — but that's shy of the 81% that an uninformed investor may have been expecting (3 x 27%.= 81%).

Over the last year the performance difference gets more challenging with the unlevered short up 13% while the 3x levered short ETF up only 9%. On longer time frames — check out the 5Y performance on the chart above for instance — the imbalance only gets worse.

Regulators warn

Despite the SEC's approval of the new ETFs regulators have been warning investors about risks in these products. SEC chairman Gary Gensler has raised concerns about these new ETFs and SEC commissioner Caroline Crenshaw has been outright critical.

Story continues

""[I]n addition to presenting significant investor protection issues in periods of market stress or volatility leveraged and inverse products can act in unexpected ways and potentially contribute to broader systemic risks"" Crenshaw wrote this week on the SEC's website.

Crenshaw also issued a warning to registered investment advisors (RIAs) saying it would be ""challenging"" for them to recommend these products while ""also honoring his or her fiduciary obligations.""

Unlike stock brokers RIAs have a fiduciary obligation to act in their customers' best financial interests.

The most recent round in June took the entry-level Tesla Model 3 RWD to $46990 (plus +$1450 DST and order fee) and Tesla Model Y LR AWD to $65990. There is also the MIT Tesla Model Y reportedly at $61990.

There were fundamental reasons for that like constrained/more expensive parts and materials lockdowns as well as inflation. Another thing was high demand with long estimated delivery time - up to around a year in some cases. Tesla was also pushing to achieve its high margin target.

Tesla's CEO Elon Musk was recently asked on Twitter about any plans to reduce the prices after the pandemic or after solving supply chain issues.

His answer was:

""If inflation calms down we can lower prices for cars""

In other words there is a chance for lower prices but the outlined conditions to even consider lower prices are beyond Tesla's control - inflation.

We are not economic experts but there are a lot of voices saying that inflation might remain relatively high for a few years which unfortunately means no affordable Teslas in the short term. The times of the $35000 Tesla Model 3 are gone and are most likely not coming back in foreseeable future.

From the business perspective there is also no reason to lower prices of any product as long as demand is high (far outperforms the supply) because actually what would be the reason? Because of that we guess that the company will not reduce prices if it does not have to (to spark some additional demand).

The ultimate force that might convince Tesla to lower the prices might be competition - affordable and compelling electric cars from other manufacturers. Those new BEVs are coming but as they are also overwhelmed by high demand there is no pressure for lower prices."
TXN,Texas Instruments,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiX2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRleGFya2FuYWdhemV0dGUuY29tL25ld3MvMjAyMi9qdWwvMTcvdGV4YXMtaW5zdHJ1bWVudHMtd2VudC1mcm9tLXBoYXNpbmctb3V0LWNoaXAv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Texas Instruments went from phasing out chip plant to modernizing it,"Before Texas Instruments Inc. selected Sherman for a $30 billion expansion the Dallas-based analog chip producer was packing its bags to leave.

In January 2020 Texas Instruments told Sherman city officials it would be closing a fabrication plant that turns 150-millimeter silicon wafers into semiconductors used in everything from autos to industrial machinery.

Kent Sharp was still new in his position as president of the Sherman Economic Development Corporation when that bombshell reached his desk. TI is one of the city's largest private employers.

""Oh God I just got here. Please don't do that"" he remembers thinking.

Texas Instruments told city officials the plant was too outdated for modern manufacturing processes and would be phased out over the next three years said Sherman Mayor David Plyler.

""They had been in our community for about 60 years so you can imagine our disappointment when they said they were closing"" Plyler said.

The city braced to lose 500 jobs while holding out hope that a new industrial employer would eventually move in. Over the next year and a half though mass layoffs never came.

""We didn't notice that anybody had lost their job there"" Plyler said.

Sherman's advantages

More than a year later the analog chip producer made a u-turn and announced it had selected Sherman for a $30 billion expansion project to build up to four new fabrication plants.

The original 150-millimeter wafer facility in Sherman is still expected to end operations in 2024 or 2025 in line with Texas Instruments' original plan disclosed to the city in January 2020. The 300-millimeter facilities under construction are part of the company's ""investment in long-term capacity planning"" said spokeswoman Ellen Fishpaw.

Why the Sherman boomerang?

""We have strong relationships and support from the local Sherman community"" Fishpaw said. ""Sherman provides some unique advantages with regard to access to talent and an existing supplier base.""

More broadly Texas Instruments is known for its long-term strategy with analog chips embedded processors and its other products. In 2021 analog sales drove 77% of the company's $18.3 billion in revenue. Analog chips aren't as technologically sophisticated as most semiconductors but they are ubiquitous. Analogs link the physical and digital worlds. Sensors that measure temperature pressure and other physical signals rely on these chips which typically cost less than $1. As the world continues to digitize demand for analog chips will continue to grow especially as electric vehicles gain in prominence.

Prioritizing long-term demand over short-term impacts worked during 2020 and Texas Instruments is following the script again with new Sherman and Richardson facilities.

When many semiconductor companies were trimming production during uncertain pandemic conditions Texas Instruments did just the opposite.

""You guys were one of the few folks that actually built inventory in 2020"" Bernstein semiconductor analyst Stacy Rasgon said during a conference call with the company June 2.

CEO Rich Templeton said the company made the right choice.

""April of 2020 when we said we're going to keep the factories running there was this kind of general dismay of 'What are you doing?' We said 'No trust me it's really the right move' and it really paid off"" Templeton said.

Inventory built up during the pandemic lasted until the first quarter of 2021.

""Eventually they started getting shortages too but they were a bit better prepared than a lot of their peers in 2020 because they learned the lesson from 2008"" Rasgon said.

Chip producers scaled back production in the 2008 financial crisis only to be caught flat-footed when demand roared back in 2009.

The long-term view

Texas Instruments was able to produce and store inventory in 2020 because it specializes in analog chips with long shelf lives for automotive and industrial customers.

""What [TI is] selling especially now doesn't go stale. There's no real long-term impact. You ship it today. You ship it tomorrow. What's the difference?"" Rasgon said.

Extra inventory from the early pandemic days is now depleted but Texas Instruments continues to peer years down the road instead of trying to micromanage short-term supply.

Templeton said the new Sherman and Richardson facilities are part of a ""15-year road map"" and each will produce close to $6 billion in annual revenue once running at full capacity. That could take a few years depending on construction time and chip demand. The shell of a second 300-millimeter plant in Richardson is complete and the plant is now being equipped. That roughly $3.1 billion investment will be ready to start production in the second half of this year.

Texas Instruments is placing all this momentum behind 300-millimeter wafer chip production rather than 150-millimeter wafers. Larger wafers mean more chips per wafer which typically boosts productivity by 4% annually according to Smithsonian research.

The company was the first to begin producing analog chips from 300-millimeter wafers buying technology and equipment from bankrupt industry players for pennies on the dollar after the financial crisis Rasgon said. The Sherman and Richardson projects will require more expensive new equipment this time around but Texas Instruments is confident in its business model.

""It's great to get equipment at 10 cents on $1"" Templeton said. ""But the real magic of 300-millimeter wafer fabs is 300-millimeter not what you pay for it.""

Texas Instruments' products are used by more than 100000 customers who make everything from consumer electronics to space rockets giving it a reach that often acts as a bellwether of demand across the economy. The company reports its next quarterly results July 26.

Wild type (WT) C57BL/6 J mice fed a HFD for four weeks develop NAFLD as detected by elevated liver triglyderides relative to levels prior to HFD feeding. We screened for mutations that modify the NAFLD phenotype and identified a phenotype termed Oily characterized by increased liver triglycerides compared to WT mice after four weeks on a HFD (Fig. 1a). The Oily phenotype was mapped as a quantitative trait. Liver triglycerides were measured in a total of 44 G3 mice and normalized to total protein. AMM6 implicated a missense allele of Gm4951 as the causative mutation displaying strongest linkage in an additive model of inheritance (P = 1.66 × 10−5) (Fig. 1b). The Oily mutation was a single nucleotide transversion from C to A causing substitution of a lysine for an asparagine at position 86 (N86K) in the GM4951 protein (Supplementary Fig. 1a). Later a second allele of Gm4951 termed Carboniferous was also identified by our screen (Fig. 1c). Carboniferous also scored in an additive model of inheritance (P = 2.332 × 10−5) (Fig. 1d). The Carboniferous mutation was a single nucleotide transition from A to G causing substitution of a glycine for an aspartic acid at position 125 (D125G) in the GM4951 protein (Fig. S1a). Combination of these two pedigrees in superpedigree analysis6 revealed a significant P value of 5.16 × 10−10 in an additive model of inheritance (Fig. 1e f). Body weight before and after HFD fasting and refeeding glucose fasting and refeeding insulin and fasting and refeeding free fatty acids (FFA) were also measured during the course of screening (Supplementary Fig. 2). None of these phenotypes were significantly different in reference allele homozygotes as compared to homozygous or heterozygous Oily mice (Supplementary Fig. 2). These data suggested that Oily and Carboniferous mutations caused a form of NAFLD unassociated with obesity or abnormal glucose metabolism.

Oily and Carboniferous are caused by loss-of-function mutations in Gm4951

Neither the Oily (N86K) nor the Carboniferous (D125G) mutations affected stability of GM4951 as revealed by a similar expression level as the WT protein in 293T cells (Fig. 2a b). We suspected that these mutations affect the function of GM4951 protein. By CRISPR/Cas9 gene targeting we introduced a null allele of Gm4951 encoding the first 35aa of the GM4951 protein followed by six aberrant amino acids and a termination codon into the germline of C57BL/6 J mice (Fig. 2a Supplementary Fig. 1a). Gm4951 knockout homozygotes appeared indistinguishable from WT mice and both sexes were fertile. Crosses of knockout heterozygotes yielded the anticipated Mendelian ratio among offspring at weaning age (Supplementary Fig. 1b). Gm4951 knockout mice were bred and expanded to form a large pedigree with all three zygosities represented and subjected to the same screens as G3 mice. The Gm4951 null allele recapitulated all aspects of the Oily and Carboniferous phenotypes (Fig. 2c–l) and reproduced the additive inheritance pattern (Fig. 2c d). These data confirm that Gm4951 mutations in Oily and Carboniferous strains were causative of the observed phenotypes and ruled out gain-of-function as a mechanism.

The development of NAFLD in Gm4951 knockout mice is not associated with alterations in body weight or glucose metabolism

Obesity is strongly associated with an increased risk of NAFLD19. The presence of hepatosteatosis is often associated with aberrant glucose fatty acid and lipoprotein metabolism reflective of insulin resistance and other metabolic dysfunctions2021. It is still not clear whether NAFLD causes metabolic dysfunction or whether metabolic dysfunction is responsible for the development of NAFLD or both2223. Although obesity correlates with NAFLD a minority of patients with NAFLD are lean24. Similarly Oily mice and Gm4951−/− mice on a HFD did not show significant alterations in body weight or glucose metabolism concomitant with development of hepatosteatosis (Fig. 2 Supplementary Fig. 2). The inguinal white adipose tissue (iWAT) of 4 week HFD-fed Gm4951−/− mice expressed similar mRNA levels of lipid metabolism genes (Acaca Pnpla2 Dgat1 Fasn) adipokines (Fabp4 Adipoq Leptin) and key transcription factors (Fabp4 Cebpa) (Supplementary Fig. 3a). Besides parameters tested in our screen we checked additional lipid profiles in serum and liver from 4 week HFD-fed mice. Compared with WT mice Gm4951−/− mice exhibited increased serum triglycerides (Supplementary Fig. 3b) with no change in serum total cholesterol (Supplementary Fig. 3c) low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol (Supplementary Fig. 3d) and high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol (Supplementary Fig. 3e). GM4951 deficiency significantly increased both triglycerides (Supplementary Fig. 3f) and FFA (Supplementary Fig. 3g) in the liver with no change in liver cholesterol (Supplementary Fig. 3h). To check if Gm4951−/− mice develop NAFLD on a standard chow diet we monitored liver triglycerides at different ages in WT and Gm4951−/− mice (Fig. 3a). Significantly increased liver triglycerides were observed in Gm4951 knockout mice by 24 weeks of age (Fig. 3a). Along with the development of hepatosteatosis we also detected an elevated level of alanine transaminase (ALT) in the serum of Gm4951−/− mice indicating liver damage caused by hepatosteatosis (Fig. 3b). On a chow diet GM4951 deficiency changed neither the body weight nor body fat content measured by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) (Fig. 3c d). Also fasting glucose insulin and serum triglycerides remained the same in Gm4951−/− and WT mice (Fig. 3e–g). These data suggest that NAFLD develops spontaneously in GM4951 deficient mice with no noticeable obesity or insulin resistance.

In screening a 4-week HFD was used to augment the development of NAFLD in C57BL6/J mice. To maximize the obesogenic effect of HFD Gm4951−/− mice were fed a HFD for 24 weeks. Compared to the 4-week course of HFD a long-term HFD further increased liver weight (Fig. 3h) liver triglycerides (Fig. 3i) and serum ALT in Gm4951−/− mice (Fig. 3j). Despite the further development of NAFLD no significant differences in body weight fat weight glucose insulin and serum triglycerides were observed between long-term HFD-fed WT and Gm4951−/− mice (Fig. 3k–o). Histologically compared to Gm4951+/+ controls Gm4951−/− mice fed a long-term HFD exhibited severe hepatosteatosis as detected by both hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining (Fig. 3p q Supplementary Fig. 4a) and oil red O staining (Fig. 3r s Supplementary Fig. 4b) of liver sections. Long-term HFD fed WT and Gm4951−/− mice were also checked for different aspects of liver fibrosis which is a prognostic factor for NAFLD patients25. Compared with WT mice Gm4951−/− mice had increased collagen in the liver detected by picrosirius red (PSR) staining (Fig. 3t u Supplementary Fig. 4c). We also observed increased α-smooth muscle actin (α-SMA)-positive myofibroblasts in Gm4951−/− liver sections suggesting the activation of hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) (Fig. 3v w Supplementary Fig. 4d). The overall NAFLD Activity Score (NAS)26 was increased for livers from Gm4951−/− mice (Supplementary Fig. 4e) suggesting the development of NASH in Gm4951−/− mice after long-term HFD. Along with this the mRNA levels of several liver fibrosis-related genes (Col1a1 Mmp9 Timp1) were also increased in livers from Gm4951−/− mice (Fig. 3x). To determine the effect of GM4951 overexpression on liver triglycerides we used hydrodynamic tail vein injection to deliver 3xFlag-Gm4951 expression plasmid to the liver. Two weeks after HFD 3xFlag-Gm4951-injected mice had a decreased level of liver triglycerides compared with control vector-injected mice (Fig. 3y z). All these data suggest a liver intrinsic role of GM4951 in the regulation of liver triglycerides.

GM4951 is an interferon inducible GTPase highly expressed in hepatocytes

To characterize the function of GM4951 we first studied the expression profile of Gm4951 mRNA in different mouse tissues. Among tissues tested from 8-week-old male C57BL6/J mice Gm4951 mRNA was maximally expressed in the liver (Fig. 4a). Gm4951 mRNA was also detected in the interscapular white adipose tissue (iWAT) lung epididymal white adipose tissue (eWAT) stomach and spleen but in each case at levels far lower than in liver (Fig. 4a). To measure relative expression of the endogenous GM4951 protein we generated 3xFlag-Gm4951 knockin mice by CRISPR-mediated homologous replacement (Fig. 4b). Consistent with the Gm4951 mRNA profile endogenous GM4951 protein (as indicated by anti-Flag tag immunoblotting) showed highest expression level in the liver with detectable amounts in the spleen lung eWAT iWAT thymus and intestine (Fig. 4c). 90% of liver mass is composed of hepatocytes while the remainder consists of nonparenchymal elements including Kupffer cells liver sinusoidal endothelial cells hepatic stellate cells and cholangiocytes. Previously reported mass spectrometry-based protein quantification revealed highest expression of GM4951 protein in hepatocytes27 (Fig. 4d). The subcellular localization of GM4951 in AML12 mouse hepatocytes appeared perinuclear and partially colocalized with markers for mitochondria (apoptosis-inducing factor AIF) endosomes (early endosome antigen 1 EEA1) ER (protein disulfide isomerase PDI) and Golgi (receptor-binding cancer antigen expressed on SiSo cells RCAS1) (Fig. 4e–h).

GM4951 contains an interferon inducible GTPase (IIGP) domain which is a Pfam28 domain (#PF05049) built on 6 seed sequences of IRG protein family (TGTP1 IRGA6 IFI47 IRGM1 IGTP IRGM2) for alignment. Considering the predominant expression of GM4951 in hepatocytes we treated mouse primary hepatocytes with recombinant IFNγ in vitro. Induction of Gm4951 mRNA occurred in response to IFNγ administered at a concentration between 0.1 and 1.0 ng/ml (Fig. 4i). Consistent with the induction of Gm4951 mRNA we also detected increased expression of GM4951 protein in hepatocytes isolated from 3xFlag-Gm4951 knockin mice and stimulated with IFNγ in vitro (Fig. 4j). To test whether GM4951 is a bona fide GTPase recombinant full-length GM4951 protein was expressed in E. coli BL21 and purified with affinity chromatography and size-exclusion chromatography. During the bioluminescent detection of GTPase activity purified GM4951 protein exhibited concentration-dependent intrinsic GTPase activity (Fig. 4k). These results suggest that GM4951 harbors common features of IRG family proteins.

Among 20 IRG proteins in mice GM4951 displays the highest sequence identity (77%) with interferon inducible GTPase 1 (IIGP1 now known as IRGA6) (Supplementary Fig. 5a). The crystal structure of IRGA6 revealed that GTP-dependent oligomerization of IRGA6 is required for cooperative GTP hydrolysis9. We constructed both the Oily mutant form (N86K) and Carboniferous mutant form (D125G) of GM4951 each tagged with both HA and 3xFlag and tested whether either mutation might disrupt dimerization. Overexpressed WT GM4951 protein in 293T cells interacted strongly with itself (Supplementary Fig. 5b). Neither Oily nor Carboniferous mutations affected self-interaction. As expected the predicted dimerization interface mutation (E43A-K47A) strongly disrupted the self-interaction of GM4951 in 293T cells (Supplementary Fig. 5c).

Structural study of IRGA6 revealed active site residues critical for GDP and GppNHp binding including G81/K82 (P loop/G1) D126 (126DLPG129/G3) D186 (183TKVD186/G4) and S231/N232 (G5)9. All these amino acids are identical in GM4951. The D125 in GM4951 is equivalent to D126 in IRGA6 which is in close contact with Mg2+ as shown in the IRGA6-GDP structure (Supplementary Fig. 5d). The N86 in GM4951 is equivalent to N87 in IRGA6 which is adjacent to P loop (Supplementary Fig. 5e). Both purified Oily (N86K) and Carboniferous (D125G) mutated GM4951 showed dramatically reduced intrinsic GTPase activity compared with WT GM4951 protein in vitro (Fig. 4l). Taken together these data indicate that GM4951 is a hepatocyte interferon-inducible protein with intrinsic GTPase activity. In addition they suggest that the Oily and Carboniferous mutations disrupt the ability of GM4951 to hydrolyze GTP without affecting its dimerization.

GM4951 supports lipid oxidation

Hepatic lipid accumulation results from an imbalance between lipid acquisition and lipid disposal which are regulated through four major pathways: uptake of circulating lipid de novo lipogenesis fatty acid oxidation and export of lipids via very low-density lipoproteins (VLDL). To investigate changes in expression of representative genes encoding components of these four major pathways a group of WT and Gm4951−/− mice was placed on HFD for four weeks while another age-matched group of WT and Gm4951−/− mice was placed on a standard chow diet. The mRNA levels of two lipid transporters (Slc27a1 Cd36) two lipid exporters (Apob Mttp) and four lipogenesis enzymes (Acaca Fasn Elovl6 Scd1) were similar between WT and Gm4951−/− livers both in chow and HFD groups (Fig. 5a b). Significantly decreased expression of Ppara and Acox1 were observed in livers from Gm4951−/− mice on HFD and a trend toward decreased expression (not significant) of Acot1 and Acadl were observed in Gm4951−/− mice on HFD (Fig. 5b). These four genes encode constituents of lipid oxidation pathways. No significant changes of these lipid oxidation genes were observed in Gm4951−/− mice on chow diet at 10 weeks of age when NAFLD had not developed yet (Fig. 5a). Reduced expression of these lipid oxidation genes was observed in livers from Gm4951−/− mice on chow diet at 24 weeks of age when NAFLD had developed (Fig. 5c). Primary hepatocytes isolated from Gm4951−/− mice also showed significally decreased expression of the four lipid oxidation genes after oleic acid (OA) treatment suggesting this phenotype is hepatocyte intrinsic (Fig. 5d). To assay lipid oxidation ability in the liver we measured the reaction products from oxidation of 14C labeled palmitic acid by proteins in liver lysates from 4 week HFD fed mice in vitro. Compared with WT livers Gm4951−/− livers showed a significantly decreased rate of lipid oxidation as revealed by reduced CO 2 released and acid soluble CoAs in the reaction mix (Fig. 5e–f). To rule out a defect in triglyceride secretion WT and Gm4951−/− mice were put on HFD for 4 weeks which effectively induces NAFLD in Gm4951−/− mice. After inhibition of lipoprotein lipase by Triton WR-1399 injection we measured serum triglycerides. We noticed a small but significantly higher level of triglycerides in the serum of Gm4951−/− mice (Fig. 5g). This suggests that hepatosteatosis observed in Gm4951−/− mice was not caused by failure to export triglycerides. We have shown that the development of NAFLD in GM4951 deficient mice was not associated with increased body weight or altered glucose metabolism (Fig. 3). Taken together these data suggest that defective lipid oxidation pathways contribute to hepatic lipid accumulation in GM4951 deficient mice.

HFD inhibits the expression of Gm4951

The acceleration of NAFLD in GM4951 deficient mice by HFD (Fig. 3) prompted us to test whether the expression of Gm4951 is regulated during the development of NAFLD. We fed C57BL6/J mice a chow diet or HFD for 24 weeks and checked the mRNA level of Gm4951 in the liver by real-time PCR. Interestingly the relative hepatic mRNA level of Gm4951 in WT mice on HFD decreased to around 30% of that observed in mice on chow diet suggesting a strong inhibition of hepatic Gm4951 under HFD feeding (Fig. 5h). In mice fed a HFD for 4 weeks an intermediate level of lipid accumulation was observed when one copy of Gm4951 was mutated (Gm4951Oily/+ Gm4951Carboniferous/+) or deleted (Gm4951+/-) (Figs. 1 2). We compared the mRNA level of Gm4951 in mice with a single WT Gm4951 allele with that in WT mice using 3xFlag-Gm4951 knockin mice. Flag tag-specific real-time PCR primers were designed to amplify only 3xFlag-Gm4951 but not WT Gm4951. mRNA expression derived from a single copy of Gm4951 was approximately 53% of that derived from two copies of Gm4951 in WT livers (Fig. 5i). These data suggest that the 70% reduction of Gm4951 after long-term HFD feeding in WT mice may be a key step leading to hepatic steatosis. The downregulation of GM4951 caused by HFD might in itself promote development of NAFLD.

GM4951 interacts with HSD17B13

To investigate the molecular mechanism of GM4951 in the regulation of lipid metabolism we utilized our 3xFlag-Gm4951 knockin mice to pull down GM4951 in liver lysates and identify interacting proteins by mass spectrometry (Fig. 6a). Among all proteins identified from mass spectrometry (Supplementary Data 1) HSD17B13 a recently identified liver restricted LD-associated protein was considered highly relevant due to its association with human NAFLD1618. GM4951 interacted with HSD17B13 when expressed in 293T cells (Fig. 6b c). In vitro GST pull-down experiments supported a direct interaction between GM4951 and HSD17B13 (Fig. 6d). Interestingly neither the Oily (N86K) nor Carboniferous (D125G) mutations disrupted the interaction of GM4951 with HSD17B13 (Fig. 6e). We checked the protein level of HSD17B13 in the liver of WT and Gm4951−/− mice and no significant changes were observed when mice were fed with chow diet or HFD (Supplementary Fig. 6). These data suggest that the interaction between GM4951 and HSD17B13 is not dependent on the GTPase activity of GM4951 and does not regulate the protein level of HSD17B13 in the liver.

GM4951 is necessary for HSD17B13 translocation to LDs

To better understand the association of GM4951 and HSD17B13 in lipid metabolism we checked their subcellular localization in hepatocytes. In untreated mouse primary hepatocytes with absent or very small LDs HSD17B13 only partially colocalized with GM4951 in the cytoplasm (Fig. 7a). When primary hepatocytes were loaded with LDs after OA treatment HSD17B13 and GM4951 almost completely colocalized around LDs to form a “circle-like” distribution (Fig. 7b). Similar results were also observed in AML12 hepatocytes (Supplementary Fig. 7a b). These data suggest that GM4951 interacts with HSD17B13 and translocates to LDs to regulate lipid metabolism. Although WT GM4951 translocated to LDs in lipid loaded primary hepatocytes (Fig. 7c d) and AML12 cells (Supplementary Fig. 7c d) both Oily (N86K) and Carboniferous (D125G) mutated GM4951 showed dramatically reduced LD translocation (Fig. 7e–h Supplementary Fig. 7e–h) suggesting that the GTPase activity of GM4951 is important for this translocation. OA induced a strong and continous localization of HSD17B13 around LDs in WT primary hepatocytes (Fig. 7i j). In Gm4951−/− primary hepatocytes the LD localization of HSD17B13 became weak and discontinuous (Fig. 7k l Supplementary Fig. 7i). Consistent with this isolated LDs from Gm4951−/− primary hepatocytes had decreased protein levels of HSD17B13 by immunoblot (Supplementary Fig. 7j). A similar phenotype was also observed in primary hepatocytes isolated from HFD-fed Gm4951−/− mice (Fig. 7m n). In contrast another LD protein Perilipin 2 (PLIN2) still maintained LD localization in the absence of GM4951 (Fig. 7o p). Taken together these data suggest that GM4951 brings HSD17B13 to LDs in a GTPase activity dependent manner.

Identification of potential human homologs of mouse GM4951

Mouse Gm4951 was not included in the NCBI HomoloGene database. A search for human protein sequences with similarity to mouse GM4951 protein sequence using Basic Local Alignment Search Tool (BLAST) identified two IRGs: immunity related GTPase cinema (IRGC) and immunity related GTPase M (IRGM) with identities of 35% and 38% respectively (Fig. 8a Supplementary Fig. 5a). IRGC contains an IIGP domain from amino acid 20 to 402 making it similar in size (by amino acid length) to the IIGP domain (aa 34-402) in mouse GM4951. Immunostaining in AML12 cells showed that most EEA1 positive endosomes colocalized with IRGC and a small portion of IRGC partially colocalized with AIF positive mitochondria (Fig. 8b c). IRGM contains a smaller IIGP domain (aa 2-193) than GM4951. Immunostaining in AML12 cells showed that IRGM exclusively colocalized with AIF positive mitochondria with no overlap with EEA1 positive endosomes (Fig. 8d e). It has been reported that variants of IRGM contribute to the development of human NAFLD by altering hepatic lipid metabolism through an effect on autophagy29. Thus we checked the autophagic flux in primary hepatocytes isolated from WT and Gm4951−/− mice. No dramatic difference in LC3BI/II and p62 expression was observed between Gm4951 knockout and WT hepatocytes with or without the treatment of the autophagy inhibitor bafilomycin A1 (Supplementary Fig. 8a). No consistent difference in autophagic flux was observed between WT and Gm4951−/− liver lysates (Supplementary Fig. 8b). Interaction between human HSD17B13 and IRGC but not IRGM (v1 longer isoform; v2 shorter isoform) was observed in 293T cells (Fig. 8f). In cultured primary human hepatocytes overexpression of GM4951 or IRGC decreased the level of triglycerides after OA treatment while no reduction of triglycerides was observed in IRGM overexpressing hepatocytes after OA treatment (Fig. 8g h). IRGC was shown to be expressed almost exclusively in human testis (Human Protein Atlas; proteinatlas.org)30. Quantification of IRGC mRNA by real-time PCR revealed a low level of IRGC in primary human hepatocytes and this level was elevated compared with that detected in primary human pre-adipocytes and other human cell lines (SW1088 astrocytoma cell line; SK-LMS-1 leiomyosarcoma cell line; SW872 liposarcoma cell line; THP-1 monocytic cell line; 293T embryonic kidney cell line; primary pre-adipocytes; HepG2 hepatocarcinoma cell line) (Fig. 8i). Knockdown of IRGC in OA treated primary human hepatocytes decreased the expression of several lipid oxidation genes including PPARA ACOT1 and ACOX1 (Fig. 8j). All these data favor IRGC as a biologically relevant human homolog of mouse GM4951.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiMmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5hdHVyZS5jb20vYXJ0aWNsZXMvczQxNTk4LTAyMi0xNjI4Ny160gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Systemic gene therapy with thymosin β4 alleviates glomerular injury in mice | Scientific Reports,"ADR is associated with the downregulation of TB4 in podocytes

ADR a chemotherapeutic drug replicates some of the features of human focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS)33 and has toxic effects on podocytes in vitro and in vivo including cytoskeletal disorganisation foot process effacement and loss of podocyte viability103435. Firstly we examined if ADR administration altered podocyte TB4 expression in mice. To assess the expression of Tmsb4x the gene encoding the TB4 protein specifically in podocytes we analysed a published scRNAseq dataset obtained from glomeruli of healthy or ADR-injured C57BL/6J mice36. Using unsupervised clustering analysis we derived ten transcriptionally distinct cell types (Fig. 1a) which using established markers of glomerular cell types we identified to represent all the known glomerular cell types (Supplementary Fig. 1a). Confirming the identity of podocytes the podocyte cluster expressed both nephrin (Nphs1) and podocin (Nphs2) components of the podocyte slit diaphragm (Fig. 1b). Comparison of control and ADR-injured glomeruli showed representation of all cell types in both groups (Supplementary Fig. 1b). As previously described36 we found a reduction in the proportion of podocyte cells in the ADR-injured glomeruli compared with controls (Supplementary Fig. 1c). ADR injury was associated with significant downregulation of Tmsb4x in the glomerular tuft assessed by grouped analysis of glomerular endothelial mesangial and podocyte cells (Fig. 1c; 0.23 log fold change; P < 0.0001) and a more pronounced 0.52 log fold reduction in podocytes (Fig. 1d; P < 0.0001). The expression of Tmsb10 another member of the β thymosins family which is enriched in podocytes37 was also reduced in podocytes (Fig. 1e; 1.52 log fold change; P < 0.0001). To assess whether the downregulation of Tmsb4x and Tmsb10 mRNA in podocytes is also evident in other mouse models of glomerular disease we analysed the scRNAseq datasets obtained from glomeruli of mice with nephrotoxic nephritis or BTBR ob/ob (LeprOb/Ob) mice with diabetic kidney disease36. The podocyte expression of both Tmsb4x and Tmsb10 was reduced in both mice with nephrotoxic nephritis or diabetes compared with healthy animals (Supplementary Fig. 2; P < 0.0001).

(a) Uniform manifold approximation and projection (UMAP) from single-cell RNA sequencing data of 8412 glomerular cells from two wildtype (control) mice and 8296 glomerular cells from mice with Adriamycin nephropathy (ADR). After analysis and cell type assignment ten transcriptionally distinct cell populations were discriminated including arterial endothelial cells (AEC) glomerular endothelial cells (GEC) macrophages (MΦ) mesangial cells monocytes (Mono) parietal epithelial cells (PEC) podocytes smooth muscle cells (SMC) T cells tubular epithelial cells (TEC). The markers used for cell type identification and assignment and the numbers of cell types per condition are shown in Supplementary Fig. 1.

Systemic upregulation of TB4 using gene therapy

We then assessed the effects of exogenous TB4 administration on ADR-induced glomerular disease. We took a preventative strategy and BALB/c mice were administered intravenously AAV-Tmsb4x or AAV-LacZ as a control3032. Three weeks after AAV injection ADR was administered (day 0). Fourteen days later the animals were euthanised and we compared mice administered either: (i) AAV-Tmsb4x and ADR (Tmsb4x/ADR); (ii) AAV-LacZ and ADR (LacZ/ADR) and (iii) AAV-LacZ and saline as our control group (LacZ/saline) (Fig. 2a). Initially we examined if AAV-Tmsb4x altered Tmsb4x mRNA levels in the liver the primary site of transduction following systemic AAV 2/7 administration38. We found a tenfold increase in liver Tmsb4x mRNA levels in the Tmsb4x/ADR group compared with the LacZ/ADR group (P = 0.0004) (Fig. 2b). This corresponded with strong positive immunostaining for TB4 in the liver in Tmsb4x/ADR mice (Fig. 2c). Additionally as TB4 is a secreted peptide39 we measured circulating levels and found a twofold increase in the Tmsb4x/ADR group compared with either the LacZ/ADR (P = 0.0217) or LacZ/saline group (P = 0.0021) (Fig. 2d). Using qRT-PCR on whole kidney lysates we found no difference in Tmsb4x mRNA levels between the three experimental groups (Fig. 2e) in agreement with previous reports that AAV 2/7 does not target the kidney38 . To assess whether circulating TB4 peptide can reach the podocytes we injected Tmsb4x knockout mice lacking endogenous TB4 protein with AAV-Tmsb4x or AAV-LacZ. Positive immunostaining for TB4 in podocytes co-labelled with synaptopodin was detected in Tmsb4x knockout mice injected with AAV-Tmsb4x but not in mice injected with AAV-LacZ (Supplementary Fig. 3).

(a) BALB/c mice were injected with AAV-LacZ or AAV-Tmsb4x three weeks prior to 10 mg/kg ADR or vehicle (saline) administration and culled 14 days after ADR/saline injection at which point thymosin β4 levels were quantified.

TB4 prevents ADR-induced albuminuria

Next we examined the effect of TB4 administration on ADR injury in vivo. Firstly as an overall measure of health we weighed the mice throughout the time course of the experiment. All mice administered ADR lost a significantly greater proportion of their body weight 48 h following ADR injection compared with LacZ/saline animals (Fig. 3a). This difference was sustained at both day 7 and 14 after ADR injection. At all time-points there was no difference between ADR mice administered AAV-LacZ and AAV-Tmsb4x.

We then analysed the levels of albumin in the urine (μg/24 h) a marker of glomerular filtration barrier integrity40. Prior to ADR injection there was no difference in the levels of urinary albumin (mean ± SEM of LacZ/saline group: 95 ± 16 LacZ/ADR group: 41 ± 16 Tmsb4x/ADR group: 60 ± 32). Similar levels were found two days after ADR administration with no differences between the three groups of mice (LacZ/saline group: 103 ± 20 LacZ/ADR group: 65 ± 11 Tmsb4x/ADR group: 73 ± 7). Conversely at 14 days post ADR injection albuminuria significantly increased to 1448 ± 115 in the LacZ/ADR mice compared with 107 ± 22 in LacZ/saline animals (P = 0.001). Strikingly gene therapy with TB4 prevented this increase with a urinary albumin excretion of 214 ± 43 in the Tmsb4x/ADR group (P < 0.0001 versus LacZ/ADR group) (Fig. 3b). We analysed the relationship between plasma TB4 concentration and albuminuria in LacZ/ADR and Tmsb4x/ADR mice 14 days post ADR injection and found a negative correlation (R2 = 0.4584 P = 0.0221 Fig. 3c). Urea is freely filtered through the glomerular filtration barrier and increased plasma blood urea nitrogen (BUN) concentration is an indicator of declining kidney function41. However we found that there were no significant changes between any of the groups 14 days after ADR administration (Fig. 3d). Assessment of gross glomerular morphology revealed that both LacZ/ADR and Tmsb4x/ADR mice had significantly more abnormal glomeruli compared with LacZ/saline mice (P < 0.0001) but there was no significant decrease between LacZ/ADR and Tmsb4x/ADR mice (Fig. 3e–g).

Previously the protective effect of TB4 in CKD has been linked to its anti-inflammatory properties162442. We quantified F4/80+ macrophage numbers within and around the glomerular tuft (Supplementary Fig. 4a). Within the glomerular tuft macrophages were rare across all three groups (Supplementary Fig. 4b). The number of macrophages outside the glomerular tuft was similar among the groups (Supplementary Fig. 4c) excluding a role for macrophage accumulation in our model and suggesting that the protective effect of TB4 in ADR-induced glomerular injury occurs by other means.

TB4 prevents ADR-induced podocyte injury in vivo

Next we assessed the effect of exogenous TB4 on podocytes. As ADR has been shown to cause podocyte loss43 we quantified the number of WT1+ glomerular podocytes44 (Fig. 4a). When analysing the results obtained per mouse we did not find a statistically significant difference in podocyte number and density in the LacZ/ADR group compared with the LacZ/saline and Tmsb4x/ADR groups (Fig. 4bc). Since one of the features of FSGS is that not all glomeruli are affected to the same extent45 we also examined podocyte number at the level of individual glomeruli by assessing a total of at least 250 glomeruli from 5 different mice in each group. This approach revealed a significant decrease in podocyte number (8.85 ± 0.31 podocytes) and density (5.31 × 10–3 ± 0.18 × 10–3 podocytes/μm2) in the LacZ/ADR group compared with LacZ/saline (10.94 ± 0.25 podocytes and 6.59 × 10–3 ± 0.13 × 10–3 podocytes/μm2 respectively) (P < 0.0001 in both cases). TB4 treatment prevented the ADR-induced podocyte loss and preserved podocyte number (10.38 ± 0.34 podocytes; P = 0.001) and podocyte density (6.57 × 10–3 ± 0.20 podocytes/μm2) (P < 0.0001 versus LacZ/ADR group) (Fig. 4de).

Alterations to podocyte F-actin have been associated with foot process effacement and albuminuria in vivo1011 . We hypothesised that the protective effect of TB4 in ADR injury may be partly mediated by its ability to sequester G-actin and regulate F-actin polymerisation131446 . Using synaptopodin as a podocyte marker47 and phalloidin to visualise F-actin filaments we quantified F-actin in the synaptopodin-positive regions (Fig. 4f). We found that there was no difference in the mean podocyte F-actin fluorescence between any of the groups (Fig. 4g). There were also no changes to the total area (μm2) or percentage of podocyte area covered by F-actin which remained at approximately 65% (Fig. 4hi) indicating that neither ADR nor TB4 alter the amount of F-actin within podocytes.

TB4 prevents ADR-induced podocyte F-actin reorganisation in vitro

Since podocyte shape and function are tightly linked to the actin cytoskeleton7 we next performed a detailed assessment of podocyte F-actin architecture in vitro. Cultured differentiated mouse podocytes an established model to study the regulation of the podocyte cytoskeleton4849 were treated with a low (0.0125 μg/ml) or high (0.125 μg/ml) dose of ADR and the potential of synthetic TB4 (100 ng/ml) to abrogate the effects of ADR was assessed (Fig. 5a). ADR treatment reduced Tmsb4x expression in cultured podocytes which was significant at the high dose (60% decrease; P = 0.0016; Fig. 5b) mirroring our findings in vivo. The expression of Tmsb10 was also reduced (P = 0.0491) following treatment with the high dose of ADR (Fig. 5c). Treatment with 0.125 μg/ml of ADR significantly reduced podocyte viability (P = 0.0366) and podocyte cell area (P = 0.0177) compared with podocytes treated with media alone which was not prevented by co-administration of exogenous TB4 (Fig. 5de). Next we quantified podocyte F-actin. Treatment with ADR did not alter podocyte mean F-actin fluorescence which remained unaffected by TB4 (Fig. 5f) in agreement with our in vivo finding that neither ADR nor TB4 alter the amount of F-actin within podocytes.

Finally to study podocyte F-actin organisation in more detail we classified F-actin arrangements into cortical actin stress fibres cytoplasmic stress fibres or unorganised fibres (Fig. 5g). Prior to ADR administration the majority of podocytes (61.2 ± 2.2%) had a prevalence of cortical actin stress fibres compared with 26.4 ± 2.5% podocytes with cytoplasmic stress fibres and 12.4 ± 2.0% podocytes with unorganised actin fibres. Treatment with 0.0125 μg/ml of ADR changed this distribution with significantly reduced cortical stress fibre prevalence (33.2 ± 2.3% P < 0.0001) and increased unorganised actin fibre prevalence (31.2 ± 3.2% P = 0.0068) compared with untreated podocytes. Treatment with exogenous TB4 prevented the ADR-induced F-actin reorganisation and significantly increased the proportion of podocytes with cortical actin stress fibres (62.8 ± 1.4% P < 0.0001) compared with the group treated with low dose ADR. Treatment with 0.125 μg/ml of ADR led to exacerbated cytoskeletal disorganisation reducing cortical stress fibre prevalence to 25.2 ± 2.1% (P < 0.0001) and increasing unorganised actin fibre prevalence to 50.4 ± 4.2% (P < 0.0001) compared with the untreated group. Co-treatment with exogenous TB4 ameliorated the effects of ADR with cortical stress fibre frequency at 57.2 ± 2.6% (P < 0.0001) and unorganised actin fibre frequency at 24 ± 4.2% (P = 0.0001) (Fig. 5h–j).",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiMmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5hdHVyZS5jb20vYXJ0aWNsZXMvczQxNTk4LTAyMi0xNjUxOC0z0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,PAI-1 is a potential transcriptional silencer that supports bladder cancer cell activity | Scientific Reports,"Patients and clinicopathologic information

The study was performed after approval by the Western Institutional Review Board (IRB # 20141019) under a request of waiver of informed consent on archived pathologic specimens. All methods were carried out in accordance with relevant guidelines and regulations. Tissue microarrays (TMAs) associated with two large patient cohorts were used in the current study. Cohort 1 was comprised of 587 bladder tumors from Aarhus University Hospital (Aarhus Denmark IRB # 1706291 National Committee on Health Research Ethics)35 and cohort 2 was comprised of 352 bladder tumors from Uppsala University Hospital (Uppsala Sweden IRB # 2015/143 Regional Ethical Review Board of Uppsala)36. Thus bladder tumors from 939 patients were available for analysis. Demographic clinical disease and treatment characteristics are presented in Table 1. The median follow-up for the entire cohort was 5.37 years.

Immunohistochemical staining of tissue microarrays

Immunostaining was performed using standard protocols. TMAs were deparaffinized in xylene and rehydrated using graded percentages of ethanol followed by antigen retrieval with citric acid buffer (pH 6.0 95 °C for 20 min). The slides were treated with 3% hydrogen peroxide in water to block endogenous peroxidase activity. Staining for PAI-1 was conducted using rabbit anti-PAI-1 antibody (HPA050039; 1:100 dilution in blocking buffer Sigma-Aldrich). Antibodies specificity information can be found in manufactures’ datasheet or our previous publication37. Biotin-labeled horse anti-mouse IgG (2 µg/ml in blocking buffer Vector Laboratories) was used as the secondary antibody. Immunoreactive signals were amplified by formation of avidin-biotin peroxidase complexes and visualized using 3 3ʹ- diaminobenzidine (DAB). Nuclear counterstaining was conducted with hematoxylin.

The expression level of PAI-1 was scored by assigning a proportion score and an intensity score18383940. The estimated proportion (0 = 0% of cells; 1 = 1% to 40%; 2 = 41% to 75% and 3 = 76% to 100%) and the average intensity (0 = none; 1 = weak; 2 = intermediate and 3 = strong) of immunoreactive tumor cells were assessed. The proportion and intensity scores were combined to obtain a total staining score for each protein which ranged from 0 to 6. Thus the protein expression levels were determined based on the total PAI-1 staining score as follows: none = 0 low = 1 or 2 moderate = 3 or 4 high = 5 or 6. Two investigators (OTMC YS) who were blinded to the clinicopathologic data and clinical outcomes scored each core. When there was a discrepancy in the scoring a third investigator reviewed consensus scoring was obtained.

Human lung was used as a positive control and omitting the primary antibody served as the negative control.

TCGA

Bladder urothelial carcinoma Illumina Hi-Seq counts from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) were downloaded from the Genomic Data Commons (GDC) data portal and corresponding clinical annotation including survival information was accessed via the TCGA Clinical Data Resource. The data was comprised of 430 samples from TCGA with gene transcriptome data of which 404 patients had valid survival data (19 normal and 411 cancer)41. These data are an open resource and no ethical issues were involved.

Survival analysis

Kaplan–Meier curves were used to distinguish the connection between the individual biomarkers (low vs. high expression) within the signature(s) and prognosis. High expression was defined as ≥ median while low expression was < median. Then Kaplan–Meier curves were used to distinguish the connection between the entire signature (i.e. composite of biomarkers low vs. high expression) within the signature(s) and prognosis.

Cell lines

Human bladder cancer cell lines; RT112 and UM-UC-3 cell lines were provided by the Pathology Core of the Bladder Cancer SPORE at MD Anderson Cancer Center. Cells were authenticated by DNA fingerprinting using the AmpFISTR Amplification or AmpFISTR Profiler PCR Amplification protocols (Life Technologies). Cell lines were maintained in RPMI 1640 or DMEM media as previously described42.

Immunofluorescence (IF) microscopy

RT112 and UM-UC-3 cells were seeded on chamber slides (#154461; Nalgene Nunc International Rochester NY) at 50% confluency. The following day cells were washed with PBS and fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde at room temperature for 15 min. Cells were permeabilized and blocked with 1% BSA and 0.5% Triton X-100 in PBS at room temperature for 30 min. Chamber slides were incubated with anti-PAI-1 antibody (H-135; Santa Cruz Biotechnology Santa Cruz CA 1:50 dilution) diluted in 1% BSA and 0.5% Triton X-100 in PBS at room temperature for 1 h. Cells were washed with PBS and subsequently treated with anti-rabbit DyLight 633 antibody (Catalog #: 35562; Thermo Fisher Scientific Waltham MA 1:280 dilution) at room temperature for 1 h in the dark. Chamber slides were washed and mounted with mounting media containing DAPI (#17984-24; Electron Microscopy Sciences Hatfield PA). IF images were captured using a Leica TCS SP5 confocal fluorescence microscope at 400X magnification (Leica Microsystems Bannockburn IL).

Cellular fractionation

Cell fractionation was performed as previously described43. Briefly plated cells were trypsinized and collected by centrifugation at 400 × g for 5 min then washed with ice-cold DPBS. The cells were solubilized in ice-cold 0.1% Nonidet P (NP) 40-PBS containing protease/phosphatase inhibitor. Cytosolic and nuclear fractions were separated by centrifugation at 10000 × g for 3 min at 4 °C. The nuclear pellet was washed once in 0.1% NP40-PBS and centrifuged at 10000 × g for 3 min at 4 °C. The nuclear pellet was resuspended either in RIPA buffer for western blotting assays or in ChIP buffer within MAGnify™ Chromatin Immunoprecipitation System (Cat No. 492024 Thermo Fisher Scientific Waltham MA) for use in immunoprecipitation and ChIP studies. Thirty micrograms of protein from all fractions was analyzed by immunoblot analysis.

Immunoblotting

Cell lysis and immunoblotting were performed using standard protocols as previously described171838. Antibody details are available in Supplementary Material.

ChIP assay was performed using MAGnify™ Chromatin Immunoprecipitation System (Cat No. 492024 Thermo Fisher Scientific) with anti-PAI-1 antibody (M01 clone 3F2; Abnova Taipei City Taiwan) according to manufacturer’s instruction. Each sample was analyzed in triplicate by real-time PCR using specific primers as described in Supplementary Material. Enrichment was determined by using the 2−ΔCT method relative to input DNA. Primer specificity was confirmed by evaluating dissociation curves and independently analyzing amplified product on an agarose gel.

ChIP library preparation and RNA sequencing

Library construction was performed using the Illumina TruSeq Nano DNA library preparation kit (Illumina San Diego CA USA). Sample libraries were multiplexed and sequenced on a HiSeq2500 platform (Illumina) using 100 bp paired-reads. An average of 25 million reads were generated from each sample.

Computational analysis of ChIP-Seq data

ChIP-Seq data were mapped to the reference human genome (hg19) using Bowtie44 (version 1.1.1) with the default parameters. PCR duplicates were removed from all downstream analyses with Picard (http://broadinstitute.github.io/picard/). Enriched regions were identified using MACS245 (version 2.1.0.20140616).

siRNA transfection

RT112 and UM-UC-3 cells were transfected with a pool of 3 synthesized commercial PAI-1 (sc-36179 Santa Cruz Biotechnology) (RT112KD-PAI1 and UM-UC-3KD-PAI1) or pool of 3 scrambled negative control siRNA (Scr sc-37007 Santa Cruz Biotechnology) (RT112Scr and UM-UC-3Scr) in 6 well plates with a 100-pmol of siRNA and 9 μl of INTERFERin (Polyplus-transfection Inc. NY USA) for 72 h according to manufacturer’s instruction.

RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) for gene expression analysis

Library preparation and sequencing

Total RNA samples were assessed for concentration using a Qubit fluorometer (ThermoFisher Scientific Waltham MA) and for quality using the 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies Santa Clara CA). Library construction was performed using the QIASeq Stranded mRNA Select kit (Qiagen Hilden Germany). Library concentration was measured with a Qubit fluorometer and library size on a 4200 TapeStation (Agilent Technologies). Libraries were multiplexed and sequenced on a NovaSeq 6000 (Illumina San Diego CA) using 75bp single-end sequencing. An average of 30 million reads were generated from each sample.

RNA-seq data analysis and overlapping with ChIP-seq data

We used cutadapt46 to remove low quality reads and trim adapter sequences from FASTQ files. Human reference genome hg38 aligned to the trimmed reads using STAR aligner47. The output BAM files aimed to measure gene counts using featureCounts48. Then we used Bioconductor packages DESeq249 and EnhancedVolcano50 in R programming environment51 for statistical analysis and visualization accordingly.

DESeq2 was subsequently used to compare expression of knock-down vs. control samples for both UM-UC-3 and RT112. An information-theoretic gene-set enrichment analysis (TEISER)52 was used to examine the distribution of PAI-1 targets among the differentially expressed genes.

Rapid immunoprecipitation mass spectrometry of endogenous proteins (RIME) assay

ChIP

Chromatin was isolated by the addition of lysis buffer followed by disruption with a Dounce homogenizer. Lysates were sonicated and the DNA sheared to an average length of 300-500 bp. Genomic DNA (Input) was prepared by treating aliquots of chromatin with RNase proteinase K and heat for de-crosslinking followed by ethanol precipitation. Pellets were resuspended and the resulting DNA was quantified on a NanoDrop spectrophotometer. Extrapolation to the original chromatin volume allowed quantitation of the total chromatin yield.

An aliquot of chromatin (125 μg) was precleared with protein G agarose beads (Invitrogen). Proteins of interest were immunoprecipitated using 13 μg of antibody against SERPINE1 (Abnova Cat. # H00005054-M01) and protein G magnetic beads. Protein complexes were washed then trypsin was used to remove the immunoprecipitate from beads and digested the protein sample. Protein digests were separated from the beads and purified using a C18 spin column (Harvard Apparatus). The peptides were vacuum dried using a speedvac.

Mass spectrometry

Digested peptides were analyzed by LC-MS/MS on a Thermo Scientific Q Exactive Orbitrap Mass spectrometer linked to Dionex Ultimate 3000 HPLC (Thermo Scientific) and a nanospray FlexTM ion source. The digested peptides were loaded directly onto the separation column Waters BEH C18 75 micron × 100 mm 130Å 1.7u particle size. Peptides were eluted using a 100 min gradient with a flow rate of 323 nl/min. An MS survey scan was obtained for the m/z range 340–1600 MS/MS spectra were acquired using a top 15 method where the top 15 ions in the MS spectra were subjected to HCD (High Energy Collisional Dissociation). An isolation mass window of 1.6 m/z was for the precursor ion selection and normalized collision energy of 27% was used for fragmentation. A 20 second duration was used for the dynamic exclusion.

Database searching

Tandem mass spectra were extracted and analyzed by PEAKS Studio version 8 built 20. Charge state deconvolution and deisotoping were not performed. Database consisted of the Uniprot database (version 180508 71771 curated entries) and the cRAP database of common laboratory contaminants (www.thegpm.org/crap; 114 entries). Database was searched with a fragment ion mass tolerance of 0.02 Da and a parent ion tolerance of 10 PPM. Post-translational variable modifications consisted of methionine oxidation asparagine and glutamine deamidation.

Criteria for protein identification

Peaks studio built-in decoy sequencing and FDR determination was used to validate MS/MS based peptide and the parsimony rules for protein identifications. A threshold of the − 10 * logp (p value) of 20 or greater was applied for the peptide identifications. The weighted sum of 9 parameters for peptide scoring are converted to a p-value which represent the probability of a false identification. Protein identifications were accepted if they could pass the − 10logp of 20 and contained at least 1 identified unique peptide. Proteins that contained similar peptides and could not be differentiated based on MS/MS analysis alone were grouped to satisfy the principles of parsimony. Proteins sharing significant peptide evidence were grouped into protein groups.

List filtering

Protein coverage percentage is observed in the raw data file. Final list generation was done by taking all proteins with a spectral count of five and above from each replicate reaction and comparing them in a venn-diagram against IgG control replicates. Proteins unique to both experimental replicates were then applied to the PANTHER database for protein ontology results.

Statistical analysis

All in vitro data are expressed as mean ± standard deviation (SD). Differences between two or more groups were analyzed by a 2-tailed unpaired Student’s t test or ANOVA followed by Tukey’s post-hoc test. Statistical analyses were performed with GraphPad Prism 7.0 (GraphPad Software Inc.) and SAS 9.4 (SAS Institute Inc. Cary NC). A p value less than 0.05 was considered significant.",,,

So on Friday and Saturday July 15-16 county officials company executives committed customers and longtime employees gathered at MTS’s newest location on Billingsley Drive to celebrate the grand opening of the business’s fourth location with an official ribbon-cutting sponsored by the Buckhannon-Upshur Chamber of Commerce.

Buckhannon’s new MTS location which offers compact tractors tractors for farmers landscapers gators side-by-sides compact construction equipment used equipment and a parts and service department as well as tools and equipment for lawn and garden tractors celebrated two years in that location as well as the Middletown Tractor Sales’s 70th anniversary.

As their slogan goes enough people had made Middletown Tractor “their main factor” by visiting the certified John Deere dealer to bolster the local family business through the trying times brought on by the COVID pandemic.

At Friday’s ribbon cutting and grand opening ceremony MTS president Adam Boyers said he was grateful to be standing at the podium welcoming everyone to MTS’s grand opening.

“As the saying goes it has not been easy sailing the past couple of years but we’ve managed to navigate the treacherous waters and we’re super excited to be here today” Adam Boyers said. He told the story of how his grandparents Dallas and Elaine Boyers had started a small ‘feed-and-seed’ farm supply store in Mannington W.Va. in 1952 and they had “on the side done some John Deere sales.”

“Over the years as the seed and feed fell to the wayside the lawn tractors and the farm tractors became more and more of the business” he said. “My father got involved and spent most of his life in it; I spent most of my life in it and we’ve grown to four locations in two states and are just super proud of the brand that is Middletown Tractor Sales.”

Adam Boyers recounted how Upshur County Commission president Kristie Tenney had reached out to him when MTS was searching for land for a fourth location in 2019 and the plot he saw at 136 Billingsley Dr. in Buckhannon and Upshur County seemed like an ideal place to grow the business.

“It was a great location the building was the right size it’s got enough land for us to do what we needed to do” Boyers said. “Tom Shaw the former owner was a great guy to work with and so we were able to make a deal.”

“We began making renovations inside they were going well they were on time we wanted to get open before our busy season and on a Wednesday in February – February 12 2020 – we opened the doors to the business” Boyers recounted. “Everything was going great and then about 30 days later the world kind of shut down and COVID and the pandemic put everyone into havoc.”

“The havoc has maintained over the past couple of years but we are super excited to be able to be here today” Adam Boyers added. “It’s not ideal to have a grand opening a couple of years after you open your doors but that’s the hand we were dealt and because of the community support that we’ve had here in Buckhannon we were able to still be here in business today to celebrate this day. I’m excited to be here to open this facility today to open this facility in the great City of Buckhannon in the great county of Upshur in the great State of West Virginia so I really appreciate everyone coming out today and recognizing us.”

Adam Boyers thanked his employees and Buckhannon store manager John Gladwell for showing up every day and “putting their best foot forward” regardless of the particular pandemic restrictions they were facing.

Jim Boyers Adam’s father said he was proud to have grown the business into one that serves four locations in two states – Buckhannon and Fairmont in West Virginia and Uniontown and Washington in Pennsylvania.

“It’s hard to maintain a business that many years now through plague … pandemics through financial problems through employees through inventory” Jim Boyers remarked at the July 15 ribbon cutting. “It’s really hard to maintain but we’ve done it and we continue to grow and we hope to maintain that. I’m very very proud of what’s going on as a family as a West Virginian and I hope Upshur County and the local counties realize it and help support it.”

Jim Boyers reiterated Adam’s thanks to MTS many dedicated employees whom he called “huge assets.”

Upshur County Commission president Kristie Tenney and commission Sam Nolte were on hand to thank the business for its investment in Upshur County.

“I was really hoping COVID wouldn’t derail your plans” Nolte said. “I hear it all over the community that everybody is super happy to have you here. We appreciate you and we thank you for making this investment.”

Regional representative for Governor Jim Justice Lynn Phillips offered a few words on the governor’s behalf saying that MTS meets the needs of every outdoor equipment necessity “whether you are homeowner farmer or landscaper they have the equipment that will tackle any workload.”

Additionally representatives from the offices of U.S. Senator Joe Manchin D-WV and Rep. Alex Mooney R-2 intimated that the Mountain State was lucky to have family-owned businesses like Middletown Tractor Sales doing business in and throughout north and south central W.Va.

“I thank all three generations of Boyers who have steered this family-owned business with great success their employees and everyone else responsible for making today’s ribbon cutting a reality” Manchin’s representative Michael Garcia said reading a letter on the senator’s behalf. “Truly West Virginia is fortunate to have local businesses like Middletown who have exceptional workforces of this caliber …. I worked in a small business all my life and I can attest that there is no more challenging or rewarding endeavor.”

Rhett Dusenbury district representative for Mooney also offered the congressman’s well wishes to MTS and presented the Boyers family with a Certificate of Special Congressional Recognition.

“The history of your company is a wonderful story of a family-owned business and how through hard work you can achieve the American dream” Dusenbury read on behalf of Mooney’s office. “[Middletown Tractors Sales] has provided the citizens of Upshur County with an option for farm and lawn equipment at competitive prices” as well as “much needed local jobs. This notable achievement demonstrates your dedication to excellence and your commitment to quality.”

MTS hosted a combined 70th anniversary-two-year anniversary celebration complete with a chicken barbecue and live radio broadcasts Saturday following MTS’s grand opening in Buckhannon.

Investigators are still piecing together what happened.

Police said when they arrived at the crash site Mwesigwa's SUV and a tractor-trailer that was also involved in the wreck were on the side of the road near the Tractor Supply. Officers haven't said what caused the crash or who is at fault. Authorities also didn't release the name of the truck driver. They said he received minor injuries from the wreck and paramedics took him to a hospital for treatment.

Officials ask anyone who saw the crash or has any information about it to contact Leesburg Police Officer M. Hackney at 571-919-8375.

Mwesigwa was a 6-feet-5-inch tall power forward/center for the Captains who stood out on the basketball court because of his defense and powerful dunking ability according to videos posted on his HUDL page. The Loudoun Times reported he earned a spot on the 2020-2021 Dulles District boys' basketball team as a junior. The Virginia High School Coaches Association also named him to the 2nd Team All-State that same year.

Mwesigwa graduated from Loudoun County High School last month.

His mother Lucy Mirembe Mwesigwa announced the teenager's death on Facebook this morning. Hundreds of people posted messages of support and memories of the young man they called a funny kind and caring friend and family member.

Prices in Spain have more than tripled ...,"European vacationers looking to avoid this summer’s airport chaos by renting a car can expect to pay record rates.

Prices that hit all-time highs in 2021 have been scaling new heights this year with Europe’s coastal regions especially affected by inflated rates.

Travelers in Spain who could rent a car for a little more than 20 euros ($20) per day before the pandemic will have to pay at least three times as much this summer. Italy and Croatia saw prices jump by more than 180% according to data compiled by Check24.

Matters could get even worse and last-minute travelers should act fast advised Andreas Schiffelholz the comparison sites’ rental-car managing director. “As pick-up dates get closer prices will continue to increase.”

Spiraling prices are the product of a post-pandemic wanderlust that’s been impervious to soaring inflation a looming energy crisis and recession fears. Overnight stays in the eurozone recovered to pre-COVID levels in May according to Oxford Economics’ Tourism Tracker. With European school holidays just beginning the number of vacationers is poised to keep climbing.

The travel resurgence has already wreaked havoc at European airports. At some of the continent’s busiest hubs more than 60% of flights are seeing delays and as many as 8% are being canceled according to data collected by travel agency Hopper Inc.

In response London Heathrow put a two-month cap on daily passenger traffic and told airlines to stop selling new summer tickets. After slashing staffing at the beginning of the pandemic airports and airlines have struggled to keep up with security and baggage handling leading to long lines and mounting piles of misplaced luggage.

Rental-car firms also shrank during the pandemic and many haven’t gotten back to pre-Covid strength even as demand rebounded. For a second straight year a supply-chain crisis fueled by global semiconductor shortages curbed auto production and left carmakers with fewer vehicles to sell to rental companies.

“Many car-rental firms have reduced their fleet during the pandemic and can’t just return to regular fleet sizes now that demand is on the rise” Schiffelholz said.

Among Europe’s largest rental firms only Avis Budget Group Inc. and Sixt SE were able to get back to their 2019 fleet levels company reports show. Europcar Mobility Group and Hertz Global Holdings Inc. which filed for bankruptcy amid the collapse of the travel industry in 2020 have yet to return to their former size.

Some rental-car firms have turned the bounce-back in demand into a profit windfall. According to Sixt’s Co-CEO Alexander Sixt prices aren’t going to fall anytime soon.

“We estimate pricing to be at this level at least for the most part of 2023” he said. Costs for tourist accommodations air travel and new vehicles have all risen in recent years while car-rental prices have been stagnant for a decade Sixt said. “These recent adjustments will stay.”

Nor does he expect an imminent decline in interest from holiday-makers. Despite additional costs from rising fuel prices “demand predictions for this summer see no significant drop” he said.

Rather than enjoying playing golf with his friends at famous Open courses around the United Kingdom the 47-year-old ended up traipsing across the country trying to locate his bags after they got lost on the journey over from the U.S.

Prenatt from Tampa Bay Fla. had attached Apple Inc. devices called AirTags to his golf bag and other luggage to track where they were after checking in for his flight. Upon landing in the U.K. he saw his bags were still stuck on the tarmac at Newark airport where they remained for two days. His luggage was eventually sent to a warehouse in Edinburgh but while driving there to pick it up he noticed that his clubs were already headed to Aberdeen. His AirTag showed they finally ended up in the West Midlands in England.

“It’s a mess” he said.

Prenatt’s experience encapsulates the chaos travelers are facing as airports in Europe the U.S. and elsewhere are overwhelmed by a surge in passenger traffic — and luggage — because they don’t have enough staff to cope following the mass job cuts that engulfed the aviation industry during the pandemic.

Travelers are turning to AirTags and similar devices from other companies to keep tabs on their belongings. Apple introduced AirTags in April 2021 with a starting price of $29 while Samsung Electronics Co.’s SmarTag costs $29.99.

The devices which use short-range Bluetooth are permissible on planes with many passengers already flying with gadgets that use similar technology like gaming consoles and headphones.

A British Airways Plc passenger wrote on Twitter this week that her tracker showed her luggage arrived in London Heathrow a day after her flight and has been there for more than 10 days. Last month a Singapore Airlines Ltd. passenger used his AirTag to locate and collect his bags after they’d been stuck in Melbourne Airport for a week the Daily Mail reported.

Representatives for British Airways couldn’t immediately comment.

Heathrow one of the world’s busiest airports on Tuesday imposed a two-month cap on daily passenger traffic through Sept. 11 because of staff shortages asking airlines to refrain from selling summer tickets. This week Delta Air Lines Inc. flew a wide-body aircraft without passengers to bring 1000 lost bags from the London hub back to the U.S. A Delta spokesperson said the carrier’s teams had “worked a creative solution” to move delayed checked bags on July 11 after a regular scheduled flight had to be canceled.

Two months since his trip and after repeated queries to British Airways and courier companies Prenatt still hasn’t got his golf bag back. He says it contained more than $10000-worth of equipment including a $4000 putter that his son gave him as a retirement gift.

He rented some clubs in the end.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZvcmJlcy5jb20vc2l0ZXMvY2hyaXN0b3BoZXJlbGxpb3R0LzIwMjIvMDcvMTYvcHJvLXRpcHMtZm9yLWZpbmRpbmctYWxsLXlvdXItbG9zdC1haXJsaW5lLWx1Z2dhZ2Uv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Pro Tips For Finding All Your Lost Airline Luggage,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Max restarts limit reached for url: https://www.forbes.com/sites/christopherelliott/2022/07/16/pro-tips-for-finding-all-your-lost-airline-luggage/ on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZvcmJlcy5jb20vc2l0ZXMvY2hyaXN0b3BoZXJlbGxpb3R0LzIwMjIvMDcvMTYvcHJvLXRpcHMtZm9yLWZpbmRpbmctYWxsLXlvdXItbG9zdC1haXJsaW5lLWx1Z2dhZ2Uv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm55dGltZXMuY29tLzIwMjIvMDcvMTYvdHJhdmVsL3Bhc3Nwb3J0LXJlbmV3YWwtc3VtbWVyLXRyYXZlbC5odG1s0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Getting a Passport Will Be Another Pain for Summer Travels,"It’s a summer of headaches for travelers: Airfares are surging checked bags are disappearing and flights are being canceled in record numbers. And now there’s another pain point to add to the mix. If you’re in need of a new or updated passport your options are limited — and it’s likely going to cost you.

Like the price of gas and groceries passport fees have gone up across the board: As of January a first-time adult passport now costs a total of $165 including the $35 acceptance fee; a renewed adult passport costs $130 and a passport for a minor costs a total of $135. Each is an increase of $20 over 2021 prices.

Monthslong delays and a severe shortage of in-person appointments have plagued passport applicants since early 2020. Now more than two years in wait times are still longer than before the pandemic and for those who need a passport in five weeks or less solutions are more limited than ever.

The elusive last-minute option

The online booking option for appointments at U.S. Passport Agencies — the only way to obtain a same-day passport for emergency travel — was eliminated last summer following reports of scammers using bots to stockpile and resell appointments. Those with urgent travel needs are now consigned to spending long wait times on the phone attempting to secure a spot. You can only book an appointment if you have proof of imminent travel within 14 days and the appointment itself must occur within three business days of your departure.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiP2h0dHBzOi8vcm9sbGluZ291dC5jb20vMjAyMi8wNy8xNi9ibGFjay1zZW5kcy1ncm91cHMtdG8tYWZyaWNhL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Black & Abroad revolutionizes travel experience sends groups to Africa,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://rollingout.com/2022/07/16/black-sends-groups-to-africa/ on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiP2h0dHBzOi8vcm9sbGluZ291dC5jb20vMjAyMi8wNy8xNi9ibGFjay1zZW5kcy1ncm91cHMtdG8tYWZyaWNhL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen

Washington Nationals star Juan Soto reportedly rejected a massive contract extension offer from the team and it appears he’s intent on testing the free agent waters after the 2024 season.

Soto has two more years of arbitration left before he can become a free agent. The Nationals’ efforts to keep the superstar slugging outfielder on the team as one of their cornerstones doesn’t seem to be going very well.

The 23-year-old rejected a 15-year $440 million offer that didn’t include any deferred money The Athletic reported Saturday.

The report noted that Soto is on track to become a free agent just ahead of his age-26 season and could command as much as $500 million on the open market.

But the efforts to make Soto the cornerstone of their rebuild is falling flat.

A trade doesn’t appear to be off the table despite Scott Boras' and general manager Mike Rizzo’s assertions to the contrary.

Unnamed MLB team executives told ESPN in May the Nationals could be ""compelled"" and ""motivated"" to deal Soto over the summer.

Boras told the New York Post bluntly ""Forget Soto trade … not happening."" Rizzo added in a radio interview the team had ""every intention of building around Soto"" and wasn’t thinking of trading him.

Soto and his agents at Boras Corporation decided to decline a 13-year $350 million extension in the offseason according to ESPN. He signed a one-year deal in the offseason in arbitration.

The Athletic on Saturday wrote ""Juan Soto is available"" and that the Nationals would ""entertain offers"" for the young stud.

The Kroll Bond Rating Agency which has assigned ‘AAA’ ratings to the most senior notes the class A says the transaction is Gracie Point’s ninth one secured by insurance premium financing. Premium finance lenders make the loans to a subsidiary of Gracie Point according to the rating agency.

Truist Bank is the structuring lead on the deal similar to a string of recent transactions under the program according to Finsight.

DBRS | Morningstar has assigned ratings of ‘AA’ to the $182.7 million class A and $44.7 class B notes; ‘A’ to the $13.2 million class C notes; ‘BBB’ to the $9.1 million class D notes and ‘BB’ to the class E notes according to Finsight.

Gracie Point International’s underlying portfolio consists of 173 premium finance loans to 24 out of 45 eligible life insurance companies with an aggregate adjusted principal balance of approximately $255.9 million. That amount equals the sum of the outstanding loan amount of such premium finance loans and the number of months for the surrender period of forward interest of deposit for the premium finance loans.

The trust will issue floating-rate notes benchmarked on the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR) through five classes A B C D and E beginning July 15. Coupon spreads are said to range from 275 basis points on the class A notes to 700 basis points over the class E notes according to Finsight.

As of the closing date Gracie Point intends to retain the class F notes KBRA said. Credit enhancement on the deal will consist of subordination levels reaching 28.6% on the class A notes; 11.1% on the class B notes; 5.9% on the class C notes; 2.4% on the class D notes and 0.5% on the class E notes.

Other forms of credit enhancement will include excess cash flow and a reserve account. The latter will be funded with about $15 million on the closing date. That amount is equal to about 5.8% of the aggregate adjusted principal balance and more than six months of forward interest on the offered notes.

But the deal also has credit vulnerabilities. Of the 173 premium finance loans in the pool nine of them were extended to individuals or revocable trusts KBRA said. The loans particularly ones to individuals introduce the risk of the individual policy holders’ bankruptcy status in which the policy could be part of an individual’s bankruptcy estate and be subject to a bankruptcy stay.

Citi Bank is the verification agent on the deal a departure from the three previous transactions according to KBRA.

Soto has two more years of arbitration left before he can become a free agent. The Nationals’ efforts to keep the superstar slugging outfielder on the team as one of their cornerstones doesn’t seem to be going very well.

The 23-year-old rejected a 15-year $440 million offer that didn’t include any deferred money The Athletic reported Saturday.

The report noted that Soto is on track to become a free agent just ahead of his age-26 season and could command as much as $500 million on the open market.

But the efforts to make Soto the cornerstone of their rebuild is falling flat.

A trade doesn’t appear to be off the table despite Scott Boras' and general manager Mike Rizzo’s assertions to the contrary.

Unnamed MLB team executives told ESPN in May the Nationals could be ""compelled"" and ""motivated"" to deal Soto over the summer.

Boras told the New York Post bluntly ""Forget Soto trade … not happening."" Rizzo added in a radio interview the team had ""every intention of building around Soto"" and wasn’t thinking of trading him.

Soto and his agents at Boras Corporation decided to decline a 13-year $350 million extension in the offseason according to ESPN. He signed a one-year deal in the offseason in arbitration.

The Athletic on Saturday wrote ""Juan Soto is available"" and that the Nationals would ""entertain offers"" for the young stud.

A trade for a player like Soto would cost a team a fortune in prospects.

Entering Saturday Soto is hitting .247 with a .895 OPS and 19 home runs. He was selected for his second All-Star Game.

Major League Baseball is moving toward acceptance of a robotically-called strike zone in the years to come. Despite this the proposal is not universally popular among players.

Count New York Yankees outfielder Aaron Judge among those skeptical of the prospect. After Friday’s game against the Boston Red Sox Judge questioned why the league could not simply improve its existing group of umpires instead.

The topic of robot umpires was a relevant one after the Yankees’ loss to Boston. Manager Aaron Boone was ejected for arguing balls and strikes and was furious over low strikes consistently being called against Judge. Boone and Judge had a beef as replays showed Judge was called out on a third strike that was essentially at his shins in the bottom of the eighth inning.

Aaron Judge has had more out-of-zone pitches called strikes against him while he's been in the league than any other MLB player. pic.twitter.com/KY7Y6g2sPo — Codify (@CodifyBaseball) July 16 2022

Judge’s response is sporting but calls like that are the reason robot umpires are coming sooner rather than later. He’ll just have to get used to that inevitability and maybe it will ultimately help him."

Beer & Hymns the only sing-along event raising funds for area nonprofits announced today a new partnership with Soldier Songs & Voices Northwest Arkansas a nonprofit offering music and songwriting lessons and instruments to U.S. veterans.

The mission of Soldier Songs and Voices NWA is to foster a creative and supportive community of veterans through music instruction performance and outreach. One of 11 chapters nationwide the group meets weekly to play together and encourage one another to write songs that express their stories and takeaways from their military service said Lee Haight board president.

With the covid-19 pandemic still looming 15 to 25 veterans gather and play outdoors at the Veterans Affairs Medical Center in Fayetteville both for lessons and to entertain hospital patients he said.

""Veterans like to talk to other veterans. A combat zone is a unique experience and lots of things in the military can cause PTSD"" Haight said. ""There is an understanding there and it's the most powerful thing. We keep the focus on the music. The music brings us back to the right place.""

The money raised for Soldier Songs and Voices NWA will go toward instruments and additional equipment veteran musicians need to play with confidence Haight said adding that music and other ""nontraditional"" methods of PTSD treatment often have the greatest healing effect.

Beer & Hymns is a free community sing-a-long of hymns and cover songs everyone knows by heart. Each month they select a lyrical theme and a charity bringing people together to raise their glasses raise their voices and raise funds for organizations that change the world. Charitable proceeds come from direct donations by attendees at the events as well as a percentage of food and drink sales.

July's Beer & Hymns theme honors American Rock making the music a perfect complement to Soldier Songs and Voices NWA said Ken Weatherford executive director of Beer & Hymns.

The July event is tonight July 17 at Bike Rack Brewing Co. 8th Street Market Bentonville from 5 to 7 p.m.

Last month Beer & Hymns raised $4036.42 for Pride at NWACC enough for two scholarships for students who identify as part of the LGBTQIA+ community. The total represented a 46 percent increase in donations to the nonprofit compared to 2021. The June total also put Beer & Hymns at $20620 raised for local community nonprofits halfway through 2022.

Rockin' Baker

A $10000 grant from Tyson Foods will help Rockin' Baker a Northwest Arkansas-based nonprofit bakery continue its dual mission of serving the area's neuro-diverse community and fighting hunger. Rockin' Baker will use the funds to support its job-training program for neuro-diverse adults even as it seeks out additional opportunities to alleviate food insecurity.

According to Daymara Baker founder of Rockin' Baker every dollar will serve two causes: job training and placement for a traditionally underserved segment of the local workforce and more opportunities to distribute free handmade bread through local hunger-prevention programs.

""We couldn't be more grateful to Tyson Foods for supporting our mission.""

(NYSE: TSN) and Saudi-based Tanmiah Food Company (“Tanmiah” or the “Company” 2281 on the Saudi Exchange) have entered into a strategic partnership agreement. The parties to the agreement are Tyson Foods and Agricultural Development Company (ADC) and Supreme Foods Processing Company (SFPC) Tanmiah’s wholly owned subsidiaries.



Tyson Foods is one of the world’s leading food companies and a recognized leader in protein while Tanmiah which established its first company 60 years ago is one of the biggest providers of fresh value-added poultry and other meat products animal feed & health products and a fast-food brand franchise operator with plans to produce more than one million birds per day by the end of 2025. ADC operates in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia Bahrain and United Arab Emirates. Through ADC the Company produces and distributes fresh products for sale to food service providers and retailers. SFPC produces a variety of value-added pre-prepared chicken and beef products with a distribution network spread across the Middle East including Saudi Arabia Kuwait Bahrain UAE Oman and Jordan among others.



“We are delighted to be joining hands with a global leader in food production to support and accelerate our strategic growth plans” said Zulfiqar Hamadani CEO of Tanmiah. “This partnership marks a significant milestone in Tanmiah’s journey through demonstrating our commitment to our pioneering role in supporting Saudi Arabia’s food security and self-sufficiency goals. During this new phase we will continue to work together with Tyson Foods whose commitment to animal welfare food safety sustainability and quality are very much in line with our own business model and sustainability framework. This transaction will not only reinforce our positioning in the regional market but will also enable us to expand our global footprint through leveraging Tyson Foods’ long-standing relationships with customers worldwide.”



“This investment will enable us to access poultry supplies in Saudi Arabia to meet the growing demand for protein in the Middle East and other markets” said Chris Langholz president of International for Tyson Foods. “Expansion into international markets is a key part of our strategic growth plan and we’re pleased to better serve customers in this region.”



“The strategic partnership is expected to accelerate Tyson Foods’ and Tanmiah’s growth and generate significant value in the short and long term” said Tan Sun president of Tyson Foods APAC. “This will be primarily achieved through further expansion across the value chain and enhanced product customer and geographical diversification as well as improvement of production and other operational processes. The agreement will also see Tyson Foods and Tanmiah unlock long-term opportunities in the fast-growing Halal food market.”



As part of the agreement Tyson Foods and Tanmiah have committed to invest substantially to expand the processing capacities of SFPC. This investment is aligned with Tanmiah’s strategic expansion agenda and will result in doubling the company’s production capacity in value-added products. Both companies through a 50/50 joint venture will also explore opportunities in the fast-growing global Halal market and as per the agreement Tyson Foods will own a 15% equity stake in Agricultural Development Corporation (ADC) and a 60% equity stake in Supreme Foods Processing Company (SFPC). The transaction will be subject to approval by the General Authority for Competition in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and other government entities.



Through this partnership Tanmiah will continue to support the growth of Saudi Halal products by bringing world-class sector expertise to the Kingdom. Through its expansion Tanmiah will also create a number of job opportunities in the local Saudi market.



“In line with our ambitious growth plans and ongoing endeavors to deliver significant long-term value to shareholders and customers alike we proudly announce Tanmiah’s partnership with Tyson Foods” said Ahmed Bin Sharaf Osilan Executive Board Member & Managing Director of Tanmiah. “There is no doubt that this partnership will enable us to achieve further expansion and success across all stages of the supply chain from sourcing of materials to production and final distribution in addition to enhancing supply chain efficiencies and improving margins. Alongside the significant opportunities that will emerge for the company in the future we are also looking forward to further advancing our technical expertise by collaborating with Tyson Foods to provide innovative and diversified product offerings to a broader base of customers in the Kingdom and abroad.”



Global protein consumption across chicken and other meats is forecasted to rise to 95 billion pounds over the next 10 years with much of that demand happening outside the U.S. Meanwhile the global Halal food market is expected to achieve unprecedented growth over the long term with industry reports pointing to a Compound Annual Growth Rate of nearly 10% by 2032."

It’s a moment unlike anything the international community has experienced in decades as countries around the world try to bring rapid price increases under control before they become a more lasting part of the economy.

Inflation has surged across many advanced and developing economies since early 2021 as strong demand for goods collided with shortages brought on by the pandemic. Central banks spent months hoping that economies would reopen and shipping routes would unclog easing supply constraints and that consumer spending would return to normal. That hasn’t happened and the war in Ukraine has only intensified the situation by disrupting oil and food supplies pushing prices even higher.

Global economic policymakers began responding in earnest this year with at least 75 central banks lifting interest rates many from historically low levels. While policymakers cannot do much to contain high energy prices higher borrowing costs could help slow consumer and business demand to give supply a chance to catch up across an array of goods and services so that inflation does not continue indefinitely.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnZvYW5ld3MuY29tL2EvbG9uZy1saW5lcy1hcmUtYmFjay1hdC11cy1mb29kLWJhbmtzLWFzLWluZmxhdGlvbi1oaXRzLWhpZ2gvNjY2MDA3MS5odG1s0gFkaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cudm9hbmV3cy5jb20vYW1wL2xvbmctbGluZXMtYXJlLWJhY2stYXQtdXMtZm9vZC1iYW5rcy1hcy1pbmZsYXRpb24taGl0cy1oaWdoLzY2NjAwNzEuaHRtbA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Long Lines Are Back at US Food Banks as Inflation Hits High,"Long lines are back at food banks around the U.S. as working Americans overwhelmed by inflation turn to handouts to help feed their families.

With gas prices soaring along with grocery costs many people are seeking charitable food for the first time and more are arriving on foot.

Inflation in the U.S. is at a 40-year high and gas prices have been surging since April 2020 with the average cost nationwide briefly hitting $5 a gallon in June. Rapidly rising rents and an end to federal COVID-19 relief have also taken a financial toll.

The food banks which had started to see some relief as people returned to work after pandemic shutdowns are struggling to meet the latest need even as federal programs provide less food to distribute grocery store donations wane and cash gifts don't go nearly as far.

Tomasina John was among hundreds of families lined up in several lanes of cars that went around the block one recent day outside St. Mary's Food Bank in Phoenix. John said her family had never visited a food bank before because her husband had easily supported her and their four children with his construction work.

""But it's really impossible to get by now without some help” said John who traveled with a neighbor to share gas costs as they idled under a scorching desert sun. ""The prices are way too high.”

Jesus Pascual was also in the queue.

""It's a real struggle” said Pascual a janitor who estimated he spends several hundred dollars a month on groceries for him his wife and their five children aged 11 to 19.

The same scene is repeated across the nation where food bank workers predict a rough summer keeping ahead of demand.

The surge in food prices comes after state governments ended COVID-19 disaster declarations that temporarily allowed increased benefits under SNAP the federal food stamp program covering some 40 million Americans .

""It does not look like it's going to get better overnight” said Katie Fitzgerald president and chief operating officer for the national food bank network Feeding America. ""Demand is really making the supply challenges complex.”

Charitable food distribution has remained far above amounts given away before the coronavirus pandemic even though demand tapered off somewhat late last year.

Feeding America officials say second quarter data won't be ready until August but they are hearing anecdotally from food banks nationwide that demand is soaring.

The Phoenix food bank's main distribution center doled out food packages to 4271 families during the third week in June a 78% increase over the 2396 families served during the same week last year said St. Mary's spokesman Jerry Brown.

More than 900 families line up at the distribution center every weekday for an emergency government food box stuffed with goods such as canned beans peanut butter and rice said Brown. St. Mary's adds products purchased with cash donations as well as food provided by local supermarkets like bread carrots and pork chops for a combined package worth about $75.

Distribution by the Alameda County Community Food Bank in Northern California has ticked up since hitting a pandemic low at the beginning of this year increasing from 890 households served on the third Friday in January to 1410 households on the third Friday in June said marketing director Michael Altfest.

At the Houston Food Bank the largest food bank in the U.S. where food distribution levels earlier in the pandemic briefly peaked at a staggering 1 million pounds a day an average of 610000 pounds is now being given out daily.

That's up from about 500000 pounds a day before the pandemic said spokeswoman Paula Murphy said.

Murphy said cash donations have not eased but inflation ensures they don't go as far.

Food bank executives said the sudden surge in demand caught them off guard.

""Last year we had expected a decrease in demand for 2022 because the economy had been doing so well” said Michael Flood CEO for the Los Angeles Regional Food Bank. ""This issue with inflation came on pretty suddenly.”

""A lot of these are people who are working and did OK during the pandemic and maybe even saw their wages go up” said Flood. ""But they have also seen food prices go up beyond their budgets.”

The Los Angeles bank gave away about 30 million pounds of food during the first three months of this year slightly less than the previous quarter but still far more than the 22 million pounds given away during the first quarter of 2020.

Feeding America's Fitzgerald is calling on USDA and Congress to find a way to restore hundreds of millions of dollars worth of commodities recently lost with the end of several temporary programs to provide food to people in need. USDA commodities which generally can represent as much as 30% of the food the banks disperse accounted for more than 40% of all food distributed in fiscal year 2021 by the Feeding America network.

""There is a critical need for the public sector to purchase more food now"" said Fitzgerald.

During the Trump administration USDA bought several billions of dollars in pork apples dairy potatoes and other products in a program that gave most of it to food banks. The ""Food Purchase & Distribution Program” designed to help American farmers harmed by tariffs and other practices of U.S. trade partners has since ended. There was $1.2 billion authorized for the 2019 fiscal year and another $1.4 billion authorized for fiscal 2020.

Another temporary USDA ""Farmers to Families” program that provided emergency relief provided more than 155 million food boxes for families in need across the U.S. during the height of the pandemic before ending May 31 2021.

A USDA spokesperson noted the agency is using $400 million from the Build Back Better initiative to establish agreements with states territories and tribal governments t o buy food from local regional and underserved producers that can be given to food banks schools and other feeding programs.

For now there's enough food but there might not be in the future said Michael G. Manning president and CEO at Greater Baton Rouge Food Bank in Louisiana. He said high fuel costs also make it far more expensive to collect and distribute food.

The USDA's Coronavirus Food Assistance Program which included Farmers to Families was ""a boon” for the Alameda County Community Food Bank providing 5 billion pounds of commodities over a single year said spokesman Altfest.

""So losing that was a big hit” he said.

Altfest said as many as 10% of the people now seeking food are first timers and a growing number are showing up on foot rather than in cars to save gas.

""The food they get from us is helping them save already-stretched budgets for other expenses like gas rent diapers and baby formula” he said.

Meanwhile food purchases by the bank have jumped from a monthly average of $250000 before the pandemic to as high as $1.5 million now because of food prices. Rocketing gasoline costs forced the bank to increase its fuel budget by 66% Altfest said.

Supply chain issues are also a problem requiring the food bank to become more aggressive with procurement.

""We used to reorder when our inventory dropped to three weeks' worth now we reorder up to six weeks out” said Altfest.

He said the food bank has already ordered and paid for whole chickens stuffing cranberries and other holiday feast items it will distribute for Thanksgiving the busiest time of the year.

At the Mexican American Opportunity Foundation in Montebello east of Los Angeles workers say they are seeing many families along with older people like Diane Martinez who lined up one recent morning on foot.

Some of the hundreds of mostly Spanish-speaking recipients had cars parked nearby. They carried cloth bags cardboard boxes or shoved pushcarts to pick up their food packages from the distribution site the Los Angeles bank serves.

""The prices of food are so high and they're going up higher every day” said Martinez who expressed gratitude for the bags of black beans ground beef and other groceries. ""I'm so glad that they're able to help us.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZpcnN0YWxlcnQ0LmNvbS8yMDIyLzA3LzE3L3dvbWFuLWNoYXJnZWQtc3QtbG91aXMtY291bnR5LWJhbmstcm9iYmVyeS_SAWFodHRwczovL3d3dy5maXJzdGFsZXJ0NC5jb20vMjAyMi8wNy8xNy93b21hbi1jaGFyZ2VkLXN0LWxvdWlzLWNvdW50eS1iYW5rLXJvYmJlcnkvP291dHB1dFR5cGU9YW1w?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Woman charged in St. Louis County bank robbery,"ST.

The robbery happened at the U.S. Bank in the 11000 block of Larimore Road at 9:30 a.m. Police said after an investigation they found that Anastacia Washington 35 went into the bank and passed a threatening note announcing a robbery before getting away with about $6000.

Officers said Washington was seen on camera leaving the bank before entering a Dirt Cheap store and leaving the store after she changed clothes. Police received a tip that led them to identify her as a person of interest. Detectives later found clothes that were thrown away outside of the Dirt Cheap store. A DNA match to Washington was confirmed.

Washington is being held on $100000 cash only with no 10% bond.

St. Louis County detectives are leading the investigation.

Earlier this month the center’s customers received email notifications about the planned shutdown.

The Bank of America financial center at 150 Aiken Mall Drive S.W. will remain open.

“Bank of America remains committed to serving the financial needs of our clients and customers in the Aiken area as well as remaining a supporter and participant in the community” said Bank of America spokesperson Christopher Feeney during an interview with the Aiken Standard.

Bank of America’s main financial center in Aiken is at 167 Laurens St. S.W.

The historic structure where the center is based is known commonly as the Farmers and Merchants Bank Building.

The structure was built around 1911 and combined with the Chatfield Building which was constructed in the 1890s according to exploresc.org.

No employees at Bank of America’s main financial center will lose their jobs as a result of its closure according to Feeney.

“They will be reassigned to other (Bank of America) locations in the area” he said.

Feeney also discussed the decision to close Bank of America’s main financial center in Aiken.

“Our financial center network is still very much core to our business and we feel like it gives us a strategic advantage” he said. “But we’re always looking at ways to optimize our financial center and ATM network so that we can deliver … a modern banking experience to support our clients and their future needs.

“As you can imagine more and more people are moving to digital for day-to-day financial needs what I would call traditional transactions” he continued. “You can do so much on your phone. People prefer to visit a bank branch only when they have more significant or personal needs.”

At Bank of America’s main financial center “we saw fewer site visits (by customers) even prior to the (COVID-19) pandemic and … the pandemic sped up the trend we were already seeing.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMid2h0dHBzOi8vYWJjN255LmNvbS9ueWMtY2hhc2UtYmFuay1zdGFiYmluZy1wcml2YXRlLXNlY3VyaXR5LWd1YXJkLXN0YWJiZWQtdXBwZXItZWFzdC1zaWRlLW5ldy15b3JrLWNpdHktY3JpbWUvMTIwNTU3MjIv0gF7aHR0cHM6Ly9hYmM3bnkuY29tL2FtcC9ueWMtY2hhc2UtYmFuay1zdGFiYmluZy1wcml2YXRlLXNlY3VyaXR5LWd1YXJkLXN0YWJiZWQtdXBwZXItZWFzdC1zaWRlLW5ldy15b3JrLWNpdHktY3JpbWUvMTIwNTU3MjIv?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Man arrested in security guard stabbing at Chase Bank on Upper East Side of Manhattan,"Man arrested in security guard stabbing at Chase Bank on Upper East Side

UPPER EAST SIDE Manhattan (WABC) -- The man police say attacked a bank security guard on the Upper East Side has been charged with attempted murder and assault.

Police say Jorge Santiago 34 stabbed the security guard in the neck at a Chase Bank branch on Friday morning.

It happened in the branch on East 86th Street as police say the guard was attempted to escort Santiago from the location.

Authorities say the dispute began prior to the opening of the bank at 9 a.m. after the customer arrived early and was told the bank was not open yet.

The man became agitated and questioned why some people were being let in. He was told they were workers.

When the bank opened the customer went to the teller and attempted to conduct business.

He was told the branch could not complete his transaction and instead was given an 800 number to call and he then began acting belligerently.

The manager was called over attempted to calm him down and after a brief conversation told the man he had to leave.

The 59-year-old private security guard attempted to walk the man to the door and a verbal dispute ensued.

It then escalated and became physical and the guard was stabbed in the neck police said.

He was rushed to Cornell Hospital in critical condition but officials said late Friday that he had stabilized and is expected to survive.

The suspect fled the scene and Santiago was arrested around 1 a.m. Saturday. Police said he had two knives in his possession.

Santiago was charged with attempted murder assault and criminal possession of a weapon.

""Our thoughts are with the security guard and his family and we are cooperating with police"" Chase Bank spokesperson Briana Curran said.

The attacker was described as a Hispanic man with a white shirt and long curly hair.

He fled on foot westbound on East 86th Street.

“Embrace the chaos. It means you’re doing something meaningful.”

It was August 2014. Uber had been operating in India for only a year and was already in 10 cities. But the rapid expansion and a cavalier attitude towards taxi laws had collided with opposition from competitors and regulators – each grappling with Uber’s insistence that it didn’t need to play by the same rules as the incumbent taxi industry.

To Uber the fight was justified – righteous even. Above all it was necessary.

“We will likely have both local and national issues in almost every city in India for the rest of your tenure at Uber … so get used to this as the status quo” continued the email from Uber’s top executive in India.

Four months later an Uber driver was accused of raping a customer leading to the service being temporarily banned in Delhi. He was later given a life sentence. In the days after the assault the executive emailed staff saying the team was making changes to improve customer safety and checks on drivers but was in good spirits: “We know that Uber is a force for good in India and around the world. Of course we have much to improve on.”

Nearly three years later as Kalanick’s leadership unravelled it was reported that while the company publicly promised to improve safety another executive obtained the medical files of the rape survivor in a failed attempt to discredit her evidence. Uber fired the executive after journalists began asking questions about the incident.

Uber’s behaviour during its years of explosive growth returned to the spotlight this week with the publication of the Uber files a Guardian-led investigation based on 124000 internal documents that illustrated how the company flouted laws duped police exploited violence against drivers and secretly lobbied governments during its aggressive global expansion. The cache of files which span the years 2013 to 2017 laid bare a catalogue of ethically questionable practices as the company chased an increasingly bullish valuation one which increased from just $60m (£50m) in 2011 to $82bn when it joined the stock market in 2019.

Q&A What are the Uber files? Show The Uber files is a global investigation based on a trove of 124000 documents that were leaked to the Guardian by Mark MacGann Uber's former chief lobbyist in Europe the Middle East and Africa. The data consist of emails iMessages and WhatsApp exchanges between the Silicon Valley giant's most senior executives as well as memos presentations notebooks briefing papers and invoices. The leaked records cover 40 countries and span 2013 to 2017 the period in which Uber was aggressively expanding across the world. They reveal how the company broke the law duped police and regulators exploited violence against drivers and secretly lobbied governments across the world. To facilitate a global investigation in the public interest the Guardian shared the data with 180 journalists in 29 countries via the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists (ICIJ). The investigation was managed and led by the Guardian with the ICIJ. In a statement Uber said: ""We have not and will not make excuses for past behaviour that is clearly not in line with our present values. Instead we ask the public to judge us by what we’ve done over the last five years and what we will do in the years to come.""

Today the firm led by Kalanick’s successor Dara Khosrowshahi is still atoning for the sins of its past as it struggles to achieve the profits its investors spent billions betting it would attain.

‘Move fast and break things’

In the beginning Uber was a typical Silicon Valley upstart. The company was founded by Kalanick and Canadian entrepreneur Garrett Camp in 2009. They conceived the idea after unsuccessfully trying to hail a cab in Paris the previous year.

Uber was among a class of supposed disruptors that embraced Mark Zuckerberg’s “move fast and break things” approach.

In Uber’s case investor cash subsidised users’ fares in cities the company had muscled its way into with an app that connected passengers with cab drivers. The price of their ride fluctuated depending on supply and demand. Uber was among the pioneers of the gig economy business model using a vast pool of freelance labour and initially avoiding the costs – such as holiday pay and pensions – associated with contracted employees.

To the pugnacious Kalanick who was 32 when Uber launched “move fast and break things” appeared to apply as much to laws as anything else.

In an early investor slide deck from 2008 Kalanick and Camp proposed a members-only service called UberCab that combined the “convenience of a cab in NYC” with the “experience of a professional chauffeur”.

The company they launched in San Francisco in 2010 quickly evolved from a limo-hailing service to one that relied primarily on pseudo-professional drivers with their own cars fuelling its break-neck expansion. By 2012 Uber was operating across the US and in three cities in Europe. Just a year later Uber was in 74 cities around the world and worth about $3.5bn.

Uber pitched itself as an innovator with a service too novel to play by the antiquated rules the entrenched taxi industry abided by. Taxi companies were archaic enemies of innovation – and expensive – according to Kalanick.

Internal emails and text messages from a critical period of growth imply that Uber’s true innovation was not necessarily the platform but the lower cost lower barrier relationship it had with its drivers who typically were not commercially licensed.

However cities around the world had long-established laws that intended mostly to ensure the safety of taxi passengers and according to those laws in many places Uber’s business was illegal.

Missing from Uber’s retelling of its own history is that it not only launched a service it knew was illegal in many cities but that running an unlicensed business was critical to the company’s bottom line.

In emails and text messages reviewed by the Guardian executives acknowledged that fighting enforcement was necessary and in one instance described it as “extremely strategic” to the company’s “ability to scale the business” in Europe.

By 2016 Uber was in 400 cities in 68 countries with a valuation of about $66bn that it struggled to justify. And on any given day the company was fighting regulators in a dozen cities worldwide.

Externally Uber presented itself as a champion of the free market and a righteous disruptor with dreams of revolutionising transportation despite being dragged down by a system designed to uphold and preserve the status quo.

But one question continued to stalk the company: did Uber have a sustainable business if it played by the rules? In a 2014 email to a senior member of the policy team the then head of global communications Nairi Hourdajian said “sometimes we have problems because well we’re just fucking illegal”. Contacted by the Guardian Hourdajian declined to comment.

Evading regulators

The Uber files shed new light on Uber’s tactics to evade regulators of which only the contours were previously publicly known. They also raise serious questions about whether the company told investors enough about the myriad flaws in its business and the lengths to which executives went to ensure Uber was able to operate outside the law. “The new revelations could raise issues about whether Uber disclosed enough information to investors about the risks” said Carl Tobias a professor in law at the University of Richmond Virginia.

Uber for its part is confident in the accuracy and completeness of its disclosures to investors. and lists more than 50 pages of risk factors in the prospectus for its 2019 stock market float including a reference to the rape in Delhi.

To preserve its business model Uber developed a sophisticated strategy that ranged from evading regulators with technology to widespread lobbying to win over politicians media and the public.

Emails show that executives established and discussed practices to thwart regulators across Europe including in Spain Belgium and the Netherlands.

When law enforcement officials would attempt to hail a car hoping to catch Uber operating without permission company employees tried to present them with a “fake view” of the app using a tool called Greyball. To the officials it would appear that no cars were in the area or there would be phantom cars not linked to an actual driver. And when law enforcement raided offices the company would often be one step ahead deploying a “kill switch” to shut down all computers. The use of the kill switch was discussed by Uber executives in at least six countries and in a statement Uber said it stopped using it and Greyball in 2017.

Then there was the lobbying using a handful of well-connected political consultants and the company’s policy team.

David Plouffe former campaign manager to Barack Obama was appointed in 2014 to lead Uber’s policy and communications teams and used his personal connections and political sway to open doors for the company. A little more than a year later Uber replaced Plouffe with Google’s PR boss Rachel Whetstone and moved him into a chief adviser role.

Meanwhile Uber continued to battle regulators and well-funded competitors around the world claiming victories in many places while being forced to pull out or rethink its operations in major markets like China in 2016.

But a new era of reckoning came in early 2017: a massive #DeleteUber campaign sparked by a blog post by Susan Fowler an engineer who wrote about the sexism and discrimination she encountered at the company. It set into motion a series of events that culminated in the forcing out of many of the top brass.

A change at the top

Uber’s reputation was in a critical state in 2017 and Kalanick was at the centre of the criticism. He resigned in June after the company released a report on its workplace culture led by the former US attorney general Eric Holder.

Amid internal chaos Uber turned to an understated but talented external figure as Kalanick’s successor: Iranian-born Khosrowshahi then CEO of online travel company Expedia.

Speaking after his appointment in a New Yorker profile Khosrowshahi said: “We were probably trading off doing the right thing for growth and thinking about competition maybe a bit too aggressively and some of those things were mistakes.” Khosrowshahi had to prove that Uber – which posted a net loss of $4.5bn in 2017 – could achieve profitability by playing nice.

But a change at the top has not lessened the regulatory and political pressure on Uber. The UK has been at the forefront of battles over its business model and its drivers’ employment status. Last year the supreme court dismissed Uber’s appeal against a landmark employment tribunal ruling that its drivers should be classed as workers with access to the minimum wage and paid holidays. After that ruling Uber said its 70000 UK drivers would be guaranteed a minimum wage of £8.72 an hour holiday pay and pensions.

In 2020 voters in California approved a law that gave gig workers some employment benefits but classed them as independent contractors. In June Massachusetts’ top court rejected an Uber-backed bid to ask voters whether app-based cab-share and delivery drivers should be treated as independent contractors rather than employees. From Switzerland to the Netherlands courts in Europe have also increasingly ruled in favour of drivers’ rights.

Uber now employs 29300 people and operates in 72 countries and 10500 cities. It has the scale but the business under Khosrowshahi has yet to yield a consistent profit. Since it was founded Uber has wracked up a cumulative loss of $23.6bn.

Uber floated on the New York Stock Exchange in 2019 with a valuation of $82.4bn but stumbled on its first day as a public company ending with a valuation of $69.7bn after investors pushed shares down 7.6%.

Khosrowshahi has been forced to take radical action selling Uber’s autonomous driving division for a reported $4bn and offloaded its loss-making flying taxi division.

The company has also resorted to working with an unlikely partner in major cities around the US: the taxi industry. In New York City and San Francisco – where Uber faced some of the most aggressive opposition from taxi regulators and companies in the US – the company has partnered with yellow cab companies and is now allowing riders to hail taxis on the platform.

Uber is now a slimmer business with its cab-hailing arm vying neck-and-neck with its takeaway and grocery delivery unit in revenue terms. In its most recent quarterly results Uber posted another loss – of $5.9bn – after writing down its stakes in other companies. It has also been battling a backdrop of dampened investor faith in tech stocks which has resulted in Uber’s share price declining 50% this year. Having floated at $45 a share it is now worth around $21 a share.

In a statement to the Guardian about the Uber Files a spokesperson for Kalanick said: “Travis Kalanick never authorised any actions or programs that would obstruct justice in any country.” The spokesperson added: “The reality was that Uber’s expansion initiatives were led by over a hundred leaders in dozens of countries around the world and at all times under the direct oversight and with the full approval of Uber’s robust legal policy and compliance groups.”

Jill Hazelbaker Uber’s senior vice-president of public affairs said: “We have not and will not make excuses for past behaviour that is clearly not in line with our present values. Instead we ask the public to judge us by what we’ve done over the last five years and what we will do in the years to come.”

'One of them put a gun against my head': Uber driver recounts terrifying carjacking incident

CHICAGO (CBS) -- An Uber driver is speaking out after a gun was put to his head while on the job. It all started in North Lawndale and ended in suburban Stickney Township. Now Chicago Police say that gun was used in several robberies.

CBS 2's Shardaa Gray spoke with the driver who was deeply shaken.

He has been an Uber driver for five years and nothing like this has ever happened. He was not injured but he feels like had he not done what the carjackers wanted he would not be here to tell his story.

""I just got to do whatever they say. Whatever they want I'm doing"" Naftali Roth said.

He gave up everything including his car as he was being carjacked at gunpoint.

""They took everything out of my pockets: my keys my wallet my phone"" he said.

Roth said last Tuesday he picked up four men near 21st and Christiana in North Lawndale.

""I start driving everything is normal"" he said. ""A few of them they were actually sleeping. I was like 'OK it seems suspicious' but I was like 'You know what maybe it's not. Maybe it's all good.'""

But when he got to his destination in the 4700 block of South Lotus in Stickney Township that's when things went south.

""They grab my phone. They say 'Don't move'"" Roth said. ""A few of them pull out guns. One of them put a gun against my head.""

The Cook County Sheriff's Office said Roth's car was found in the 1900 block of South Christiana Avenue not too far from where he picked up the suspects.

Authorities say they were involved in several armed robberies -- including nine in Chicago as Roth said he was told.

""They went on a rampage. I mean like really fast"" he said.

Uber said in a statement ""The details reported by Mr. Roth are terrifying and as soon as he reported the incident we deactivated the rider. We are working with law enforcement on their investigation.""

Roth said with the suspects still on the loose and having access to his phone he hasn't gotten much sleep.

""I'm actually like scared at night right now because I don't even know are they going to come to my house. Like God forbid but I'm scared of that"" he said.

Roth said since the sheriff's office still has his car he is hopeful they will find some evidence that will link it to the carjackers. He is raising money to replace the items he lost.

Uber said it has pioneered several safety features for drivers including an emergency button that enables them to call or text 911.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMicWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWd1YXJkaWFuLmNvbS90ZWNobm9sb2d5LzIwMjIvanVsLzE3L3VuaW9uLWNhbGxzLW9uLXVrLXViZXItdXNlcnMtdG8tam9pbi0yNC1ob3VyLXN0cmlrZS11YmVyLWZpbGVz0gFxaHR0cHM6Ly9hbXAudGhlZ3VhcmRpYW4uY29tL3RlY2hub2xvZ3kvMjAyMi9qdWwvMTcvdW5pb24tY2FsbHMtb24tdWstdWJlci11c2Vycy10by1qb2luLTI0LWhvdXItc3RyaWtlLXViZXItZmlsZXM?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Union calls on UK Uber users to join 24-hour strike over revelations,"A trade union representing “gig economy” workers is calling on Uber customers to join a 24-hour strike in response to the Uber files a series of revelations about the cab-hailing app published by the Guardian and its media partners.

The App Drivers and Couriers Union (ADCU) invited Uber users to avoid using the service for a day on Wednesday and instead join a demonstration at the company’s headquarters in London.

The ADCU is demanding increased pay and conditions for its drivers and measures to address issues raised in the Uber files.

A trove of more than 124000 documents which was leaked to the Guardian and shared with the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists and international media partners revealed last week how Uber broke laws duped police and secretly lobbied governments.

Uber has said that it “will not make excuses for past behaviour that is clearly not in line with our present values. Instead we ask the public to judge us by what we’ve done over the last five years and what we will do in the years to come.”

ADCU said Uber had not gone far enough questioning the company’s response to a landmark ruling last year by the supreme court which found drivers were not self-employed contracters but workers who were entitled to rights such as minimum wage and holiday pay.

The union said Uber was interpreting drivers’ working hours as lasting from the cab’s dispatch to dropping off a customer. Instead the period should include waiting times which the ADCU claimed accounted for up to 40% of drivers’ working period.

Fares should also be increased to £2.50 a mile and 20p a minute with Uber’s commission capped at 15% the union said.

The Uber files uncovered how the San Francisco-based company gained access to top-level politicians around the world as it lobbied for regulatory changes to allow it to operate.

The ADCU said Uber was still exercising significant “unfair” lobbying heft in the UK including having meetings with MPs.

Last the union called for the dismissal of Pierre-Dimitri Gore-Coty the head of the food delivery service Uber Eats whose involvement in the use of “kill switches” and controversial software called Greyball to fool law enforcement was revealed in the Uber files.

Gore-Coty told the Guardian he had been “young and inexperienced and too often took direction from superiors with questionable ethics”.

Uber has insisted it has changed for the better since the arrival of Dara Khosrowshahi as chief executive in 2017 triggered an overhaul of the company’s corporate culture.

James Farrar the general secretary of the ADCU disputed the claim saying drivers had “no choice but to strike and take to the streets”.

An Uber spokesperson said: “The ADCU represents a tiny proportion of active drivers on Uber. For over a year now GMB union has served as the voice of drivers in the UK following our historic recognition agreement which helped secure new worker protections including holiday pay and access to a pension plan.

“With demand up following the pandemic Uber drivers are earning more than ever – in the first quarter of 2022 they earned on average £29.72 an hour including holiday pay when actively engaged on the app.

“The combination of higher earnings new protections such as holiday pay and a pension and trade union recognition in the UK has led to more than 10000 new drivers signing up with Uber in recent months.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNvY2lhbGV1cm9wZS5ldS90aGUtdWJlci1maWxlcy1hLXdha2UtdXAtY2FsbC1mb3ItdGhlLWV1LWluc3RpdHV0aW9uc9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,The Uber Files—a wake-up call for the EU institutions,"The huge challenges facing the EU can only be met if citizens are confident it acts in the public interest.

Uber evidently hoped a word in the ear would be heard particularly loudly (MassimoUsai60/shutterstock.com)

Earlier this month we saw the murky side of American corporate lobbying in Europe spill out of the shadows and on to the front pages of our newspapers. On display in remarkable detail were the tactics used by the multinational company Uber to try to change national and European Union legislation and regulation to suit its business model.

The methods it reportedly deployed covered backroom meetings with high-level politicians the use of ‘stealth technology’ to block scrutiny paying academics for flattering write-ups and the actual flouting of laws. Regulators everywhere should study these techniques to see what they are really up against.

While these revelations are concerning they are not surprising. Brussels is the second lobbying capital of the world reflecting its status as a global regulatory power. Standards and laws decided by the EU affect 450 million Europeans but also tend to be applied far beyond Europe’s borders making the city a hotspot for lobbyists and businesses.

The EU capital is awash with tales of huge lobbying efforts accompanying major pieces of legislation. Just recently those efforts were focused on EU legislation designed to regulate Big Tech.

High-level access

As compelling as the individual details of the Uber revelations might be the most important lesson concerns the level of access top lobbyists had to the upper echelons of power at both the national and the European level. The ease with which the company managed to secure the attention of such high level policy-makers ought to be a wake-up call for the EU administration.

Too many people still have a one-dimensional understanding of what lobbying is: the publicly registered meeting with an EU official to discuss a particular issue is but a small part of the overall picture. Transparent lobbying is legitimate and can be very useful leading to improved policies. Much lobbying however happens away from the public eye covering a range of informal and formal settings moves by officials into the private sector and the establishment of front organisations which obscure who or what is being represented.

A ‘good’ lobbying campaign tries to build a web of influence. This might include trying to use the networks of an ex-member of the European Commission to gain access to current commissioners hiring EU officials to benefit from their networks and knowledge of the system or simply being sure to know when key meetings are taking place. The private sector usually has a vast array of resources allowing them to cover all these paths—and many more—of influence.

Little monitoring

Of various examples which have landed on my desk as complaints over the years one stands out as an illustration of how corporations build influence. The world’s largest asset-management company Blackrock managed to secure a contract to carry out an EU study on sustainable finance an area of significant regulatory interest to it. Its initial application should have resulted in much more critical scrutiny—as well as a few pointed questions as to why such a large company would be keen to secure such a relatively low-remuneration contract.

There are strong laws governing ethics and accountability in the EU institutions. The laws regulate moves by EU officials to the private sector they require ex-commissioners to behave with integrity and discretion for life and they oblige high-level officials to meet only those lobbyists in the EU Transparency Register and to document these meetings publicly.

But the laws are only as strong as their enforcement. There is little monitoring of what ex-commissioners for example do after their time in office. I have tried to address the shortcomings in several inquiries over the years and have regularly called for the further tightening of ethics and accountability rules and more robust enforcement.

Change of culture

What the Uber Files show is that there needs to be a change of culture at the top of the EU but also in national administrations. A lax approach to revolving doors or to lobbying can severely undermine the integrity of any public service.

This change in culture must also include a willingness to deal with new challenges such as ensuring that the public can still scrutinise decision-making in an era of text and instant messages. The evidence is that the EU institutions are not yet dealing properly with this.

For example despite an access-to-documents request by a journalist and a follow-up inquiry by my office the European Commission failed to conduct a proper search for text messages between its president Ursula von der Leyen and the head of a global pharmaceutical company. The commission’s refusal to engage substantively on the matter gave the regrettable impression of an EU institution which was not forthcoming on matters of significant public interest.

Moreover a survey of eight EU institutions and agencies by my office revealed little practical preparedness for dealing with accountability issues in an age of instant messaging. EU administrative practices must evolve and grow with the times we live in and the modern methods we use to communicate. It should have been obvious but the texts leaked as part of the Uber revelations demonstrate why the recording of relevant work-related text messages is so essential for the proper scrutiny of decision-making.

EU-wide rules

Lobbying strategies operate at the EU and national levels. The ease of access to the EU in the Uber case was matched in several member states; lobbying efforts at national level also feed into decisions taken by the EU. This raises the question as to whether there should be an EU directive on lobbying transparency and ethics. This could be considered when the treaties are next revised—the European Parliament last month called for a convention to revise the treaties to act on the conclusions of the Conference on the Future of Europe.

A common understanding across the EU of what constitutes ethical behaviour for current and former members of public administrations would be an important step to reduce the undue influence of lobbying. Upholding ethics rules adapting transparency practices to align with modern communication methods making it easier for the public to monitor EU decision-making—these can all increase the democratic legitimacy of the EU and national administrations. Ethical and accountable public administrations are the bedrock of healthy democracies.

The EU faces many challenges—from the climate crisis to the fallout from Russia’s war in Ukraine to upholding the rule of law within its borders and ensuring a green and equitable recovery from the pandemic. Some difficult policy decisions will have be made requiring significant public support. Maintaining such support will only be possible if citizens believe that the EU administration and its national counterparts are acting entirely in the public interest."

Courtesy of United Airlines

Airline seat maps require a complex configuration for ease of booking and transfer in case of a change in aircraft. And while the business and first-class rows often skew the order of economy class seats I was surprised to see row 33 missing entirely on my last United Airlines flight.

Hotels are known to skip floor 13 to avoid issues for guests who have triskaidekaphobia a fear of the number 13. A fear of the number 33 however is yet to be coined thus prompting the question: Why would an airline skip row number 33?

Founded in 1926 United Airlines flies to more than 300 destinations in 60 countries spanning North America South America Europe Asia and Oceania. About one-third of its routes are completed within the continental United States the mainline service for which was (and continues to be in some parts) the Boeing 737-700. The carrier is standardized to 32 rows. However after the first-class rows of 1 through 3 the economy plus seats start at row 7 (skipping 4 5 and 6) to offer more space to the upgraded passengers. So the aircraft doesn't actually have 32 rows; instead it has 29.

Wayne Slezak/Courtesy of United Airlines

While some of the Boeing 737-700 aircrafts are still in service many of the newer planes are missing row 33 in order for the seat map to end in row 40. The row is missing on the following Boeing aircrafts: 757-200 (both versions) 737-700 (both versions) 737-800 (all three versions) 737-900 (all three versions) A319 and A320. As a result these planes have four first-class rows. The configuration then skips rows 5 and 6 and starts at 7 through 12 for economy plus. Then another shift happens: Rows 13 through 19 are skipped and they pick up again at row 20 and 21 (exit rows). Economy class starts at row 22 and again row 33 is skipped. This aircraft has 29 to 30 rows. Thus while these planes are different they don't offer much more seating than the Boeing 737-700 but do provide more comfort.

""We used to skip 33 on certain maps to make the [final] row standardized but the end row is no longer standardized"" a United Airlines spokesperson told Travel + Leisure. In short the reasoning behind having a unanimous seating map is a math equation of sorts. The aircraft seating chart must end in an even round number like 40 or 50 which the airline considers ""standard."" The row is not skipped on the even newer aircrafts. Rows 20 and 21 are maintained at exit rows across the board of all United Airlines planes resulting in a skewed number system depending on the aircraft and potentially ""missing"" rows. This makes it easier to switch out airplanes and for passengers to choose their seats always knowing where the exit rows are located.

A full list of the United Airlines fleet and seat maps are available on their website. These maps reflect the seat type location of the lavatories and exit doors and rows position of the galleys and in-seat power (offered on most but not all aircrafts.) Customers can view this map depending on the type of aircraft assigned to operate their flight at the time of booking.

While it's standard for airlines to skip some rows between first-class and economy plus as well as for exit row seats this is most common on Boeing aircrafts. However most airlines including Delta and American do not skip rows in the middle like 33. United Airlines is also switching out many of these aircrafts. So if you happen to be on one of these flights enjoy it now because these too will soon be obsolete with row 33 permanently present.

Next to it a portable sink awaits use — its soap dispenser empty.

They sit on the corner of Gould Street and Al Lipscomb Way in the Cedars area of South Dallas in view of the Dallas skyline. The camp they are meant to service starts at the tree line about 100 feet away where people stay cool beneath the shade.

The toilet and sink are part of a pilot initiative launched in February that aims to provide homeless people with access to basic hygiene. The city is particularly targeting people living in encampments that the homeless solutions office is trying to move into shelters or housing.

Currently the toilets service six locations including by the J. Erik Jonsson Central Library downtown. The program costs the city $23000 annually part of $1.14 million it has set aside for encampment cleanups and outreach to the unsheltered population.

But many homeless people interviewed by The Dallas Morning News said they found them often too dirty or understocked to use. Some living near them weren’t even aware they were there.

Flavio Gonzales who often visits his friend Gloria who lives in a tent on Chestnut Street said they noticed a port-a-potty placed near them a couple months ago. But he said they rarely use it — it’s dirty most of the time.

“I clean it!” he said when asked if they ever see workers refreshing it.

Thomas Earl Castle who lives in a tent nearby said he and others try to service it with whatever cleaning supplies they can round up though it’s difficult for anybody to keep it in perfect condition all the time.

“About an hour ago that wasn’t there” he said pointing to excrement on the floor of the port-a-potty.

The condition of the portable toilet at Gould Street is hit or miss said Cedric Hubbard who stays at the camp there but added that it’s great when it’s clean.

In addition to the toilet Hubbard said homeless solutions staff come around trying to offer shelter and other resources every now and then. He doesn’t know of anybody in the immediate area who has gotten housing recently.

“Somebody might nobody I know personally” he said.

He then pulled out a cleaning notice from the city given to him and others at the camp. Everyone needed to leave the area with their belongings because it was scheduled for a sweep. He said city staff told them they had just a few days.

Maintenance issues

City officials indicated the toilets should be cleaned at least three times per week when the program was rolled out but records in the port-a-potties show that might not be happening.

The port-a-potty vendors — United Site Services and United Rentals — are in charge of maintenance according to Office of Homeless Solutions director Christine Crossley and city staff checks the toilets randomly to see if they’re doing their job. Neither vendor responded to repeated calls about the state of the toilets.

Not all of the port-a-potties are receiving the same amount of attention — the ones by the library are getting priority.

According to the Chestnut Street port-a-potty’s log it had only been cleaned twice in the last two weeks. The one at Gould Street has been getting attention at most twice every week.

“I’m not sure if they’ve been cleaning and not filling out the logs I can’t speak for them but our street outreach manager is working with both vendors now to make sure that they understand not only do you need to do the cleanings you need to fill out the logs” said Crossley.

But even three cleanings per week might not be enough to keep the toilets sanitary.

The port-a-potties at the library were originally on that schedule but library staff told homeless solutions it wasn’t enough — now they are serviced at least three times weekly.

United Rental owns and services the ones by the library and United Site Services owns the others. Originally United Rental was going to provide toilets for all the sites but declined to put them at camps because of security concerns.

This delayed the program and increased costs forcing the city to hire United Site Services and to remove one of the sites that was originally part of the plan. The library got its port-a-potties in early March but the camps waited until the end of May two months later than expected.

Willie “Trey” Seals who has been homeless for about a year and spends a lot of his time in front of the library said he uses the ones there and that they’re usually fairly clean.

“Honestly that was a great thing” he said. “I’ve been seeing quite a few around.”

Anita Hutten who sleeps at the entrance of the library on a regular basis also uses the toilets when the library is closed but sanitizes its surfaces with her own wipes beforehand.

“I don’t care if they clean it 24 hours” she said adding she often finds clothes and other miscellaneous items scattered around in them.

The need for public restrooms

Hubbard likes the port-a-potty because it’s better than going “over in those trees” he said pointing behind him to the greenery shading the camp.

Sites for the port-a-potties were chosen partly to give people another option when nature calls — there are no 24-hour public restrooms near the camps.

The lack of bathrooms has led to a large number of reports of public indecency near the camps said Crossley something the city hopes to reduce with the program. This will also help people avoid getting cited for relieving themselves in public increasing the likelihood they will get into housing eventually.

“Being arrested for public indecency … frankly doesn’t solve your homelessness” she said.

Michael Kabtimer an activist with Say It With Your Chest and Dallas Liberation Movement comes to the Gould Street camp twice per week to help people with laundry and distribute water and ice. Most people he said have no other choice but to find a place outdoors when it’s time to go.

“Realistically most people are using whatever their own type of creative solutions for this may be outside that port-a-potty” he said.

Some shelters in the area such as Austin Street Center have opened up their restrooms to the public during working hours to help those living in nearby camps.

Daniel Roby the shelter’s CEO said he views having access to a restroom as a human right.

“It’s incumbent upon us as the community to say if we don’t want things that are unsanitary if we don’t want people to be cited for something that’s a human bodily function then it’s our obligation to make sure that we provide something that’s safe for people to do” he said.

Potentially erecting more permanent public bathrooms came up during a presentation of the program to the City Council’s Housing and Homelessness Solutions Committee something Crossley said they would consider in the future but that isn’t feasible at the moment.

“I do think we need to have a broader discussion about publicly available restrooms across the city for people everybody needs them and sometimes it’s hard for homeless people to find them” council member Cara Mendelsohn said at the meeting.

Mendelsohn and council member Paula Blackmon also expressed concerns about whether the port-a-potties encourage people to stay in the camps and not seek shelter.

“I just don’t want to create a system that encourages a more permanent establishment of these sites that’s just my concern” Blackmon said.

A temporary solution

Tonya Mack who stays in a tent a couple blocks from the Gould Street port-a-potty and sink perked up when she heard about them. “They put it up for us?” she said.

She is only just hearing about the facilities but may not get a chance to try them out.

The Gould Street camp will be forced to move soon — the site’s property owner real estate agency Topletz Investments told the city a week ago it’s time for them to go said Crossley.

Dennis Topletz the agency’s owner said he’s in a “Catch-22″ with the city which is reluctant to move the camp forcibly but also tells his company to keep the lot clean. Finally he reached out to Dallas Code Compliance to issue a notice to those in the camp to move he said.

“My problem is the city is on me and people are on my property causing the problem” he said.

The toilet placements are only supposed to be temporary Crossley said part of a broader effort to get people living at the encampments into shelters or housing through the Dallas R.E.A.L. Time Rehousing Program.

In this case they had not started getting people at Gould Street into the program yet and won’t be able to help them all before the sweep. Getting people onto a list for housing at other locations usually takes about four to six weeks she said.

“There hasn’t been enough time that would’ve needed to happen a month ago” she said. “This was certainly on the radar but not yet because we’re somewhere else right now.”

Crossley said they haven’t decided whether to move the port-a-potty from Gould Street quite yet understanding some in the area might use it even after the property is reclaimed. They were able to delay the camp’s removal by three days.

Mack is excited about the toilet and sink but most concerned with the sweep.

“Where am I going?” she asked.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiN2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmluZHljYXIuY29tL05ld3MvMjAyMi8wNy8wNy0xNy1Ub3JvbnRvLVJhY2XSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Dixon Ends Drought Ties Mario with Commanding Toronto Win,"The drought finally is over for Scott Dixon.

Six-time NTT INDYCAR SERIES champion Dixon earned his first victory since May 2021 at Texas Motor Speedway – a span of 23 races the second-longest winless streak of his illustrious career – by capturing the Honda Indy Toronto on Sunday. Dixon drove his No. 9 PNC Bank Chip Ganassi Racing Honda to a victory by .8106 of a second over Colton Herta in the No. 26 Gainbridge Honda.

The victory also was the 52nd of Dixon’s career tying him with fellow legend Mario Andretti for No. 2 on the all-time INDYCAR SERIES win list. A.J. Foyt leads with 67 wins. Dixon’s fourth career Toronto victory extended his record to 18 consecutive INDYCAR SERIES seasons with at least one win and he also has won a race in a record 20 seasons overall.

“Ended a streak there which is fantastic” Dixon said. “Just so happy for the team. A crazy year for the 9. The PNC Bank No. 9 back in winner’s circle. It just feels so good.

“To be close to Mario every time I’m asked these questions I’m just so thankful that we still have A.J. and him in the pits. We get to see them; we get to talk to them. It’s just fantastic. It’s huge man. I just feel so lucky to be a part of this group.”

Felix Rosenqvist finished third in the No. 7 Arrow McLaren SP Chevrolet to earn his first podium result since his sole career INDYCAR SERIES victory in July 2020 at Road America.

Graham Rahal finished a season-best fourth in the No. 15 United Rentals Honda while NTT INDYCAR SERIES championship leader Marcus Ericsson finished fifth in the No. 8 Huski Chocolate Chip Ganassi Racing Honda.

Ericsson expanded his lead from 20 to 35 points over second-place Will Power in the series standings. Power finished 15th after starting 16th in the No. 12 Verizon Team Penske Chevrolet.

Dixon is fifth in the standings 44 points behind his Chip Ganassi Racing teammate Ericsson. Dixon would tie Foyt as the all-time championship winner in INDYCAR SERIES history with a seventh title.

“Hopefully we’re kind of in the title hunt now” Dixon said. “I’m hoping this is the start of the roll. I know the team definitely deserves it.”

Dixon who started second used canny strategy from his pit box earlier in the race to take the lead for the first time on Lap 32 of the 85-lap race.

Dixon chased NTT P1 Award winner Colton Herta for the first 17 laps around the 11-turn 1.786-mile temporary street circuit around Exhibition Place. The Ganassi team called Dixon for fuel and to change from Firestone alternate “red” tires to the primary “black” tires on Lap 17.

That move prompted Andretti Autosport to call Herta to the pits for an identical tire change on Lap 18 and Dixon – on hot primary tires – passed Herta and his cold primary tires on track during Herta’s out lap after his pit stop. That overtaking maneuver proved decisive and Dixon circulated to the front on Lap 32 when Pato O’Ward surrendered the lead after finally making his first pit stop in the No. 5 Arrow McLaren SP Chevrolet.

“We struggled a little bit on reds” Dixon said of the Firestone alternate tires. “We made some adjustments after this morning (based) on some of the different tracks that we’ve been throughout the year. We had fought with understeer and that definitely wasn’t the case today. It was a tough drive man.”

The race was remarkably clean for the first 44 laps with just one caution for two laps in the opening laps after contact damaged the No. 51 Deloitte Honda of Takuma Sato. But the treacherous bumpy circuit with its unforgiving walls spawned three caution periods between Laps 45 and 60 giving Herta and others a chance to jump Dixon on a restart.

But Dixon held firm and assumed the lead for good under caution on Lap 61 when an off-sequence Rinus VeeKay pitted from the front in the No. 21 Bitcoin Racing Team with BitNile Chevrolet. Dixon led a race-high 40 of the 85 laps with VeeKay second with 18 laps in front.

Herta couldn’t get past Dixon on the final restart of the race on Lap 66. Then Herta focused on his mirrors and resisted intense pressure from behind from Rosenqvist prevailing for second over the Swede by .5384 of a second at the finish.

“Felix was really fast and I’m glad we were able to keep him behind us” Herta said. “He looked like a few more laps and he was going to get us. We struggled a little bit with tire wear at the end but other than that our car was amazing.”

Dixon will split $10000 with his team and a charity of his choice for the victory as part of the PeopleReady Force for Good Challenge.

A July survey from the University of Michigan showed that inflation expectations have held steady or improved along with general consumer sentiment. The report was welcomed following several government reports this week that showed consumer prices remained extremely hot in June along with wholesale prices for businesses.

The report also bodes well for investors looking for signs that the Federal Reserve might eventually ease off its aggressive policy to fight inflation.

The S&P 500 rose 1.9 per cent snapping a five-day losing streak. Still the gains weren’t enough to pull the benchmark index out of the red for the week.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 2.1 per cent and the Nasdaq gained 1.8 per cent. Smaller company stocks outgained the broader market sending the Russell 2000 index 2.2 per cent higher. Those indexes also posted losses for the week however.

“Investors are saying look ‘we’ve seen this before where the market goes up smartly one day only to turn back around the next day'” said chief investment strategist at CFRA Sam Stovall.

Technology stocks banks and healthcare companies made some of the biggest gains. PayPal climbed 6.3 per cent. UnitedHealth Group rose 5.4 per cent after raising its profit forecast for the year following a strong earnings report. Citigroup jumped 13.2 per cent for the biggest gain in the S&P 500 after reporting encouraging financial results.

Bond yields mostly fell. The yield on the 10-year Treasury slipped to 2.92 per cent from 2.96 per cent late Thursday. The yield on the two-year Treasury rose to 3.14 per cent from 3.13 per cent late on Thursday.

Inflation and its impact on businesses and consumers remains a key focus for Wall Street. The Federal Reserve has been raising interest rates in an effort to hit the brakes on economic growth and curtail rising inflation. The Fed has already raised rates three times this year.

Wall Street has been worried that the Fed could go too far in raising rates and actually bring on a recession.

Investors have been closely watching economic reports for clues as to how the central bank might react and the latest upbeat consumer sentiment report raises the chance of the Fed softening its current policy.

Traders have eased off of their bets that the Fed will issue a monster rate hike of one per cent at its next policy meeting in two weeks. They now see a 30.9-per-cent chance of that happening according to CME Group. That’s down significantly from Thursday.

They now see a 69.1 per cent chance of a three-quarters of a percentage point rate hike. Economic data also shows that retail sales remain strong. A government report showed that retail sales rose one per cent in June from May topping economists’ expectations while prices for everything from food to clothing rose.

All told the S&P 500 rose 72.78 points to 3863.16. The index has resisted dropping below 3800 noted Stovall. “Whenever we come down to about 3800 and we bounce off it it’s a confirmation there are a lot of buyers at that level” he said. “And we saw that yesterday as the market retested that level only to be pushed higher and then today with encouraging fundamentals to go along with it.”

The Dow rose 658.09 points to 31288.26 and the Nasdaq rose 201.24 points to 11452.42. The Russell 2000 gained 36.87 points to 1744.37.

Overseas stocks in Hong Kong and Shanghai fell following a report that showed the Chinese economy shrank by 2.6 per cent compared with the January-March period’s already weak quarter-on-quarter rate of 1.4 per cent.

China locked down major cities earlier this year to try and contain COVID-19 cases and more outbreaks this week in China and elsewhere in Asia have raised worries that COVID-19 controls might be restored on top of existing precautions.",,,,,,,,,

The idea behind the new hotline is similar to 911. It offers an easy to remember three-digit number to dial for anyone in a mental health crisis 24 hours a day. The difference is that the calls won’t go to law enforcement; calls will be answered by a network of more than 200 trained crisis call centers. Callers with an Idaho area code will be routed to the Idaho Crisis and Suicide hotline 988 project manager Nicole Coleman said.

The 988 hotline replaces and consolidates other state and national suicide prevention and mental health hotlines into one short number for callers all across the United States.

During a meeting of the Idaho Council of Indian Affairs last week Idaho Department of Health and Welfare Director Dave Jeppesen encouraged everyone to begin memorizing 988 as the new number to call in a mental health emergency.

What happens when you call the 988 mental health hotline?

On the hotline experts will be available to help intervene in a crisis support and de-escalate the caller or refer the caller to an array of local services.

“988 is the new national suicide and crisis lifeline. It will be the 911 equivalent for behavioral health crises and an integral part of Idaho’s crisis care continuum” Coleman said in a written statement. “The 988 partnership is committed to empathetic and culturally responsive services based on best practices. This continuum of care includes but isn’t limited to crisis de-escalation over the phone appropriate crisis mobile response behavioral health service linkage and crisis follow-up.”

The new 988 hotline launches in Idaho this weekend following about two years of groundwork from Idaho Department of Health and Welfare and Division of Behavioral Health along with support from Medicaid and public health districts Coleman said.

New hotline receives Idaho’s elected officials’ support

This year the hotline received an additional $4.4 million in one-time state funding approved by the Idaho Legislature from Gov. Brad Little’s behavioral health care plan Idaho Department of Health and Welfare spokesman Greg Stahl said.

During the 2021 legislative session the Idaho House of Representatives and Idaho Senate voted to adopt House Concurrent Resolution 11 a resolution that signals the Legislature’s support and promotion for the 988 hotline. In the resolution Idaho legislators noted that Idaho’s suicide rate was 41% higher than the national average as of 2019 and that the state has a shortage of mental health and primary care providers.

“988 will improve access to mental health support for all Idahoans especially those in rural communities with few health care providers; and … promotion of 988 will help raise awareness of mental health and suicide prevention and decrease stigma associated with asking for help” the resolution states.

In Congress U.S. Sen. Mike Crapo R-Idaho was one of the co-sponsors of the National Suicide Hotline Designation Act of 2020 which required the Federal Communications Commission to designate 988 as the universal suicide prevention and mental health crisis hotline. Former President Donald J. Trump signed the National Suicide Hotline Designation Act of 2020 into law that same year.

On Friday at the Idaho GOP Convention in Twin Falls Crapo assembled a group of people involved in suicide prevention and crisis intervention efforts from across Idaho including St. Luke’s Behavioral Health school counselors police and fire department staff and the Boise Vet Center. Veterans and those in active military service will have the option to press 1 after calling 988 or the old suicide prevention hotline number which will route the call to resources that specialize in care for military members.

Crapo said the launch of the hotline is just the beginning and there is more work to be done at the national and state level to ensure stable sources of funding for 988 and adequate staffing.

“One of the key initiatives we are engaged in is to incentivize the increase in number of people in America who are available because those who need help take up your time 24/7 every day and there still aren’t enough of you to help” Crapo said.

Rep. Laurie Lickley R-Jerome also attended the press conference as a speaker. Lickley is a member of Idaho’s Behavioral Health Council and could be a member of the Idaho Senate in the 2023 legislative session.

Lickley said she expects the Idaho Legislature to address the funding issues in the future but it will take some time to determine what is needed.

“We see a path forward and with your voice the voices behind us your family and their voice and the community here today we are partners in implementing your treatment and your recovery” Lickley said. “This is a lifelong path and we are with you.”

Immunization is a success story for global health and development saving millions of lives every year. Between 2010 and 2018 23 million deaths were averted with measles vaccine alone (1). The number of infants vaccinated annually – more than 116 million or 86% of all infants born – has reached the highest level ever reported. More than 20 life-threatening diseases can now be prevented by immunization (2). Since 2010 116 countries have introduced vaccines that they did not use previously (3) including those against major killers like pneumococcal pneumonia diarrhoea cervical cancer typhoid cholera and meningitis.

Furthermore there has been much innovation in vaccine development. There are now vaccines to protect against malaria dengue and Ebola virus disease and promising vaccines against respiratory syncytial virus tuberculosis and all influenza virus strains are in the pipeline. New research on broadly neutralizing antibodies and therapeutic vaccines is opening fresh horizons. Increasingly vaccines are protecting health beyond infancy – in adolescence and adulthood during pregnancy and for older people.

Innovative ways are being found to distribute and administer vaccines and to improve immunization services. Digital tools new needle-free techniques for vaccine administration and more robust vaccine storage and supply chains promise to transform immunization programmes over the next decade. Timely access to reliable data will provide new opportunities for national programmes to monitor and continuously improve their performance reach and efficiency.

Vaccines are critical to the prevention and control of many communicable diseases and therefore underpin global health security. Moreover they are widely seen as critical for addressing emerging infectious diseases for example by containing or limiting outbreaks of infectious diseases or combatting the spread of antimicrobial resistance. Regional outbreaks (e.g. of Ebola virus disease) the COVID-19 pandemic and the threat of future pandemics (such as with a novel flu strain) have and will continue to strain even the most resilient health systems. A clear risk is a reduction in essential services and particularly vaccination and prevention of other communicable diseases. Countries should identify essential services that to be prioritized and maintained during emerging infectious disease threats and move as soon as feasible to provide missed vaccinations. In the longer term intensive collaborative investments in research and development and equitable supplies of new vaccines are likely to be part of the solution to averting recurrences.

Nevertheless important challenges remain. The benefits of immunization are unevenly shared: coverage varies widely among and within countries. Some populations – often the poorest the most marginalized and the most vulnerable in fragile conflict-torn settings – have poor access to immunization services. Each year 20 million infants do not receive a full course of even basic vaccines and many more miss out on newer vaccines. Of these over 13 million receive no vaccines through immunization programmes – the “zero dose” children.

In some countries progress has stalled or even reversed and the risk that complacency will undermine past achievements is real. Outbreaks of measles and vaccine-derived polioviruses are stark reminders that strong immunization programmes and effective disease surveillance are necessary to sustain high levels of coverage and to eliminate and eradicate diseases. Because measles is highly infectious its presence serves as a tracer (the “canary in the coal mine”) of inadequate coverage and gaps in the health system. Detection of measles cases through surveillance reveals communities and age groups that are unor under-immunized and immunization programmes and overall primary health care systems that are inadequate indicating where particular attention and interventions are needed. High coverage with measles vaccine is an indicator of a strong immunization programme which may signal a solid foundation for primary health care services. The second dose of measles vaccine is an opportunity to enhance focus on strengthening immunization programmes to reach children beyond the first year of life and to broaden immunization services throughout the life-course.

If all people are to access immunization services vaccines must be delivered to areas that are isolated geographically culturally socially or otherwise and to marginalized populations such as displaced people and migrants and those affected by conflict political instability and natural disasters. The causes of low vaccine use must be understood and addressed in order to increase people’s demand for immunization services. Adequate predictable supplies of appropriate affordable vaccines of assured quality must be available at points of service delivery and stock-outs must be avoided. Tailored strategies are necessary for understanding and overcoming barriers to vaccination particularly genderrelated barriers of caregivers and health workers to accessing immunization services. New approaches are required to reach older age groups and to deliver people-centred immunization services integrated with primary health care.

The Immunization Agenda 2030 (IA2030) sets an ambitious overarching global vision and strategy for vaccines and immunization for the decade 2021–2030. It draws on lessons learnt acknowledges continuing and new challenges posed by infectious diseases and capitalizes on new opportunities to meet those challenges. IA2030 positions immunization as a key contributor to people’s fundamental right to the enjoyment of the highest attainable physical and mental health and also as an investment in the future creating a healthier safer more prosperous world for all. IA2030 aims to ensure that we maintain the hard-won gains and also that we achieve more – leaving no one behind in any situation or at any stage of life.

IA2030 is intended to inspire and align the activities of community national regional and global stakeholders – national governments regional bodies global agencies development partners health care professionals academic and research institutions vaccine developers and manufacturers the private sector and civil society. Its impact will be maximized by more effective and efficient use of resources innovation to improve performance and measures to attain financial and programmatic sustainability. Success will depend on building and strengthening partnerships within and outside the health sector as part of a coordinated effort to improve access to high-quality affordable primary health care achieve universal health coverage and accelerate progress towards the 2030 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).

IA2030 provides a long-term strategic framework to guide a dynamic operational phase responding to changes in country needs and the global context over the next decade. This document is therefore just the beginning. The IA2030 global vision and strategy will be complemented by annexes providing detailed technical information on the strategic framework together with new and existing strategies and immunization plans including those for disease-specific programmes to control eliminate or eradicate disease. IA2030 will become operational through regional and national strategies a mechanism to ensure ownership and accountability and a monitoring and evaluation framework to guide country implementation.

Through collective endeavour by all stakeholders we will achieve the vision for the decade: A world where everyone everywhere at every age fully benefits from vaccines for good health and well-being.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMihgFodHRwczovL3d3dy5rbm94bmV3cy5jb20vc3RvcnkvbmV3cy9oZWFsdGgvMjAyMi8wNy8xMi85ODgtaG90bGluZS1ob3ctdGVubmVzc2VlLXByZXBhcmVkLW5hdGlvbndpZGUtbWVudGFsLWhlYWx0aC1zZXJ2aWNlLzEwMDI2Njk3MDAyL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,How Tennessee prepared for nationwide mental health hotline 988,"On July 16 everyone in the United States will have immediate access to mental health and substance abuse help and resources by dialing just three digits: 9-8-8.

Through the new universal 988 number – intended to be an alternative to 911 to broaden care access and decriminalize mental health crisis calls – trained counselors and response teams will be available 24/7. They will listen to the caller’s problems assess their needs and provide support by connecting individuals with local resources and alert local emergency crisis teams if necessary.

Dialing or texting 988 will redirect to the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline which currently links to around 200 local crisis centers across the country. Area codes determine which call center receives the call and the longer number (800-273-8255) will remain active even after 988 is implemented.

For Knoxvillians Contact Care in Oak Ridge is one of those centers that take crisis calls and offers support through Frontier Health. And an existing program that pairs trained counselors with Knoxville police officers on crisis calls will continue.

“I think (988) could help in a unique way” says Mental Health Association of East Tennessee CEO Ben Harrington who believes the universal number will forge greater collaboration between 911 and existing crisis services available in Tennessee.

“All three doors are open for business … as long as the end result is that a person gets their crisis alleviated they don't attempt suicide they get served or we can deflect away from law enforcement engagement and incarceration and get them connected to mental health services” he said.

Decriminalizing mental health in Knoxville

One in four fatal police shootings between 2015 and 2020 involved someone with mental illness according to the National Alliance of Mental Health. And one in 10 people who experience mental health and substance abuse emergencies engage with law enforcement before receiving care.

What is 988?:What you need to know about the new mental health crisis helpline

These interactions with officers can lead to arrests hospitalizations and even injury or death which could have possibly been avoided if mental and behavioral specialists were on the scene or providing support by phone before police arrived.

Recognizing this concern Knoxville Police Department and McNabb Center partnered in 2021 to develop a co-response team that paired an officer and a behavioral specialist on mental health related calls.

Harrington believes this co-response team will be an asset once 988 goes into effect.

However because an officer is dispatched with the co-response team and potentially when someone calls 988 any police presence on mental heath calls remains a concern for some.

Knoxville HEART an organization that advocates for alternative responses to mental health emergencies has hesitation.

“The (988) line itself is great … (but) we believe that police should not be the first responders for mental health crisis calls & that you can improve outcomes with alternative response teams instead” Knoxville HEART said in a statement to Knox News.

Calls to 988 will connect to local crisis centers and mobile crisis teams. But if you call 911 Knox County Emergency Communications will dispatch officers or the co-response team.

The responding unit will conduct a welfare check and then make the determination of how to handle the call such as alerting a local 988 call center or mobile crisis teams.

“The first line of care for those in crisis should be mental health professionals trained in de-escalation not police with weapons. Police presence often worsens mental health crises especially for those with prior experience with police or folks from historically marginalized communities” Knoxville HEART's statement continued.

McNabb representatives said they're uncertain how 988 will affect the co-response team or how police will respond to mental health emergency calls but they are in favor of new avenues of support.

“We know the need for mental health care is great and it is important for people to have immediate access in their time of need. We applaud efforts to raise awareness and increase options for people who may be struggling” McNabb regional clinical vice president Leann Human Hilliard told Knox News in a statement.

How prepared is Tennessee for 988 launch?

Marie Williams Tennessee’s Department of Mental Health and Abuse Services commissioner praised Knoxville’s alternative response efforts and says the state has been making improvements to its mental health emergency services and resources.

In fact one of the reasons 988 hasn’t been heavily promoted nationally is because some states have yet to figure out ways to fund the program which may require taxes or charges in the way 911 is funded by sates.

But that's not the case in Tennessee because the current infrastructure can seamlessly accommodate 988 needs.

“In Tennessee we didn't need to do a tax” Williams said. “Those other states are doing taxes. We already are funding the things that they want to fund if you read about what 988's wanting to fund (like) crisis centers mobile crisis respite.""

Tennessee has its own statewide crisis line (855-CRISIS-1) in addition to the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline. This line will remain active too once 988 goes live across the country.

Tennessee has six crisis centers and 13 provider lines throughout the state that provide immediate care and help find long-term solutions and multiple mobile crisis teams. These resources continue to be funded and expanded through added staffing and into areas that may have limited access to support.

Tennessee call centers have already taken 158907 calls this year including 16000 statewide calls 112000 provider calls and 30000 National Suicide Prevention Lifeline calls according to Williams.

Williams knows the importance of differentiating between mental health and police responses and the need for programs like Knoxville's to continue. .

“You still need those pairings (with trained officers) because when you get the call then what do you do? So you still need those teams to go out and be able to intervene in whatever's happening in the crisis.”

What happens after the crisis call?

One area Harrington said Knoxville and East Tennessee can improve is long-term care in the private sector.

988 and crisis centers offer immediate help regardless of cost. Those who don't have insurance and aren't enrolled in Medicaid or Medicare can receive expanded care through places like McNabb Cherokee Health Systems and Ridgeview Behavioral Services.

But patients with insurance in the private sector such as through an employer may have limited mental health care options because nearby mental health professionals may not be taking new patients or may not be in their plan's network.

“That's where you start to get squeezed and you have to start searching and find somebody. All of that happens right below the crisis level but where you still need care and you need it quickly and folks can end up waiting for service” Harrington noted.

Tennessee’s statewide crisis number and the full National Suicide Prevention Lifeline number are currently available for emergency calls. These numbers will continue to be active after the launch of 988.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiemh0dHBzOi8vdGhlY29udmVyc2F0aW9uLmNvbS9oZWFsdGgtY2FyZS1wcm92aWRlcnMtYW5kLW1haWQtdGhlLXJlYXNvbnMtd2h5LXNvbWUtZG9udC1vZmZlci1tZWRpY2FsbHktYXNzaXN0ZWQtZGVhdGgtMTg2NjI10gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Health-care providers and MAID: The reasons why some don't offer medically assisted death,"Medical assistance in dying (MAID) was legalized in Canada in 2016. Since then there have been year-over-year increases in Canadians accessing a MAID death. The most recent data from 2019 to 2020 highlights a 34.2 per cent increase in Canadians accessing MAID.

Bill C-7 which passed in June 2021 changed the eligibility criteria by removing the “natural death has become reasonably foreseeable” requirement. As a result more Canadians may qualify for MAID.

During the pandemic 23 per cent of care providers in an international survey reported that assisted death inquiries or requests had “somewhat” or “significantly” increased. MAID and COVID-19 pressures resulted in at least one Canadian province temporarily pausing referrals for patients wishing to access MAID.

Non-participation in MAID:

Health-care providers willing to participate in patient assessment and MAID provision are essential to support Canadians who wish to access MAID. That makes it important to understand the factors that influence practitioners’ decisions to not participate in MAID.

THE CANADIAN PRESS/Sean Kilpatrick

As an end-of-life researcher and registered nurse I investigated this question with the support of my thesis committee. That research highlighted the complex and interwoven reasons why health-care practioners may not participate in MAID.

These factors can be divided into internal and external factors but it’s also important to recognize that there are conscience and non-conscience-based factors that influence non-participation.

Internal factors

Several personal or internally originating factors influenced non-participation. These included a general discomfort in caring for dying patients as well as the provider’s previous personal and work experiences related to death and dying. Also MAID did not align with some practioners’ approaches to end-of-life care.

Other factors that influenced non-participation included practitioners’ views of their professional duty. MAID did not align with some practitioners’ faith or spiritual beliefs and some reported they could not imagine being at peace with the decision to participate in medically assisted dying.

Health-care practitioners also considered how they were likely to respond emotionally to participating in MAID. They had concerns about the future impact of MAID participation in terms of their potential risk of post-traumatic stress disorder and burnout.

External factors

Health-care system factors: The health-care system influenced non-participation. This included working for an organization with an institutional conscientious objection to MAID and the uncertainty of working within a rapidly changing legal landscape in terms of MAID regulation. There were also concerns about adequate access to alternatives to MAID such as palliative care and chronic care support at home. Some nurse practitioners reported that they did not participate in MAID because of limiting job or practice descriptions at their current employer or a lack of billing codes that would enable them to be paid for these services.

Community factors: Reasons for non-participation also included gauging the “community conscience” perceiving a lack of openness in end-of-life discussions and the dominant religious beliefs of the community. Health-care practitioners were concerned about the impact of having to reduce or cancel other services in an already busy practice to make the time to provide MAID care to a single patient. They were also unsure if or how culture influenced the patient’s perception of MAID or the patient’s perception of them as health-care practitioners if they participated or if participation would alter the community’s trust in them.

Practice factors: For some health-care practitioners their decision to not participate in MAID was influenced by a lack of policy and program knowledge or skills to participate in the MAID assessment or provision. Another reasons was adequate pay for the time and overhead costs involved. Others said they lacked understanding about the optimal care model for MAID (such as whether MAID is provided by family medicine practitioners end-of-life care practitioners or MAID teams). Others identified that MAID was outside their clinical interest and practice strengths.

Visibility factors: How MAID participation would be viewed by colleagues clinic staff and patients also influenced the non-participation of health-care providers. This included fear of colleagues’ disapproval fear that participation would harm patient relationships and their relationship with their faith community and a fear that participation would be interpreted as giving up on patients.

Risk factors: Health-care providers contemplated the risk to themselves their practice and their families. Specifically the risk associated with professional discipline if the patient or patient’s family disagreed with their assessments the risk of colleagues making their professional lives difficult and the perceived risk of personal physical harm or violence to themselves or their families.

Time factors: Concerns about competing clinical demands time-limited appointments that do not accommodate end-of-life conversations and lack of time to offer quality MAID care influenced non-participation as well. Some health-care providers did not wish to take on new practices at their current career stage (for example close to retirement) and others noted a lack of time to take continuing education in MAID.

Patient’s family factors: Other factors that influenced non-participation in MAID related to the patient’s family. Health-care providers expressed concern that participation would impact the care provided to other family members and that there was a lack of support for the family before during and after MAID. They also considered the potential challenges of inter-family conflict around the patient’s MAID choice and the impact of the MAID death on future family dynamics.

Patient relationship factors: Another factor was the health-care practitioner/patient relationship. A long relationship with the patient could make participating in MAID uncomfortable and challenging. Others noted that a long history with a patient would support open discussions about their reasons for not participating in MAID.

Support for health-care practitioners

My research outlines a model of non-participation in the formal MAID processes. In terms of conscience and non-conscience-based factors it’s vital to differentiate between a conscientious objection to MAID and non-participation in MAID because health-care practitioners require different support for these.

Steps that might support health-care practitioners who are considering participating in MAID include clarifying regional models of care which vary between provinces and territories.

Practice-focused MAID education could include not only policy and legal aspects but also pragmatic issues such as obtaining medications and administrative requirements as well as discussions about relevant factors like communication skills and religious knowledge.

Recognizing the practice issues time and relationship investment required to provide MAID and developing fair remuneration policies for health-care practitioners who provide it may support more participation in MAID.

Supporting health-care practitioners will be vital to a sustainable healthy health-care system for Canadians.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMidmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRhbmRjLmV1L2VuL2FydGljbGUvdHJhZGl0aW9uYWwtbWVkaWNpbmUtb2Z0ZW4taW5hZGVxdWF0ZS10aG91Z2gtaXQtZG9lcy13b3JrLW1hbnktY2FzZXMtYW5kLWNvbXBhcmF0aXZlbHnSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Why many Africans must rely on informal health care,"Access to affordable modern health care remains a huge challenge in sub-Saharan Africa. Masses of people are too poor to afford treatment at hospitals. Most African countries spell out integrated universal health coverage as a goal. Unfortunately that goal still seems somewhat utopian in many places. Where government hospitals are supposed to provide services at heavily subsidised rates or even free of charge facilities tend to be overwhelmed. Indeed black markets have emerged as patients often have to pay bribes to get treatment at public health centres.

It matters very much that most Africans do not have any kind of health insurance (see Dirk Reinhard on www.dandc.eu). There is a great need to develop both private insurance and governmental social-protection schemes (see Markus Loewe on www.dandc.eu). So far however most health expenditures are paid out of pocket in Africa.

In the few African countries where national medical insurance schemes exist they serve only a minority according to the World Health Organization (WHO). In Ghana only a third of the population receives medical insurance under the country’s National Health Insurance Scheme. In Nigeria which has among the highest out-of-pocket health expenditures and the poorest health indicators in the world 75 % of health expenditures were paid out-of-pocket in 2016 according to the WHO.

While there is at least some access to scientifically trained doctors in cities things tend to be worse in rural areas. Most village communities rely entirely on traditional medicine and many urban people do so too. The practitioners are easily accessible and their services are comparatively cheap. However they sometimes fail to diagnose an illness properly or suggest treatments that do not work. Malperformance of this kind can lead to the loss of lives.

Age-old practices

Traditional medicine is also known as ethno-medicine folk medicine native healing or complementary and alternative medicine. It is based on millennia of – mostly orally transmitted – experience. Traditional healers are often quite competent when it comes to dealing with standard situations. Bone setters know how to deal with broken bones for instance and traditional midwives help women give birth. However they are not always able to deal with difficult situations. Caesarean sections for example are beyond their competence.

A comparative study in Nigeria showed that maternal and child mortality were higher for women who relied on traditional medicine in pregnancy and labour than for those who could afford professional care. Similar studies in Niger and South Africa yielded the same results.

Even faith healers often deliver results but apart from boosting a patient’s mental state their practices obviously have not scientifically explainable base. When traditional healers resort to practices with such a base however it would be good if they referred complicated cases to modern health centres. Unfortunately that only happens rarely. To a large extent modern and traditional medicine co-exist without much exchange between them.

What patients like about traditional medicine

According to research done in Malawi the traditional healers are not to blame for this state of affairs. “Traditional healers were more enthusiastic than biomedical practitioners who had several reservations about traditional healers and placed certain conditions on prospective collaboration” is a finding reported in a joint publication by Fanuel Lampiao Joseph Chisaka and Carol Clements (2019). While traditional healers clearly had confidence in modern practitioners’ competencies the reverse was not true.

The study confirmed that one reason traditional healers were so popular was that many live and work in villages so people need not travel long distances to see them. However they pointed out that costs and travelling distances were not all that mattered. The researchers found that traditional healers were considered to be more respectful and approachable than their scientifically trained counterparts. They estimated that 80 % of Malawi’s people seek treatment from traditional healers.

Far too often however traditional medicine is inadequate. In 2015 malaria tuberculosis and HIV-related illnesses killed about 1.6 million Africans according to the WHO. Timely access to appropriate and affordable medicines vaccines and other health services would have saved many of these lives. The full truth however is not only that many patients never saw a professional doctor but that even if they had done so they would have been unable to afford the prescribed medications. Over 98 % of the drugs consumed in Africa are produced outside the continent. They are quite expensive and counterfeit drugs are a problem in their own right (see Assane Diagne’s contribution of 2019 on www.dandc.eu).

The problem with herbal medications

Accordingly herbal medicine is one of the most important forms of traditional medicine. Once again it has its limits even though it often works. Serious issues include that:

dosage is difficult so both under- and over-dosage happen

sometimes the wrong plant is used and

contamination with toxic substances is common.

Efforts are being made to align traditional and modern medicine better. Over the past two decades the WHO has been providing financial resources and technical support to ensure safe and effective traditional medicine development in Africa. In a series of clinical trials 89 traditional products met international and national requirements for registration.

Fourteen countries have thus issued marketing authorisation for herbal medications. About half of these traditional products are now included in national lists of essential medicines. They play their part in treating diseases such as malaria opportunistic infections related to HIV diabetes sickle cell disease and hypertension.

Jean-Baptiste Nikiema is a WHO adviser who specialises in essential medicines. In his eyes two things are slowing down progress regarding the scientific approval of traditional medicine. One is political interference the other is researchers’ hesitancy to share insights for which intellectual-property protection is not available.

In most cases traditional medicine thus remains unregulated in Africa. It is thus not monitored by any institutions of oversight either. Patients deserve better.

(RNS/PCUSA/Danny Bolin)

A prominent mainline Christian denomination plans to divest from five oil companies it believes are not doing enough to address climate change. The vote to divest from Chevron Exxon Mobil Marathon Petroleum Phillips 66 and Valero Energy comes after years of debate in the Presbyterian Church (U.S.A.). On July 6 commissioners at the PCUSA's general assembly voted 340-41 to add those companies to the denomination's divestment list. They join 85 other companies on the list — most with ties to the military or the weapons industry. The move ""gives teeth to selective divestment"" said Aaron Ochart vice moderator of the Environmental Justice Committee who introduced the divestment recommendation to the general assembly which voted online. Since the 1980s Presbyterians have called for a move away from fossil fuels including oil. More recently they have debated whether to divest or to use their investments to pressure companies to change their ways. In 2016 and 2018 votes to divest failed in favor of more engagement. Rob Fohr director of faith-based investing and corporate engagement for the PCUSA said the church's ""Mission Responsibility Through Investment"" committee had hoped to see more change at the five oil companies. But their efforts at engagement failed to make progress he said.

""Divestment is never the goal"" he said in an email. ""Corporate change is the goal. MRTI determined after engagement with these five companies that continued engagement is not likely to yield meaningful change. Meanwhile the climate crisis is only increasing in urgency. We hope this divestment will be received as a clear signal that meaningful change is needed."" The next step in the process will be for the MRTI committee to compile a new version of the divestment list. That list will then be sent to the denomination's pension board and the Presbyterian Foundation for approval. Both groups have already said they will approve the new list said Fohr. During the discussion of the divestment recommendation Tom Taylor president of the Presbyterian Foundation was asked about the financial impact of divesting. He said the impact was ""impossible to know"" and would depend on future market conditions. He also said the foundation would act quickly to divest. ""As soon as possible we will get out of it"" he said. Commissioners who are made up of local Presbyterian church leaders also approved a recommendation to add seven other companies including three airlines for more direct engagement. Those companies are found on a list compiled by the environmental group Climate Action 100 according to the denomination's Environmental Justice Committee. Those commissioners also approved a proposal known as an overture to create a ""Presbyterian Tree Fund"" to purchase carbon offsets for work-related air travel by church staff as well as one titled ""Investing in a Green Future."" Last week a group of three dozen faith groups from seven countries announced they have divested from fossil fuels. The groups include five Church of England dioceses two Catholic dioceses in the United Kingdom 11 Catholic religious orders two Jesuit universities in the United States and the United Methodist Church in Ireland. Darren Dochuk author of ""Anointed With Oil"" a history of religion and the oil industry in the United States said faith groups in the past saw oil and other fossil fuels as a blessing. Some of the early oil tycoons such as the Pew family and Lyman Stewart who helped fund the fundamentalist movement were Presbyterians and many church institutions in the United States were funded by oil money. Divesting from fossil fuels Dochuk said is complicated both for denominations and for local congregations especially those in areas where the local economy depends on the fossil fuel industry.

""Today's generation probably doesn't realize that this is a relationship generations in the making"" he said. ""So to all of a sudden unravel it or disassemble it is complicated."" Fletcher Harper an Episcopal priest and executive director of GreenFaith an environmental group said the increasing threat of climate change makes divestment from fossil fuels a crucial priority for churches. In the past he said there were worries that doing so would cost churches money. That's no longer the case he said. ""The research has shown you can get out of oil and gas and perform as well as the market"" he said. Along with divesting he said faith groups can work with other activists to put pressure on financial companies to get out of investing in fossil fuels. That's the bigger goal he said.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUGh0dHBzOi8vY29ycGdvdi5sYXcuaGFydmFyZC5lZHUvMjAyMi8wNy8xNi9lc2ctZGlzY2xvc3VyZS10cmVuZHMtaW4tc2VjLWZpbGluZ3Mv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,ESG Disclosure Trends in SEC Filings,"The regulatory landscape for ESG disclosure by U.S. public companies faces potentially dramatic changes with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) proposing rules that would mandate comprehensive climate change disclosures and integrate key aspects of sustainability reporting with annual reports. Against this backdrop White & Case surveyed the SEC filings of 50 companies in the Fortune 100 to assess the latest trends in ESG disclosure.

Survey of ESG Disclosure—2020 to 2022

For its fourth annual survey of ESG disclosure in SEC filings the White & Case Public Company Advisory Group reviewed the annual meeting proxy statements and annual reports of 50 companies in the Fortune 100. In these 100 SEC filings we focused on 12 categories of ESG disclosure in annual reports and proxy statements filed with the SEC in 2020 2021 and 2022. The key trends and takeaways from our survey are discussed below.

Climate-Related Disclosure Takes the Spotlight in 2022

In the fall of 2021 ahead of Form 10-K filings the SEC issued a sample comment letter on climate disclosure and also issued bespoke comment letters to a number of companies questioning their materiality assessments with respect to climate disclosure. Climate-related disclosure significantly increased in both Form 10-K and proxy statement filings of the surveyed companies with many companies including such disclosure for the first time in 2022. Our survey focused on the ways climate disclosure changed year-over-year among the surveyed companies.

The Seven ESG Topics on the Rise in 2022

1. Environmental Matters

Overall for 2022 the largest increase in categories of ESG disclosure was with respect to environmental matters (up from third on the list in 2021) which covered a range of environmental topics including investments in sustainability recycling and renewable energy use. As shown in the chart below 89 of the 2022 filings surveyed increased their environmental disclosure compared to 35 of the 2021 filings and 29 of the 2020 filings.

Moreover every company surveyed (all 50 companies) included environmental disclosure in their 2022 filings. Of the 96 filings that included environmental disclosure in 2022:

Forty-eight companies (or 96%) included it in their Form 10-K (up from 37 in 2021 and 32 in 2020) and 48 companies (or 96%) in their proxy statement (the same number as in 2021 and up from 45 in 2020).

Thirty-seven filings (or 37%) included historical quantitative metrics (13 Form 10-Ks and 24 proxy statements) such as information on greenhouse gas (“GHG”) emissions reductions and renewable energy use.

Although the number of proxy statements that contained environmental disclosure has remained fairly constant environmental disclosures in Form 10-Ks have increased significantly over the past two years. The fact that every company surveyed included environmental disclosures either in their Form 10-K or in their proxy statement and that so many companies that already had robust environmental disclosure increased that disclosure in 2022 illustrates the significant focus on environmental issues in 2022.

Examples of new environmental disclosures included the following:

Investments in Environmental Sustainability for example: “Operate Sustainably. We have a long-standing and substantial commitment to sustainable business operations from the products and services we offer to our customers; to our store construction maintenance and operations; to our supply chain and packaging initiatives; to our ethical sourcing program. As we strive to operate sustainably we have focused on protecting the climate reducing our environmental impact and sourcing responsibly and we have set specific measurable goals to drive progress in these areas.” Renewable Energy for example: “The Climate Pledge is [the Company’s] commitment to be net-zero carbon by 2040 and we are on a path to powering our operations with 100% renewable energy by 2025. As the world’s largest corporate buyer of renewable energy [the Company] announced dozens of new renewable energy projects in 2021 and now has 274 projects globally. The Climate Pledge has been signed by [the Company] and over 300 other companies that commit to the same goals…Pledge signatories in total generate over $3.5 trillion in global annual revenues and have more than 8 million employees across 51 industries in 29 countries.” Climate Change Evaluation for example: “As part of our commitment to being good stewards of the environment we are working to understand quantify and reduce our impact on climate change. We understand that climate change poses risk and presents opportunities for our business to address such impacts in several ways. We recently undertook several actions to raise understanding about climate change and potential risks to our business including…[e]valuating potential enterprise risks associated with climate change [and] [d]isclosing our baseline scope 1 and scope 2 [GHG] emissions which we assessed in 2021 for calendar years 2019 and 2020. We are currently focused on calculating our scope 3 GHG emissions and in conjunction with our Value Creation Plan we are assessing energy usage and reduction opportunities and determining decarbonization goals.”

Spotlight on Climate-Related Disclosure

Overall 43 of the surveyed companies (or 86%) increased their climate-related disclosure in their 2022 Form 10-Ks and 35 companies (or 70%) increased this disclosure in their 2022 proxy statements. Seven companies (or 14%) addressed climate-related disclosure in their Form 10-K for the first time in 2022 and six companies (or 12%) addressed climate-related disclosure in their proxy statements for the first time in 2022.

Four of the surveyed companies received comments from the SEC in 2021 on climate-related disclosure. Two of the four companies agreed to additional risk factor and/or Management Discussion and Analysis (“MD&A”) disclosure. Many other surveyed companies included additional Form 10-K disclosure that appeared based on content to be directly influenced by the SEC’s sample comment letter.

Fifteen companies added entirely new risk factors devoted to climate-related impacts (including physical impacts of climate change transition risks to a low-carbon economy compliance costs related to new and disparate regulations and reputational risks) and 14 companies increased references to climate-related impacts in their existing risk factors.

For the surveyed companies references to climate-related impacts increased by seven mentions on average and five companies added new sections discussing ESG sustainability and climate change in their MD&A. Only two companies did not mention climate-related impacts in their 2022 Form 10-Ks and seven did not do so in their 2022 proxy statements.



The increase in climate-related risk factors is particularly notable. For example:

“Climate Change Could Have a Negative Impact on [the Company’s] Results of Operations and Financial Condition.… Climate change presents both immediate and long-term risks to [the Company] and [our] customers and clients with the risks expected to increase over time. Climate risks can arise from both physical risks (those risks related to the physical effects of climate change) and transition risks (risks related to regulatory and legal technological market and reputational changes from a transition to a low-carbon economy)…”

2. Human Capital Management (HCM)

In 2022 the second largest increase in ESG disclosures came in human capital management (“HCM”) down from first place in the prior three years.

As expected due to the SEC rule changes mandating human capital disclosure in the Form 10-K every company surveyed included some form of HCM disclosure in their Form 10-K and nearly all surveyed companies (96%) also included HCM disclosure in their annual meeting proxy statement. Eighty-six of the 2022 filings surveyed presented an increase in this type of disclosure from 2021 (up from 60 in 2021 and 35 in 2020) with 41 of these increases coming in the 10-K and 45 of these increases in the proxy statement. Increased disclosure included topics such as employee health and safety talent management and development employee engagement and pay equity.

Within HCM disclosures we also found a significant number of quantitative disclosures in both 2021 and 2022. In 2022 of the 98 filings that included disclosure on HCM 54 included current or historical quantitative metrics. These metrics included information on: (1) the percentage of employees who are women or people of color; (2) information on corporate initiatives to improve gender and ethnic diversity in their workforce; and (3) information on employee turnover and retention rates.

The below graphics represent the disclosure increases and the excerpts provide representative examples of the additional HCM disclosure:

Examples of new disclosures included the following:

On Employee Engagement for example: Associate engagement is the emotional commitment associates have to [the Company]. It is vital to our culture and to our success. We create an engaging workplace by continuously listening to and acting on associate feedback. We provide several pulse check surveys…that help us determine how emotionally connected those associates are to our customers the Company their jobs fellow associates and leaders. In addition our annual Voice of the Associate survey…serves as our primary means of gauging associates’ level of engagement within their roles. We use the feedback from these surveys to help improve the overall associate experience …We also maintain a digital associate engagement platform that links associates with common interests and fuels connections to co-workers and Company leaders.” On Talent Retention for example: “In 2021…our Employee Engagement Index an overall measure of employee satisfaction with the Corporation was 88%. Our turnover among employees was 12% in 2021 and 7% in 2020. Our pre-pandemic levels of turnover in 2019 and 2018 were 11% and 12%. Additionally [we] provide[] a variety of resources to help employees grow in their current roles and build new skills including resources to help employees find new opportunities re-skill and seek leadership positions…In 2021 more than 26000 employees found new roles within the Corporation.” On Pay Equity for example: Since 2019 we have achieved gender pay equity globally and we continue to maintain race/ethnicity pay equity in the US. We achieve pay equity by closing the gap in average pay between employees of different genders or race/ethnicity in the same or similar roles after accounting for legitimate business factors that can explain differences such as location time at grade level and tenure.” On Employee Wellness and Flexible Working for example: “Our offices and sites once again closed Company wide for one day in May 2021 to allow colleagues to recharge In 2021 in recognition of the new way of working we initiated [ Flex a hybrid model that empowers our office based employees to find the right productivity and balance of in person and remote work.”

Focus on Diversity Equity and Inclusion (“DEI”)

In 2022 all but one of the companies surveyed (49 out of 50) included disclosure on diversity or related initiatives at the company up from 43 in 2021 and 29 in 2020.

In 2022 most companies surveyed (44 out of 50) included this in both their Form 10-K and their proxy statement although the disclosures in the proxy statements were generally more robust and detailed.

On Employee Diversity Equity and Inclusion for example: Diversity Equity and Inclusion (DEI): Building a world where progress equitable outcomes diversity and inclusion can be realities is at the heart of what we do—from how we build our products to how we build our workforce. We have deepened our efforts to drive meaningful change but we know there is more to be done. We have a responsibility to continue scaling our DEI initiatives to ensure a workforce that is more representative of our users a workplace that creates a sense of belonging for everyone and to increase pathways to tech in the communities we call home…In 2020 we implemented a series of industry-leading principles and improvements that incorporated input from both employees and stockholders including the creation of a new DEI Advisory Council which comprises internal senior executives and external DEI experts. We have also heightened our focus on promoting racial equity including announcing in 2020 a series of racial equity commitments. We shared an update on our progress in 2021 and continue working to translate those efforts into lasting meaningful change.”

EEO-1 Data References. In 2022 36 companies (or 72%) included EEO-1 data or referenced the provision of such data in a separate report up from 16 (or 32%) in 2021. Thirty-two companies made this disclosure only in their proxy statement two only in their Form 10-K and six included the disclosure in both filings. The prevalence of this disclosure was largely the result of renewed investor pressure and focus on these disclosures. For example BlackRock called on companies to disclose their EEO-1 survey responses and starting in 2022 State Street adopted a policy to vote “against” the compensation committee chairs at companies that do not disclose their EEO-1 survey responses.

Representative examples of these disclosures include the following:

“We released our 2021 [DEI] Report in which we provide workforce diversity data (including our EEO-1 data) and explain how we are working to drive progress through our pillars of action: public policy workforce diversity community engagement and supplier diversity.” “As part of our Health for Humanity Report publication in June 2021 we publicly disclosed our U.S. Federal Employer Information Report EEO-1 and we annually publish the You Belong: Diversity Equity & Inclusion Impact Review (DEI Impact Review) which examines how the Company’s global DEI strategy has been a key driver of innovation and business outcomes since our founding over 130 years ago.”

3. E&S Goals and Targets

For the first time in White & Case’s annual survey E&S Goals and Targets made the top seven categories rising to the third spot with the largest increase in disclosure. This reflects the heightened focus by investors on companies setting specific targets with respect to environmental and social priorities.

Seventy-six of the filings surveyed (or 76%) increased their disclosure related to E&S goals and targets. In total all but one of the surveyed companies (49 out of 50) included some form of E&S goal or target. Of these 32 companies included the disclosure in their Form 10-K and 48 companies included it in their proxy statement. Of the 49 companies that included E&S goals and targets seven companies included them for the first time in their 2022 disclosures.

E&S goals and targets cover a range of topics including long term goals to reach net zero and shorter term goals to reduce GHG emissions by specified amounts.

Quantitative E&S Goals and Targets. Notably in addition to including qualitative goals and targets a significant number of companies included quantitative metrics in their E&S goals and targets. Forty-four companies (or 88%) included some form of quantitative metric in their E&S goals and targets disclosure—18 in their Form 10-K (up from 11 in 2021) and 42 in their proxy (up from 26 in 2021). This demonstrates a growing trend of companies that are disclosing quantifiable goals in their SEC filings and not just in sustainability reports or website disclosures which can be measured and tracked by investors.

Specifically:

GHG Emissions: Forty of the surveyed companies disclosed at least one specific goal relating to GHG emissions reduction on a given timeline. Twenty-three companies disclosed a specific net zero goal ten companies disclosed a carbon neutral goal 18 companies disclosed other specific emission reduction goals and one company disclosed a goal to be carbon negative. Several companies disclosed a combination of emissions goals.

Financial Commitment Towards ESG: Seventeen of the surveyed companies set forward-looking quantitative goals to commit a specified amount of funds over a specific timeline towards ESG initiatives such as diversity funds sustainable energy climate action and local community support.

Community Investment: Thirteen of the surveyed companies set goals to support local communities through a specific number of volunteer hours committed meals donated or people educated.

Renewable Energy: Nine of the surveyed companies set a quantitative goal to meet their energy needs with 100% renewable energy by a given timeline and four companies set a goal to source a specific percentage or amount of renewable energy by a given timeline. Four companies set other quantitative renewable energy or energy conservation goals such as achieving green certification for a certain percentage of their buildings or producing a certain amount of clean energy.

Examples of new disclosures included the following:

GHG Reductions Goals for example: “The Company’s environmental goals collectively called “Strive 35”—an ambitious plan to by 2035 reduce from a 2019 baseline absolute Scope 1 and 2 [GHG] emissions by 25 percent reduce absolute Scope 3 emissions by 25 percent reduce energy intensity by 15 percent reduce water intensity by 10 percent and achieve a 90 percent landfill diversion rate—are part of an aggressive plan to continue to reduce the [our] environmental footprint…In 2021 [we] added 5-year interim targets to ensure the Company stays on track to meet its 2035 goals. By 2025 the Company aims to reduce absolute GHG emissions by 1.5% reduce energy intensity and water intensity by 6% and 5% respectively and achieve 87% of its waste diverted from landfill.” Carbon Negative Goals for example: “In January 2020 we announced a bold commitment and detailed plan to be carbon negative by 2030 and to remove from the environment by 2050 all the carbon we have emitted since our founding in 1975.” Financial Commitments for example: “In April 2021 we committed $1 trillion to sustainable finance by 2030 which builds on the work we outlined in our updated Sustainable Progress Strategy. This commitment includes extending our prior five-year $250 billion environmental finance goal to $500 billion by 2030 through which we will finance and facilitate an array of climate solutions such as renewable energy energy efficiency sustainable transportation and circular economy and $500 billion in social finance including affordable housing diversity and equity economic inclusion food security and healthcare.” Employee Diversity Goals for example: “We set the following goals to change our workforce representation by 2030: (i) globally increase representation of women at the manager level and above to 48% (up from 40%); (ii) in the United States increase representation of African American and Black employees at the manager level and above to 11% (up from 5%); and (iii) in the United States increase representation of all other ethnically diverse groups at the manager level and above to 23% (up from 17%). To achieve these goals we will focus on attracting developing and retaining diverse talent from entry-level to senior leadership positions.”

4. Corporate Culture

Sixty-one of the 2022 filings surveyed increased their disclosure on corporate culture compared to 33 of the 2021 filings surveyed and 28 of the 2020 filings surveyed.

Overall 47 of the companies surveyed included disclosure on corporate culture in their 2022 filings compared to 44 companies in 2021 and 43 companies in 2020.

Examples of new disclosures included the following:

Core Values for example: “The [Company] has a strong commitment to ethics and integrity and we are a values- and culture-centric business. Our commitment to our core values drives our approach to human capital management. Our culture is based on our servant leadership philosophy represented by the inverted pyramid which puts primary importance on our customers and our associates by positioning them at the top with senior management at the base in a support role. We bring our culture to life through our core values which serve as the foundation of our business and the guiding principles behind the decisions we make every day.” Importance of Board in Shaping Culture for example: “Our Board and its committees play a key role in establishing and maintaining our culture setting the “tone at the top” and holding management accountable for its maintenance of high ethical standards and effective policies and practices to protect our reputation assets and business.”

5. Board Oversight of Environmental and Social Issues

Fifty-six of the filings surveyed increased their disclosure related to board oversight of E&S issues in 2022 compared to 27 filings in 2021 and 22 filings in 2020. Overall 47 companies included disclosure on board oversight of E&S issues in their 2022 filings.

Notably there has been an increasing trend of companies including this disclosure in their Form 10-Ks as well as their proxy statements. In 2022 16 companies included this disclosure in their Form 10-Ks up from eight in 2021 and one in 2020. Board oversight disclosures generally appeared in the business section of the surveyed companies’ Form 10-Ks.

Examples of new disclosures include the following:

ESG Committee or Function Reporting to the Board for example: “Our sustainability efforts are overseen by our Board of Directors in particular a dedicated Sustainability and Corporate Responsibility Committee and led by our Chief Sustainability Officer… The Sustainability and Corporate Responsibility Committee actively oversees our objectives goals strategies and activities relating to sustainability and corporate responsibility matters and assists the Board in ensuring that we operate as a sustainable organization and responsible corporate citizen in order to enhance shareholder value and protect [our] reputation.” Governance Committee Oversight of E&S for example: “The [NGC] is responsible for overseeing management of risks related to our environmental sustainability and corporate social responsibility practices including risks related to our operations and our supply chain.” Board Oversight of HCM in Form 10-K business section for example: “As we execute on the Company’s strategy in the coming years our focus on organizational performance and talent will remain front and center. We will continue to monitor various factors across our human capital priorities including as a part of our business operating reviews during the year and with oversight by our Board of Directors and the Board’s Management Development and Compensation Committee.” Specialized Board Committee Oversight of E&S Issues in Form 10-K business section for example: “Our Board of Directors and Board committees provide important oversight on certain human capital matters including items discussed at the Executive People Forum. The Compensation Talent and Culture Committee maintains responsibility to review discuss and set strategic direction for various people-related business strategies including: compensation and benefit programs; leadership succession planning; culture; [DEI]; and talent development programs. The Sustainability Innovation and Policy Committee is responsible for discussing and advising management on maintaining and improving sustainability strategies the implementation of which creates value consistent with the long-term preservation and enhancement of shareholder value and social wellbeing including human rights working conditions and responsible sourcing.”

Committee(s) with Oversight over ESG Matters.

Of the 50 surveyed companies:

Thirty companies (or 60%) disclosed that their Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee (“NGC”) oversaw some or all ESG Matters up from 12 in 2021 (a 150% increase). Of these 30 companies: three disclosed that ESG matters were solely or primarily overseen by the NGC while the other 27 companies disclosed that both the NCG and another committee had oversight over ESG matters.

Twenty-seven companies disclosed that their Compensation Committee (“CC”) oversaw some or all ESG Matters; of these 27 companies three disclosed that ESG matters were solely or primarily overseen by the CC while the other 24 companies disclosed that there was shared ESG oversight between both the CC and another committee.

Twenty-three companies disclosed that at least some ESG matters were overseen by a more specialized committee or committees such as a dedicated Sustainability Committee or a Public Responsibility Committee.

Fourteen companies disclosed that the audit committee had oversight over some ESG issues such as risks and exposures associated with civil and human rights and sustainability identifying ESG investment criteria and providing assurance of ESG disclosures. Additionally ten companies disclosed that the full board shared E&S oversight responsibilities with another committee.

It is interesting to note that 34 companies disclosed that they allocated responsibility for oversight of ESG issues to more than one committee (up from 21 in 2021) with six companies disclosing that they allocate responsibility to four committees and five companies disclosing allocation of ESG oversight to five committees. This increase in allocation of ESG oversight to more than one committee reflects the increasing role boards have in providing oversight of ESG issues and allows committees to narrow and deepen their focus on different facets of these issues. For example many companies disclosed that ESG issues were divided between committees that focused on human capital and social/public policy issues and those that focused on environmental and sustainability issues.

6. Social Impact and Community

The social impact and community category of ESG disclosure moved down from second to sixth on our list of increased ESG disclosure. Specifically 55 of the 2022 filings surveyed (or 55%) including 16 Form 10-Ks increased their disclosure related to social impact and community relations compared to 40 in 2021 (or 40%) and 21 in 2020 (or 21%).

Examples of new disclosures included the following:

Community Development and Engagement for example: “We are committed to creating value for our communities through economic development philanthropy volunteerism and advocacy and by operating our business in a socially and environmentally responsible way. The communities in which our assets are located and where our employees live are critical stakeholders. We consistently and regularly engage with our local communities and seek their feedback. Our refining operations have community advisory councils or panels that include both Company representatives and community members…Our pipeline business units have year-round community awareness education and listening panels to stay connected with those involved with and living near our extensive pipeline network.” Access to Technology for example: “Access to affordable and reliable internet service is critical for work learning and commerce—and for staying digitally connected to family friends news and information. Using our platform to address the digital divide is strategically important to [the Company] as it helps drive social change while expanding our network reach and deepening valuable collaboration with communities authorities and NGOs…In 2021 [the Company] announced a commitment to invest $2 billion over the next 3 years to help address the digital divide…As part of our $2 billion digital divide commitment we introduced [] Connected Learning a multi-year initiative led by our CSR organization to help stem the tide of learning loss further narrow the homework gap and empower today’s learners…Through the end of 2022 we’re launching more than 20 [] Connected Learning Centers in under-resourced neighborhoods facing barriers to connectivity—providing access to high-speed internet and computing devices as well as opportunities for tutoring and mentorship through our employee-driven [Company] volunteerism initiative.”

7. E&S Issues in Shareholder Engagements

Forty companies increased their disclosure related to ESG issues included in their shareholder engagements in their 2022 proxy statements up from 21 in both 2021 and 2020. Overall 48 companies disclosed that ESG issues were included in their shareholder engagements in their 2022 proxy statements up from 45 in 2021 and 40 in 2020.

Examples of new disclosures included the following:

Responsiveness to Shareholder Feedback (in 21 of the 45 filings). For example: “Our Board believes that solicitation and consideration of shareholder feedback is critical to driving long-term growth and creating shareholder value. Our shareholder engagement program is a robust year-round process encompassing meetings held throughout the year with shareholders during which we encourage ongoing meaningful dialogue about the issues they find most important…Our Board reviews our annual meeting results ongoing shareholder feedback and corporate governance and compensation trends to help drive and develop our shareholder engagement priorities…We respond to shareholder feedback by enhancing our policies practices and disclosures informed by ongoing dialogue with our shareholders and communicate important updates and enhancements made during the fiscal year in our proxy statement.” Mention of Specific E&S Issues Discussed for example: “Recent Board discussions have addressed shareholder feedback on a variety of topics including Board refreshment shareholder proposals executive compensation sustainability and human capital management and political advocacy often resulting in changes to our policies and practices as well as guiding the focus of future discussions in the boardroom…We also fulfilled our commitment to publish our first Sustainability Report and publicly disclosed our workplace diversity data including our consolidated EEO-1 report. Recognizing the continued importance of transparency on political advocacy we strengthened our website disclosures to provide additional detail regarding the Board and Governance & Public Policy Committee’s enhanced oversight role information on our direct lobbying activities and our political contributions guidelines and political action committee processes and oversight.”

Reporting Frameworks: SASB TCFD and Others

The 2022 SEC filings revealed a continuing trend of more companies disclosing the use of reporting frameworks. In 2022 38 of the surveyed companies disclosed in their SEC filings that their sustainability reports posted on their website follow or align with specific reporting frameworks a significant increase from 26 in 2021 11 in 2020 and just one company in 2019.

In general companies are trending towards disclosing the use of more than one framework. In 2022 five companies reported using only one framework whereas 33 companies reported using at least two or more frameworks (compared to 16 companies using two or more frameworks in 2021). In 2022 of the 38 surveyed companies that disclosed their use of frameworks:

Twenty-five surveyed companies disclosed that they align their sustainability reporting with both Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (“SASB”) standards and Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (“TCFD”) frameworks (compared to 13 in 2021).

Eight companies only referenced SASB standards or SASB plus another non-TCFD standard (compared to 5 in 2021) and four companies only referenced TCFD or TCFD plus another non-SASB standard (compared to eight in 2021).

Eighteen of the 38 companies in 2022 disclosed that they aligned with Global Reporting Initiative (“GRI”) standards (compared to six in 2021) with one company exclusively using the GRI standards.

Companies also disclosed that they use other reporting frameworks such as CDP (formerly known as The Climate Disclosure Project) (five companies) the UN Guiding Principles Reporting Framework (two companies) the UN Sustainable Development Goals (three companies) and the UN Global Compact (one company).

Companies continue to make these disclosures referencing the reporting frameworks that they use primarily in their proxy statements. In 2022 only one company disclosed its reporting frameworks solely in its Form 10-K whereas six companies made this disclosure in both their Form 10-K and proxy statements and 31 companies made this disclosure exclusively in their proxy statement.

The significant increase in disclosure regarding use of these reporting frameworks echoes the calls from the investor community including BlackRock which has asked the public companies it invests in to (i) “disclose the identification assessment management and oversight of sustainability-related risks in accordance with the four pillars of TCFD” and (ii) “publish investor-relevant industry-specific material metrics and rigorous targets aligned with SASB or comparable sustainability reporting standards.”

Examples of new disclosures included the following:

Disclosed following TCFD for example: “In our most recent Task Force for Climate Change-related Financial Disclosure (TCFD)-aligned report issued in October 2021 we described our GHG intensity targets for oil gas flaring and methane for 2028.” Disclosed following more than one standard for example: “[The Company] participates in the CDP’s climate forestry and water security questionnaires to benchmark and quantify our environmental practices to provide transparency on our progress and assist in the reduction of our contributions to climate change. We continue to align our sustainability reporting with the appropriate [SASB] standards for our industry the [GRI] and the UN Sustainable Development Goals (“SDGs”). We also published our first [TCFD] report in 2021 to assess our climate-related risks and opportunities and better understand the potential impacts on our value chain.” Disclosed following more than one standard for example: “We are committed to transparency around our carbon footprint and climate risk and use the framework developed by the TCFD to inform our disclosure on climate governance strategy risk management and metrics and targets…Our Corporate Responsibility Report also includes a mapping of our disclosure to the TCFD the [SASB] framework and our CDP Climate Change Survey all of which are available on our website.”

Three Key Take-Aways

Given these disclosure trends and influences when contemplating any ESG disclosure in connection with SEC filings public reporting companies should consider the following key takeaways:

1. ESG: What’s In and What’s Out of SEC Filings

Based on our survey the top ESG topics for 2022 SEC filings were:

Environmental disclosure with a focus on climate change which moved up from third to first in 2022;

Human capital management with a focus on diversity and inclusion; and

E&S targets and goals which made the top seven list for the first time since our survey began in 2019.

These top categories for increase reflect the key areas of corporate SEC and investor focus this year for the surveyed companies.

2. A Renewed Focus on ESG for Form 10-Ks

Even ahead of the SEC’s adoption of any new climate rules in-house teams should take note of the growing trend of providing ESG disclosure in annual reports on Form 10-Ks. The results of our survey demonstrate a re-focus and movement towards the Form 10-K for enhanced ESG disclosures. For example 15 of the surveyed companies added entirely new risk factors devoted to climate change impacts and more broadly environmental disclosures in Form 10-Ks have increased significantly over the past two years while remaining fairly constant in proxy statements.

This increase in Form 10-K disclosure particularly on the environment came on the heels of the September 2021 sample letter on climate disclosure. As a result of this growing trend companies should zero in on their (1) materiality assessments for climate change (2) their approach towards differentiating their Form 10-K from sustainability reports and (3) enhancing their controls on ESG disclosure. More specifically:

Confirm Your Materiality Assessments . In terms of the materiality assessments companies should continue to consider the SEC’s 2010 climate change disclosure guidance12 and the recent comment letters from Corp Fin on companies’ climate disclosure. SEC comments to date on climate disclosure initially asked questions focusing on a company’s materiality analysis and then requested additional details on the company’s determination that disclosure of climate change matters was not necessary because the climate change matters were not material. In some cases the follow-up comments requested that companies provide quantitative information to support their materiality determinations.

In some cases the follow-up comments requested that companies provide quantitative information to support their materiality determinations. Differentiate ESG for Your Form 10-K and Sustainability Report . With respect to sustainability reporting it is important to note the growing SEC scrutiny of the divide between the content of SEC filings and sustainability reports. One of the SEC sample comments asked companies to advise the SEC of “what consideration” a company “gave to providing the same type of climate-related disclosure in your SEC filings as you provided in your CSR report.” Although companies have largely continued to provide the vast majority of their ESG disclosure on corporate websites in sustainability reports as opposed to their Form 10-Ks the rationale for this divide is being called into question by both the SEC comments and proposed rule changes on climate.

Enhance Your Controls on ESG. Following from these two points it is crucial to confirm whether (a) any ESG disclosures (whether they be on website sustainability reports or communicated to investors underwriters or banks) may be material and therefore required to be included in a Form 10-K and (b) sufficient controls are in place to ensure their accuracy and enable the information to be covered by Sarbanes Oxley certifications signed by CEOs and CFOs and filed with the SEC.

3. Focus on Next Steps in Light of ESG Trends and Proposed SEC Disclosure Rules on Climate

As the deadline passes for comments on the SEC’s rule proposal on climate change disclosure the SEC will determine the fate of ESG disclosures in SEC filings particularly the Form 10-K. In the meantime companies will need to:

First prepare to update your company’s ESG disclosure on a holistic basis for future reports—across your sustainability report proxy statement and your Form 10-K—as if the new SEC rules will not yet be in effect next year. Companies should begin considering their ESG disclosure on particular topics (for example human capital and climate) on a holistic basis across all of their disclosure documents to ensure consistency appropriate vetting of the accuracy of the disclosures and consistent messaging to investors. Second carefully scrutinize any proposed expansion of your ESG disclosures at this time and make sure they undergo a comprehensive legal review. It is crucial that companies take a hard look at any new proposed ESG disclosures at this time and conduct a thorough legal assessment of the implications of making any such new disclosures. In particular a company should consider in detail how the proposed rules (if adopted as proposed) would impact any such new disclosure particularly as it relates to new E&S targets or goals and transition plans. Third take steps to prepare for the proposed SEC climate rules now as if they will be adopted substantially as proposed. Companies should establish a working group (including legal financial reporting sustainability IR and communications) and begin their assessment of what steps would need to be taken in order to comply with the new climate change disclosure requirements if the proposed rules are adopted substantially as proposed. This includes creating a plan to tackle those elements of the proposed rules that will be the most challenging for companies to comply with and require the most lead time to implement. Last but not least….remember the key word here: Controls controls and more effective controls. Regardless of whether companies include enhanced ESG disclosure in their next Form 10-Ks in light of the enhanced SEC scrutiny and trends on the horizon companies should treat this disclosure as if it were subject to their disclosure controls and procedures under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. This means establishing the same rigor of controls for such disclosure such as completing a sub-certification process and disclosure committee oversight to appropriately vet and confirm the accuracy of required disclosures.

Aunque la camioneta Bronco se presentó hace un año sus altas ventas muestran cómo un vehículo popular puede aumentar las ventas en función de la enorme demanda del público. Ford vendió 915820 vehículos desde hace un año.

Ford vendió cinco generaciones de Broncos desde 1965 hasta 1996. Eso hace que el modelo sea tan antiguo como el Mustang el auto deportivo insignia de Ford.

Ford decidió volver a vender el modelo Bronco el año pasado para continuar expandiendo su exitosa categoría de autos crossover/SUV.

El primer modelo Bronco estuvo disponible en julio del año pasado.

Como la mayoría de los vehículos de gran éxito la camioneta viene en varios modelos. Los básicos son los modelos Bronco Sport. Su punto de precio más bajo es de $28815 dólares. El segundo modelo tiene un precio mínimo de $31300 dólares.

El precio del modelo Bronco Raptor es de $68500. Aunque su precio podría subir todavía más hasta casi $75000 dólares si se le añaden accesorios extra.

Aunque es difícil saber exactamente por qué al modelo Bronco le ha ido tan bien se dice que es porque los medios de comunicación han ayudado a impulsar las ventas además de que es uno de los modelos heredados más conocidos de Ford. Asimismo este automóvil entra a un mercado en el que la demanda de crossovers y SUV es extraordinariamente alta.

El delantero colombiano dejó Junior y arribó al fútbol argentino para reemplazar a Julián Álvarez como el ‘9′ de Marcelo Gallardo.

El atacante ya suma varios entrenamientos con el equipo de Núñez y todo indica que debutaría el próximo jueves ante Gimnasia por la Liga Profesional de Argentina recordando que quedó fuera de la convocatoria para el duelo con Vélez. “La confianza que me tiene Gallardo es muy grande” dijo antes de partir rumbo a Argentina.

La llegada de Borja a River se cerró por 6.7 millones de euros una cifra que lo ubica entre los 10 mejores traspasos del FPC. Según el portal especializado en fichajes Transfermarkt es la cuarta venta más cara en la historia de la liga colombiana.

El ranking lo lidera el propio Borja pero por su transferencia de Atlético Nacional a Palmeiras en 2017 por 12 millones de euros. La salida de Luis Díaz de Junior a Porto (7.2 M€) y la de Harold Preciado de Deportivo Cali al Shenzhen (7 M€) completan el podio.

En el top 10 también aparecen traspasos de otros jugadores con pasado o presente en Selección Colombia como Marlos Moreno y Matheus Uribe entre otros. Cuatro de las mayores ventas han sido al fútbol europeo.

El clima festivo en el que este viernes concluyeron la operación el presidente Herbert Hainer el director general Oliver Kahn el director deportivo Hasan Salihamidzic y el entrenador Julian Nagelsmann se correspondió con las expectativas superadas por la venta de un jugador de 34 años al que no querían. Según fuentes próximas al cuerpo técnico y la dirección tras la eliminación de la Champions en cuartos de final contra el Villarreal el 22 de abril el club resolvió ofrecer al polaco la carta de libertad si no aceptaba renovar por una temporada más el contrato que vencía en 2023.

El repentino interés que mostró el Barça en mayo —el club catalán fue el único que formalizó una oferta— desembocó en una gran inyección financiera. Si desde el Barça se indica de forma extraoficial que la adquisición costará 50 millones desde el Bayern y bajo condición de anonimato aseguran que el traspaso se cerró por un total de 60 millones de euros: 45 fijos cinco si el Barça se clasifica para la Champions en las próximas temporadas y diez más si el jugador cumple su primer año de contrato como culé. “El Barça insistió en que llegará a 60 millones si antes el Bayern anuncia públicamente que vende por 50″ dice un agente que participó en la compraventa. “Así quieren aliviar el impacto mediático”

“Sabemos muy bien lo que le debemos a Robert” dijo Khan en el comunicado que oficializó la salida; “pero grandes jugadores han dejado el Bayern en el pasado y nuestro mundo no solo no se vino abajo sino que por el contrario a menudo tuvimos más éxito”.

El propio Khan presidió la reunión que mantuvo la directiva con Nagelsmann en febrero cuando el entrenador presentó su primera gran auditoría sobre el estado de un equipo que daba muestras de agotamiento. Sugirió una regeneración en puestos clave. A la cabeza de la lista de bajas situó al polaco. Autor de 277 goles en 275 partidos Lewandowski goza del prestigio que le confiere ser el futbolista más anotador de las grandes ligas europeas desde 2016. Pero el técnico argumentó su obsolescencia explicando que con 34 años tanto su despliegue físico como su ambición habían remitido en un contexto general que se volvía en su contra. Lewandowski dijo pertenecía a una especie la de los nueves de área que el fútbol contemporáneo condenaba a la extinción en equipos que como el Bayern pretendiesen monopolizar el control del balón.

“Llevamos diez Bundesligas seguidas” dijo Nagelsmann según un empleado del club; “pero si queréis que el Bayern sea competitivo en la Champions necesitamos un nueve que no solo se limite a rematar sino que tenga un efecto amplificador sobre el juego colectivo en el último tercio del campo”.

92 millones brutos en cuatro años

Nagelsmann sostuvo que los viejos nueves oportunistas como Lewandowski —o como Luka Jovic— destacaron en la Bundesliga gracias dos factores. Primero un predominante ida y vuelta de continuas transiciones que conducían los partidos hacia el desorden; segundo los criterios de los clubes en la selección de los centrales que ponían el énfasis en su estatura para el juego aéreo antes que su agilidad y su velocidad para la anticipación. Puesto en ese escenario Lewandowski destacó pero el fútbol y esto se apreciaba en las altas instancias de la Champions apuntaba a cambios inexorables. Las defensas se coordinarían cada día mejor. Si el Bayern pretendía dominar a sus rivales en campo contrario y sin espacios frente a defensas cerradas con centrales atentos un delantero que buscara más el choque que del desmarque se convertiría en un tapón. Nagelsmann expuso que si el Bayern producía diez ocasiones de gol Lewandowski remataría siete; pero que si conseguía reformular el ataque sin él el equipo gestaría 20 ocasiones cuyo remate se repartirían los tres atacantes y los dos volantes. Sus nueves ideales en este esquema eran Erling Haaland Sadio Mané y Roberto Firmino a los que conocía de su paso por el Hoffenheim y los clubes de la compañía Red Bull.

Aturdidos ante la exposición Khan y Salihamidzic comenzaron a examinar a Lewandowski en cada partido. La conclusión tras el doble duelo con el Villarreal fue tajante: Nagelsmann tenía razón. En marzo el Bayern procuró contratar a Haaland sin éxito al tiempo que ofrecía un solo año de renovación a Lewandowski que captó la indirecta como una invitación a que se marchara. Cuando el Barça apareció en el horizonte los directivos del Bayern llevaban semanas de acuerdo en una cosa: Lewandowski profesional intachable y productivo al que habían fichado libre en 2014 merecía que le dejaran en libertad sin pedir prima de traspaso. Solo eso supondría que el club se ahorraría los 60 millones que le restaban del pago de su salario hasta 2023. Resuelto a irse el polaco le confesó en el vestuario que su objetivo no era ganar más dinero. Su mujer Anna quería vivir en un país meridional y el Barça le ofrecía cuatro temporadas a razón de 23 millones de euros brutos anuales por debajo de los 28 anuales que ganaba en Múnich.

Dicen en el Bayern que si no vendieron a Lewandowski en junio fue por un error en la estrategia del Barça. Las declaraciones del jugador al acabar la temporada en mayo diciendo que no volvería a entrenarse con el Bayern fueron percibidas como un chantaje intolerable. Uli Hoeness el presidente honorífico opinó que no se podía trasladar a la plantilla la idea de que cualquier acto de rebeldía rendiría frutos ante un club débil. Hoeness también comentó entre sus directivos que tenía la convicción de que el Barça acabaría pagando lo que pidieran ya que Laporta era el verdadero interesado y no Xavi Hernández. Durante días el Bayern fingió desinterés y prepotencia. Nunca respondió a la primera oferta del Barça de 45 millones más cinco por objetivos y obligó al delantero a presentarse en Sabener Strasse haciendo acto de contrición. Luego fue el propio Bayern el que desatascó la negociación cuando un alto cargo se dirigió a Lewandowski el lunes pasado para advertirle de que el Barça ficharía a Raphinha por 70 millones. Si de verdad le querían debía presionar a su agente Pini Zahavi.

Harry Kane una idea tomada de Xavi

El pasado miércoles cuando el Barça hizo oficial el fichaje de Raphihna Lewandowski le dijo a Zahavi que buscara otro club de inmediato. Zahavi habló con Joan Laporta el presidente del Barça y horas después se desató el frenesí en las oficinas del Bayern en donde comenzaron a recibir ofertas al alza. A Kahn y a Hoeness no les sorprendió. Los alemanes siempre supieron que el interés del Barça acabaría convirtiéndose en un negocio rentable para el Bayern desde que Laporta mantiene con Pini Zahavi una relación que en el Bayern creen que tuvo carácter societario aunque Laporta desmintió este extremo en reiteradas ocasiones.

Ahora Nagelsmann asegura entre sus colaboradores que Xavi tiene ante sí una tarea “colosal”. El técnico observa que su colega catalán encontrará graves dificultades en adaptar a Lewandowski al juego elaborado del Barcelona en un concierto de defensas tan bien organizadas como el de la Liga. El fichaje a su entender no es un deseo de Xavi. Hace cosa de dos meses un amigo común le confesó que las prioridades de Xavi uno de los responsables de la salida de Ibrahimovic del Barça en 2012 no pasaban por fichar un tanque como Lewandowski sino por recuperar a Messi intentar reclutar a Gabriel Jesús o incluso convencer a Harry Kane de dejar el Tottenham si no lograba clasificarse para la Champions como finalmente sucedió. Esta información iluminó a Nagelsmann. Desde hace semanas el entrenador intenta convencer a los dirigentes del Bayern de que intenten algo que parece imposible: contratar a Kane a su entender el nueve más asociativo que existe. El más capacitado en el mundo para generar situaciones de peligro para sí mismo y para sus compañeros. El opuesto de Lewandowski.

Special to USA TODAY

The consumer price index a measurement of everyday goods and services related to the cost of living skyrocketed to a new multi-decade high of 9.1% in the year up to June according to fresh data published by the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics.

This translates to spending more on everything from gasoline and groceries to rent and clothing.

As such many are looking for ways to stretch their dollar further says Danetha Doe an economist Webby Award-winning TV host and author of the Money & Mimosas personal finance site. “The current high inflation rates combined with the long-standing stagnant wages are driving folks to figure out ways to make their money last longer.”

“My biggest tip is to electronically track your spending on a weekly basis” Doe continues in an interview with USA TODAY.

“I call this a ‘money date’"" she says ""and I recommend using any personal finance app to stay on top of your week’s transactions [as] most folks are not aware of how much money they spend on a weekly basis.”

Americans aren’t just spending more on fuel food and apparel but services too such as electricity costs at home video streaming platforms and healthcare costs including rising dental services.

(No wonder Google says there's been a spike for searched words like “cheap” and affordable” over the past few months.)

Ways to save on mobile phone services

Considering 85% of Americans now own a smartphone according to Pew Research Center there are ways you can shave your monthly carrier costs too.

In fact there are many. Here are a half-dozen suggestions.

Look for ‘perks’: “If you’ve had the same plan for a year or more research the latest to see if a new plan can save on things you already pay for” suggests Nina Bibby senior vice president of Verizon's consumer segment marketing. These include bonus “perks” such as getting free Disney+ Hulu and ESPN+ streaming services for six months. It doesn’t hurt to ask your carrier what they offer so you don’t spend money on a service you could be getting for free.

Eligible discounts: Contact your carrier to inquire about discounts you may be eligible for. Seniors (including AARP members) often pay less for mobile phone plans along with reduced rates for active-duty military and veterans first responders nurses and teachers. In other words be sure to contact – and press – your carrier for the best monthly price they can give you for calls texts and 5G data (based on your needs).

Family plans and bundles: You can save on these services if there are multiple family members with the same carrier so inquire about group discounts. That is there should be an incentive to commit to more than one line under the same plan. On a related note you can save by bundling with home services if your carrier offers them such as home internet and/or television. These services should be less when packaged together than paying for them individually.

Trade-ins BOGOs: If you’re in the market for a new phone don’t toss your old one in a drawer (thinking you will use it again one day) as many carriers let you trade it in and put the value towards a new device. Unless you want to hand it down to someone get a discount on a new device by giving in your old one (and be sure to perform a factory reset first) or sell it first to a service like Decluttr or Gazelle. Carriers sometimes have a “buy one get one” deal for new or existing customers or a “free phone” promo for signing up but review the conditions of that contact ahead of time.

Change plans: On a related note you might not be aware of promotions and new plans offered by your carrier where you can get more (such as unlimited data) or pay less per month or both. Often we get complacent with our monthly services or too busy to see if there’s something better but it pays to stay on top of what’s new. “The best tip is to never settle. Everyone deserves a network they can rely on at a price they can afford” Bibby tells USA TODAY.

AutoPay paperless statements: Many carriers will give you a discount if you set up AutoPay which means your account will be charged automatically every month (instead of you forgetting to pay). It may not be much but it’s worth looking into (but make a note on your calendar on the day the charge comes out of your bank account or applied to your credit card). Some carriers will also give you a discount to opt for paperless billing which saves them money on printing and postage.

5G nomenclature is already a rather complex and winding topic and it’s received yet another layer of convolution with the introduction of C-Band 5G. The term made headlines in early 2022 when AT&T and Verizon added support for C-Band 5G to their networks. But don’t fret it’s thankfully not a whole other standard to get familiar with. Instead this latest term simply refers to the introduction of more frequency bands into the already broad spectrum landscape.

Put simply C-Band 5G allows carriers to increase their spectrum diversity through the use of mid-band frequencies. This allows them to deliver faster speeds and better coverage to their customers or at least those that own compatible smartphones. The term covers an important piece of spectrum for carriers aiming to provide median 5G speeds in excess of 100Mbps rather than just peak speeds. Read more: What is 5G and what can we expect from it?

If you’re eager to learn a little bit more about what is C-Band 5G and where is it available then read on for Android Authority’s complete guide on the topic.

C-Band 5G: Everything you need to know

You may already be familiar with 5G spectrum terms like mmWave and sub-6GHz which define a range of network frequencies and bands used by carriers to send and receive 5G data. C-Band is another one of those terms although it’s most typically associated with US network deployments.

More specifically C-Band refers to radio frequency bands between 4 and 8GHz according to the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) — although in the case of the US the FCC designates the range as between 3.7 and 4.2GHz. Technically that’s already classed as a sub-6GHz spectrum and the International Telecommunication Union (ITU) has divided up C-band into the n77 (3.7GHz) n78 (3.5GHz) and n79 (4.7GHz) bands you’ll find in use around the world right now. So you could already be reading this on a C-Band 5G connection.

C-Band occupies a frequency sweet spot in terms of broad coverage and fast speeds.

The term has a slightly different connotation in the US where the spectrum was previously allocated for satellite TV back in the 1970s. In 2020 the FCC announced that it would reallocate much of this spectrum for 5G use. The subsequent auctions around the 3.7GHz band ended in February 2021 and raised $81 billion with the majority of band licenses grabbed by AT&T and Verizon.

C-Band 5G is so popular because it occupies a frequency sweet spot in terms of wide coverage and fast speeds. You may have noticed that the FFC’s definition falls right between the popular 2.4 and 5GHz Wi-Fi bands. If you’ve been following sub-6GHz deployment you’ll know that these frequencies form the backbone of 5G coverage as they offer many benefits (including better range) compared to mmWave making them well suited for rural as well as urban coverage.

The similar benefits of C-Band explain why AT&T and Verizon — two carriers that previously focused heavily on mmWave deployment — are now particularly interested in these bands. Data from the speed test behemoth Ookla highlights that T-Mobile is way ahead in median 5G network speeds owing to its superior sub-6GHz coverage.

Where is C-Band 5G available?

Edgar Cervantes / Android Authority

As previously mentioned the global 5G spectrum that could be classed as C-Band is already widely in use around the world. Specifically bands n77 n78 and n79 are up and running across Australia China the European Union (including the United Kingdom) Hong Kong Isreal Japan New Zealand the Philippines Singapore South Korea and more.

By comparison the US situation is in the much earlier stages owing to delayed licensing and aviation disputes which we’ll get to in a minute. Verizon flipped on its C-Band 5G switch on January 19 2022. The carrier has yet to provide a coverage map for these latest frequencies but wants to bring its 5G Ultra Wideband service to 1700 cities by the end of January. Customers will see a “5G UW” or “5G UWB” icon when connected to this part of its network.

AT&T also activated its C-Band service on the same date with Austin Dallas-Fort Worth Houston Chicago Detroit Jacksonville Orlando and South Florida covered in the initial rollout. AT&T devices will display a 5G+ indicator when connected.

It’s worth noting that AT&T and Verizon have voluntarily agreed to limit C-Band 5G deployment in the vicinity of airports until July 2023 owing to an ongoing dispute over whether the technology interferes with aircraft radio altimeters. The FCC is testing and certifying flight altimeters to check for C-Band interference and has a 220MHz “guard band” already in effect. The airport argument appears to be easing off but time will tell if these efforts are enough to appease the airlines. Other countries have similar restrictions on C-Band use near airports. Fortunately other 5G frequencies can still be used in and around airports so your coverage shouldn’t drop out.

Although AT&T and Verizon may have pinched the most recent headlines they’re not the only US carriers with C-Band and similar sub-6GHz frequencies at their disposal. T-Mobile purchased an average of 40MHz of C-Band which it plans to deploy to over 225 million people. Not forgetting it already snapped up Sprint’s 2.5GHz (n41) mid-band spectrum in the merger which serves a similar widespread coverage purpose to C-Band. Minor carriers that piggyback on AT&T and Verizon networks such as Visible will also benefit from C-Band coverage. See also: 5G plans in the US — What are your options?

Does my phone support C-Band 5G?

Dhruv Bhutani / Android Authority

As C-Band 5G already falls under well-defined sub-6GHz bands many existing 5G phones already support the required technologies. Below is by no means a complete list of popular phones that feature the necessary bands and do note that some carrier requirements may vary especially when bringing your own handset.

“Running Up That Hill” the analyst titled his July 12 report referencing the singer’s 1985 track that appeared in Stranger Things season four and then topped charts globally this summer. Like his peers and management Swinburne predicts a second quarter in a row of subscriber losses with Netflix’s 221.6 million global figure likely shrinking. The expert expects Netflix to stay “consistent with global paid net adds guidance (-2 million) but we see potential downside risks from mobile app download trends and we trim our third-quarter net adds (+1.55 million versus prior +2 million) to factor in elevated churn following the release of Stranger Things season 4.” Swinburne also cut his 2023 subscriber growth forecast from 9.3 million to 7.9 million and his price target from $300 to $220 but kept his “equal weight” rating on the stock.

More from The Hollywood Reporter

Addressing rising inflation and talk of a recession in more detail Swinburne predicted both could hit Netflix. “Streaming video revenues may prove more vulnerable than expected to a global recession and lower consumer spending levels” he argued. “While Netflix’s leading engagement should help it retain customers its relative price premium is likely an offset as consumers look to trim their streaming bill.”

But the Morgan Stanley expert also touted the streamer’s planned rollout of a cheaper advertising-supported subscription tier. “Tapping into the $160 billion global video advertising spending opportunity in the long term should allow Netflix to drive average revenue per user (ARPU) growth with less reliance on consumer price increases” Swinburne wrote. The analyst concluded by noting that the way investors view Netflix will change over time: “Net adds matter to shares but longer-term ARPU growth expectations matter more.” After all in the past “the majority of Netflix revenue growth came from net adds or customer growth. As the business matures ARPU is shifting from a secondary to a primary driver.” That is why he expects Netflix “to continue to prioritize ARPU growth including continuing to raise prices.”

In a July 12 report Benchmark analyst Matthew Harrigan similarly highlighted: “Tapping into the $160 billion global video advertising spending opportunity in the long term should allow Netflix to drive ARPU growth with less reliance on consumer price increases. In markets with high ad ARPUs like the U.S. Netflix can offer a materially lower priced offering and unlock additional net adds without sacrificing unit economics. Advertising may also prove a consumer-friendly way to monetize password sharing.” Harrigan also noted the changes that the AVOD push could bring to Netflix’s culture. “Departing from its DNA Netflix will also have to divulge full viewing information to satisfy ad market transparency and 3rd-party auditing demands” he argued.

Wells Fargo analyst Steven Cahall in a July 13 report noted that his team’s analysis of monthly active users data implies a second-quarter net subscriber drop of only 1 million. But he stuck to his 2 million decline forecast in line with management guidance. “The main driver of our unchanged estimates is low conviction as we think the historically correlated metrics are less relevant at present for Netflix which appears to be experiencing a new phase of customer churn” he explained. “As such prior correlations are proving less reliable and we do not believe there is sufficient evidence to imply a bullish call into earnings.” And he highlighted: “We also have a downside bias on second-half estimates including sub growth pressure and a foreign exchange headwind to financials.”

So what should investors expect from Netflix in terms of subscriber forecasts for the current quarter? “We sense low conviction across the Street so this is another wait and see quarter with investors likely resetting afterwards” Cahall wrote.

Bank of America analyst Nat Schindler in a June 23 report reiterated his “underperform” rating on Netflix but cut his price target from $240 to $196 “given current market conditions rising costs of content production in addition to several potential costly initiatives.” Schindler added: “Overall while our survey indicates Netflix is currently consumers’ top choice we believe our results are indicative that streaming has very quickly become a commoditized product following the pandemic with original content being a key differentiating factor for a user to subscribe to the service.”

The domestic subscription run-up for Netflix “seems to be at or very near its peak” the Bank of America analyst argued. “The availability of more services in addition to more compelling competitor value propositions have led customers to subscribe to more services on the whole while still keeping Netflix. If a recession were to take hold however it wouldn’t be surprising to see incremental churn.”

Near-term it remains all about sub trends after all. Cowen analyst John Blackledge highlighted as much in his earnings preview which had this takeaway: “Net-net we expect investors will remain focused on net sub trajectory at the (earnings report) as well as third-quarter guide.” He forecasts a paid net decline of 2 million users “given macro competition and password sharing.” But he slightly raised his 2023 net adds projection due to the upcoming ad tier.

“Netflix shares are down 46 percent since first-quarter earnings on 4/19 (and down 69 percent year-to-date) with the pullback reflecting the broader trend among tech sector shares as well as Netflix-specific challenges (high existing penetration in some markets along with password sharing increased competition and macro issues)” Blackledge highlighted. “Meanwhile the stock pullback has led to more attractive valuation in our view ahead of the service’s likely introduction of an ad-supported tier that we estimate could add about 4 million incremental U.S./Canada subs and significant upside to ’23 U.S./Canada revenue.”

Wall Street does expect more updates on a planned crackdown on password sharing and launch of a cheaper AVOD meaning advertising-supported subscriber tier. After all Netflix on July 13 unveiled that it has picked Microsoft as its global advertising technology and sales partner. “We expect more detail on the AVOD rollout password sharing and any rethink to the content strategy to stimulate sub growth” Cahall said. “We think the bias for second-half estimate revisions is downward.”

The Middlesex County suburb of 26000 has been overshadowed by growth submarkets such as Watertown and Waltham capturing life science expansion in recent years but recent leasing and development activity is establishing Burlington’s name recognition in industry circles.

The Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard’s recent commitment to a new 146000-square-foot gene sequencing facility at 25-27 Network Drive could have a transformative effect similar to Vertex Pharmaceuticals’ relocation to Boston’s Seaport District in 2014 said John Coakley a partner at tenant representation brokerage Cresa in Boston.

“The cluster effect is huge. These early-stage companies don’t want to be the first and only one in an area and Burlington hasn’t had the concentration we’ve seen in other areas on Route 128 such as Waltham” Coakley said.

Ground-Up and Office Conversions Planned

Developers are proposing and building a range of ground-up construction and office conversions to accommodate newcomers in various stages of the industry life cycle from speculative clean rooms and R&D labs to biomanufacturing.

The Cambridge-based Broad Institute which partners with Harvard-affiliated hospitals and global researchers will use the Burlington location to augment its primary facility in Kendall Square. Vericel Corp. previously leased 125000 square feet at the property being developed by Burlington-based Nordblom Co. and Starwood Capital Group into a 1 million-square-foot campus for its own relocation and expansion.

Massachusetts’ economic boom of the 1980s was driven in large part by suburban tech and defense industry expansion contributing to the growth of office parks along Route 128 and Interstate 495. Many of those same buildings are being repurposed for the state’s current economic driver and offer proximity to retail amenities and an educated workforce said Kris Galletta chief investment officer at Nordblom Co.

“The same reasons the defense and software industries were drawn to Burlington before are the reasons we think it’s going to be successful from a life science perspective” Galletta said.

Nordblom Co. sees additional opportunities for lab conversions within the 1.1 million-square-foot Network Drive at Northwest Park which counts only a handful of current life science tenants Galletta said.

Another biotech-focused real estate model has already paid off for Nordblom and its partner Alcion Ventures at 60 Blanchard Road. Life science consultants Azzur Group leased the 50300-square-foot facility for its sixth Cleanrooms on Demand facility offering pre-built suites to biopharma companies to accelerate their early-space manufacturing. Moderna promptly leased 75 percent of the facility in mid-2021.

The Burlington location augments Azzur Group’s initial Massachusetts facility which opened in 2018 in Waltham and is designed to meet growing demand from big pharma clients and early-stage companies alike spokeswoman Katie Brown said. The labs are typically ready for occupancy within three months and the Burlington facility currently has three cleanrooms which average 760 square feet still available.

“We absolutely needed to expand and we looked at Burlington basically as an extension of that Cambridge area. We want to be where our customers are” Brown said.

‘Dynamic’ Growth-Stage Firms Wanted

Two dozen biotech medical tech biomanufacturing and health care companies call Burlington home according data compiled by the town’s economic development office. Burlington officials sought to make commercial properties more suitable for life science conversions last year by enacting fast-track zoning approvals and higher densities for a 150-acre “Innovation District” near Route 128.

“It’s great to have the anchor institutions but the smaller growing ones are much more dynamic and willing to collaborate with other companies” said Melisa Tintocalis Burlington’s economic development coordinator.

At the Boston Marriott Burlington hotel property at 1 Burlington Mall Road Boston-based Pyramid Hotel Group is proposing a 96000-square-foot life science building on a portion of the parking lot.

And Hudson Bay Co. has filed plans to convert the vacant former Lord & Taylor anchor store at the Burlington Mall into a 120000-square-foot lab building.

Neighbor Sought for EMDMillipore Campus

EMDMillipore’s decision to consolidate 900 Greater Boston employees’ workspace in a new 280000-square-foot build-to-suit campus that opened in 2017 on Summit Road gave Burlington a high-profile industry anchor. To expand the life science cluster Burlington and town officials have sought to provide options for smaller firms in growth mode.

That was Burlington-based Gutierrez Cos.’ strategy when it added lab infrastructure to a vacant new office building at 4 Burlington Woods Drive later rebranded as Burlington BioCenter. In less than 12 months Gutierrez Cos. leased the entire 110000-square-foot facility to biotechs Ultivue Protagene and CANbridge. Rare disease researcher CANbridge is expanding its research staff to 92 employees at the new 24500-square-foot headquarters after relocating from Cambridge in June. The facility also will include lab space in a partnership with the Horae Gene Therapy Center at the UMass Chan Medical School.

Next-door to Burlington BioCenter San Francisco-based GI Partners acquired a neighboring office building at 3 Burlington Woods Drive for $58.1 million in February and is proposing a 160000-square-foot lab conversion.

And a 291000-square-foot office-to-lab conversion is scheduled for completion in spring 2023 at 3 Van De Graaff Drive by Quincy-based Jumbo Capital.

Scott Weiss Gutierrez Cos.’ vice president of development said the firm is expanding its bet on Burlington biotech growth with two upcoming projects.

Gutierrez Cos. is converting the 110000-square-foot 10 Corporate Drive office building into lab space scheduled for tenant fit-outs in late 2022.

And an approved 250000-square-foot lab development pad at 300 Summit Drive next to the EMDMillipore campus could break ground speculatively late this year Weiss said. The firm is keeping a close eye on inflation and construction costs but is optimistic that continuing tenant demand will translate into higher rents.

“It’s making it far more challenging with supply chain issues and the cost of labor and materials but we think there’s still a market need and therefore there will be interest by tenants to absorb the additional costs” Weiss said.",,,,,,,,,,,,
VTRS,Viatris,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiK2h0dHBzOi8vbmV3c3Jvb20udmlhdHJpcy5jb20vVm9WLUFuaXRhLUNoYW7SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Featured Stories,"By: Niki Kapsambelis

From the time she was a schoolgirl in her native Hong Kong Anita Chan has been – quite literally – raising her voice.

She credits her early education with giving her the confidence to express her opinions which developed her interest in public speaking and singing. Today as Viatris’ general manager for Hong Kong and Macau she is paying it forward by cultivating a workplace that encourages colleagues to step outside their comfort zones.

That sense of empowerment is one of the qualities Anita enjoys most about her job. Trust from both her supervisor and team coupled with supportive data help drive her decisionmaking – and she works hard to ensure that she also fosters that quality in others.

“As a manager don’t treat me as your boss. We are partners” she said in summarizing her philosophy. “We all have specific roles. But it’s not about seniority or hierarchy. We all bring our own expertise to work that can help us reach that common goal: ultimately to help empower patients to live healthier.”

Anita attended college in the United States after high school initially with plans of becoming a surgeon. She earned a pharmacy degree to familiarize herself with available medications then pivoted her plans after gaining acceptance to medical school so she could focus on her family.

She worked as a community pharmacist in the Midwest of the United States eventually moving into pharmacy management and later a district director on the U.S. West Coast.

“This helped open my eyes to working with different people cultures and values” Anita said. “Ultimately it helped me understand and appreciate a whole range of views and listen to others’ perspectives.”

In 2009 she decided to return to Hong Kong to be closer to her extended family. It was a move that required re-taking board examinations so she could practice; after passing she helped set up a nonprofit community pharmacy to focus on greater patient access.

The experience left Anita with the impression that gaps still exist in public health knowledge so she returned to school at Hong Kong University to earn a public health degree. Eventually her experiences working in the nonprofit sector led to her current role as Viatris’ first general manager in Hong Kong.

Her approach to building the Hong Kong team is to create an environment of partnership and agility. She also hopes her example will inspire others to welcome opportunities as they present themselves.",,,,,,,,,,,,

Any alternative?,"""Life-saving"" virtual dollar cards in Nigeria has come under attack as leading provider pulls plug. What could make them pull the plug and what are the alternatives for consumers and fintechs alike?

Barter popularly known for its virtual dollar card service announced on Friday July 15 2022 that it was shutting down its virtual card service.

Barter by Flutterwave was the first of many Nigerian fintechs to break the hearts of fintech-savvy Nigerians with the withdrawal of their virtual card service. According to an email Barter sent to users ""effective Sunday 17th July 2022 all our Virtual Dollar cards will be unavailable for any transactions and purchases."" It attributes this unavailability to ""an update from our card partner which will cause the card service to be unavailable for an extended period of time.""

When I saw the Barter announcement my first question was ""Who is this card partner?"" This is because one would expect an African payment giant like Flutterwave to be speaking directly to the card schemes as opposed to working through a card-issuing company to issue Mastercard.

💳 Mastercard is/was an early investor in Flutterwave . They co-led the startup's Series A Extension round that was announced in October 2018. Likewise Visa. In fact the former Chairman and CEO of Visa Joe Saunders was on Flutterwave's Board.

Flutterwave used to issue Visa cards until they switched to Mastercard. Startups who had previously issued virtual Visa dollar cards provided by Barter tell me that it wasn't reliable enough. Hence why they switched to Union54. Even Flutterwave now ""partners"" (AKA use) with Union54 (for Barter).

Who is Union54?

Union54 is the Zambian startup making it seamless reliable and rewarding to issue virtual dollar cards in Africa.

🌍 The '54' in Union54 mimics the number of countries in Africa.

Union54 was officially founded in 2021 by an entrepreneurial couple Perseus Mlambo and Alessandra Martini. Perseus and his wife have been building digital financial services since 2015 when they launched Zazu Africa. Zazu is a neobank and thus needed to issue debit cards to allow its users to spend their money anywhere. But it just wasn't working owing to sponsor bank delays in issuing those cards—""at one point they had to wait for 18 months"" Perseus told Tage of TechCrunch.

As a fix they decided to go direct to Mastercard. They succeeded and became a Mastercard Principle member—allowing them to issue and acquire card transactions. Their decision at Zazu to make this issuing capability available to other African fintechs is what birthed Union54.

The work Perseus and Alessandra are doing is so crucial to the African continent especially Nigeria where there are restrictions on international commerce. But also in Zambia their home country where only about 10% of the adult population has a debit card. Hence financially excluded from participating in the global economy.

Little wonder that in less than a year Union54 raised a $15.1 million Seed from investors all over the world including Tiger Global and Nigerian neobank founder Babs Ogundeyi of Kuda Bank. They are also the first Zambian startup to get into Y Combinator the leading global accelerator.

With Union54's APIs fintechs are able to issue debit cards without worrying about all the complexities of the card business. Union54 takes care of the required Bank sponsorship needed to work with the selected Card scheme (Mastercard in this case). They also facilitate transaction processing and settlement.

As of October 2021 Union54 said more than 50 companies are currently in its API sandbox environment. Four of them—Flutterwave PayDay Plumter and Bitmama— were live. Union54's clientele includes existing startups and new startups ""founded on the basis of Union54’s availability"" Perseus boasts without mincing words. He is not wrong. Startups that offer one debit card for all your bank accounts would fall neatly into this bucket that Perseus describes as being founded on Union54's availability.

Similarly we project that Union54's clientele would have more than quadrupled in the last six months. This growth we believe to be driven by organic marketing—earned media and word of mouth referral—due to the novelty of its solution timing the prevailing consumer need and additional revenue line. On revenue Union54 is the ""only company in Africa that would give you [fintechs] the interchange.” Interchange fees typically accrue to issuers and processors which would be Union54 in this case. But TechCrunch reports that customers of Union54 (the fintechs that on-issue cards through them) earn 1% on each card transaction carried out by the cardholder.

Union54 has also invested in a couple of African infrastructural and cross-border payment startups we know.

The current virtual dollar card outage reported by tens of fintechs in Nigeria is believed to be due to Union54's downtime.

Union54's message to its Partners on its virtual cards' downtime

Dear Partners;

Despite our best efforts on 18th July cards will stop working. We have a number of upgrades and work streams we will be implementing which might take us ~ 6 weeks before we can resume service again.

As a reminder you can defund cards and process float funds via: https://docs.union54.technology/docs/float-refunds. Please make sure to defund all cards by 17th July 2022 in order for us to effect a bank transfer of any remaining floating float funds on the 20th July.

We had hoped to avoid this hiatus but it had proved impossible to do so. As such please accept our apologies for the impact on your business and know that we will back with a stronger and more resilient product.

For the purpose of clarity: new card issuance and transaction processing will stop on the 18th July. All issued cards will not work during this hiatus.

Onwards and upwards.

So why exactly is Union54 down and for how long?

No one knows the exact cause of the downtime—not even the founders of startups using Union54. I'm in three founder-focused groups and I've chatted directly to some of the founders of startups that have publicly come out to announce their virtual dollar card downtime.

Regarding how long Union54's card-issuing offering would be down I estimate six to ten weeks. One affected founder told me ""we'd be back up in six weeks"" via private message. Another founder said ""Probably 7 ish weeks"". So I've added an additional three weeks to account for any uncertainties.

A recurring theme I have heard from speaking with founders is that Union54 is trying to resolve some issues with Mastercard. But that the founders don't know the details of those issues.

What could these issues be? And could it be similar to some of the issues that Flutterwave might have faced some years back with Visa?

A major issue many acquiring players in the Card value chain face is a high rate of chargebacks and fraud. A chargeback is a dispute raised by a customer when they didn't get value for a transaction. Fraud occurs when someone tries to use a Card that they are not authorised to use to authenticate a transaction. The fraudulent use of a chargeback is when customers try to secure refunds even when they got value. So they reach out to the issuer/bank to initiate the chargeback process.

With chargeback processing there are strict resolution timelines otherwise the customer will get their value back ""System accept"". Card schemes have a low tolerance for high volumes of chargebacks filed through an acquirer. Thus many acquirers are willing to turn off merchants on their platform till they can get their processes in order.

Regarding Union54 it's possible that end users of their issued cards are using it to perpetrate fraud on other payment gateways and that's raising a recurring flag with their card scheme Mastercard. So Union54 might be taking a step back to build better chargeback reconciliation and settlement processes.

On the other hand the commercialisation of the card-issuing offering from Union54 might not suffice for their relationship with Mastercard. So two things to note here. Before now Mastercard didn't offer any direct licence to digital-first players partly cause those players couldn't afford Mastercard's quarterly fees (which are in dollars). Banks act as both BIN sponsors and settlement partners to facilitate card issuing and transaction settlement respectively. But Union54's offering makes them a non-bank issuer with the expected backing of a Bank.

Operating in the card space is hard and more than ever consumers are demanding ways to spend their money globally. In the meantime customers can do three things:

request foreign domiciliary accounts from their local banks.

continue to seek alternative consumer fintechs offering virtual dollar cards. For example Sudo Africa Chipper Cash Mono and Changera virtual dollars card offerings. More examples are contained in the link above.

and virtual dollars card offerings. More examples are contained in the link above. seek alternatives that allow above the $20 international spending limit on naira cards. I don't know why but gomoney reviewed my naira card spending limit to $100. So maybe try them.

Consumer fintechs like—Barter Eversend GetEquity PayDay Vesti Busha—who have publicly announced the shut down of their virtual dollar card service will now look to other providers for this solution. Doesn't seem like there is any readily available. Perhaps we are all doomed to check back in two months.

Union54 is pausing for a ""necessary compliance audit""

On Monday (July 18 2o22) Union54's CEO Perseus Mlambo tweeted a screenshot of an internal Slack message stating that ""the pause on service is part of a necessary compliance audit"" which will take place within two weeks.

WBA,Walgreens Boots Alliance,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZvb2wuY29tL2ludmVzdGluZy8yMDIyLzA3LzE2L2lzLXdhbGdyZWVucy1hLXdhcnJlbi1idWZmZXR0LXN0b2NrL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Is Walgreens a Warren Buffett Stock?,"The price is right but Buffett might not bite.

Warren Buffett is a stickler for consistency and it's no surprise why. Businesses that are capable of doing the same thing year after year while still posting decent growth regardless of whatever's happening in the market and in the world tend to be winners in the long run. And for Buffett it's no big problem to wait out decades as his investments compound in value like clockwork.

Companies like Walgreens Boots Alliance (WBA 0.29%) seem like obvious candidates for investors like Buffett. As a pharmacy and retailer there's little it needs to do differently to keep collecting money from the millions of people who rely on its stores. But the picture is a bit more complicated than that upon closer inspection so let's dive in.

It's a mixed bag

One of Buffett's biggest points of emphasis in investing is whether or not a business has an economic moat and if it does how wide. Wide moats tend to lead to robust and sturdy profit margins whether or not there are competitors in play. So they're a crucial aspect of a company's potential to make long-lived returns. In Walgreens' case the moat consists of the locations of its retail stores especially in high-value areas where commercial real estate may be sparse or too expensive for late-coming competitors to justify having a footprint.

But as you may have realized that isn't exactly a wide moat so it isn't particularly a point in the stock's favor as far as Buffett might be concerned. Nor is Walgreens' profitability particularly durable over time; in the last 10 years its gross margin has shrunk and it has had a number of unprofitable periods.

Nonetheless the company's sales grow with a consistency that would probably appeal to Buffett. Since 2002 its trailing 12-month revenue has risen by 369% reaching more than $134.5 billion. At a minimum that points to the enduring demand for its pharmacy goods and services.

Buffett might be pleased with Walgreens' low spending on research and development; it hasn't claimed any such expenses in the past decade. For Buffett spending a lot on making new products or improving old ones is a sign that the company's business model may not be evergreen enough and is at risk of competition that could drive down margins.

That's not to say that Walgreens isn't changing its offerings over time to chase new growth opportunities though. With its new plans to offer health insurance and some basic primary care services out of its branded Health Corners it's conceivable that its growth could accelerate.

Plus services like health insurance tend to be inconvenient to switch away from once customers are signed up which should mean that at least some of the new revenue from selling insurance could be persistent. And health insurance is a line of business that definitely features wide and often unassailable moats thanks to the legal hurdles necessary to participate in the market.

He'd probably like its price

So far Walgreens doesn't have the makings of a traditional Buffett stock like Moody's or Visa even if there are a few indications it's getting into lines of business that he might find more favorable. But there is one thing that Buffett would find very appealing compared to the company's competitors: its valuation. Take a look at this chart:

As you can see Walgreens has a significantly lower price-to-sales (P/S) ratio price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio and price-to-book (P/B) ratio in a head-to-head matchup against its archrival CVS Health. That doesn't mean Buffett would be jumping to buy it but it does mean that he'd interpret its potential for future growth as being at a discount today which could be an important influence.

Given that Buffett prefers to buy high-quality companies at a fair price rather than average companies at a discount it's still hard to say that he'd be very tempted. It's not beyond the realm of possibility for that to change over the next few years especially if the pharmacy can demonstrate that its new services are going to lead to permanent improvements to its margin.

Until then there's no rule that says you shouldn't buy stocks that the Oracle of Omaha wouldn't be interested in even though it's hard to justify a purchase if you use his traditional value investing framework.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5vdHRpbmdoYW1wb3N0LmNvbS9uZXdzL25vdHRpbmdoYW0tbmV3cy9idWlsZGluZy1ib290cy1oZWFkcXVhcnRlcnMtbm90dGluZ2hhbS1wdXQtNzMzMTE5NtIBamh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5vdHRpbmdoYW1wb3N0LmNvbS9uZXdzL25vdHRpbmdoYW0tbmV3cy9idWlsZGluZy1ib290cy1oZWFkcXVhcnRlcnMtbm90dGluZ2hhbS1wdXQtNzMzMTE5Ni5hbXA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Building at Boots headquarters in Nottingham put up for lease on Rightmove,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='news.google.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /articles/CBMiZmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5vdHRpbmdoYW1wb3N0LmNvbS9uZXdzL25vdHRpbmdoYW0tbmV3cy9idWlsZGluZy1ib290cy1oZWFkcXVhcnRlcnMtbm90dGluZ2hhbS1wdXQtNzMzMTE5NtIBamh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5vdHRpbmdoYW1wb3N0LmNvbS9uZXdzL25vdHRpbmdoYW0tbmV3cy9idWlsZGluZy1ib290cy1oZWFkcXVhcnRlcnMtbm90dGluZ2hhbS1wdXQtNzMzMTE5Ni5hbXA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen (Caused by NewConnectionError('<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x0000021859A89660>: Failed to establish a new connection: [WinError 10051] A socket operation was attempted to an unreachable network')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5vdHRpbmdoYW1wb3N0LmNvbS9uZXdzL25vdHRpbmdoYW0tbmV3cy9idWlsZGluZy1ib290cy1oZWFkcXVhcnRlcnMtbm90dGluZ2hhbS1wdXQtNzMzMTE5NtIBamh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5vdHRpbmdoYW1wb3N0LmNvbS9uZXdzL25vdHRpbmdoYW0tbmV3cy9idWlsZGluZy1ib290cy1oZWFkcXVhcnRlcnMtbm90dGluZ2hhbS1wdXQtNzMzMTE5Ni5hbXA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen",,,,,,,,,

I typically shop online instead of going into the store anymore. Lisa Tanner

Though the number of products I purchase at Walmart has dropped over the years it's still a staple in our shopping routine.

These days my Walmart visits mostly consist of placing an order online and letting someone else do the shopping for me — which is a godsend when you have 10 kids.

It's super quick and I'm much better at sticking to my list when I'm not walking through the store staring at all the great deals.

Whether I'm shopping online or in person here are some of the items that regularly make it into my shopping cart.

In the video posted by user Cee (@ceiranicole) one can see her hang up on the customer over and over frequently laughing as she does so.

According to Cee her interactions with the customer were pleasant until she informed the customer that all of her managers were in a meeting. At that point the customer insisted she get a manager and addressed Cee as “ghetto girl” which both surprised Cee and led her to hang up on the customer.

The customer continued to call back and Cee began recording. The TikTok documenting this series of hang-ups currently has over 1.6 million views.

The video begins after Cee has already hung up at least one time.

“I don’t know who you think you are that you think you can hang up in my face but you’re not going to do it again” the customer says.

“Okay” Cee responds.

“Get me a manager on this—” the customer starts before Cee hangs up on her collapsing into laughter.

Over the course of the video interactions like these happen several more times. The customer insists she be connected with a manager she is once again informed that the managers are in a meeting she gets upset and Cee hangs up on her.

After several calls Cee says that no matter how many times the woman calls she’s going to keep getting Cee on the other end as yet again the managers are in a meeting.

“Well I am glad that you’re the only one that I’m going to get because now they’ll know who’s been such a bitch” the customer states.

“Oh you want to tussle!” Cee answers.

This results in another interaction during which Cee hangs up.

In the comments Cee said that she was initially more than happy to assist the customer—”but not after she called me ghetto & wanted to argue.”

“If she would’ve told me what she wanted I could’ve helped her” she later added in comments.

Some TikTok commenters supported Cee offering their own thoughts on the situation.

“Hanging up on a rude customer is one of the most satisfying experiences” one user wrote. “Sometimes you have to remind them who’s the one in need in the situation.”

“When will they realize if they treat people with basic respect they will get what they need faster” a second user added.

“Thanks sincerely from everybody who gotta talk to customers on the phone all day” a third shared.

However some took the opposing view saying that Cee was wrong for doing this regardless of customer behavior.

“Why all walmart employees think they’re so tough” asked a commenter. “It’s so much easier to be nice and you think this shits funny.”

In response to comments like these Cee posted a follow-up video further explaining what happened and the reality of working at Walmart in general.

“A lot of people’s problem when I was working there” she starts “they feel like they could just go off on you because you know they’re not getting their way.”

“But if it’s something that I cannot handle or control then what the eff do you want me to do?” Cee asks. “Y’all be wanting us to bend over backwards do a split…for y’all and that’s not how it work.”

Many users agreed with Cee.

“The thing is you are not required to be disrespected or abused by customers” a commenter said. “You were helping train her to be respectful for the next!!!”

“People know you’re at work and they abuse that power dynamic” another added. “She wouldn’t talk to you like that if you weren’t at work!! you handled it well tbh.”

Today Cee says she no longer works at Walmart. “…God blessed me with a better paying job” she wrote in a comment.

We’ve reached out to Cee via TikTok comment and Walmart via its website press form.

To create an extraordinary welcome on such a momentous occasion were campus personnel cast members and special guests!

The long-awaited opening of Avengers Campus in correlation with the 30th Anniversary celebrations has action-packed adventures with surprise live-action stunts heroic encounters with Marvel Super Heroes and two epic attractions. On top of these offerings recruits can refuel like a Super Hero with all-new dining experiences and look the part with their heroic merchandise.

To help welcome the very first recruits Josh D’Amaro Chairman of Disney Parks Experiences and Products and President and Managing Director Disney Parks International Jill Estorino joined cast members alongside the Disneyland Paris Ambassadors and Natacha Rafalski President of Disneyland Paris with an assembly line down Walt Disney Studios Park.

“It was such a beautiful and magical day! So intense in emotions!” shared Yodin Luboya campus personnel.

The atmosphere was filled with excitement smiles and cheers from both cast and guests alike as everyone filled in to see the new Campus. To commemorate the event special buttons were distributed along with an exclusive Mission Files document for the Campus’ first recruits.

“It was great to join all of my colleagues to live this moment together and welcome our first recruits!” expressed Carlos Alarcón Álvarez campus personnel.

More surprises awaited in backstage areas for Disneyland Paris cast members — decorations set up in cast buildings and a special dessert was offered to all cast. While enjoying these delicious desserts they snapped selfies in a brand-new cast selfie spot where they could help fight the Spider-Bots escaping from the SPIDER-MAN W.E.B. ADVENTURE attraction!

As the day continued everyone was invited to join in on the action — teaming up with the Avengers and their allies throughout the land; slinging webs like Spider-Man on SPIDER-MAN W.E.B. ADVENTURE; flying into space with Iron Man and Captain Marvel on AVENGERS ASSEMBLE: FLIGHT FORCE; and suiting up and refueling in true Super Hero fashion.

Recruits encountered Spider-Man Iron Man or Captain Marvel in a new dedicated building specially designed for Avengers Campus in Disneyland Paris the Hero Training Center. For the first time in a Disney Park a dynamic “freeze frame” video sequence created by Disney PhotoPass with 27 cameras all around the action captured these meetings with Captain Marvel or Iron Man and turned them into unforgettable moments. These special encounters are available for booking through the Disneyland Paris mobile app.

New recruits of all ages also had the chance to train with Black Panther’s loyal protectors the Dora Milaje and learn from the warriors of Wakanda on what it’s like to be a member of this elite royal guard. From there they went onto saving the world in fun fashion showing off their best dance moves during an interactive dance-off with Star-Lord and Gamora from the Guardians of the Galaxy and capturing moments with more heroes at The Gateway Portal.

Avengers Campus is now open with cast members and personnel ready to welcome new recruits as they embark on exciting new adventures in Disneyland Paris!

1. Guardians Of The Galaxy: Cosmic Rewind

EPCOT

As an ardent fan of roller coasters and the Guardians of the Galaxy films I was excited to experience EPCOT’s newest major attraction. Guardians of the Galaxy: Cosmic Rewind is one of the largest enclosed roller coasters in the world and this thrilling ride is an audiovisual treat.

Set in EPCOT’s first “other-world” pavilion called the Galaxarium Guardians of the Galaxy: Cosmic Rewind begins with an incredible pre-show experience filled with Guardians of the Galaxy characters elaborate storytelling and a virtual journey to a Nova Corps ship. Then it’s “save the galaxy” time on this immersive omnicoaster ride featuring Disney’s first-ever reverse-launch roomy Starjumper vehicles that rotate 360 degrees and a fantastic soundtrack that changes with each ride and alters the feel of the entire experience. “September” and “Conga” had me dancing the whole time.

This family-friendly coaster has a 42-inch minimum height requirement. Riding Guardians of the Galaxy: Cosmic Rewind feels like surfing through space and time and the experience is exhilarating. It was so much fun that I wanted to do it again and again.

Pro Tip: On Guardians of the Galaxy: Cosmic Rewind seating choice affects the overall experience. After riding the attraction numerous times in various locations my personal favorite is the front seat’s smooth glide. The back seat provides maximum thrills. Dark indoor coasters and reverse-launch rides can be disorienting for some people. I didn’t experience any motion sickness even on back-to-back rides.

2. Space 220 Restaurant

EPCOT

Vacationers can enjoy an out-of-this-world culinary experience at Space 220 Restaurant a popular dining venue in EPCOT’s expanded Mission: SPACE pavilion. At this memorable dining attraction the immersive experience is mind-blowing and the space-themed atmosphere is the star of the show.

After checking in at the Departure Lounge and receiving a boarding pass guests board a “space elevator” and blast off on a simulated scenic journey to the Centauri Space Station. Upon arrival they can enjoy lunch or dinner while taking in panoramic views of the space station astronauts planets satellites and stars. While the meal is on the expensive side the unique interstellar experience and virtual day and evening views of our planet from 220 miles above the Earth are phenomenal.

Pro Tip: Space 220 reservations sell out quickly so make bookings as soon as possible. If you can’t obtain a reservation check the restaurant early to see if you can join a walk-up waiting line for the Space 220 lounge. It’s part of the main dining area so you can still enjoy the incredible views.

5. Drawn To Life Presented By Cirque Du Soleil And Disney

Disney Springs

This dazzling new show is the first-ever theatrical collaboration between Cirque du Soleil Walt Disney Imagineering and Walt Disney Animation Studios. Drawn to Life depicts the story of a young girl who discovers an uncompleted animation bequeathed to her by her late father a Disney animator. Guided by an amazing pencil the daughter delves into the world of animation and embarks on an uplifting personal quest filled with Disney memories from her childhood. The show’s beautiful artistry incredible acrobatic performances and brilliant choreography kept me spellbound throughout the entire production.

I’ve enjoyed combining Cirque du Soleil shows with dinner in Disney Springs on past visits. This shopping entertainment and dining district is home to dozens of fantastic dining options. The performance lasts about 90 minutes so make dinner reservations with your show time in mind.

Pro Tip: A few children from the audience are selected to go on stage to draw pictures during the Drawn to Life pre-show. If your group includes kids you may want to purchase seats close to the stage to maximize their chances of being chosen.

If you haven’t sent Casey Bloys a quick email congratulating him on 140 Emmy nominations now you’ve got another reason. The HBO/HBO Max chief content officer just closed a big new deal to stay at the company. It’s a five-year contract I’m told and it comes with a sigh of relief from Warner Bros. Discovery C.E.O. David Zaslav who made re-signing Bloys the top personnel priority of his first 100 days. An HBO rep confirmed the deal to me but declined to comment further.

I never thought Bloys was going anywhere but it’s weird that in his Emmy victory lap interviews this week nobody asked him about his own status. Inside HBO people knew Bloys’s deal was coming up and that he’d have tons of options given how seamlessly HBO has navigated its ownership chaos of the past few years. Many (including me) thought that adding more populist content to the HBO Max service might dilute the HBO brand but Bloys and his team have successfully positioned The White Lotus Hacks and Euphoria alongside The Peacemaker and Fboy Island. Next month’s House of the Dragon the Game of Thrones prequel likely will check both boxes.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiV2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxldmVsdXAuY29tL2VuL25ld3MvNjg4MjM4L1RoZS1MYXN0LW9mLVVzLXNlcmllcy13aWxsLWFpci1vbi1IQk8tZWFybHktMjAyM9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,The Last of Us series will air on HBO early 2023,"The Last of Us T.V. series will premiere through HBO Max and HBO (in countries where that channel/service is available separately) in early 2023. Casey Bloys content manager from the brand owned by Warner Bros. Discovery has been asked in an interview with The Hollywood Reporter when we should expect the series. ""It is closer to the beginning of 2023"" the executive replied.

PlayStation Productions and Sony Pictures Television announced a television adaptation of The Last of Us in March 2020. Neil Druckmann director of The Last of Us and The Last of Us Part II is writing the script alongside Craig Mazin creator of the award-winning Chernobyl series that premiered in 2019. Filming began in the summer of last year.

Will the show encompass the plot from the first game's story?

The HBO series will not follow the events of the first installment of the saga but will be both a reinterpretation and an extension of the events.“Things sometimes stay pretty close. It’s funny to see my dialogue there from the games in HBO scripts. And sometimes they deviate greatly to much better effect because we are dealing with a different medium” said Executive Producer Neil Druckmann IGN reported last year.

As for the artists who will participate in the production Pedro Pascal is interpreting Joel Bella Ramsey as Ellie Gabriel Luna as Tommy Merle Dandridge as Marlene Jeffrey Pierce as Perry Anna Torv as Tess Storm Reid as Riley Nico Parker as Sarah Murray Barlett as Frank and Nick Offerman as Bill. Also appearing in unknown roles are Troy Baker Ashley Johnson Brad Leland and Murray Bartlett. Gustavo Santaolalla will be the composer of the soundtrack.

The list included paper and plastics the heart of curbside recycling programs. Government officials described these materials as “waste”. To their buyers however they were raw materials for products. The ban went into effect in March 2018.

The announcement created an uproar. In retrospect it was no surprise. I spoke at a 2014 paper recycling conference Shanghai. At the same meeting Chinese environmental officials laid out their plans for “rationalizing” the domestic recycling system and fixing its perceived problems. They never mentioned banning recyclables but I bet they already had made that decision.

The media reaction was over the top. We were told for instance that “since the 1990s the world has shipped its waste paper discarded plastic and unwanted metals to China”. That is simply not true. Paper mills and other manufacturing facilities throughout the world use local recyclables. After all it’s usually cheaper to ship locally than overseas.

We were also told communities were abandoning their recycling programs and recycling is “broken”. It’s not and they didn’t. Only about 100 communities stopped recycling. That’s not a bad loss rate out of 10000 or so curbside programs.

That is not to say that everything was rosy when the ban went into effect. Curbside paper prices collapsed. Residential mixed paper had a negative price for much of 2019. Similarly corrugated container (aka cardboard boxes) prices fell considerably.

Curbside plastic values followed a different trajectory. PET and PP prices went up a bit natural HDPE and colored HDPE went up and then down. Mixed 3-7 plastic bales lost three-quarters of their minimal value. (All paper and plastic prices are from RecyclingMarkets.net and reflect prices received by MRFs.)

Price impacts were different because recycled paper and plastic have different markets. In 2017 about 40 percent of America’s recycled paper was exported with about 27 percent going to China. Even now we export 34 percent of our paper recyclables. This is a direct result of American companies “offshoring” product manufacturing to other countries in the last three decades. The boxes used to ship those products to this country are usually made overseas as well. Paper exports will only fall dramatically when those same companies start reshoring manufacturing.

Because of the ban recycled plastic exports plummeted from 3.68 billion pounds in 2017 to 1.21 billion pounds in 2021. Yet at the beginning of the decade exports of recycled PET and HDPE had already begun to decline. Mixed plastics are more likely to be exported. Now half of our exports go to Canada and Mexico. Note too that plastic export data is always in billions of pounds while paper is in millions of tons. Plastics after all are lightweight.

Capacity to use more recycled paper in North America has increased since the ban leading to higher prices for curbside paper. That increase is partially a result of the ban but due to the increase in the use of e-commerce. Before the ban several containerboard mills started increasing their capacity to use recycled boxes. Plans were also underway to build at least one new mill using curbside paper. Since the ban these capacity increases have been even more dramatic with as much as 8 million new tons of capacity coming online as a result

New plastic recycled content capacity has also been announced and built. Much of it is so-called “mechanical” plastic recycling in use since plastic recycling began. Limitations with those processes have led to a great deal of interest in non-mechanical systems usually called “chemical” or “advanced” plastic recycling. About seven of those facilities are now operating although exact data on the amount and type of postconsumer plastics they use is hard to get.

In an ironic twist the ban may have had a negative impact on Chinese papermaking capacity. Before the ban China relied heavily on domestic supplies of recyclable paper and imports. Since the ban domestic recycling has increased as has its cost. Imports in the form of recycled fiber pulp have also increased. Some of that pulp is made in American mills some in Southeast Asian mills that rely on imports. Because those two sources are limited in size China has been forced to increase its use of virgin fiber pulp whether it is made in China or imported. Time will tell whether those sources can make up the gap caused by the ban.

The ban clearly put American recycling programs through a wringer. I expect more crises in the future. I’ve seen six or seven since I started at EPA in 1976. I don’t know what crisis is waiting to unfold in the future but I suspect that recycling will continue to have the resilience to survive.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMihQFodHRwczovL3d3dy5jbGFyaW9ubGVkZ2VyLmNvbS9zdG9yeS9uZXdzLzIwMjIvMDcvMTcvcmljaGFyZHMtZGlzcG9zYWwtZ2FyYmFnZS1jb21wYW55LWZpbGVzLWxhd3N1aXQtYWdhaW5zdC1jaXR5LWphY2tzb24vMTAwODE1NDMwMDIv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Garbage company files $1.6M lawsuit against city of Jackson,"Associated Press

A $1.6 million lawsuit is the latest development in the ongoing garbage contract dispute in Jackson Mississippi.

WAPT-TV reported on Friday that Richard’s Disposal filed a lawsuit in U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Mississippi on Wednesday and is seeking more than $1.6 million in restitution. The New Orleans-based company has been collecting trash in Jackson since April 1 but has yet to be paid because the Jackson City Council said the company does not have an approved contract.

Earlier this week a judge ruled that the mayor of Mississippi’s capital city did not have the power veto a contract that the city council had not approved. Judge Larry Roberts issued his ruling Friday in a dispute among Jackson officials over who will be paid to collect garbage news outlets reported.

“There’s nothing there to veto. The council didn’t pass affirmatively the matter. It rejected it” said Roberts a retired Mississippi Court of Appeals judge who was appointed to hear the case in Hinds County Chancery Court.

The Jackson City Council sued after Mayor Chokwe Antar Lumumba issued an emergency order to award a garbage collection contract to a Richard’s Disposal.

During a Friday interview with Canadian publication the Globe and Mail the 78-year-old musician stated that it “seemed odd” that the Weeknd’s concert received more media coverage from Toronto publications considering it was canceled due to a widespread outage.

The conversation initially commenced with a question about Waters’ audiences on his “This Is Not a Drill” tour which kicked off in the first week of July. After the reporter said he wasn’t able to review Waters’ show because he was set to cover the Weeknd that same night Waters offered a response.

“I have no idea what or who the Weeknd is because I don’t listen to much music” Waters began. “People have told me he’s a big act. Well good luck to him. I’ve got nothing against him. Would it not have been possible to review his show one night and my show another night?”

Waters asserted that his statements were not intended as a “a personal attack” adding “with all due respect to the Weeknd or Drake or any of them I am far far far more important than any of them will ever be however many billions of streams they’ve got. There is stuff going on here that is fundamentally important to all of our lives.”

Waters has made politics a central theme of his upcoming shows a freedom he is now getting to exercise as he is “not constrained by the rock group that I was with then.”

“They were always trying to drag me back from my natural instinct which is to tell the truth” Waters said.

On the night of Waters’ first show for the “This Is Not a Drill” tour the Brooklyn Vegan reported the musician putting a message on screen before the performance reading: “If you’re one of those ‘I love Pink Floyd but I can’t stand Roger’s politics people’ you might do well to fuck off to the bar right now.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiW2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJpbGxib2FyZC5jb20vbXVzaWMvbXVzaWMtbmV3cy9yb2dlcnMtd2F0ZXJzLWludGVydmlldy13ZWVrbmQtZHJha2UtMTIzNTExNTI1Mi_SAV9odHRwczovL3d3dy5iaWxsYm9hcmQuY29tL211c2ljL211c2ljLW5ld3Mvcm9nZXJzLXdhdGVycy1pbnRlcnZpZXctd2Vla25kLWRyYWtlLTEyMzUxMTUyNTIvYW1wLw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Roger Waters Offers His Thoughts on Drake and The Weeknd: ‘I Am Far Far Far More Important’,"Roger Waters is offering his thoughts on how his musical legacy measures up against some of today’s biggest stars.

The subject arose during a recent interview with Toronto’s The Globe and Mail when a reporter told the former Pink Floyd rocker that he was assigned by the Canadian publication to review The Weeknd‘s show at the city’s Rogers Centre on July 8 (which was ultimately postponed) rather than Waters’ back-to-back concerts at the nearby Scotiabank Arena on July 8-9.

“But the Weeknd was canceled and my show was for two nights” Rogers said referencing a nationwide power outage that caused The Weeknd’s show to be postponed. “I have no idea what or who The Weeknd is because I don’t listen to much music. People have told me he’s a big act. Well good luck to him. I’ve got nothing against him. Would it not have been possible to review his show one night and my show another night?”

The 78-year-old icon added that he wasn’t “trying to make a personal attack” against The Weeknd but that it “seemed odd” that the newspaper couldn’t review both concerts on separate nights. Waters then took aim at another Canadian superstar: Drake.

“By the way with all due respect to The Weeknd or Drake or any of them I am far far far more important than any of them will ever be however many billions of streams they’ve got. There is stuff going on here that is fundamentally important to all of our lives” Waters said without elaborating.

Trending on Billboard

Waters is currently on the road as part of his This Is Not a Drill tour which visits North American arenas through mid-October. The musician’s next concert is scheduled for Sunday (July 17) at Quebec’s Videotron Center.

A news release for This Is Not a Drill describes the tour as a “stunning indictment of the corporate dystopia in which we all struggle to survive and a call to action to LOVE PROTECT and SHARE our precious and precarious planet home.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiY2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnJvbGxpbmdzdG9uZS5jb20vbXVzaWMvbXVzaWMtbmV3cy9yb2dlci13YXRlcnMtbW9yZS1pbXBvcnRhbnQtdGhlLXdlZWtuZC1kcmFrZS0xMzg0MjYyL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Roger Waters Says He's 'Far Far Far More Important' Than the Weeknd and Drake,"Roger Waters threw shade at both the Weeknd and Drake after the former Pink Floyd rocker found himself overshadowed in the Canadian press by the two hometown artists.

Waters’ This Is Not a Drill Tour rolled into Toronto on July 8 the same day the Weeknd’s After Hours Til Dawn trek was set to kick off in the city. While the Weeknd’s gig at the Rogers Centre was ultimately postponed due to Canada-wide power issue Waters’ show at Scotiabank Arena somehow still proceeded as scheduled.

However in an interview with Canadian newspaper the Globe and Mail the always-truculent Waters expressed anger that the Canadian press — and specifically the reporter he was interviewing with — opted to cover the Weeknd kicking off his tour in his hometown stadium rather than Waters’ show which was the first of a two-night stand at the Toronto arena.

“I have no idea what or who the Weeknd is because I don’t listen to much music” Waters said. “People have told me he’s a big act. Well good luck to him. I’ve got nothing against him. Would it not have been possible to review his show one night and my show another night?”

He added “I’m not trying to make a personal attack. I’m just saying it seemed odd.”

Then for reasons unknown other than he was in Toronto Waters also took aim at the city’s native superstar Drake.

Biodegradable materials could be a lifesaver.,"It’s official: In March the United Nations Environmental Assembly endorsed a global pact on the life cycle of plastic. It has been declared a seismic shift in the battle against marine pollution but what will happen to the oceans before those potential positive effects come?

Japan’s coasts and seas are awash with plastic waste. More PET bottles and plastic cups and take-out containers were found on the country’s beaches than any other litter except cigarette butts according to a 2020 study by Statista. And that’s not set to change soon: Japan continues to produce 9.4 million tons of plastic waste annually according to the Environmental Investigation Agency a London-based nongovernmental organization.

In deeper waters the Great Pacific Garbage Patch of floating plastic is an estimated 1.6 million square kilometers and the amount of plastic waste entering the ocean annually could rise to 29 million tons by 2040 without action according to a 2020 Pew report. This phenomenon has contributed to the 35000 tons of microplastics already in the oceans globally as noted by the Scottish nonprofit Fidra.

March saw Japan provisionally agree to sign the United Nations Environmental Assembly’s global pact to eliminate plastic pollution by addressing the life cycle of plastic (the agreement is due for completion in 2024). In April Japan enacted its own attempt to address the plastic issue from creation to disposal. The Plastic Resource Circulation Act aims to reduce the use of petroleum-based plastics and promote recycling contributing to the Osaka Blue Vision set out at the 2019 G20 meeting which is “to reduce additional pollution by marine plastic litter to zero by 2050.”

Fighting the tide

Efforts to tackle this problem have not been solely legislative however. Enter marine-biodegradable plastic a material that breaks down into water and carbon dioxide when subjected to microorganisms heat and light in aquatic environments. The material has been heralded as a solution to marine plastic pollution. According to the Ministry of Economy Trade and Industry (METI) “marine-biodegradable plastics (are) one of the most promising cutting-edge technologies for addressing (marine plastic pollution).”

As examples of good practice METI points to Tokyo-based Plants Laboratory Inc.’s marine-biodegradable resin for hydroponics which can replace urethane-based support structures that deteriorate into tiny pieces and infiltrate the soil. And Osaka’s Rengo Co. Ltd. claims its marine-biodegradable spherical particulate Viscopearl a 100% wood pulp cellulose-derived product could replace plastic beads commonly found in detergents cosmetics and abrasives.

Kaneka Corp. is expanding production of Green Planet its fully plant-derived and marine-biodegradable polymer used to make items such as cutlery and shopping bags. Its Green Planet-made straws have been available at 7-Eleven stores since 2019 and on Ito En tea cartons since 2021. In April Tokyu Hotels became the first chain in Japan to stock Green Planet-made toothbrushes.

From January 2024 Kaneka will increase its annual production capacity from 5000 tons to 20000 tons and has set a target of 200000 to 300000 tons by 2030.

Kaneka spokesperson Chika Harada says the company plans to apply the technology next to snack packaging and seedling pots pointing out that it is “highly anticipated as a business solution that will play a key role in the environment.”

Green Planet is but one Japan-made material designated “OK Biodegradable Marine” by international certifying body TUV Austria. To achieve certification at least 90% of the product must biodegrade within six months in seawater at a temperature of 30 degrees Celsius.

Another material recognized by TUV Austria is Osaka-based Daicel Corp.’s Cafblo a constituent of eyeglass frames protective LCD films and cosmetics that is made from plant-derived cellulose and naturally occurring acetic acid. Unlike conventional cellulose acetate 90% of which biodegrades in seawater after 260 days Cafblo needs just 25 days to be broken down by 98%.

Tokyo’s Asahi Kasei meanwhile obtained the certification for Bemliese a nonwoven fabric used in facial masks and disinfectant wipes while Aichi Prefecture’s Fukusuke Kogyo Co. was granted the label for a shopping bag made primarily from corn-derived resin and capable of holding up to 8 kilograms.

Against the current

A 2020 report by Mitsui & Co. Global Strategic Studies Institute claimed market growth will result in marine-biodegradable plastics becoming less expensive and lead to wider adoption. Even so more work needs to be done on international standards for marine biodegradability the report said pointing out certifications such as OK Biodegradable Marine are based on standards “withdrawn” in 2015 for being inadequate. A Yano Research Institute report goes further stating that OK Biodegradable Marine certification is not a guarantee that the material does not have a bad influence on the natural ecosystem.

Indeed establishing ISO certification for marine-biodegradable plastic is one of the requirements for the material to gain a solid footing according to METI. The Ibaraki Prefecture-based National Institute of Advanced Industries is building on two standards to evaluate marine biodegradability which were introduced by ISO in 2020.

Still not everyone is optimistic about marine-biodegradable plastic with environmental organizations maintaining that reducing reusing and recycling plastic is the better approach. The United Nations Environment Programme cites the possibility that the material would still cause “physical and chemical impacts on the marine environment.”

“We do not believe that marine biodegradability is the solution to the marine plastic problem” said a spokesperson for Mitsubishi Chemical Holdings Group. Instead the company called for the development of “a system (collection and composting of plastic products) that makes use of the biodegradable function.”

Other organizations in Japan meanwhile are tackling marine plastic by rethinking the use of plastic — especially the single-use kind — from the ground up.

Natalia Hirai communications officer for Greenpeace Japan says “shifting to other single-use materials” such as marine-biodegradable plastic is not the answer to marine plastic noting that the world “must reduce plastic production at source” by “drastically reducing and making reuse and refill a new norm in our society.”

Kate Sedwell director of Atlantic Pacific International Rescue is one of many pushing for a sea change in how the public views marine plastic pollution. | NICK JAUSSI

Japan Environmental Action Network is carrying out research and educational programs about marine plastic. Such activities are designed to fill gaps in public awareness of key issues. Although 89% of people in a 2019 government survey were concerned about marine plastic pollution only 52% in a 2020 poll understood that littering of plastic products on land could cause pollution at sea.

Atlantic Pacific International Rescue a nongovernmental organization established to combat global drowning is also delivering education. Its sea safety and search and rescue training is designed to prepare people for the growing impact of climate change such as more frequent extreme weather and more catastrophic natural disasters. Its programs meanwhile cover the impact of plastic consumption on the oceans which affects human health and climate systems.

“The sea and all the creatures in it are a vital part of our ecosystem” says Kate Sedwell director of Atlantic Pacific International Rescue. “We need it to thrive and it is currently being choked with plastic.”

This year the organization tasked students in both Wales and Kamaishi Iwate Prefecture to make new items from single-use plastic as part of its “Precious Plastic Project” which aims to convert marine plastic into disaster prevention products such as lifebuoys rescue boards and lifeboats.

It’s possible that increased awareness coupled with greater innovation in the field of marine-biodegradable plastics could help turn the tide of rising plastic pollution in Japan’s seas. But efforts to educate the public are far from new and questions remain on the complete impact of these new materials. That’s why the estimated 2.2 million people 1000 organizations and 120 companies who appealed to the U.N. for the global pact to address the life cycle of plastic believe it is the best way so far to eliminate plastic pollution in all environments.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMigAFodHRwczovL3RpbWVzb2ZpbmRpYS5pbmRpYXRpbWVzLmNvbS9jaXR5L3N1cmF0L2d1amFyYXQtYXMtZmxvb2Qtd2F0ZXJzLXJlY2VkZS1kZXZhc3RhdGlvbi1jb21lcy10by1mb3JlL2FydGljbGVzaG93LzkyOTA5MzMyLmNtc9IBhAFodHRwczovL3RpbWVzb2ZpbmRpYS5pbmRpYXRpbWVzLmNvbS9jaXR5L3N1cmF0L2d1amFyYXQtYXMtZmxvb2Qtd2F0ZXJzLXJlY2VkZS1kZXZhc3RhdGlvbi1jb21lcy10by1mb3JlL2FtcF9hcnRpY2xlc2hvdy85MjkwOTMzMi5jbXM?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Gujarat: As flood waters recede devastation comes to fore,SURAT: As the flood waters receded in most parts of Navsari and Valsad  the actual scene of destruction has started emerging.

Citibank is an advertising partner of this site as is American Express Chase Barclays and Capital One. Any opinions expressed in this post are my own and have not been reviewed approved or endorsed by my advertising partners. I do not write about all credit cards that are available -- instead focusing on miles points and cash back (and currencies that can be converted into the same). Terms apply to the offers and benefits listed on this page.

Wells Fargo introduced its new Autograph Card this month. It’s an above-average product but not best in class. What’s struck me most about it is that Wells Fargo is making marketing claims that just seem wrong – and that actually undersell other products they have in the process.

The no annual fee Autograph card offers



Initial bonus: 30000 points after $1500 spend in first 3 months



30000 points after $1500 spend in first 3 months 3x earning: dining travel (including transit and gas) streaming services and phone plans [1x everywhere else]



dining travel (including transit and gas) streaming services and phone plans [1x everywhere else] Redemption: points are worth 1 cent apiece with redemptions in $25 increments ($20 at Wells Fargo ATMs)

These are nice 3x categories but it’s basically a cash back card with minimums to cash out. You’ll never get better than 3% back on any of your spend. That’s better than a 1% card and it has no annual fee so a lot of consumers out in the world would do better with this card than they already have. But it’s hardly top of market.

So here’s what I see in an ad when I Google the card:

Wells Fargo claims Autograph is their “best points card ever.” I’m surprised their lawyers allowed the claim because it’s so obviously not accurate.

The Autograph card is basically the old Wells Fargo Propel card but running on the Visa network instead of American Express. The Propel World card used to come with baggage and trip delay; trip cancellation and interruption; return protection and extended warranty and more.

The most direct comparison for Autograph at Wells Fargo would be to their Active Cash card which is a no annual fee 2% back card on everything. Autograph has some nice 3x categories but that’s not obviously better than 2% across the board (just ask Capital One!). Active Cash is probably the more lucrative standalone card and one of the best cash back cards.

Wells wants to call Autograph a points card rather than cash back putting it in a different category from Active Cash. Sure they’re bonusing travel spend but it’s not a points card the way we usually think of those. There’s no elevated redemption option for travel and no transfers to other points programs. Instead you redeem points for cash or for other options like merchandise. Yet even on that technicality the claim doesn’t hold water.

Let’s grant them that they’re trying to define Autograph as a ‘points card’ and not claiming it’s their best cash back card ever (even though that’s really how to think about the Autograph card).

Do the Wells Fargo marketing people not realize they have a much better actual points card than Autograph right now? Wells Fargo issues the Bilt Mastercard.

Bilt has 3x points-earning too (dining) as well as 2x points-earning (travel) also at no annual fee with richer protections like trip delay and cancellation; primary rental car collision damage waiver (versus secondary with Autograph)

More importantly it’s going to earn far more points for most cardmembers than Autograph will – certainly for anyone who rents rather than owns their home and especially as consumers keep and use the card year after year. The Bilt Mastercard lets cardmembers earn 1 point per dollar spent on rent at no cost. It’s the biggest expense item for most people who rent and the Autograph card will generally earn zero points for that spending while the Bilt card earns up to 100000 points per year. Bilt will earn more points for most than Autograph will .

An Autograph point can be cashed out at a penny apiece. In contrast I’ve valued Bilt points at 1.7 cents each (others like The Points Guy use a higher value) thanks to Bilt’s valuable transfer partners like American AAdvantage United MileagePlus World of Hyatt and more. I still can get 8 to 10 cents per point or more in value against the retail cost of a ticket when redeeming transferred points for international business class travel and I use Hyatt points on especially expensive hotel nights and for the kind of suites you won’t be getting with points off a cash back card that earns 1% on much of your spend. Bilt also offers spending points through their travel portal at 1.25 cents apiece which while not how I prefer to use points is still 25% more value than straight 1% redemption value. Bilt’s points are worth more than Autograph’s.

At the end of the day Wells has a card that earns points in a category no one else can match (rent) that’s the biggest expense item for most customers who spend in the category. Each of their points is far more flexible and worth more. And somehow it’s the Autograph card Wells Fargo is spending money to shout from the rooftops as their best points card ever. What could possibly be going on here?

Big bank marketing claims go through extensive legal review. This isn’t a claim Wells Fargo is making lightly but I’m trying mightily to make sense of it. I’m confident they’re well-meaning here but that makes this even more of a mystery.

Wells Fargo has one of the best most innovative products that’s been introduced in the last year in the Bilt Mastercard. That’s a real coup for Wells because until now the bank hasn’t been a player or even competitive in the ‘points’ space.

Maybe it’s just so new to them (their launch party was just in March) that their executives don’t actually realize what they have? Perhaps marketing and legal just don’t know they have a much better card than the one they’re promoting as their best?

Regardless of the reason the consequence is the same: Wells Fargo is advertising in a way that points customers in the wrong direction that will earn many consumers fewer points and deliver less value. And that’s not something Wells Fargo wants to do as it builds its reputation in consumer cards.

Wells already has the very best no annual fee consumer points card offered by any bank in their portfolio. Think of it as Chase Sapphire Preferred but without the annual fee and better transfer partners too – that earns points on rent at no charge but doesn’t offer a signup bonus. Too bad the card is a well-kept secret even inside their own bank!",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMie2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmhvbGx5d29vZHJlcG9ydGVyLmNvbS9idXNpbmVzcy9idXNpbmVzcy1uZXdzL25ldGZsaXgtc2Vjb25kLXF1YXJ0ZXItZWFybmluZ3MtcmVwb3J0LXN1YnNjcmliZXItZHJvcC0xMjM1MTgwMzQ2L9IBf2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmhvbGx5d29vZHJlcG9ydGVyLmNvbS9idXNpbmVzcy9idXNpbmVzcy1uZXdzL25ldGZsaXgtc2Vjb25kLXF1YXJ0ZXItZWFybmluZ3MtcmVwb3J0LXN1YnNjcmliZXItZHJvcC0xMjM1MTgwMzQ2L2FtcC8?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Netflix Earnings Preview: Wall Street Expects Subscriber Drop and Detail About Its Ad Ambitions,"Morgan Stanley’s Benjamin Swinburne likely won’t be the only one to reference the Kate Bush song featured in Netflix hit series Stranger Things as Wall Street prepares for the global streamer’s second-quarter earnings report on Tuesday.

“Running Up That Hill” the analyst titled his July 12 report referencing the singer’s 1985 track that appeared in Stranger Things season four and then topped charts globally this summer. Like his peers and management Swinburne predicts a second quarter in a row of subscriber losses with Netflix’s 221.6 million global figure likely shrinking. The expert expects Netflix to stay “consistent with global paid net adds guidance (-2 million) but we see potential downside risks from mobile app download trends and we trim our third-quarter net adds (+1.55 million versus prior +2 million) to factor in elevated churn following the release of Stranger Things season 4.” Swinburne also cut his 2023 subscriber growth forecast from 9.3 million to 7.9 million and his price target from $300 to $220 but kept his “equal weight” rating on the stock.

Addressing rising inflation and talk of a recession in more detail Swinburne predicted both could hit Netflix. “Streaming video revenues may prove more vulnerable than expected to a global recession and lower consumer spending levels” he argued. “While Netflix’s leading engagement should help it retain customers its relative price premium is likely an offset as consumers look to trim their streaming bill.”

But the Morgan Stanley expert also touted the streamer’s planned rollout of a cheaper advertising-supported subscription tier. “Tapping into the $160 billion global video advertising spending opportunity in the long term should allow Netflix to drive average revenue per user (ARPU) growth with less reliance on consumer price increases” Swinburne wrote. The analyst concluded by noting that the way investors view Netflix will change over time: “Net adds matter to shares but longer-term ARPU growth expectations matter more.” After all in the past “the majority of Netflix revenue growth came from net adds or customer growth. As the business matures ARPU is shifting from a secondary to a primary driver.” That is why he expects Netflix “to continue to prioritize ARPU growth including continuing to raise prices.”

In a July 12 report Benchmark analyst Matthew Harrigan similarly highlighted: “Tapping into the $160 billion global video advertising spending opportunity in the long term should allow Netflix to drive ARPU growth with less reliance on consumer price increases. In markets with high ad ARPUs like the U.S. Netflix can offer a materially lower priced offering and unlock additional net adds without sacrificing unit economics. Advertising may also prove a consumer-friendly way to monetize password sharing.” Harrigan also noted the changes that the AVOD push could bring to Netflix’s culture. “Departing from its DNA Netflix will also have to divulge full viewing information to satisfy ad market transparency and 3rd-party auditing demands” he argued.

Wells Fargo analyst Steven Cahall in a July 13 report noted that his team’s analysis of monthly active users data implies a second-quarter net subscriber drop of only 1 million. But he stuck to his 2 million decline forecast in line with management guidance. “The main driver of our unchanged estimates is low conviction as we think the historically correlated metrics are less relevant at present for Netflix which appears to be experiencing a new phase of customer churn” he explained. “As such prior correlations are proving less reliable and we do not believe there is sufficient evidence to imply a bullish call into earnings.” And he highlighted: “We also have a downside bias on second-half estimates including sub growth pressure and a foreign exchange headwind to financials.”

So what should investors expect from Netflix in terms of subscriber forecasts for the current quarter? “We sense low conviction across the Street so this is another wait and see quarter with investors likely resetting afterwards” Cahall wrote.

Bank of America analyst Nat Schindler in a June 23 report reiterated his “underperform” rating on Netflix but cut his price target from $240 to $196 “given current market conditions rising costs of content production in addition to several potential costly initiatives.” Schindler added: “Overall while our survey indicates Netflix is currently consumers’ top choice we believe our results are indicative that streaming has very quickly become a commoditized product following the pandemic with original content being a key differentiating factor for a user to subscribe to the service.”

The domestic subscription run-up for Netflix “seems to be at or very near its peak” the Bank of America analyst argued. “The availability of more services in addition to more compelling competitor value propositions have led customers to subscribe to more services on the whole while still keeping Netflix. If a recession were to take hold however it wouldn’t be surprising to see incremental churn.”

Near-term it remains all about sub trends after all. Cowen analyst John Blackledge highlighted as much in his earnings preview which had this takeaway: “Net-net we expect investors will remain focused on net sub trajectory at the (earnings report) as well as third-quarter guide.” He forecasts a paid net decline of 2 million users “given macro competition and password sharing.” But he slightly raised his 2023 net adds projection due to the upcoming ad tier.

“Netflix shares are down 46 percent since first-quarter earnings on 4/19 (and down 69 percent year-to-date) with the pullback reflecting the broader trend among tech sector shares as well as Netflix-specific challenges (high existing penetration in some markets along with password sharing increased competition and macro issues)” Blackledge highlighted. “Meanwhile the stock pullback has led to more attractive valuation in our view ahead of the service’s likely introduction of an ad-supported tier that we estimate could add about 4 million incremental U.S./Canada subs and significant upside to ’23 U.S./Canada revenue.”

Wall Street does expect more updates on a planned crackdown on password sharing and launch of a cheaper AVOD meaning advertising-supported subscriber tier. After all Netflix on July 13 unveiled that it has picked Microsoft as its global advertising technology and sales partner. “We expect more detail on the AVOD rollout password sharing and any rethink to the content strategy to stimulate sub growth” Cahall said. “We think the bias for second-half estimate revisions is downward.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiV2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LndkYXlyYWRpb25vdy5jb20vbmV3cy9uYXRpb25hbC1uZXdzLzUwODI5LWNpdGlncm91cC1lYXJuaW5ncy1iZWF0LWVzdGltYXRlc9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Citigroup earnings beat estimates,"(New York NY) -- Citigroup earnings are beating estimates by a lot.

The jury deliberated for about an hour Friday before ruling Wells Fargo Bank breached a contract with Bolus. The panel awarded only nominal damages however after finding Bolus suffered no harm.

The verdict reached after a five-day trial before Judge Julia Munley is a stinging loss for Bolus who as of February was seeking $2.5 million in damages and rejected a $300000 settlement offer according to a joint pretrial statement filed on April 22.

Bolus filed suit in 2004 against First Union Corporation which later merged with Wachovia Corporation doing business as First Union Bank. Wells Fargo assumed the case after it merged with Wachovia in 2008.

According to the lawsuit Bolus owner of Bolus Truck Sales and Parts temporarily lost access to money in his business accounts after former bank employee Richard Gray transferred funds from the accounts without Bolus's knowledge or permission.

Gray was charged with a federal count of bank fraud in 2004 relating to another person's account at the bank. He pleaded guilty to the offense in December 2004 and was sentenced to five months in prison.

Bolus discovered the issue with his account and demanded the money be restored on May 22 2002. The bank investigated fired Gray and credited his account on June 14 2002 according to court documents.

In closing arguments Friday Bolus's attorney Michael Melnick of Shavertown told jurors that delay financially harmed Bolus because he bounced several checks and also lost out on the purchase of a North Carolina property he alleged would have netted him at least a $225000 profit.

The bank's attorney Andrew Soven of Philadelphia said evidence showed no checks bounced because they were covered by overdraft protection from another account. He also said there was no written evidence Bolus made an offer on the North Carolina property.

Story continues

""He is looking for a windfall and looking for money he did not deserve"" he said in his closing. ""He thought 'I got a bank and people don't like banks.""

Although the case was filed in 2004 it sat largely dormant until 2016. The long delay in bringing the case to trial created issues for both Bolus and the bank because some documents including bank statements that might have supported their respective positions were not available.

Speaking after the trial Bolus said part of the delay was caused because he was fighting to obtain documents for years. He finally had to forgo them and take the case to trial. He said he is considering an appeal.

""We believe the verdict was wrong"" Bolus said. ""The bank allowed a thief to be there and we were damaged by what he did.""

Officials with Wells Fargo declined to comment Friday.

For years Amazon tried – and ultimately failed – to translate its online book business into successful brick and mortar bookstores. Dozens of stores were shuttered this spring. Now the online shopping giant is trying again this time attempting to reinvent the mall clothing store.

During the pandemic Amazon pushed past Walmart to become the number one clothing retailer in the US analysts from Wells Fargo concluded last year. The company is billing its new store as an ambitious fusion of its online shopping algorithm with an in-person shopping experience.

The first Amazon Style store which opened in Glendale California a suburb of Los Angeles in May allows customers to use a smartphone app to send clothes directly to their fitting rooms rather than carrying them around and offers additional clothing recommendations from the company’s algorithms.

Clad in company lanyards employees at the front of the store greet customers and offer help navigating the smartphone app and the store’s free WiFi and phone chargers. And there are plenty of other Amazon employees at work behind the scenes swiftly delivering new outfit picks to the “magic closet” in each dressing room.

But the store is designed to make many of its staff invisible: customers can use a dressing room touchscreen to summon a pair of pants in a different size or a shirt in a different color without having to see or speak to another human being.

“It’s something new something you’ve never seen before. It’s an experience rather than just a regular store” said Marshall Sanders 28.

‘Hi-tech’ but limited

In person Amazon Style feels a bit like what someone in the 1990s might have imagined “hi-tech” shopping would look like in 2020.

The store features a mix of known and even high-end brands such as Levi’s Vince and Theory with the more obscure brands and cheap in-house clothing lines that Amazon customers are used to finding on the website. There are racks of $200 or $300 blouses in a “premium” section but more racks of cheaply made T-shirts in trendy prints and sack-like floral dresses.

Scan a summery floral Rebecca Taylor dress which was offered for the discounted price of $276.50 and under “related items” Amazon’s shopping app might recommend a floral dress in a similar color for $41.25.

Several customers shopping at the Glendale store said the retail store’s selection was limited and didn’t live up to the experience of shopping on Amazon’s online marketplace.

Dana Roo and Diana Guerrero both 25 had come from the west side of Los Angeles and San Diego specifically to check out the new Amazon store but were disappointed by the lack of bargains they enjoy online. For them Amazon was a place to find good “dupes” of higher-end clothes like Ugg’s fuzzy lounge sets Roo said. The brick-and-mortar store was offering only original sets.

View image in fullscreen Dressing rooms in Amazon Style unlock using an app on a smartphone and are already filled with a customers’ selected clothing. Photograph: Courtesy of Amazon

The store’s clothing options are organized thematically in sections with names such as “rustic grace” “feminine strength” “Y2k” and more pragmatically “night out tops under $35”. The app sends an alert when the dressing room is ready and the phone unlocks the dressing room door.

The dressing rooms are bright and clean with a glowing lightstrip around the mirror and a message welcoming them by name on a touchscreen. Details about the customers’ selected clothes are on the screen as well as a list of new clothing picks including recommendations for matching tops shoes and bags to “finish the look”.

Swiping through outfit options on a touch screen is an experience straight out of Clueless though it remains to be seen whether Amazon’s algorithm will create Cher-inspired looks.

The main gimmick of Amazon Style is what one corporate director has called the “magic closet” in the fitting rooms. Close the door on the empty closet press a few buttons on the touchscreen and wait. A warning light will glow red there will be some rustlings in the closet and then a sudden glow of light around the door: open it and the clothes requested are there.

Amazon makes sure to keep the workers who fill its new magic closets out of sight: the “closet” door locks from the fitting room side when employees are at work in the closet for shoppers’ privacy according to a sign in the dressing room. The closet’s back door to the employee side is also locked from the inside.

Amazon touts that its quick clothing delivery is made possible through the “advanced technologies and processes used in Amazon fulfillment centers” which have also made headlines for years for grueling working conditions and high injury rates. So far Amazon has not let the public see what is happening in the rooms on the other side of its “magic closets”.

An Amazon press spokesperson declined a request for a behind-the-scenes tour. Asked about working conditions behind the scenes at Amazon Style the company touted what it called its competitive pay and good benefits and said that the store’s employees have the ability to try different roles throughout the store.

The human element

When Amazon announced its new clothing store concept in January ahead of the store’s official launch some critics saw it as an attempt to make human sales associates obsolete.

Many big box clothing stores are understaffed and their employees stretched too thin to provide many personal recommendations Rachel Kraus wrote in Mashable which meant that Amazon’s algorithmic shopping could be a better option for some customers. At the same time Kraus argued “I’m not sure an app telling me I’d look great in this top would give me the confidence boost that’s all part of the fun of in-person shopping.”

In a statement Amazon said that its front-of-store employees who provide customers with human recommendations and assistance were essential to the Amazon Style experience and would continue to be part of the store’s operations even as customers grew more accustomed to using the shopping app.

The Glendale store currently employs hundreds of people many of them with previous experience in the clothing industry Amazon said. Because employees at the front of the store did not have to spend time restocking sizes on the floor it suggested employees would have more time to interact with customers and provide recommendations.

Customers who had browsed inside the new California store this month praised the friendly front-of-store employees though many were divided on whether they liked the overall concept: some said they found it “really cool” and innovative others the experience was overwhelming and some said the in-store clothing selection was underwhelming compared with what they could find online.

Sanders the 28-year-old had not been a huge Amazon shopper previously but said he planned to encourage his friends to try the store.

Inside his fitting room Amazon’s algorithm offered Sanders items similar to what he had already picked – “two expensive things and two cheaper things” – and he ended up purchasing one of them he said without even realizing he had done so.

Le said the “anti-social” aspect of the store appealed to her but wasn’t a big fan of the quality of Amazon’s clothes. And she saw deeper problems: the store’s “cool concept” was also “classist” and “causes a lot of disparities” since people without smartphones would not be able to shop.

An Amazon spokesperson said that people without smartphones are welcome to shop in the store and that they would be assisted by a store employee throughout the shopping process.

This article was amended on 18 July to add comment from Amazon about the option to shop in the store without a smartphone."

The latter does not play a major role in terms of rigidity as the ""box"" with its rounded corners is already stable in itself.

The same applies to the display which can only be twisted to a limited extent. Pressure on the back hardly causes any dents and no streaks emerge on the panel. The mono-hinge keeps the lid taut enough but is not too rigid that it prevents opening with one hand. One-finger opening is possible. When opened the bottom of the screen slides under the chassis and raises it but only between opening angles of 130 to 180 degrees.

A small flaw comes to light in the summer heat: the lower display frame is glued which bulges and remains in this state even after cooling down.

His long-term partnership with Hawkins Way a Beverly Hills-based real estate private equity fund is believed to be the only NIL deal of its kind. Williams is the only known college football player to pursue equity as part of his NIL portfolio. He now “owns a stake in a men’s grooming company (Faculty) an NFT marketplace (Hall of GOATs) and most recently a mood-altering sunglasses company (FutureMood).” * snip * As the conversation continued it crystallized just how much the Williamses had already considered their criteria. If it didn’t serve a specific purpose in Caleb’s portfolio it was ruled out. If the deal required too much of Caleb’s time or distracted from football or school (father) Carl said “it doesn’t matter what it paid it’s off the table.” They stayed away from short-term mass-produced deals that amounted to quick cash grabs and turned down national campaigns that featured multiple players so as to set Caleb apart from the pack. Instead they sought long-term agreements in which Caleb’s success could directly help the brand grow — and in turn help his bottom line.

USC former Heisman Trophy winner Matt Leinart is teaming up with Caleb Williams to launch a new NFT platform for current college athletes to generate digital collectables through their name image and likeness (NIL) rights. The project is called “Hall of G.O.A.T.S.” and will specifically target high school and college athletes.

A solar array added to the company’s facility at 11811 E. 51st St. became operational last week. The 400 kilowatts of power will produce roughly 20% of the annual electricity needs for that 110000-square-foot building said David Rossi senior manager for the Atlanta-based Cox Enterprises’ engineering and sustainability team.

“Through clean renewable power coming from the sun it allows us reduce our carbon impact for this one facility by over 580 tons of carbon per year” Rossi said by phone.

Cox which employs about 500 people in Tulsa has sunk more than $130 million nationally in conservation and sustainability efforts since the start of Cox Conserves the company’s national sustainability program in 2007 he said. The company has done 53 solar projects nationwide in the past 15 years said Gene Coleman who manages operation and maintenance for the company’s renewable assets.

The Tulsa installation encompasses 900 roughly 20-square-foot panels Rossi said. The system also has five inverters devices that convert direct current electricity which a solar panel generates to alternating current which the electric grid uses.

“If there happens to be a time say on a weekend or a holiday when our facility is mostly vacant there could be some times when we push power back to the grid and share that renewable energy with the community” Rossi said. “But more than likely it’s all behind the meter which is true distributed generation with the intent that this power comes to our facility directly.”

Oklahoma ranks 45th nationally in solar energy with 0.18% of the state’s energy coming from the sun according to the Solar Energy Industries Association.

The U.S. Energy Information Administration said earlier this year that solar power is on track to account for nearly half of the country’s new electric generation.

In 2022 it expects 46.1 gigawatts of new utility-scale electric generating capacity to be added to the U.S. power grid. Almost half of the planned 2022 capacity additions are solar followed by natural gas at 21% and wind at 17%.

Since the mid-2000s the the federal government has incentivized homeowners and businesses to switch to solar through an investment tax credit also known as the federal solar tax credit. Currently it allows consumers to claim 26% of the total cost of their solar system installation on their federal taxes.

“Really just three years ago was when the door kind of opened up” Rossi said. “The price of solar has come down enough where we can start to work in areas where just a few years ago wouldn’t have penciled out for a project.”

Those areas of concentration have moved from the coasts to the middle of the country.

“California is a no-brainer for us financially” he said. “Their cost of power is extremely high and I can really make a pencil project there. But their grid is so green I don’t get a whole lot of carbon reduction from the same size project in California as I do in Oklahoma.

“While not as cost-effective in Oklahoma the carbon reduction we get from this project is quite extensive compared to the same-size project we can get elsewhere in the country.”

The ""good times"" for crypto miners really do seem to be coming to an end.

Just last month it was reported that Bitcoin miners were selling off more Bitcoin than they were bringing in in order to cover their energy costs during the crypto crash which saw the token plummet in value. With energy costs rising as well mining companies were seeing profits dwindle from their mining endeavors.

Now cryptocurrency miners have a new issue on their hands: U.S. Congress.

Congressional Democrats led by Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts are looking into crypto mining requirements that would force mining companies to report their energy usage.

Senator Warren along with five other Democratic members of Congress wrote a letter to the Environmental Protection Agency and Department of Energy requesting that the two agencies work together to create rules requiring crypto mining companies to report on their energy use and emissions data.

The move comes according to the New York Times  after an investigation into seven of the United States' largest Bitcoin mining companies. The inquiry found that these Bitcoin miners are heading towards using up ""as much as 1045 megawatts of power or enough electricity to power all the residences in a city the size of Houston."" Houston is Texas' most populous city and the fourth largest in the country with more than 2.3 million residents.

""The results of our investigation which gathered data from just seven companies are disturbing with this limited data alone revealing that cryptominers are large energy users that account for a significant – and rapidly growing – amount of carbon emissions"" reads the letter.

The letter points out that miners' energy use is also passing on additional costs for those who live and work in the cities where they are based. Notably the Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT) which operates Texas' power grid has had to ask crypto miners in the state to voluntarily shut down operations when energy demands spike due to heatwaves.

The largely-unregulated cryptocurrency mining industry uses massive amounts of energy due to the high-powered computer processing power necessary in order to validate transactions on the blockchain. In exchange for successfully guessing the random string of numbers required to put a block on the chain miners are rewarded with Bitcoin. As time goes on this process becomes more difficult and the Bitcoin remuneration will be cut in half.

According to the report one mining company Marathon Digital Holdings plans to grow its operation from its current 33000 mining rigs to 199000 rigs by early 2023. Right now the company powers its operation thanks to a Montana-based energy company that generates electricity by burning coal.

With crypto miners set to use up even more energy in the near future it seems Senator Warren's letter is a step towards monitoring the industry and possibly passing regulations to curtail at least some of its more destructive behavior.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiiQFodHRwczovL3d3dy5tYW5zaW9uZ2xvYmFsLmNvbS9hcnRpY2xlcy9tYW5oYXR0YW5zLXVwcGVyLXdlc3Qtc2lkZS1zZWVzLXJlbmV3ZWQtaW50ZXJlc3QtYXMtbmV3LWRldmVsb3BtZW50cy1vcGVuLXRvLXJlc2lkZW50cy0wMTY1ODA1NTQyMdIBjQFodHRwczovL3d3dy5tYW5zaW9uZ2xvYmFsLmNvbS9hbXAvYXJ0aWNsZXMvbWFuaGF0dGFucy11cHBlci13ZXN0LXNpZGUtc2Vlcy1yZW5ld2VkLWludGVyZXN0LWFzLW5ldy1kZXZlbG9wbWVudHMtb3Blbi10by1yZXNpZGVudHMtMDE2NTgwNTU0MjE?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Manhattan’s Upper West Side Sees Renewed Interest as New Developments Open to Residents,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 404 Client Error: Not Found for url: https://www.mansionglobal.com/articles/manhattans-upper-west-side-sees-renewed-interest-as-new-developments-open-to-residents-01658055421 on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiiQFodHRwczovL3d3dy5tYW5zaW9uZ2xvYmFsLmNvbS9hcnRpY2xlcy9tYW5oYXR0YW5zLXVwcGVyLXdlc3Qtc2lkZS1zZWVzLXJlbmV3ZWQtaW50ZXJlc3QtYXMtbmV3LWRldmVsb3BtZW50cy1vcGVuLXRvLXJlc2lkZW50cy0wMTY1ODA1NTQyMdIBjQFodHRwczovL3d3dy5tYW5zaW9uZ2xvYmFsLmNvbS9hbXAvYXJ0aWNsZXMvbWFuaGF0dGFucy11cHBlci13ZXN0LXNpZGUtc2Vlcy1yZW5ld2VkLWludGVyZXN0LWFzLW5ldy1kZXZlbG9wbWVudHMtb3Blbi10by1yZXNpZGVudHMtMDE2NTgwNTU0MjE?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen

Her Philosophies

On being an entrepreneur having worked for several organisations she said:

“There are challenges but when you are focussed dedicated and determined you will scale through all the hurdles. Looking back I thank God how far He has helped me.

“I’m a very passionate person. If I believe in anything I put in everything to make it work. In fact I do tell people that since I started here it’s as if I’m not working because when I was on the other side I put in so much. Then sometimes I had to work late into the night. But starting this company I’m not burdened because once you are used to hard work you don’t believe that there is a challenge you can’t overcome.”

Being a woman determined to excel in a corporate world she said is a challenge.

“So the challenge I faced most was that people rarely believed in me as a woman. People sometimes think women won’t be able to deliver. It’s a major challenge and as a female you have to do a lot for you to be recognised and given the opportunity to express yourself. I must say it’s tough for women. As a woman you have a home to run apart from work meaning you have to work much more than a man” she pointed out.",,,,,,,,,,,,

Beyond the intoxicating whirligig of casinos concerts and costumed performers local neighbourhoods are blooming with street art while hiking trails offer desert vistas.

This article was adapted from National Geographic Traveller (UK).

Las Vegas is a monument to human ingenuity and vice; capitalist performance art let loose in the outer reaches of the Mojave Desert; a neon-lit oasis existing solely to entertain us. Each year up to 40 million people visit the city of just 635000 residents that’s home to the world’s biggest tourist trap: the Strip. Many travellers might feel predisposed to dislike Sin City for its brashness its lurid aesthetic its populist appeal — but I find its unique brew of hedonism and heart intoxicating.



My first stop is the residential Arts District. In March 2020 when casinos on the Strip were closed for an record six weeks in response to the pandemic the focus shifted to other neighbourhoods. Consequentially here and in Downtown local artists were hired to paint murals. Today Frida Kahlo smiles down on me on a Main Street full of small businesses including craft breweries and vintage clothes shops. Many Americans are now moving to Vegas; it’s not just the sunshine good salaries and affordable housing that lure them but the thriving culinary scene and community feel.



The Vegas that most visitors flock to is the Strip a cartoonish theme park of a boulevard serving up a sensory overload. As a blonde American gondolier sings to me beautifully in Italian as she paddles me around The Venetian Las Vegas hotel it dawns on me: this place isn’t meant to be authentic; it’s a world of make-believe.



But that doesn’t mean there aren’t real thrills to be had. At dusk I drink delicious cocktails covered in glittery pop rocks at a bar made to look like a fantasy facsimile of 19th-century Europe; I watch The Beatles LOVE by Cirque du Soleil and am brought to tears by its intensity; then almost as a rite of passage I forfeit the contents of my purse to a slot machine. There are worlds here to explore and when it comes time to leave I’ve barely scratched the surface.



To entice new people to visit and others to return Las Vegas continues to grow and change launching bigger casinos more exotic restaurants and sexier shows. Dozens of new attractions and events will open this week and dozens more the next. Vegas rolls with novelty and innovation and the house always wins.

See & do



Cruise The Strip at night: Where else can you find a pyramid-shaped hotel shooting a beam of light into space a shimmering half-size Eiffel Tower and a thousand dancing lit-up fountains all within a four-mile stroll? Join the throngs for the must-see most Vegasy part of Vegas: the Strip. The bridge linking the MGM Grand and New York-New York Hotel & Casino has some of the best views over the cacophony of neon lights. Next weave through audacious air-conditioned casinos where slot machines chortle and ping snapping photos with costumed staff — from feather-clad dancers to Roman legionaries.



See a show: There’s always something new on (Katy Perry Sting and Usher are some of the musicians set to perform this summer) but there are classic residencies too: opt for magician Criss Angel or the Blue Man Group for an evening to remember. The five Cirque du Soleil shows currently playing each at a different resort are unique to Vegas with over-the-top water-based O being the hottest ticket.



Experience Fremont Street: North of the Strip in Downtown this is the original gambling district — and it could easily feel like a 1970s time capsule but for that fact the world’s largest (1500ft long) video screen serves as a canopy covering all five blocks. The gambling and entertainment hub capitalises on the area’s seedy roots: here electric guitar players busk next to lingerie-clad women holding signs proclaiming ‘dances for cigarettes and vodka’. Continue east and you’ll come to the open-air section of the street the Fremont East District which brims with bars and restaurants.



Explore AREA15: Discover alternate universes at this vast immersive entertainment zone. They include Omega Mart a ‘supermarket’ where a fridge leads to an alien world of slides and staircases. Expand your mind in the mirror rooms of Wink World or head to Lost Spirits Distillery where an immersive distillery tour takes you through a recreation of 19th-century London. Next door newly opened Illuminarium offers virtual safaris undersea adventures and more via ‘video transport technology’.



Visit ‘foreign cities’: Las Vegas serves up the European dream in spades. Crooning gondoliers paddle punters past a replica Saint Mark’s Square at The Venetian Las Vegas while at the new Vanderpump à Paris restaurant at the Paris Las Vegas hotel settle into a belle époque sofa for cocktails served in Louvre Pyramid-shaped glasses. You can also time travel: sample ancient Rome at Caesars Palace or the era of the Egyptian pharaohs at the Luxor Hotel & Casino. For a conceptual hop across the US grab a drink at a corner bar off Times Square at the New York-New York Hotel & Casino.



Day trip to the Hoover Dam: This 726ft-high dam provides electricity to around 1.3 million households. Visit the Boulder City-Hoover Dam Museum before taking a tour of the inner workings of this engineering masterpiece. Adjacent Lake Mead has myriad tours from cruises on a Mississippi-style paddle steamer to kayaking. It’s all a 40-minute drive from the Strip.

Buy



Fergusons downtown: The rooms of this former motel host local artists and fashion designers as well as artisans selling handmade T-shirts soap and more. There’s also a cafe a regular pop-up craft market and the Vegas Test Kitchen where local chefs can try out their recipes during three-month residencies.



Shopping malls: Casino winners love to spend their spoils at high-roller malls like the Grande Canal Shoppes or The Shops at Crystal. Fashion Show Las Vegas is a mall for clothes hounds looking to dress to impress while at opposite ends of the city Las Vegas North and South Premium Outlets are where to go for brands from Prada to Levi’s.



The Writer’s Block: Need to get away from the lights and the hubbub of the Strip? There’s no better place than this bookshop with its floor-to-ceiling windows potted plants and aroma of freshly ground arabica wafting from the coffee shop.

Sleep



Golden Nugget: Lovers of kitsch will adore Fremont Street’s most distinctive hotel. Rooms are run-of-the-mill but amenities include a swimming pool surrounding a fish tank and one of the most lively and colourful casinos on the ground floor. Don’t stay here if sleep is a priority but fun is right on your doorstep.



Nobu Hotel at Caesars Palace: This sumptuous hotel is hidden away inside the massive bustling Caesars Palace making it feel like a secret and serene oasis. The Japanese aesthetic adds class and creativity to the good-value rooms.

ARIA Sky Suites: Superlative in both its physical height and luxury these ultra-modern apartment-sized suites offer a dedicated concierge service pool access and deluxe airport transfers. The expansive views over the city from the floor-to-ceiling windows in the bedroom dining and living rooms are postcard-perfect.

Eat



Famous Foods Street Eats: This globe-trotting food court has everything from sushi and fried chicken to authentic Southeast Asian noodle dishes. At night slip into the well-hidden speakeasy — the discrete entrance is behind a shelf lined with lucky cat figurines.



Esther’s Kitchen: When renowned chef James Trees opened his restaurant in the Arts District in 2018 people thought his choice of location was lunacy. But the food — simple Italian-inspired fare with a focus on fine ingredients — attracted so many accolades that Esther’s Kitchen sparked a wave of interest in the neighbourhood. Don’t miss the sourdough bread with a whipped basil ricotta topping.



Delilahs: Get your Great Gatsby on at this ritzy supper club where a diva belts out jazz tunes under crystal chandeliers to tables of finely dressed diners. The beef wellington is a rival to Gordon Ramsay’s and there’s a strict no-photo policy owing to the fact that many celebrities like to spend their evenings here.

After hours



Atomic Liquors: Opened in 1952 Las Vegas’s oldest bar was a favourite watering hole for workers at an atomic bomb test site 50 miles away. It’s said that nuclear explosions could be watched from the roof and it later became a hangout for the Rat Pack.



Lake of Dreams: At this surreal lakeside show at Wynn Las Vegas hop between three cocktail bars: the opulent Overlook Lounge Asia-inspired Bar Parasol and Aft Cocktail Deck which has superyacht vibes. The cocktails mixed here by Mariena Mercer Boarini are as creative as they are delicious and you’ll have the surreal perk of being serenaded across the lake by a giant mechanical frog.



Marquee Nightclub & Dayclub: Celebrity DJs spin EDM house and hip hop amid light shows to crowds of up to 5000 revellers dancing the night away. It morphs into a day club in the morning when the party rolls on in infinity pools and at an outdoor party deck.

Like a local



Take a hike: Las Vegas has outstanding desert hiking with many trailheads under an hour’s drive from Downtown. Try the 2.2-mile trail from Calico Tanks into Red Rock Canyon which winds over pink sandstone hills and ends at a magnificent viewpoint overlooking the Strip.



Chinatown: This three-mile stretch of Spring Mountain Road commonly known as Chinatown Vegas is lined with strip malls. But behind this shabby veneer are some of Vegas’s most interesting bars and restaurants. Head to kitschy The Golden Tiki where any drink can be set on fire for $1 (80p); the Sand Dollar Lounge for blues and occasional surprise performances by ZZ Top’s Billy Gibbons; or restaurants like Shanghai Taste for authentic xiao long bao.



Arts District: Covered with murals by local artists and famous for its monthly First Friday street festival which features live music and food trucks this up-and-coming neighbourhood is the place to go for craft beer art galleries and eclectic shops.

Getting there & around

British Airways and Virgin Atlantic offer nonstop daily flights from Heathrow. Other carriers such as Iberia American Airlines and United Airlines offer one-stop flights via US hubs.



Average flight time: 10h30m.



It’s possible to explore most of Las Vegas’s main attractions on foot by taxi or by monorail. The latter is the best way to travel around the Strip with a two-day pass costing $29 (£23).Many hotels outside of the centre offer free shuttle buses to the Strip. For sights further afield book a tour or rent a car from companies such as Sixt and Budget.

When to go

September to October and March to April have the most comfortable temperatures and clear skies. Peak summer (June to mid September) can be scalding with temperatures climbing to around 38C while December to February can cool to as low as 7C with more chance of rain.

""I'm feeling super good"" Tedeschi stated after his victory. ""This was my last tournament of the series and in Las Vegas. I was losing like every day every day every day and then for the last one finally I get it!""

Across three starting flights 2190 entrants attempted to grab a piece of the $3175500 prize pool. However only 239 survivors made it to Day 2 with a min-cash of $2350 and an opportunity to take home a six-figure score even if they finished nowhere near the final table thanks to the mystery bounty format.

Every time a player eliminated an opponent they were given a chance to pull a slip of paper from a drum and instantly win between $500 and $100000. There were three $100000 bounties up for grabs and they were claimed by Andrei Stoenescu David To and Shouyi Gao. Those who didn't find the highest prize still had a shot at big money as five $50000 bounties and eight $25000 bounties were also claimed by fortunate folks on the felt.

Action of the Day

The day started with 239 returning players and the action started swiftly with the incentive of the mystery bounty. The first top bounty was found prior to the first break by Stoenescu and within those first two hours of the day the field was already whittled down to nearly half.

After the first break the players grinded it out on the felt for a few more hours and just before they headed off to the dinner break To pulled the second $100000 bounty. Then near the end of the dinner break Gao decided to redeem one of his mystery bounties and as luck would have it he excitedly pulled the final top bounty prize.

David To Winning $100000 Mystery Bounty

Several notables were in the field but they fell at various points during the day including Shannon Shorr Ryan Laplante Jason Wheeler Sohale Khalili Karina Jett and Shankar Pillai.

When the remaining contenders returned from dinner the eliminations continued quickly and three tables turned into ten players in roughly two hours. During this time a short-stacked Tedeschi scored two doubles in a short period and he never relented from there en route to his eventual victory.

Play then slowed down considerably with the final table on the horizon. It took another hour and a half before Kurt Jewell was eliminated in tenth place and the remaining players converged on a single table with Tedeschi having built his stack up to the chip lead.

The eliminations once again continued at a brisk pace as Jason Nablo fell in ninth to Tedeschi before eventual runner-up Light won a massive pot that propelled him to the top of the counts when his pocket queens held and he eliminated Michael Marder in eighth and Nicolas Plantin in seventh.

Final Table

Tom Kinney was next to go in sixth when his pocket kings were cracked by Light and David To made his way to the payout desk soon after in fifth when his ducks couldn't hold against Tedeschi. Adrian State was then pipped by Tedeschi's superior ace and was knocked out in fourth place.

Viliyan Petleshkov was the clear short stack when three-handed play began and ran right into Tedeschi's pocket aces to bring the tournament heads up with fairly even stacks. All of the players at the final table were knocked out by either Tedeschi or Light and the two remaining players went on a short break. They discussed a deal before resuming play and ultimately settled on an agreement that gave Tedeschi the title and the glamorous Wynn trophy.

Deputies with the Larimer County Sheriff’s Office responded to reports of a camping trailer that had been washed away in the Buckhorn Road area west of Fort Collins said David Moore a spokesman with the department. A woman and a girl in the trailer did not survive.

Multiple emergency crews with Larimer County reported moderate flooding in the Glen Haven area and significant flooding in the Crystal Mountain area. Buckhorn Road was washed out near mile marker 25 on County Road 27. Private bridges and culverts were also washed out.

One home a cabin located in the 700 block of Granite Road was destroyed. The occupants were reported safe. No other deaths injuries or missing people were reported from the floods.

The National Weather Service in Boulder said Friday’s flash floods were caused by a strong thunderstorm that produced 1 to 2 inches of rain within a short period of time. Meteorologist David Barjenbruch said a flash flood threat remains in the area Saturday.

“That moisture decreases a little bit but we can’t let our guards down” Barjenbruch said. “There is still some threat of flash flooding in the burn area today just not as great as yesterday.”

Buckhorn Road is closed with no estimated time for reopening. The Larimer County Office of Emergency Management assessed the damage Saturday.

The area has been vulnerable to flash flooding due to wildfires most recently the Cameron Peak and East Troublesome fires because there is no vegetation to absorb water. Barjenbruch describes the soil as “hydrophobic.”

“They won’t absorb any rainfall or a very limited amount of rainfall. And then that water is basically like it’s falling on a piece of glass and it’s just shooting off the mountain side” Barjenbruch said.

The National Weather Service advises those living in burn scars especially in mountainous regions to have multiple communication methods to receive alerts and keep contact in emergency situations. The Larimer County Sheriff’s Office said people located in burn scars and who are concerned about their safety during a flash flood should seek higher ground.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxlZ2FjeS5jb20vY2Evb2JpdHVhcmllcy9jaHJvbmljbGVqb3VybmFsL25hbWUvcGVra2Etc2FsbGFzdmFhcmEtb2JpdHVhcnk_aWQ9Mzk5ODQ0NznSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Pekka Sallasvaara Obituary (2022) - Thunder Bay ON - The Thunder Bay Chronicle Journal,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.legacy.com/ca/obituaries/chroniclejournal/name/pekka-sallasvaara-obituary?id=39984479 on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxlZ2FjeS5jb20vY2Evb2JpdHVhcmllcy9jaHJvbmljbGVqb3VybmFsL25hbWUvcGVra2Etc2FsbGFzdmFhcmEtb2JpdHVhcnk_aWQ9Mzk5ODQ0NznSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,,,,,,,,,

The Beatles created an iconic album cover in 1969 where the singers were crossing the crosswalk on Abbey Road. Over the years this crosswalk has become iconic for fans and for everyone visiting Britain this is an iconic place to visit recreate the album cover and take photographs. Tourists often rely on Google Maps to get directions and sadly it is leading them to a wrong zebra crossing.

Reports from the British media now say that Google Maps is sending fans and tourists to a wrong zebra crossing. Hence for those who have faint idea about the whereabouts of this location they are found recreating the album cover on a crossing 1Km from the actual spot. Maps is directing people to the crossing near the Abbey Medical Centre. Since Uber drivers also use Google Maps to navigate they have often been found dropping people at this spot.

Google Maps gets the Beatles crossing wrong

A report from the Independent.ie says that several travellers have been visiting the wrong crosswalk taking pictures and recreating Album cover at the wrong spot. Leilani May 16 a Californian tourist travelling around Europe with friends said “That's embarrassing we were taking a picture on a random spot. We were wondering why nobody else was here. It's Google Maps' fault.”

“We are both Beatles fans and wanted the picture so we came here but Google maps sent us to the wrong place – we're going back tomorrow. It's 10 minutes wasted” said another couple from Mexico.

Shion Hayasaka resident of that area in north-west London said “I've seen them once or twice. I saw them doing the Beatles walk and that's how I knew it was them. I almost told them and then I thought they are just having a lovely time I don't want to ruin their day.”

While Google is yet to rectify the mistake on the Maps and issue a statement a simple workaround for Beatles fans is to search for the following place – The Beatles Crosswalk. This will guide you to the exact location of the iconic zebra crossing.",,,,,,,,,,,,

After institutional review board approval we retrospectively collected all radiographs taken between June 1 2011 and Dec 1 2020 at one university hospital. The images are collected by Neusoft PACS/RIS Version 5.5 on a personal computer running Windows 10. We confirm that all methods were performed in accordance with the relevant guidelines and regulations. Images were collected from surgeries performed by 3 fellowship-trained arthroplasty surgeons to ensure a variety of implant manufacturers and implant designs. At the time of collection images had all identifying information removed and were thus de-identified. Implant type was identified through the primary surgery operative note and crosschecked with implant sheets. Implant designs were only included in our analysis if more than 30 images per model were identified14.

From the medical records of 313 patients a total of 357 images were included in this analysis.

Although Zimmer and Biomet merged (Zimmer Biomet) these were treated as two distinct manufacturers. The following 4 designs from the four industry leading manufacturers were included: Biomet Echo Bi-Metric (Zimmer Biomet) Biomet Universal RingLoc (Zimmer Biomet) Depuy Corail (Depuy Synthes) Depuy Pinnacle (Depuy Synthes) LINK Lubinus SP II LINK Vario cup and Zimmer Versys FMT and Trilogy (Zimmer Biomet). Implant designs that did not meet the 30-implant threshold were not included. Figure 1 demonstrated an example of Cup and Stem anterior–posterior (AP) radiographs of each included implant design. The four types of implants are denoted as type A type B type C and type D respectively in this paper.

Overview of framework

We used convolutional neural network-based (CNN) algorithms for classification of hip implants. Our training data consist of images of anteroposterior (AP) view of the hips. For each image we manually cut the image into two parts: the stem and the cup. We will train four CNN models the first one using stem images (stem network) the second one using cup images (cup network) and the third one using the original uncut images (combined network). The fourth one is an integration of the models trained with stem network and the cup network (joint network).

Since the models involve millions of parameters while our data set only contained less than one thousand images it was infeasible to train a CNN model from scratch using our data. Therefore we adopted the transfer learning framework to train our networks17. The transfer learning framework is a paradigm in the machine learning literature that is widely applied in scenarios where the training data is scarce compared to the scale of the model18. Under the transfer learning framework the model is first initialized to some model pretrained with other data sets that contain enough data for a different but related task. Then we tune the model using our data set by performing gradient descent (backward-propagation) only on the last two layers of the networks. As the parameters in the last two layers of the network are comparable with the size of our data set (for the target task) and the parameters in the previous layers have been tuned from the pre-trained model the resulting network model can have satisfactory performance on the target task.

In our case our CNN models we used are based on the established ResNet50 network pre-trained on the ImageNet data set19. The target task and our training data sets correspond to the images of the AP views of the hips (stem cup and combined).

Figure 2 demonstrates the overview of the framework of our deep learning-based method.

Dataset

Our dataset contained 714 images from 4 different kinds of implants.

Image preprocessing

We followed standard procedures to pre-process our training data so that it could work with a network trained on ImageNet. We rescaled each image to a size of 224*224 and normalized it according to ImageNet standards. We also performed data augmentation i.e. random rotation horizontal flips etc. to increase the amount of training data and make our algorithm robust to the orientation of the images.

Dataset partition

We first divided the set of patients into three groups of sizes ~ 60% (group 1) ~ 30% (group 2) and ~ 10% (group 3). This split technique was used on a per-design basis to ensure the ratio of each implant remained constant. Next we used the cup and stem images of patients in group 1 for training those of patients in group 2 for validation and those of patients in group 3 for testing. The validation set was used to compute cross-validation loss for hyper-parameter tuning and early stopping determination.

Model training

We adopted the adaptive gradient method ADAM20 to train our models. Based on the cross-validation loss we chose the hyper-parameters for ADAM as (learning rate \(\mathrm{\alpha }\) = 0.001 \({\upbeta }_{1}=0.9 {\beta }_{2}=0.99 \epsilon ={10}^{-8}\) weight_decay = 0). The maximum number of epochs was 1000 and the batch size was 16. The early stopping threshold was set to 8. During the training process of each network the early stopping threshold was hit after around 50 epochs. As we mentioned above we trained four networks in total.

The first network is trained with the stem images the second with the cup images. The third network is trained with the original uncut images which is one way we propose to combine the power of stem images and cup images. We further integrate the first and the second network as an alternative way of jointly utilizing stem and cup images. The integration was done via the following logistic-regression based method. We collected the outputs of the stem network and the cup network (both are of the form of a 4-dimensional vector with each element corresponding to the classification weight the network gives to the category of implants) and then fed them as the input to a two-layer feed-forward neural network and trained the network with the data from the validation set. The integration is similar to a weighted-voting procedure among the outputs of the stem network and the cup network with the weighting votes computed through the validation data set. Note that the above construction relied on our dataset division procedure where the training set validation set and testing set each contained the stem and cup images of the same set of patients. We referred to the resulting network constructed from the outputs of stem network and cup network as the “joint network”.

Model testing

We tested our models (stem cup Joint) using the testing set. The prediction result on each testing image was a 4-dimensional vector with each coordinate representing the classification confidence of the corresponding category of implants.

Statistical analysis

Since we were studying a multi-class classification problem we would directly present the confusion matrices of our methods on the testing data and compute the operation characteristics generalized for multi-class classification.
